                                     transfer of CS, and SDA signals. SCK only drive high / low only while accessing EEPROM
                                     otherwise it is tri-stated and internally pulled down.
CS            B5/PD/T        17      EEPROM Chip Select. CS is asserted high synchronously with respect to rising edge of SCK
                                     as chip select signal. CS drives high / low only while accessing EEPROM otherwise it is
                                     tri-stated and internally pulled down.
SDA           B5/PU/T        15      EEPROM Data. SDA is the serial output data to EEPROM’s data input pin and is
                                     synchronous with respect to the rising edge of SCK. SDA drives high / low only while
                                     accessing EEPROM otherwise it is tri-stated and internally pulled up.

Functional Overview
USB Core and Interfaces
The USB core is made up of USB 3.0 PHY and Device Controller. The USB 3.0 PHY processes USB Physical layer signals. The USB
3.0 Device Controller is interfaced with USB 3.0 PHY by PIPE/UTMI buses and it processes packets of link layer and protocol layer.
The USB 3.0 Device Controller supports Bulk IN, Bulk OUT and Interrupt IN transfers for data transactions.
Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)
GX3 supports IEEE 802.3az, also known as Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) at 10Mbps, 100Mbps and 1000Mbps. It also supports
EEE specified negotiation method to enable link partner to determine whether EEE is supported and to select the best set of
parameters common to both devices. It provides a protocol to coordinate transitions to/from a lower power consumption level (Low
Power Idle mode) based on link utilization. When no packets are being transmitted, the system goes to Low Power Idle mode to save
power. Once packets need to be transmitted, the system returns to normal mode, and starts transmitting packets without changing
the link status and without dropping/corrupting frames.
During the Low Power Idle mode, most of the circuits are disabled to save power. However, the transition time to/from Low Power
Idle mode is kept small enough to be transparent to the upper layer protocols and applications.
10/100/1000M Ethernet PHY
The 10/100/1000M Ethernet PHY is compliant with 10Base-T, 100Base-TX, and 1000Base-T IEEE 802.3 standards. It provides all
the necessary physical layer functions to transmit and receive Ethernet packets over CAT 5 UTP cable or CAT 3 UTP (10 Mbps only)
cable. It uses state-of-the-art DSP technology and an Analog Front End (AFE) to enable high-speed data transmission and reception
over UTP cable. Crossover Detection & Auto-Correction, polarity correction, adaptive equalization, cross-talk cancellation, echo
cancellation, timing recovery, and error correction functions are also implemented.
MAC Core
The MAC core supports IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.3u and IEEE 802.3ab MAC sub-layer functions, such as basic MAC frame receive and
transmit, CRC checking and generation, filtering, forwarding, flow-control in full-duplex mode, and collision-detection and handling in
half-duplex mode, etc. It supports virtual local area network (VLAN)-tagged frames according to IEEE 802.1Q specification in both
transmit and receive functions. The MAC core also implements CRC-32 checking at full-speed using a multi-stage, cyclic redundancy
code (CRC) calculation architecture with optional forwarding of the frame check sequence (FCS) field to the user application CRC-32
generation and append on transmit.
Checksum Offload Engine (COE)
The Checksum Offload Engine (COE) supports IPv4, IPv6, layer 4 (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMPv6 and IGMP) header processing functions
and real time checksum calculation in the hardware.
The COE supports the following features in layer 3:
■  IP header parsing, including IPv4 and IPv6
■  IPv6 routing header type 0 supported
■  IPv4 header checksum check and generation (There is no checksum field in IPv6 header)
■  Detecting on RX direction for IP packets with error header checksum
The COE supports the following features in layer 4:
■  TCP and UDP checksum check and generation for non-fragmented packet
■  TCP Large Send Offload V1
■  ICMP, ICMPv6 and IGMP message checksum check and generation for non-fragmented packet
Memory Arbiter
The memory arbiter block stores received MAC frames into on-chip SRAM (packet buffer) and then forward it to the USB bus upon
request from the USB host via Bulk IN transfer. It also monitors the packet buffer usage in full-duplex mode for triggering PAUSE
frame (or in half-duplex mode to activate Back pressure jam signal) transmission out on transmit (TX) direction. The memory arbiter
block is also responsible for storing MAC frames received from the USB host via Bulk OUT transfer and scheduling transmission out
towards Ethernet network.
USB to Ethernet Bridge
The USB to Ethernet bridge block converts Ethernet MAC frames into USB packets or vice-versa. This block supports burst transfer

SEEPROM Loader Interface
The SEEPROM loader interface is responsible for reading configuration data automatically from the external serial EEPROM after
power-on reset.
If the content of EEPROM offset 05h (low byte) is equal to (0xFF - SUM [EEPROM offset 03h ~ 04h]), the EEPROM is the first
candidate for SEEEPROM loader.
GPIOs and LED
There are 4 GPIO pins (GPIO[0/1/2/3]) and 4 multi-function pins group A (MFA[0/1/2/3]) provided by this chip. The MFA[0/1/2/3] pins
are also used for LED indication. Please refer to LED Mode (EEPROM: 42h) on page 16 for details.
PLL Clock Generator
GX3 includes an on-chip internal oscillator circuit for 25 MHz which allows the chip to operate cost effectively with just external 25 MHz
crystals.
The external 25 MHz crystal or oscillator, via pins XTALIN/XTALOUT, provides the reference clock to internal oscillator circuit to
generate clock for the embedded Ethernet PHY, embedded USB PHY, and base clock for the ASIC.
The external 25 MHz Crystal spec is listed in below table. For more details on crystal timing, please refer to Clock Timing on page 28
and CYUSB3610 demo board reference schematic.

Reset Generation
GX3 integrates an on-chip power-on-reset circuit, which simplifies the external reset circuitry on the board. The power-on-reset circuit
generates a reset pulse after 1.2 V core power ramps up to 0.72 V (typical threshold). The external reset pin, RESET#, can be directly
connected to the input of the power-on-reset circuit and can also be used as an additional hardware reset source. For more details
on RESET# timing, please refer to Reset Timing on page 28.

Default Wake-On-LAN (DWOL) Ready Mode
This Default WOL Ready Mode application is different from normal operation where GX3 Suspend/Resume state usually has to be
configured by software driver during normal system operation. This application applies to a system that uses a predefined remote
wakeup event to turn on the system power supply and its peripheral circuits without having any system software running in the
beginning. This is quite useful when a system has been powered down already and a user needs to power on the system remotely.
GX3 can be configured to support Default WOL Ready Mode, where no system driver is required to configure its WOL related settings
after power on reset. A system design usually partitions its power supply into two or more groups and the GX3 is supplied with an
independent power separated from the system processor. The power supply of GX3 is usually available as soon as power plug is
connected. The power supply of system processor remains off initially when power plug is connected and is controlled by GX3’s PME
pin, which can be activated whenever GX3 detects a pre-defined wakeup event such as valid Magic Packet reception or the WAKEUP#
pin trigger. To reduce power consumption, initially the USB host controller communicating with GX3 can also be unpowered as the
system processor.
The PME pin of GX3 can control the power management IC (PMIC) to power up the system processor along with the USB host
controller, which will perform USB transactions with GX3 after both have been initialized. The pin polarity of PME is configured as
high active when enabling Default WOL Ready Mode. Note that the GX3 must be in self-power (via setting EEPROM Flag [0]) mode
for this function.

                                                                                                      USB

To enable Default WOL Ready Mode, configure GPIO[0] pin as PME (via setting EEPROM Flag [12]) and have GPIO[1] pulled-up
with a 4.7K resistor. After power on reset, GX3 will disable most functions including USB transceiver (see Note 2) but enable Magic
Packet detector logic, internal Ethernet PHY and its auto-negotiation function to be ready to
receive Magic Packet. When a valid Magic Packet is received, GX3 will assert the PME pin to indicate to system processor the wakeup
event. The PME pin, when being configured as static level output signal (via setting EEPROM Flag [15], see Note 3), can be used to
control the power management IC to enable system power supply. After asserting the PME pin, GX3 will also exit from the Default
WOL Ready Mode and revert back to normal operation mode to start normal USB device detection, handshaking, and enumeration.
The PME pin, when being configured as static level output signal, maintains its signal level until RESET# is asserted again. If RESET#
to GX3 is asserted with GPIO[1] pulled-up, the Default WOL Ready Mode will be re-entered. Otherwise (GPIO[1] being pulled-down),
it will enter into normal operation mode and the normal USB device detection, handshaking and enumeration process should take
place right after RESET# negation.
 Notes
  1. For complete truth table of wakeup events supported, please refer to below on the “GPIO[1] = 1” setting.
  2. When the Default WOL Ready Mode is enabled, the DP/DM pins of GX3 will be in tri-state.
  3. Please refer to Flag (EEPROM: 05h) on page 15. The bit [15:12] of Flag (PME_IND, PME_TYP, PME_POL, PME_PIN) = 0111.
  4. It is recommended that VBUS pin be connected to system power group directly. This way the VBUS will become HIGH when power management IC enables the
     system power supply.

Detailed Description
The following sections provide detailed descriptions for some of the fields in memory maps of serial EEPROM.
Node ID (00~02h)
The Node ID 0 to 5 bytes represent the MAC address of the device, for example, if MAC address = 04-23-45-67-89-AB, then Node
ID 0 = 04h, Node ID 1 = 23h, Node ID 2 = 45h, Node ID 3 = 67h, Node ID 4 = 89h, and Node ID 5 = ABh.
Default values: Node ID {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} = 00-0E-C6-F9-D0-00.

Max. Power for Self/Bus Power (07h)
They are Max power values’ setting of powered device for EEPROM at offset 07h.
The default value of Bus Power is 3Eh.
For USB 3.0, the power value is 496 mA (Unit = 8 mA).
For USB 2.0, the power value is 248mA (Unit = 4 mA).
Self power setting follows conversion above.

EndPoint1 for SS/HS/FS (EEPROM:08h)
The time interval (named “bInterval”) for polling Interrupt IN endpoint 1 for data transfers of SuperSpeed/High-Speed/Full-Speed is
stored at EEPROM offset 08h. It is expressed in frames or microframes depending on the device operating speed (i.e. either
1 millisecond or 125 μs units).
The default “bInterval” value is 0Bh for Super-Speed/High-Speed (the polling time of endpoint 1 = 2(11-1) × 125 μs =128 ms) and is
80h for Full-Speed (the polling time of endpoint 1 = 128 × 1 ms = 128 ms).
Max. Burst for EP3/EP2 (EEPROM: 3Ch)
This value is bMaxBurst field in SS endpoint companion descriptor.
LED Mode (EEPROM: 42h)
LED Mode defines the indication setting for LED_0/1/2/3 function of MFA[0/1/2/3] pins.

External EEPROM Description
User can assign the specific VID/PID, Serial Number, Manufacture String, Product String, etc. user defined fields by external
EEPROM. Please refer to GX3 EEPROM User Guide document for more details about how to configure GX3 EEPROM content.
Note the EEPROM checksum field should be changed together with the VID/PID fields.
 Notes
  9. Remote Wakeup/PME Settings
      The offset 05h field of GX3 EEPROM is used to configure the Remote Wakeup and PME functions. Please refer to Serial EEPROM Memory Map on page 14 for the
      detailed description of EEPROM offset 05h.
      The RWU bit of GX3 EEPROM offset 05h is used to configure the “bmAttributes” field of Standard Configuration Descriptor that will be reported to the USB host
      controller when the GET_DESCRIPTOR command with CONFIGURATION type is issued. Please refer to “Section 9.6.3 Configuration” of Universal Serial Bus 3.0
      Spec for the detailed description of the “bmAttributes” field of Standard Configuration Descriptor.
      The power mode about Bus-powered or Self-powered is decided by the SELF_PWR pin when chip powers on. This will be updated to the “bmAttributes” field of
      Standard Configuration Descriptor.
  10. Max Power Setting
      The low byte of GX3 EEPROM offset 07h (for bus-powered) field and high byte of GX3 EEPROM offset 07h (for self-powered) field are used to configure the
      “bMaxPower” field of Standard Configuration Descriptor that will be reported to the USB host controller when the GET_DESCRIPTOR command with
      CONFIGURATION type is issued. Please refer to “Section 9.6.3 Configuration” of Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Spec for the detailed description of the “bMaxPower” field
      of Standard Configuration Descriptor. These fields are used to define the Maximum power consumption of the USB device drawn from the USB bus in this specific
      configuration when the device is fully operational.
  11. Product/Manufacturer/Serial Number String Settings
      The “Offset” fields of Product/Manufacturer/Serial Number String are fixed in GX3 EEPROM memory map. Please DO NOT change the recommended values of these
      fields.
      If you need to change the Product/Manufacturer/Serial Number strings on your GX3 EEPROM, please modify the “Length” fields of Product/Manufacturer/Serial
      Number String to meet the exact string length of your Product/Manufacturer/Serial Number strings.

Power-up Sequence
At power-up, the GX3 requires the A3V3/CVDDQ/VIO/E33VDDQ/E33VCC power supply to rise to nominal operating voltage within
Trise3 and the VCC12 (Note) power supply to rise to nominal operating voltage within Trise2.

Notes
 13. When the VCC12 power-up, the internal power-on-reset circuit will generate a few us (micro second) of hardware reset to chip and will start operation after the
     XTALIN/N 25 MHz clock signals are stable.
 14. The Tclk timing is depended on the 25 MHz crystal circuit. The 1 ms Tclk timing is reference timing based on the GX3 reference 25 MHz crystal circuit. Please refer
     to GX3 reference schematic for details.
