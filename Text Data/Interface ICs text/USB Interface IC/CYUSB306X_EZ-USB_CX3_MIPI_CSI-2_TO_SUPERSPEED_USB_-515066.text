CX3 has a 4-lane CSI-2 receiver with up to 1 Gbps on each lane.            2009.
It supports video data formats such as RAW8/10/12/14, YUV422
(CCIR/ITU 8/10-bit), RGB888/666/565, and user-defined 8-bit.               Application Examples
CX3 has integrated the USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 physical layers                 In a typical application (see Figure 1), CX3 acts as the main
(PHYs) along with a 32-bit ARM926EJ-S microprocessor for                   processor and connects to an image sensor, an audio device, or
powerful data processing and for building custom applications.             camera control devices amongst others.
CX3 contains 512 KB of on-chip SRAM (see Ordering
Information on page 27) for code and data. EZ-USB CX3 also
provides interfaces to connect to serial peripherals such as
UART, SPI, I2C, and I2S.

ReNumeration
Because of CX3’s soft configuration, one chip can take on the
identities of multiple distinct USB devices.
When first plugged into USB, CX3 enumerates automatically
with the Cypress Vendor ID (0x04B4) and downloads the
firmware and USB descriptors over the USB interface. The
downloaded firmware executes an electrical disconnect and
connect. CX3 enumerates again, this time as a device defined
by the downloaded information. This patented two-step process,
called ReNumeration, happens instantly when the device is
plugged in.

GPIOs
CX3 provides 12 pins for general purpose I/O (for example, can
be used for lighting, sync-in, sync-out and so on). See Pin
Configuration on page 14 for pinout details.
All GPIO pins support an external load of up to 16 pF for every
pin.

 1. Turning off VDDIO1 during Normal, Suspend, and Standby modes causes the CX3 to stop working.
■ Problem Definition
    Turning off the VDDIO1 during Normal, Suspend, and Standby modes will cause the CX3 to stop working.
■ Parameters Affected
    N/A
■ Trigger Conditions
    This condition is triggered when the VDDIO1 is turned off during Normal, Suspend, and Standby modes.
■ Scope Of Impact
    CX3 stops working.
■ Workaround
    VDDIO1 must stay on during Normal, Suspend, and Standby modes.
■ Fix Status
    No fix. Workaround is required.

2. USB enumeration failure in USB boot mode when CX3 is self-powered.
■ Problem Definition
   CX3 device may not enumerate in USB boot mode when it is self-powered. The bootloader is designed for bus power mode. It
   does not make use of the VUSB pin on the USB connector to detect the USB connection and expect that USB bus is connected
   to host if it is powered. If CX3 is not already connected to the USB host when it is powered, then it enters into low-power mode
   and does not wake up when connected to USB host.
■ Parameters Affected
   N/A
■ Trigger Conditions
   This condition is triggered when CX3 is self-powered in USB boot mode.
■ Scope of Impact
   Device does not enumerate
■ Workaround
   Reset the device after connecting to USB host.
■ Fix Status
   No fix. Workaround is required.
3. Extra ZLP is generated by the COMMIT action in the GPIF II state.
■ Problem Definition
   When COMMIT action is used in a GPIF-II state without IN_DATA action then an extra Zero Length Packet (ZLP) is committed
   along with the data packets.
■ Parameters Affected
   N/A
■ Trigger Conditions
   This condition is triggered when COMMIT action is used in a state without IN_DATA action.
■ Scope of Impact
   Extra ZLP is generated.
■ Workaround
   Use IN_DATA action along with COMMIT action in the same state.
■ Fix Status
   No fix. Workaround is required.
Document Number: 001-87516 Rev. *L                                                                                 Page 31 of 37


                                                                                                                 CYUSB306X
4. Invalid PID Sequence in USB 2.0 ISOC data transfer.
■ Problem Definition
   When the CX3 device is functioning as a high speed USB device with high bandwidth isochronous endpoints, the PID sequence
   of the ISO data packets is governed solely by the isomult setting. The length of the data packet is not considered while generating
   the PID sequence during each microframe. For example, even if a short packet is being sent on an endpoint with MULT set to 2;
   the PID used will be DATA2.
■ Parameters Affected
   N/A
■ Trigger Conditions
   This condition is triggered when high bandwidth ISOC transfer endpoints are used.
■ Scope of Impact
   ISOC data transfers failure.
■ Workaround
   This problem can be worked around by reconfiguring the endpoint with a lower isomult setting prior to sending short packets, and
   then switching back to the original value.
■ Fix Status
   No fix. Workaround is required.
5. USB data transfer errors are seen when ZLP is followed by data packet within same microframe.
■ Problem Definition
   Some data transfer errors may be seen if a Zero Length Packet is followed very quickly (within one microframe or 125 µs) by
   another data packet on a burst enabled USB IN endpoint operating at super speed.
■ Parameters Affected
   N/A
■ Trigger Conditions
   This condition is triggered in SuperSpeed transfer with ZLPs.
■ Scope of Impact
   Data failure and lower data speed.
■ Workaround
   The solution is to ensure that some time is allowed to elapse between a ZLP and the next data packet on burst enabled USB IN
   endpoints. If this cannot be ensured at the data source, the CyU3PDmaChannelSetSuspend() API can be used to suspend the
   corresponding USB DMA socket on seeing the EOP condition. The channel operation can then be resumed as soon as the suspend
   callback is received.
■ Fix Status
   No fix. Workaround is required.
Document Number: 001-87516 Rev. *L                                                                                  Page 32 of 37

6. Bus collision is seen when the I2C block is used as a master in the I2C Multi-master configuration.
■ Problem Definition
   When CX3 is used as a master in the I2C multi-master configuration, there can be occasional bus collisions.
■ Parameters Affected
   NA
■ Trigger Conditions
   This condition is triggered only when the CX3 I2C block operates in Multi-master configuration.
■ Scope of Impact
   The CX3 I2C block can transmit data when the I2C bus is not idle leading to bus collision.
■ Workaround
   Use CX3 as a single master.
■ Fix Status
   No fix.
