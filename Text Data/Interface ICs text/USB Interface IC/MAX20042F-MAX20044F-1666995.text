Note 2: Specifications with minimum and maximum limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and are guaranteed over the
         operating temperature range by design and characterization. Actual typical values may vary and are not guaranteed.
Note 3: Forward current is defined as current into BUS and out of HVBUS. See the Functional Diagram.
Note 4: Guaranteed by design. Limits are not production tested.
Note 5: Tested in the Typical Application Circuit, as shown on the MAX20044 evaluation kit.
