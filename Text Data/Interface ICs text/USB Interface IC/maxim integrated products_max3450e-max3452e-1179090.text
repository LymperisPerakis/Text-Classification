The MAX3450E/MAX3451E/MAX3452E USB-compliant                                      ♦ ±15kV ESD Protection on D+ and D-
transceivers interface low-voltage ASICs with USB
devices. The devices fully comply with USB 1.1 and                                ♦ Combined VP and VM Inputs/Outputs
USB 2.0 when operating at full (12Mbps) and low                                   ♦ +1.65V to +3.6V VL Logic Supply Input for
(1.5Mbps) speeds. The MAX3450E/MAX3451E/                                            Interfacing with Low-Voltage ASICs
MAX3452E operate with VL as low as +1.65V, ensuring
compatibility with low-voltage ASICs.                                             ♦ Enumerate Input Function (MAX3451E)
The MAX3450E/MAX3451E/MAX3452E feature a logic-                                   ♦ Powered from Li+ Battery as Low as +3.1V

protection protects the USB D+ and D- bidirectional                               ♦ VBUS Detection (MAX3452E)
bus connections. The MAX3450E is pin compatible with                              ♦ Pin Compatible with Micrel MIC2550A (MAX3450E)
Micrel’s MIC2550A. The MAX3451E features an internal
1.5kΩ USB pullup resistor and an enumeration function                             ♦ Internal D+ or D- Pullup Resistor (MAX3451E)
that allows devices to logically disconnect while                                 ♦ No Power-Supply Sequencing Required
plugged in. The MAX3452E provides a push-pull bus-
detect (BD) output that asserts high when V BUS is
greater than +4.0V.                                                                                                   Ordering Information
