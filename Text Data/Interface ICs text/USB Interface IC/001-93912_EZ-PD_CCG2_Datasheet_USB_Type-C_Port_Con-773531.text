USB Type-C Port Controller
General Description
EZ-PD™ CCG2 is a USB Type-C controller that complies with the latest USB Type-C and PD standards. EZ-PD CCG2 provides a
complete USB Type-C and U1SB Power Delivery port control solution for passive cables, active cables, and powered accessories. It
can also be used in many upstream and downstream facing port applications. EZ-PD CCG2 uses Cypress’s proprietary M0S8
technology with a 32-bit, 48-MHz Arm® Cortex®-M0 processor with 32-KB flash and integrates a complete Type-C Transceiver
including the Type-C termination resistors RP, RD and RA.

EZ-PD Configuration Utility
The EZ-PD Configuration Utility is a GUI-based Microsoft Windows application developed by Cypress to guide a CCGx user through
the process of configuring and programming the chip. The utility allows users to:
 1. Select and configure the parameters they want to modify
 2. Program the resulting configuration onto the target CCGx device.
The utility works with the Cypress supplied CCG1, CCG2, CCG3, and CCG4 kits, which host the CCGx controllers along with a USB
interface. This version of the EZ-PD Configuration Utility supports configuration and firmware update operations on CCGx controllers
implementing EMCA and Display Dongle applications. Support for other applications, such as Power Adapters and Notebook port
controllers, will be provided in later versions of the utility.

CCG2 can operate from three different power sources over the
range of 2.7 to 5.5 V and has three different power modes,
transitions between which are managed by the power system.
EZ-PD CCG2 provides Sleep and Deep Sleep low-power
modes.

Timer/Counter/PWM Block (TCPWM)
EZ-PD CCG2 has six TCPWM blocks. Each implements a 16-bit
timer, counter, pulse-width modulator (PWM), and quadrature
decoder functionality. The block can be used to measure the
period and pulse width of an input signal (timer), find the number
of times a particular event occurs (counter), generate PWM
signals, or decode quadrature signals.

In UFP, DFP, and DRP applications, CCG2 can be operated from
VDDD as the only supply input. In such applications, the VCONN
pins are left open. In DFP applications, the lowest VDDD level
that CCG2 can operate is 3.0 V due to the need to support
disconnect detection thresholds of up to 2.7 V.

Figure 11 shows a CCG2 device being used in a UFP application (tablet with a Type-C port) only as a power consumer.
The Type-C receptacle brings in HighSpeed and SuperSpeed lines, which are connected directly to the applications processor. The
VBUS line from the Type-C receptacle goes directly to the UFP (tablet) charger circuitry. The applications processor communicates
over the I2C signal with the CCG2 device, and the CC1 and CC2 lines from the Type-C receptacle are connected directly to the
respective CC1/2 pins of the CCG2 device.

Note
 1. Usage above the absolute maximum conditions listed in Table 1 may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to absolute maximum conditions for extended
    periods of time may affect device reliability. The maximum storage temperature is 150 °C in compliance with JEDEC Standard JESD22-A103, High Temperature
    Storage Life. When used below absolute maximum conditions but above normal operating conditions, the device may not operate to specification.

  3. It can take as much as 20 milliseconds to write to Flash. During this time the device should not be Reset, or Flash operations will be interrupted and cannot be relied
     on to have completed. Reset sources include the XRES pin, software resets, CPU lockup states and privilege violations, improper power supply levels, and watchdogs.
     Make certain that these are not inadvertently activated.

Notice regarding compliance with Universal Serial Bus specification. Cypress offers firmware and hardware solutions that are certified to comply with the Universal Serial Bus specification, USB
Type-C™ Cable and Connector Specification, and other specifications of USB Implementers Forum, Inc (USB-IF). You may use Cypress or third party software tools, including sample code, to modify
the firmware for Cypress USB products. Modification of such firmware could cause the firmware/hardware combination to no longer comply with the relevant USB-IF specification. You are solely
responsible ensuring the compliance of any modifications you make, and you must follow the compliance requirements of USB-IF before using any USB-IF trademarks or logos in connection with any
modifications you make. In addition, if Cypress modifies firmware based on your specifications, then you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any desired standard or specifications as if you
had made the modification. CYPRESS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN THE EVENT THAT YOU MODIFY OR HAVE MODIFIED A CERTIFIED CYPRESS PRODUCT AND SUCH MODIFIED PRODUCT
NO LONGER COMPLIES WITH THE RELEVANT USB-IF SPECIFICATIONS.
