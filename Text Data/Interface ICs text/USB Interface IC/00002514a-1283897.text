USB4715
2.0      INTRODUCTION
2.1      General Description
The Microchip USB4715 USB 2.0 Hi-Speed hub controller is a single-chip device targeted for automotive, industrial, and
commercial applications. Primary functions of the device include: multiple downstream USB ports supporting USB 2.0
Low Speed/Full Speed/Hi-Speed, single USB 2.0 Hi-Speed upstream connection to a USB host / OTG port, battery
charging support for BC1.2, Apple and China charging profiles, USB I/O bridging, and an on-chip microcontroller.
The USB4715 employs unique FlexConnect USB functionality, whereby one of the downstream ports can be reconfig-
ured to become an upstream port, allowing the host or master capability to be switched to equipment on any of the other
ports. This port/host becomes the master of the new USB bus, while the other ports can connect as USB devices, or
become dedicated charging ports.
The USB4715 is available in commercial (0°C to +70°C), industrial and Automotive Grade 3 (-40°C to +85°C) tempera-
ture ranges. An internal block diagram of the USB4715 is shown in Figure 2-1.

  Note 3-1       Configuration strap values are latched on Power-On Reset (POR) and the rising edge of RESET_N
                 (external chip reset). Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. Signals that
                 function as configuration straps must be augmented with an external resistor when connected to a
                 load. For additional information, refer to Section 3.3, "Configuration Straps and Programmable
                 Functions".
3.3       Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions
Configuration straps are multi-function pins that are used during Power-On Reset (POR) or external chip reset
(RESET_N) to determine the default configuration of a particular feature. The state of the signal is latched following de-
assertion of the reset. Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. This section details the various
device configuration straps and associated programmable pin functions.
  Note:     The system designer must guarantee that configuration straps meet the timing requirements specified in
            Section 9.6.2, "Power-On and Configuration Strap Timing" and Section 9.6.3, "Reset and Configuration
            Strap Timing". If configuration straps are not at the correct voltage level prior to being latched, the device
            may capture incorrect strap values.
3.3.1       PORT DISABLE CONFIGURATION (PRT_DIS_P[4:1] / PRT_DIS_M[4:1])
The PRT_DIS_P[4:1] / PRT_DIS_M[4:1] configuration straps are used in conjunction to disable the related port (4-1).

   Note:     Both PRT_DIS_Px and PRT_DIS_Mx (where x is the corresponding port) must be tied to 3.3 V to disable
             the associated downstream port.
3.3.2        NON-REMOVABLE PORT CONFIGURATION (CFG_NON_REM)
The CFG_NON_REM configuration strap is used to configure the non-removable port settings of the device to one of
five settings. These modes are selected by the configuration of an external resistor on the CFG_NON_REM pin. The
resistor options are a 200 kΩ pull-down, 200 kΩ pull-up, 10 kΩ pull-down, 10 kΩ pull-up, and 10 Ω pull-down, as shown
in Table 3-3.

5.0      MODES OF OPERATION
The device provides two main modes of operation: Standby Mode and Hub Mode. These modes are controlled via the
RESET_N pin, as shown in Table 5-1.
TABLE 5-1:         MODES OF OPERATION
  RESET_N Input                                                  Summary
         0            Standby Mode: This is the lowest power mode of the device. No functions are active
                      other than monitoring the RESET_N input. All port interfaces are high impedance and
                      the PLL is halted. Refer to Section 8.9, "Resets" for additional information on
                      RESET_N.
         1            Hub (Normal) Mode: The device operates as a configurable USB hub. This mode has
                      various sub-modes of operation, as detailed in Figure 5-1. Power consumption is based
                      on the number of active ports, their speed, and amount of data received.
The flowchart in Figure 5-1 details the modes of operation and details how the device traverses through the Hub Mode
stages (shown in bold). The remaining sub-sections provide more detail on each stage of operation.

5.1        Boot Sequence
5.1.1        STANDBY MODE
If the RESET_N pin is asserted, the hub will be in Standby Mode. This mode provides a very low power state for maxi-
mum power efficiency when no signaling is required. This is the lowest power state. In Standby Mode all downstream
ports are disabled, the USB data pins are held in a high-impedance state, all transactions immediately terminate (no
states saved), all internal registers return to their default state, the PLL is halted, and core logic is powered down in order
to minimize power consumption. Because core logic is powered off, no configuration settings are retained in this mode
and must be re-initialized after RESET_N is negated high.
5.1.2        SPI INITIALIZATION STAGE (SPI_INIT)
The first stage, the initialization stage, occurs on the deassertion of RESET_N. In this stage, the internal logic is reset,
the PLL locks if a valid clock is supplied, and the configuration registers are initialized to their default state. The internal
firmware then checks for an external SPI ROM. The firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid
signature of “2DFU” (device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the SPI
Firmware/external SPI ROM is enabled and the code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If
a valid signature is not found, then execution continues from internal ROM (CFG_ROM stage).
When using an external SPI ROM, a minimum of 2.2 Mbit is required, and 60 MHz or faster SPI ROM must be used.
Both 1- and 2-bit SPI ROM are supported. For optimum throughput, a 2-bit SPI ROM is recommended. Both mode 0
and mode 3 SPI flashes are supported.
If the system is not strapped for SPI Mode, code execution will continue from internal ROM (CFG_ROM stage).
5.1.3        CONFIGURATION FROM INTERNAL ROM STAGE (CFG_ROM)
In this stage, the internal firmware loads the default values from the internal ROM. Most of the hub configuration regis-
ters, USB descriptors, electrical settings, etc. will be initialized in this state even when running from SPI.
5.1.4        CONFIGURATION STRAP READ STAGE (CFG_STRAP)
In this stage, the firmware reads the following configuration straps to override the default values:
•   CONFIG_STRAP_[2:1]
•   PRT_DIS_P[4:1]
•   PRT_DIS_M[4:1]
•   CFG_NON_REM
•   CFG_BC_EN
If the CONFIG_STRAP_[2:1] pins are set to Configuration 5, the device will move to the SMBUS_CHECK stage, other-
wise it move to the CFG_OTP stage. Refer to Section 3.3, "Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions" for infor-
mation on usage of the various device configuration straps.
5.1.5        SMBUS CHECK STAGE (SMBUS_CHECK)
Based on the PROG_FUNC[8:1] configuration selected (refer to Section 3.3.4, "PROG_FUNC[8:1] Configuration (CON-
FIG_STRAP_[2:1])"), the firmware will check for the presence of external pull up resistors on the SMBus slave program-
mable function pins. If 10K pull-ups are detected on both pins, the device will be configured as an SMBus slave, and
the next state will be CFG_SOC. If a pull-up is not detected in either of the pins, the next state is CFG_OTP.
5.1.6        SOC CONFIGURATION STAGE (CFG_SOC)
In this stage, the SOC can modify any of the default configuration settings specified in the integrated ROM, such as USB
device descriptors, port electrical settings, and control features such as downstream battery charging.
In this stage the firmware will wait indefinitely for the SMBus/I2C configuration there is no time limit on this stage. The
external SMBus master writes to register 0xFF, to end the configuration in legacy mode. In non-legacy mode, the SMBus
command USB_ATTACH (opcode 0xAA55) or USB_ATTACH_WITH_SMBUS (opcode 0xAA56) will finish the configu-
ration.
5.1.7        OTP CONFIGURATION STAGE (CFG_OTP)
Once the SOC has indicated that it is done with configuration, all configuration data is combined in this stage. The
default data, the SOC configuration data, and the OTP data are all combined in the firmware and the device is pro-
grammed.

USB4715
   Note:      Changes to hub registers made in OTP memory space are not visible via SMBus during CFG_SOC stage.
             Any register which is modified via SMBus during SOC_CFG and also modified in the OTP memory will exit
             the configuration stages with the value as programmed in the OTP memory.
5.1.8        HUB CONNECT STAGE (USB_ATTACH)
Once the hub registers are updated through default values, SMBus master, and OTP, the device firmware will enable
attaching the USB host by setting the USB_ATTACH bit in the HUB_CMD_STAT register. The device will remain in the
Hub Connect stage indefinitely until the VBUS function is deasserted/assertion of external RESET_N pin.
5.1.9        NORMAL MODE (NORMAL_MODE)
Lastly, the hub enters Normal Mode of operation. In this stage full USB operation is supported under control of the USB
Host on the upstream port. The device will remain in the normal mode until the operating mode is changed by the USB
Host.
If RESET_N is asserted low, then Standby Mode is entered. The device may then be placed into any of the designated
hub stages. Asserting a soft disconnect on the upstream port will cause the hub to return to the Hub Connect stage until
the soft disconnect is negated.

            Microchip provides a comprehensive software programming tool, MPLAB Connect (formerly ProTouch2),
            for configuring the USB4715 functions, registers and OTP memory. All configuration is to be performed via
            the MPLAB Connect Configurator programming tool. For additional information on this tool, refer to th
            MPLAB Connect Configurator programming tool product page at http://www.microchip.com/design-cen-
            ters/usb/mplab-connect-configurator.
7.1       SPI/SQI Master Interface
The SPI/SQI controller has two basic modes of operation: execution of an external hub firmware image, or the USB to
SPI bridge. On power up, the firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid signature of 2DFU
(device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the external ROM mode is
enabled and the code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid signature is not found,
then execution continues from internal ROM and the SPI interface can be used as a USB to SPI bridge.
The second mode of operation is the USB to SPI bridge operation. Additional details on this feature can be found in
Section 8.5, "USB to SPI Bridging" as well as the AN2430 - USB to SPI Bridging with USB4715 and USB49xx application
note.

7.2        SMBus/I2C Master/Slave Interfaces
The USB4715 provides two independent SMBus/I2C controllers SMBus 1 and SMBus 2, which can be used to access
internal device run time registers or program the internal OTP memory. SMBus 1 is used as the USB to SMBus/I2C
bridge, and SMBus 2 is used as the slave interface. The device contains two 128 byte buffers to enable simultaneous
master/slave operation and to minimize firmware overhead in processed SMBus/I2C packets.
The SMBus 1 and SMBus 2 interfaces are assigned to programmable pins (PROG_FUNC_x) and therefore the device
must be programmed into specific configurations to enable both interfaces. SMBus 1 is available in all CON-
FIG_STRAP[1:2] settings. SMBus 2 is available only with specific CONFIG_STRAP[1:2] settings. Refer to Section
3.3.4, "PROG_FUNC[8:1] Configuration (CONFIG_STRAP_[2:1])" for additional information.
   Note:     For SMBus/I2C timing information, refer to Section 9.6.5, "SMBus Timing" and Section 9.6.6, "I2C Timing".
7.3        I2S Interface
The USB4715 provides an integrated I2S interface to facilitate the connection of digital audio devices. The I2S interface
conforms to the voltage, power, and timing characteristics/specifications as set forth in the I2S-Bus Specification, and
consists of the following signals:
•  I2S_SDIN: Serial Data Input
•  I2S_SDOUT: Serial Data Output
•  I2S_SCK: Serial Clock
•  I2S_LRCK: Left/Right Clock (SS/FSYNC)
•  I2S_MCLK: Master Clock
Each audio connection is half-duplex, so I2S_SDOUT exists only on the transmit side and I2S_SDIN exists only on the
receive side of the interface. Some codecs refer to the Serial Clock (I2S_SCK) as Baud/Bit Clock (BCLK). Also, the Left/
Right Clock is commonly referred to as LRC or LRCK. The I2S and other audio protocols refer to LRC as Word Select
(WS).
The following codec is supported by default:
• Analog Devices ADAU1961 (24-bit 96KHz)
   Note:     For I2S timing information, refer to Section 9.6.7, "I2S Timing".
7.3.1        MODES OF OPERATION
The USB audio class operates in three ways: Asynchronous, Synchronous and Adaptive. There are also multiple oper-
ating modes, such as hi-res, streaming, etc.. Typically for USB devices, inputs such as microphones are Asynchronous,
and output devices such as speakers are Adaptive. The hardware is set up to handle all three modes of operation. It is
recommended that the following configuration be used: Asynchronous IN; Adaptive OUT; 48Khz streaming mode; Two
channels: 16 bits per channel.
7.3.1.1        Asynchronous IN 48KHz Streaming
In this mode, the codec sampling clock is set to 48Khz based on the local oscillator. This clock is never changed. The
data from the codec is fed into the input FIFO. Since the sampling clock is asynchronous to the host clock, the amount
of data captured in every USB frame will vary. This issue is left for the host to handle. The input FIFO has two markers,
a low water mark (THRESHOLD_LOW_VAL), and a high water mark (THRESHOLD_HIGH_VAL). There are three reg-
isters to determine how much data to send back in each frame. If the amount of data in the FIFO exceeds the high water
mark, then HI_PKT_SIZE worth of data is sent. If the data is between the high and low water mark, the normal MID_P-
KT_SIZE amount of data is sent. If the data is below the low water mark, LO_PKT_SIZE worth of data is sent.

USB4715
7.3.1.2         Adaptive OUT 48KHz Streaming
In this mode, the codec sampling clock is initially set to 48Khz based on the local oscillator. The host data is fed into the
OUT FIFO. The host will send the same amount of data on every frame, i.e. 48KHz of data based on the host clock. The
codec sampling clock is asynchronous to the host clock. This will cause the amount of data in the OUT FIFO to vary. If
the amount of data in the FIFO exceeds the high water mark, then the sampling clock is increased. If the data is between
the high and low water mark, the sampling clock does not change. If the data is below the low water mark, the sampling
clock is decreased.
7.3.1.3         Synchronous Operation
For synchronous operation, the internal clock must be synchronized with the host SOF. The Frame SOF is nominally
1mS. Since there is significant jitter in the SOFs, there is circuitry provided to measure the SOFs over a long period of
time to get a more accurate reading. The calculated host frequency is used to calculate the codec sampling clock.
7.4         UART Interface
The device incorporates a configurable universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) that is functionally compat-
ible with the NS 16550AF, 16450, 16450 ACE registers and the 16C550A. The UART performs serial-to-parallel con-
version on received characters and parallel-to-serial conversion on transmit characters. Two sets of baud rates are
provided: 24 Mhz and 16 MHz. When the 24 Mhz source clock is selected, standard baud rates from 50 to 115.2 K are
available. When the source clock is 16 MHz, baud rates from 125 K to 1,000 K are available. The character options are
programmable for the transmission of data in word lengths of from five to eight, 1 start bit; 1, 1.5 or 2 stop bits; even,
odd, sticky or no parity; and prioritized interrupts. The UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that is capa-
ble of dividing the input clock or crystal by a number from 1 to 65535. The UART is also capable of supporting the MIDI
data rate.
7.4.1          TRANSMIT OPERATION
Transmission is initiated by writing the data to be sent to the TX Holding Register or TX FIFO (if enabled). The data is
then transferred to the TX Shift Register together with a start bit and parity and stop bits as determined by settings in
the Line Control Register. The bits to be transmitted are then shifted out of the TX Shift Register in the order Start bit,
Data bits (LSB first), Parity bit, Stop bit, using the output from the Baud Rate Generator (divided by 16) as the clock.
If enabled, a TX Holding Register Empty interrupt will be generated when the TX Holding Register or the TX FIFO (if
enabled) becomes empty.
When FIFOs are enabled (i.e. bit 0 of the FIFO Control Register is set), the UART can store up to 16 bytes of data for
transmission at a time. Transmission will continue until the TX FIFO is empty. The FIFO’s readiness to accept more data
is indicated by interrupt.
7.4.2          RECEIVE OPERATION
Data is sampled into the RX Shift Register using the Receive clock, divided by 16. The Receive clock is provided by the
Baud Rate Generator. A filter is used to remove spurious inputs that last for less than two periods of the Receive clock.
When the complete word has been clocked into the receiver, the data bits are transferred to the RX Buffer Register or
to the RX FIFO (if enabled) to be read by the CPU. (The first bit of the data to be received is placed in bit 0 of this reg-
ister.) The receiver also checks that the parity bit and stop bits are as specified by the Line Control Register.
If enabled, an RX Data Received interrupt will be generated when the data has been transferred to the RX Buffer Reg-
ister or, if FIFOs are enabled, when the RX Trigger Level has been reached. Interrupts can also be generated to signal
RX FIFO Character Timeout, incorrect parity, a missing stop bit (frame error) or other Line Status errors.
When FIFOs are enabled (i.e. bit 0 of the FIFO Control Register is set), the UART can store up to 16 bytes of received
data at a time. Depending on the selected RX Trigger Level, interrupt will go active to indicate that data is available when
the RX FIFO contains 1, 4, 8 or 14 bytes of data.

8.0         FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
This section details various USB4715 functions, including:
•   Downstream Battery Charging
•   FlexConnect
•   USB to GPIO Bridging
•   USB to SMBus/I2C Bridging
•   USB to SPI Bridging
•   USB to UART Bridging
•   Link Power Management (LPM)
•   Port Power Control
•   Resets
8.1         Downstream Battery Charging
The device can be configured by an OEM to have any of the downstream ports support battery charging. The hub’s role
in battery charging is to provide acknowledgment to a device’s query as to whether the hub system supports USB battery
charging. The hub silicon does not provide any current or power FETs or any additional circuitry to actually charge the
device. Those components must be provided externally by the OEM.

If the OEM provides an external supply capable of supplying current per the battery charging specification, the hub can
be configured to indicate the presence of such a supply from the device. This indication, via a handshake on the D+ and
D- at the start of the connection with the device, is on a per port basis. For example, the OEM can configure two ports
to support battery charging through high current power FETs and leave the other two ports as standard USB ports.
For detailed information on utilizing the USB4715 battery charging feature, refer to the application note “USB Battery
Charging with Microchip USB4715 and USB49xx Hubs”, which can be found on the Microchip USB4715 product page
at www.microchip.com/USB4715.
8.2         FlexConnect
The USB4715 allows any of the 4 FlexConnect capable USB ports to assume the role of USB host at any time during
hub operation. This host role exchange feature is called FlexConnect.
This functionality can be used in two primary ways:
1.    Host Swapping: This functionality can be achieved through a hub wherein a host and device can agree to swap
      the host/device relationship; The host becomes a device, and the device becomes a host.
2.    Host Sharing: A USB ecosystem can be shared between multiple hosts. Note that only 1 host may access to
      the USB tree at a time.
FlexConnect can be enabled through any of the following three methods:
• SMBus Control: An embedded SMBus master can control the state of the FlexConnect feature through basic
    write/read operations.
• USB Command: FlexConnect can be initiated via a special USB command directed to the hub’s internal Hub

8.7        Link Power Management (LPM)
The device supports the L0 (On), L1 (Sleep), and L2 (Suspend) link power management states. These supported LPM
states offer low transitional latencies in the tens of microseconds versus the much longer latencies of the traditional USB
suspend/resume in the tens of milliseconds. The supported LPM states are detailed in Table 8-1.

8.8        Port Power Control
Port power and over-current sense share the same pin (PRT_CTLx) for each port. These functions can be controlled
directly from the USB hub, or via the processor.
The device can be configured into the following port control modes:
• Ganged Mode
• Combined Mode
8.8.1         PORT CONNECTION IN GANGED MODE
In this mode, one pin (PRT_CTL_GANG) is used to control port power and over-current sensing.
8.8.2         PORT CONNECTION IN COMBINED MODE
8.8.2.1        Port Power Control using USB Power Switch
When operating in combined mode, the device will have one port power control and over-current sense pin for each
downstream port. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a '0'. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation,
the pull-up resistor will be disabled at that time. When port power is enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable
the pull-up resistor, making it an open drain output. If there is an over-current situation, the USB Power Switch will assert
the open drain OCS signal. The Schmidt trigger input will recognize that as a low. The open drain output does not inter-
fere. The over-current sense filter handles the transient conditions such as low voltage while the device is powering up.

8.8.2.2         Port Power Control using Poly Fuse
When using the device with a poly fuse, there is no need for an output power control. To maintain consistency, the same
circuit will be used. A single port power control and over-current sense for each downstream port is still used from the
Hub's perspective. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a '0'. This will have no effect as the external
diode will isolate pin from the load. When port power is enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable the pull-up
resistor. This means that the pull-up resistor is providing 3.3 volts to the anode of the diode. If there is an over-current
situation, the poly fuse will open. This will cause the cathode of the diode to go to 0 volts. The anode of the diode will
be at 0.7 volts, and the Schmidt trigger input will register this as a low resulting in an over-current detection. The open
drain output does not interfere.

Many customers use a single poly fuse to power all their devices. For the ganged situation, all power control pins must
be tied together.

8.9            Resets
The device includes the following chip-level reset sources:
• Power-On Reset (POR)
• External Chip Reset (RESET_N)
• USB Bus Reset
8.9.1             POWER-ON RESET (POR)
A power-on reset occurs whenever power is initially supplied to the device, or if power is removed and reapplied to the
device. A timer within the device will assert the internal reset per the specifications listed in Section 9.6.2, "Power-On
and Configuration Strap Timing," on page 34.
8.9.2             EXTERNAL CHIP RESET (RESET_N)
A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N, after all power supplies are within operating range, per the
specifications in Section 9.6.3, "Reset and Configuration Strap Timing," on page 35. While reset is asserted, the device
(and its associated external circuitry) enters Standby Mode and consumes minimal current.
Assertion of RESET_N causes the following:
1.       The PHY is disabled and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
2.       All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
3.       All internal registers return to the default state.
4.       The external crystal oscillator is halted.
5.       The PLL is halted.
   Note:          All power supplies must have reached the operating levels mandated in Section 9.2, "Operating Condi-
                  tions**," on page 31, prior to (or coincident with) the assertion of RESET_N.

8.9.3       USB BUS RESET
In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the device, the device performs the following:
1.   Sets default address to 0.
2.   Sets configuration to Unconfigured.
3.   Moves device from suspended to active (if suspended).
4.   Complies with the USB Specification for behavior after completion of a reset sequence.
The host then configures the device in accordance with the USB Specification.
   Note:    The device does not propagate the upstream USB reset to downstream devices.

  Note 9-1       When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the absolute
                 maximum ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage
                 spikes on their outputs when AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the
                 AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested to use a clamp
                 circuit.

9.6.2        POWER-ON AND CONFIGURATION STRAP TIMING
Figure 9-3 illustrates the configuration strap valid timing requirements in relation to power-on, for applications where
RESET_N is not used at power-on. In order for valid configuration strap values to be read at power-on, the following
timing requirements must be met. The operational levels (Vopp) for the external power supplies are detailed in Section
9.2, "Operating Conditions**," on page 31.

The device can accept either a 25MHz crystal or a 25MHz single-ended clock oscillator input. If the single-ended clock
oscillator method is implemented, XTALO should be left unconnected and XTALI/CLK_IN should be driven with a
nominal 0-3.3V clock signal. The input clock duty cycle is 40% minimum, 50% typical and 60% maximum.
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XTALI/XTALO). The following circuit design (Figure 9-6) and specifications (Table 9-9) are required to ensure proper
operation.

  Note 9-7      Frequency Deviation Over Time is also referred to as Aging.
  Note 9-8      0 °C for commercial version, -40 °C for industrial and Grade 3 Automotive.
  Note 9-9      +70 °C for commercial version, +85 °C for industrial and Grade 3 Automotive.
  Note 9-10     This number includes the pad, the bond wire and the lead frame. PCB capacitance is not included
                in this value. The XTALI/CLK_IN pin, XTALO pin and PCB capacitance values are required to
                accurately calculate the value of the two external load capacitors. These two external load capacitors
                determine the accuracy of the 25.000 MHz frequency.
9.7.2        EXTERNAL REFERENCE CLOCK (CLK_IN)
When using an external reference clock, the following input clock specifications are suggested:
• 25 MHz
• 50% duty cycle ±10%, ±100 ppm
• Jitter < 100 ps RMS

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
