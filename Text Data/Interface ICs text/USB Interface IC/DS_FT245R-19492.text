                                  9...14, 22, 23). In USB bus powered designs connect this pin to 3V3OUT
                                  pin to drive out at +3.3V levels, or connect to VCC to drive out at 5V
                                  CMOS level. This pin can also be supplied with an external +1.8V to

                                  +2.8V supply in order to drive outputs at lower levels. It should be noted
                                  that in this case this supply should originate from the same source as the
                                  supply to VCC. This means that in bus powered designs a regulator which
                                  is supplied by the +5V on the USB bus should be used.

                                  decoupled to ground using a 100nF capacitor. The main use of this pin is
                                  to provide the internal +3.3V supply to the USB transceiver cell and the

                                  this pin to power external logic if required. This pin can also be used to
                                  supply the VCCIO pin.

Notes:
    1. The minimum operating voltage VCC must be +4.0V (could use VBUS=+5V) when using the
       internal clock generator. Operation at +3.3V is possible using an external crystal oscillator.
    2. For details on how to use an external crystal, ceramic resonator, or oscillator with the FT245R,
       please refer Section 7.2
    3. When used in Input Mode, the input pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 200kΩ resistors. These
       pins can be programmed to gently pull low during USB suspend (PWREN# = “1”) by setting an
       option in the internal EEPROM.

                                                                                                Version 2.14

4 Function Description
The FT245R is a USB to parallel FIFO interface device which simplifies USB to FIFO designs and reduces
external component count by fully integrating an external EEPROM, USB termination resistors and an
integrated clock circuit which requires no external crystal, into the device. It has been designed to
operate efficiently with a USB host controller by using as little as possible of the total USB bandwidth
available.
4.1 Key Features
Functional Integration. Fully integrated EEPROM, USB termination resistors, clock generation, AVCC
filtering, power-on-reset (POR) and LDO regulator.
Asynchronous Bit Bang Mode. In asynchronous bit-bang mode, the eight FIFO lines can be switched
from the regular interface mode to an 8-bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the
device and they will be sequentially sent to the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer
(equivalent to the baud rate pre-scaler. This option will be described more fully in a separate application
note available from FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com).
Synchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT245R supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs from
asynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. This
makes it easier for the controlling program to measure the response to an output stimulus as the data
returned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R-01, available from FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
TDIChip-ID™. The FT245R also includes the new FTDIChip-ID™ security dongle feature. This FTDIChip-
ID™ feature allows a unique number to be burnt into each device during manufacture. This number
cannot be reprogrammed. This number is only readable over USB and forms a basis of a security dongle
which can be used to protect any customer application software being copied. This allows the possibility
of using the FT245R in a dongle for software licensing. Further to this, a renewable license scheme can be
implemented based on the FTDIChip-ID™ number when encrypted with other information. This encrypted
number can be stored in the user area of the FT245R internal EEPROM, and can be decrypted, then
compared with the protected FTDIChip-ID™ to verify that a license is valid. Web based applications can
be used to maintain product licensing this way. An application note, AN232R-02, available from FTDI
website (www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
High Output Drive Option. The parallel FIFO interface and the four FIFO handshake pins can be made
to drive out at three times the standard signal drive level thus allowing multiple devices to be driven, or
devices that require a greater signal drive strength to be interfaced to the FT245R. This option is
configured in the internal EEPROM.
Programmable FIFO RX Buffer Timeout. The FIFO RX buffer timeout is used to flush remaining data
from the receive buffer. This timeout defaults to 16ms, but is programmable over USB in 1ms increments
from 2ms to 255ms, thus allowing the device to be optimised for protocols that require fast response
times from short data packets.
Wake Up Function. If USB is in suspend mode, and remote wake up has been enabled in the internal
EEPROM (it is enabled by default), the RXF# pin becomes an input. Strobing this pin low for a minimum
of 20ms will cause the FT245R to request a resume from suspend on the USB bus. Normally this can be
used to wake up the host PC from suspend.
The FT245R is capable of operating at a voltage supply between +3.3V and +5V with a nominal
operational mode current of 15mA and a nominal USB suspend mode current of 70µA. This allows greater
margin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode current limit of 2.5mA. An integrated level
converter within the FIFO interface allows the FT245R to interface to FIFO logic running at +1.8V, 2.5V,
+3.3V or +5V.

4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within the FT245R. Please refer to the block
diagram shown in Figure 2.1.
Internal EEPROM. The internal EEPROM in the FT245R is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID
(PID), device serial number, product description string and various other USB configuration descriptors.
The FT245R is supplied with the internal EEPROM pre-programmed as described in Section 8. A user area
of the internal EEPROM is available to system designers to allow storing additional data. The internal
EEPROM descriptors can be programmed in circuit, over USB without any additional voltage requirement.
It can be programmed using the FTDI utility software called MPROG and FT_PROG, which can be
downloaded from FTDI Utilities on the FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com).
+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the
USB transceiver cell output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the
3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on
USBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells
rather than to power external logic. However, it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a
+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.
USB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full-speed physical interface
to the USB cable. The output drivers provide +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential
input receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single-Ended-0 (SE0) and USB
reset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates the internal USB series termination
resistors on the USB data lines and a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP.
USB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock
and data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.
Internal 12MHz Oscillator. The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This
provides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference
clock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and FIFO controller blocks.
Clock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal
Oscillator function and generates the 48MHz. The 48Mz clock reference is used by the USB DPLL and the
Baud Rate Generator blocks.
Serial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it
performs bit stuffing/un-stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also checks the CRC on the USB data
stream.
USB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control
endpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the
commands for controlling the functional parameters of the FIFO in accordance with the USB 2.0
specification Section 9.
FIFO RX Buffer (128 bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the FIFO via the USB data OUT
endpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer and is removed from the buffer by reading the contents
of the FIFO using the RD# pin. (Rx relative to the USB interface).
FIFO TX Buffer (256 bytes). Data written into the FIFO using the WR pin is stored in the FIFO TX
(transmit) Buffer. The USB host controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB
request for data from the device data IN endpoint. (Tx relative to the USB interface).
FIFO Controller with Programmable High Drive. The FIFO Controller handles the transfer of data
between the FIFO RX, the FIFO TX buffers and the external FIFO interface pins (D0 - D7).
Additionally, the FIFO signals have a configurable high drive strength capability which is configurable in
the EEPROM.
RESET Generator. The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT245R.
RESET# can be tied to VCC or left unconnected if not being used.

Figure 6.1 illustrates the FT245R in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows –
     i)          On plug-in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.
     ii)         In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA.
     iii)        A bus powered high power USB device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use the
                 PWREN# to keep the current below 100mA on plug-in and 2.5mA on USB suspend.
     iv)         A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB bus powered hub.
     v)          No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.
The power descriptors in the internal EEPROM of the FT245R should be programmed to match the current
drawn by the device.
A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT245R and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application. A suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from
Steward (www.steward.com), for example Steward Part # MI0805K400R-10.
Note: If using PWREN#, the pin should be pulled to VCCIO using a 10kΩ resistor.

6.2 Self Powered Configuration
                                  Figure 6.2 Self-Powered Configuration
Figure 6.2 illustrates the FT245R in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic
rules for USB self-powered devices are as follows –
     i)       A self-powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub
              controller is powered down.
     ii)      A self-powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB
              suspend as it has its own power supply.
     iii)     A self-powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-
              powered USB hub.
The power descriptor in the internal EEPROM of the FT245R should be programmed to a value of zero
(self-powered).
In order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus power (pin 1) is used to control the
RESET# pin of the FT245R device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ resistor on
USBDP is pulled up to +3.3V (generated using the 4K7 and 10k resistor network), thus identifying the
device as a full speed device to the USB host or hub. When the USB host or hub is powered off, RESET#
will be low and the FT245R is held in reset. Since RESET# is low, the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is not pulled
up to any power supply (hub or host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1.5kΩ
pull-up resistor. Failure to do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.
Figure 7.2 illustrates a self-powered design which has a +4V to +5.25V supply.
Note:
     1. When the FT232R is in reset, the UART interface I/O pins are tri-stated. Input pins have internal
          200kΩ pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external
          logic.
     2. When using internal FT232R oscillator the VCC supply voltage range must be +4.0V to 5.25V.
     3. When using external oscillator the VCC supply voltage range must be +3.3V to 5.25V
          Any design which interfaces to +3.3 V or +1.8V would be having a +3.3V or +1.8V supply to
          VCCIO.

                      Figure 6.3 Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration
A requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode the application draws a
total current of less than 2.5mA. This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the
ability to power itself down into a low current state by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic
that cannot power itself down in this way, the FT245R provides a simple but effective method of turning
off power during the USB suspend mode.
Figure 6.3 shows an example of using a discrete P-Channel MOSFET to control the power to external
logic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier (www.irf.com) IRLML6402, or equivalent. It
is recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used
to limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the
transient power surge, caused when the MOSFET switches on, will reset the FT245R or the USB host/hub
controller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 6.3 powers up with a slew rate of
approximaely12.5V/ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in
approximately 400 microseconds.
As an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used. A
suitable power switch IC for such an application is the Micrel (www.micrel.com) MIC2025-2BM or
equivalent.
With power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:
     i)   The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to
          automatically reset the logic when power is re-applied when moving out of suspend mode.
     ii) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the internal FT245R EEPROM.
     iii) The PWREN# pin should be used to switch the power to the external circuitry.
     iv) For USB high-power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up
          to 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in
          the Max Power field in the internal FT245R EEPROM. A high-power bus powered application uses
          the descriptor in the internal FT245R EEPROM to inform the system of its power requirements.
     v) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered
          down using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.

           Figure 6.4 USB Bus Powered with +3.3V or +5V External Logic Power Supply
Figure 6.4 illustrates a USB bus power application with selectable external logic supply. The external logic
can be selected between +3.3V and +5V using the jumper switch. This jumper is used to allow the
FT245R to be interfaced with a +3.3V or +5V logic devices. The VCCIO pin is either supplied with +5V
from the USB bus (jumper pins1 and 2 connected), or from the +3.3V output from the FT245R 3V3OUT
pin (jumper pins 2 and 3 connected). The supply to VCCIO is also used to supply external logic.
With bus powered applications, the following should be noted:
    i)       To comply with the 2.5mA current supply limit during USB suspend mode, PWREN# or
             SLEEP# signals should be used to power down external logic in this mode. If this is not
             possible, use the configuration shown in Section 8.
    ii)      The maximum current sourced from the USB bus during normal operation should not exceed
             100mA, otherwise a bus powered design with power switching (Section 6.3) should be used.
Another possible configuration could use a discrete low dropout (LDO) regulator which is supplied by the
5V on the USB bus to supply between +1.8V and +2.8V to the VCCIO pin and to the external logic. In
this case VCC would be supplied with the +5V from the USB bus and the VCCIO would be supplied from
the output of the LDO regulator. This results in the FT245R I/O pins driving out at between +1.8V and
+2.8V logic levels.
or a USB bus powered application, it is important to consider the following when selecting the regulator:
    i)       The regulator must be capable of sustaining its output voltage with an input voltage of
             +4.35V. An Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator should be selected.
    ii)      The quiescent current of the regulator must be low enough to meet the total current
             requirement of <= 2.5mA during USB suspend mode.
A suitable series of LDO regulators that meets these requirements is the MicroChip/Telcom
(www.microchip.com) TC55 series of devices. These devices can supply up to 250mA current and have a
quiescent current of under 1μA.

                                        Figure 7.1 USB to MCU FIFO Interface
A typical example of using the FT245R as a USB to Microcontroller (MCU) FIFO interface is illustrated in
Figure 7.1. This example uses two MCU I/O ports: one port (8 bits) to transfer data and the other port (4
or 5 bits) to monitor the TXE# and RXF# status bits and generate the RD# and WR strobes to the
FT245R, when required.
Using PWREN# for this function is optional.
If the Remote Wakeup option is enabled in the internal EEPROM, during USB suspend mode RXF#
becomes an input which can be used to wake up the USB host controller by strobing the pin low.

7.2 Using the External Oscillator
The FT245R defaults to operating using its own internal oscillator. This requires that the device is
powered with VCC (min)=+4.0V. This supply voltage can be taken from the USB VBUS. Applications
which require using an external oscillator, VCC= +3.3V must do so in the following order:
    1. When device powered for the very first time, it must have VCC > +4.0V. This supply is available
        from the USB VBUS supply = +5.0V.
    2. The EEPROM must then be programmed to enable external oscillator. This EEPROM modification
        cannot be done using the FTDI programming utility, MPROG and FT_PROG. The EEPROM can
        only be re-configured from a custom application. Please refer to the following applications note on
        how to do this:
        http://www.ftdichip.com/Documents/AppNotes/AN_100_Using_The_FT232_245R_With_External_
        Osc(FT_000067).pdf
    3. The FT245R can then be powered from VCC=+3.3V and an external oscillator. This can be done
        using a link to switch the VCC supply.
The FT245R will fail to operate when the internal oscillator has been disabled, but no external oscillator
has been connected.

8 Internal EEPROM Configuration
Following a power-on reset or a USB reset the FT245R will scan its internal EEPROM and read the USB
configuration descriptors stored there. The default factory programmed values of the internal EEPROM
