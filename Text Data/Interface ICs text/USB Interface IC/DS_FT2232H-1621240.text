1.1 Driver Support
The FT2232H requires USB drivers (listed below), available free from http://www.ftdichip.com, which are
used to make the FT2232H appear as a virtual COM port (VCP). This allows the user to communicate with
the USB interface via a standard PC serial emulation port (for example TTY). Another FTDI USB driver,
the D2XX driver, can also be used with application software to directly access the FT2232H through a
DLL.

1.3 USB Compliant
The FT2232H is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 specification and has been given the USB-IF Test-ID
(TID) 40720019.
The timing of the rise/fall time of the USB signals is not only dependant on the USB signal drivers, it is
also dependant system and is affected by factors such as PCB layout, external components and any
transient protection present on the USB signals. For USB compliance these may require a slight
adjustment. This timing can be modified through a programmable setting stored in the same external
EEPROM that is used for the USB descriptors. Timing can also be changed by adding appropriate passive
components to the USB signals.

3.1.2 Pin Descriptions
This section describes the operation of the FT2232H pins for 64-pin LQFP and 64-pin QFN. Both the LQFP
and the QFN packages have the same function on each pin. The function of many pins is determined by
the configuration of the FT2232H. The following table details the function of each pin dependent on the
configuration of the interface. Each of the functions is described in the following table (Note: The
convention used throughout this document for active low signals is the signal name followed by#). Pins
marked ** default to tri-stated inputs with an internal 75KΩ (approx.) pull up resistor to VCCIO.

                                           used to prevent forcing current down the USB lines when the

3.1.4.2 FT2232H pins used in an FT245 Style Synchronous FIFO Interface
The FT2232H only channel A can be configured as a FT245 style synchronous FIFO interface. When
configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in Table 3.6. To
enter this mode the external EEPROM must be set to make port A 245 mode. A software command (Set
Bit Mode option) is then sent by the application to the FTDI driver to tell the chip to enter single channel
synchronous FIFO mode. In this mode the ‘B’ channel is not available as all resources have been switched
onto channel A. In this mode, data is written or read on the rising edge of the CLKOUT.

                                            is data available in the FIFO which can be read by driving RD#
                                            low. When in synchronous mode, data is transferred on every

                                            clock that RXF# and RD# are both low. Note that the OE# pin
                                            must be driven low at least 1 clock period before asserting
                                            RD# low.
                                            When high, do not write data into the FIFO. When low, data
                                            can be written into the FIFO by driving WR# low. When in

                                            synchronous mode, data is transferred on every clock that
                                            TXE# and WR# are both low.
                                            Enables the current FIFO data byte to be driven onto D0...D7

                                            fetched from the receive FIFO buffer each CLKOUT cycle until
                                            RD# goes high.
                                            Enables the data byte on the D0...D7 pins to be written into

                                            data byte is written to the transmit FIFO buffer each CLKOUT

                                            allow for data buffer turn-around.
                                            The Send Immediate / WakeUp signal combines two functions
                                            on a single pin. If USB is in suspend mode (PWREN# = 1) and
                                            remote wakeup is enabled in the EEPROM, strobing this pin
                                            low will cause the device to request a resume on the USB Bus.
                                            Normally, this can be used to wake up the Host PC.
                                            During normal operation (PWREN# = 0), if this pin is strobed

                                            on the next Bulk-IN request from the drivers regardless of the
                                            pending packet size. This can be used to optimize USB
                                            transfer speed for some applications. Tie this pin to VCCIO if

3.1.4.4 FT2232H pins used in a Synchronous or Asynchronous Bit-Bang Interface
The FT2232H channel A or channel B can be configured as a synchronous or asynchronous bit-bang
interface. Bit-bang mode is a special FTDI FT2232H device mode that changes the 8 IO lines on either (or
both) channels into an 8 bit bi-directional data bus. There are two types of bit-bang modes: synchronous
and asynchronous.
When configured in any bit-bang mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in
Table 3.8.

3.1.4.5 FT2232H pins used in an MPSSE
The FT2232H channel A and channel B, each have a Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine (MPSSE).
Each MPSSE can be independently configured to a number of industry standard serial interface protocols
such as JTAG, I2C or SPI, or it can be used to implement a proprietary bus protocol. For example, it is
possible to use one of the FT2232H’s channels to connect to an SRAM configurable FPGA such as supplied
by Altera or Xilinx. The FPGA device would normally be un-configured (i.e. have no defined function) at
power-up. Application software on the PC could use the MPSSE to download configuration data to the
FPGA over USB. This data would define the hardware function on power up. The other FT2232H channel
would be available for another function. Alternatively each MPSSE can be used to control a number of
GPIO pins. When configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown
Table 3.9.

data transfer: Fast Serial Interface. (Not available on channel A). A proprietary FTDI protocol designed to
allow galvanic isolated devices to communicate synchronously with the FT2232H using just 4 signal wires
(over two dual opto-isolators), and two power lines. The peripheral circuitry controls the data transfer
rate in both directions, whilst maintaining full data integrity. Maximum USB full speed data rates can be
achieved. Both ‘A’ and ‘B’ channels can communicate over the same 4 wire interface if desired.
When configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in Table 3.10.

                                           connector. When this input goes high, then it indicates to the
                                           FT2232H that it is connected to a host PC. When the host or hub
                                           is powered down then the FT2232H is held in SUSPEND mode.

3.2.4.2 FT2232H-56Q pins used in an FT245 Style Synchronous FIFO Interface
The FT2232H-56Q only channel A can be configured as a FT245 style synchronous FIFO interface. When
configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in Table 3.18. To
enter this mode the external EEPROM must be set to make port A 245 mode. A software command (Set
Bit Mode option) is then sent by the application to the FTDI driver to tell the chip to enter single channel
synchronous FIFO mode. In this mode the ‘B’ channel is not available as all resources have been switched
onto channel A. In this mode, data is written or read on the rising edge of the CLKOUT.

                                            will cause the device to request a resume on the USB Bus.

3.2.4.5 FT2232H-56Q pins used in an MPSSE
The FT2232H-56Q channel A and channel B, each have a Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine
(MPSSE). Each MPSSE can be independently configured to a number of industry standard serial interface
protocols such as JTAG, I2C or SPI, or it can be used to implement a proprietary bus protocol. For
example, it is possible to use one of the FT2232H’s channels to connect to an SRAM configurable FPGA
such as supplied by Altera or Xilinx. The FPGA device would normally be un-configured (i.e. have no
defined function) at power-up. Application software on the PC could use the MPSSE to download
configuration data to the FPGA over USB. This data would define the hardware function on power up. The
other FT2232H channel would be available for another function. Alternatively each MPSSE can be used to
control a number of GPIO pins. When configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the
signals are shown Table 3.21

The FT2232H-56Q channel B can be configured for use with high-speed optical bi-directional isolated
serial data transfer: Fast Serial Interface. (Not available on channel A). A proprietary FTDI protocol
designed to allow galvanic isolated devices to communicate synchronously with the FT2232H-56Q using
just 4 signal wires (over two dual opto-isolators), and two power lines. The peripheral circuitry controls
the data transfer rate in both directions, whilst maintaining full data integrity. Maximum USB full speed
data rates can be achieved. Both ‘A’ and ‘B’ channels can communicate over the same 4 wire interface if
desired.
When configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in Table 3.22.

                                                                      Document No.: FT_000061  Clearance No.: FTDI#77
4    Function Description
The FT2232H USB 2.0 High Speed (480Mb/s) to UART/FIFO is one of FTDI’s 5th generation of ICs. It has
the capability of being configured in a variety of industry standard serial or parallel interfaces.
The FT2232H has two independent configurable interfaces. Each interface can be configured as UART,
FIFO, JTAG, SPI, I2C or bit-bang mode with independent baud rate generators. In addition to these, the
FT2232H supports a host bus emulation mode, a CPU-Style FIFO mode and a fast opto-isolated serial
interface mode.
4.1 Key Features
USB High Speed to Dual Interface. The FT2232H is a USB 2.0 High Speed (480Mbits/s) to dual
independent flexible and configurable parallel/serial interfaces.
Functional Integration. The FT2232H integrates a USB protocol engine which controls the physical
Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) and handles all aspects of the USB 2.0 High Speed
interface. The FT222H includes an integrated +1.8V Low Drop-Out (LDO) regulator and 12MHz to 480MHz
PLL. It also includes 4kbytes Tx and Rx data buffers per interface. The FT2232H effectively integrates the
entire USB protocol on a chip with no firmware required.
MPSSE.Multi-Purpose Synchronous Serial Engines (MPSSE), capable of speeds up to 30 Mbits/s, provides
flexible synchronous interface configurations.
Data Transfer rate. The FT2232H supports a data transfer rate up to 12 Mbaud when configured as an
RS232/RS422/RS485 UART interface or greater than 25 Mbytes/second over a synchronous parallel FIFO
interface. Please note the FT2232H does not support the baud rates of 7 Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10 Mbaud and
11 Mbaud.
Latency Timer. This is really a feature of the driver and is used to as a timeout to flush short packets of
data back to the PC. The default is 16ms, but it can be altered between 0ms and 255ms. At 0ms latency
you get a packet transfer on every high speed microframe.
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
Dual Multi-Purpose UART/FIFO Controllers. The FT2232H has two independent UART/FIFO
Controllers. These control the UART data, 245 fifo data, opto isolation (Fast Serial) or control the Bit-
Bang mode if selected by SETUP command. Each Multi-Purpose UART/FIFO Controller also contains an
MPSSE (Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine) which can be used independently of each other. Using
this MPSSE, the Multi-Purpose UART/FIFO Controller can be configured, under software command, to
have 1 MPSSE + 1 UART / 245 FIFO (each UART / 245 can be set to Bit Bang mode to gain extra I/O if
required) or 2 MPSSE.
USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control. The USB Protocol Engine controls and manages the interface
between the UTMI PHY and the FIFOs of the chip. It also handles power management and the USB
protocol specification.
Dual Port FIFO TX Buffer (4Kbytes per interface). Data from the Host PC is stored in these buffers
to be used by the Multi-purpose UART/FIFO controllers. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and
FIFO control block.
Dual Port FIFO RX Buffer (4Kbytes per interface). Data from the Multi-purpose UART/FIFO
controllers is stored in these blocks to be sent back to the Host PC when requested. This is controlled by
the USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control block.
RESET Generator – The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT2232H.
RESET# should be tied to VCCIO (+3.3v) if not being used.

                                                                                                     Version 2.6
                                                                      Document No.: FT_000061 Clearance No.: FTDI#77
Independent Baud Rate Generators – The Baud Rate Generators provides an x16 or an x10 clock
input to the UART’s from a 120MHz reference clock and consists of a 14 bit pre-scaler and 4 register bits
which provide fine tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction). This determines
the Baud Rate of the UART which is programmable from 183 baud to 12 million baud. The FT2232H does
not support the baud rates of 7 Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10 Mbaud and 11 Mbaud.
See FTDI application note AN232B-05 for more details.
+1.8V LDO Regulator. The +1.8V LDO regulator generates the +1.8 volts for the core and the USB
transceiver cell. Its input (VREGIN) must be connected to a +3.3V external power source. It is also
recommended to add an external filtering capacitor to the VREGIN. There is no direct connection from the
+1.8V output (VREGOUT) and the internal functions of the FT2232H. The PCB must be routed to connect
VREGOUT to the pins that require the +1.8V including VREGIN.
UTMI PHY. The Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) physical interface cell. This block
handles the Full speed / High Speed SERDES (serialise – deserialise) function for the USB TX/RX data. It
also provides the clocks for the rest of the chip. A 12 MHz crystal should be connected to the OSCI and
OSCO pins. A 12K Ohm resistor should be connected between REF and GND on the PCB.
 The UTMI PHY functions include:
        Supports 480 Mbit/s “High Speed” (HS)/ 12 Mbit/s “Full Speed” (FS), FS Only and “Low Speed”
          (LS)
        SYNC/EOP generation and checking
        Data and clock recovery from serial stream on the USB.
        Bit-stuffing/unstuffing; bit stuff error detection.
        Manages USB Resume, Wake Up and Suspend functions.
        Single parallel data clock output with on-chip PLL to generate higher speed serial data clocks.
EEPROM Interface. When used without an external EEPROM the FT2232H defaults to a USB to dual
asynchronous serial port device. Adding an external 93C46 (93C56 or 93C66) EEPROM allows each of the
chip’s channels to be independently configured as a serial UART (RS232 mode), parallel FIFO (245) mode
or fast serial (opto isolation). The external EEPROM can also be used to customise the USB VID, PID,
Serial Number, Product Description Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT2232H for OEM
applications. Other parameters controlled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down on
Power-Off and I/O pin drive strength.
The EEPROM should be a 16 bit wide configuration such as a Microchip 93LC46B or equivalent capable of
a 1Mbit/s clock rate at VCC = +3.00V to 3.6V. The EEPROM is programmable in-circuit over USB using a
utility program called FT_PROG. This allows a blank part to be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as
part of the manufacturing and test process.
If no EEPROM is connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT2232H will default to dual serial ports. The
device uses its built-in default VID (0403), PID (6010) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value.
In this case, the device will not have a serial number as part of the USB descriptor.

4.3 Dual Port FT232 UART Interface Mode Description
The FT2232H can be configured in similar UART modes as the FTDI FT232 devices. The following
examples illustrate how to configure the FT2232H with an RS232, RS422 or RS485 interface. The FT2232
can be configured as a mixture of these interfaces.
4.3.1 Dual Port RS232 Configuration
Figure 4.1 illustrates how the FT2232H can be configured with an RS232 UART interface. This can be
repeated for channel B to provide a dual RS232, but has been omitted for clarity.

4.3.2 Dual Port RS422 Configuration
Figure 4.2 illustrates how the FT2232H can be configured as a dual RS422 interface.
                                  Figure 4.2 Dual RS422 Configuration
In this case both channel A and channel B are configured as UART operating at TTL levels and a level
converter device (full duplex RS485 transceiver) is used to convert the TTL level signals from the
FT2232H to RS422 levels. The PWREN# signal is used to power down the level shifters such that they
operate in a low quiescent current when the USB interface is in suspend mode.

4.3.3 Dual Port RS485 Configuration
Figure 4.3 illustrates how the FT2232H can be configured as a dual RS485 interface.
                                  Figure 4.3 Dual RS485 Configuration
In this case both channel A and channel B are configured as RS485 operating at TTL levels and a level
converter device (half duplex RS485 transceiver) is used to convert the TTL level signals from the
FT232H to RS485 levels. It has separate enables on both the transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the
transmitter is only enabled when a character is being transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN pins on the
FT2232H are provided for exactly that purpose, and so the transmitter enables are wired to the TXDEN’s.
The receiver enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB
suspend mode.
RS485 is a multi-drop network – i.e. many devices can communicate with each other over a single two
wire cable connection. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. Links are
provided to allow the cable to be terminated if the device is physically positioned at either end of the
cable.

In this example the data transmitted by the FT2232H is also received by the device that is transmitting.
This is a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the transmitted data
from the received data stream. With the FT2232H it is possible to do this entirely in hardware – simply
modify the schematic so that RXD of the FT2232H is the logical OR of the level converter device receiver
output with TXDEN using an HC32 or similar logic gate.

4.4 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Interface Mode Description
When channel A is configured in an FT245 Synchronous FIFO interface mode the IO timing of the signals
used are shown in
Figure 4.4, which shows details for read and write accesses. The timings are shown in Table 4.1.
Note that only a read or a write cycle can be performed at any one time. Data is read or written on the
rising edge of the CLKOUT clock.

                     Table 4.1 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Interface Signal Timings
This single channel mode uses a synchronous interface to get high data transfer speeds. The chip drives a
60 MHz CLKOUT clock for the external system to use.
Note that Asynchronous FIFO mode must be selected on both channels before selecting the Synchronous
FIFO mode in software.
4.4.1 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Read Operation
A read operation is started when the chip drives RXF# low. The external system can then drive OE# low
to turn around the data bus drivers before acknowledging the data with the RD# signal going low. The
first data byte is on the bus after OE# is low. The external system can burst the data out of the chip by
keeping RD# low or it can insert wait states in the RD# signal. If there is more data to be read it will
change on the clock following RD# sampled low. Once all the data has been consumed, the chip will drive
RXF# high. Any data that appears on the data bus, after RXF# is high, is invalid and should be ignored.
4.4.2 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Write Operation
A write operation can be started when TXE# is low. WR# is brought low when the data is valid. A burst
operation can be done on every clock providing TXE# is still low. The external system must monitor TXE#
and its own WR# to check that data has been accepted. Both TXE# and WR# must be low for data to be
accepted.
4.5 FT245 Asynchronous FIFO Interface Mode Description
The FT2232H can be configured as a dual channel asynchronous FIFO interface. This mode is similar to
the synchronous FIFO interface with the exception that the data is written to or read from the FIFO on
the falling edge of the WR# or RD# signals.
This mode does not provide a CLKOUT signal and it does not expect an OE# input signal. The following
diagrams illustrate the asynchronous FIFO mode timing.

4.6 MPSSE Interface Mode Description
MPSSE Mode is designed to allow the FT2232H to interface efficiently with synchronous serial protocols
such as JTAG, I2C and SPI Bus. It can also be used to program SRAM based FPGA’s over USB. The
MPSSE interface is designed to be flexible so that it can be configured to allow any synchronous serial
protocol (industry standard or proprietary) to be implemented using the FT2232H. MPSSE is available on
channel A and channel B.
MPSSE is fully configurable, and is programmed by sending commands down the data stream. These can
be sent individually or more efficiently in packets. MPSSE is capable of a maximum sustained data rate of
30 Mbits/s.
When a channel is configured in MPSSE mode, the IO timing and signals used are shown in Figure 4.7
and Table 4.3 These show timings for CLKOUT=30MHz. CLKOUT can be divided internally to be provide a
slower clock.

MPSSE mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command. A hex value of 2 will enable it, and a
hex value of 0 will reset the device. See application note AN2232L-02, “Bit Mode Functions for the
FT2232D” for more details and examples.
The MPSSE command set is fully described in application note AN_108 – “Command Processor for MPSSE

4.6.1 MPSSE Adaptive Clocking
Adaptive clocking is a new MPSSE feature added to the FT2232H MPSSE engine.
The mode is effectively handshaking the CLK signal with a return clock RTCK. This is a technique used by
ARM processors.
The FT2232H will assert the CLK line and wait for the RTCK to be returned from the target device to
GPIOL3 line before changing the TDO (data out line).

4.7 MCU Host Bus Emulation Mode
MCU host bus emulation mode uses both of the FT2232H’s A and B channel interfaces to make the chip
emulate a standard 8048/8051 MCU host bus. This allows peripheral devices for these MCU families to be
directly connected to USB via the FT2232H.
The lower 8 bits (AD7 to AD0) is a multiplexed Address / Data bus. A15 to A8 provide upper (extended)
addresses. There are 4 basic operations:-
1) Read (does not change A15 to A8)
2) Read Extended (changes A15 to A8)
3) Write (does not change A15 to A8)
4) Write Extended (changes A15 to A8)

MCU Host Bus Emulation mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command. A hex value of 8 will
enable it, and a hex value of 0 will reset the device. The FT2232H operates in the same way as the
FT2232D. See application note AN2232-02, “Bit Mode Functions for the FT2232D” for more details and
examples.
The MCU Host Bus Emulation Mode command set is fully described in application note AN_108 –
“Command Processor for MPSSE and MCU Host Bus Emulation Modes”.
When MCU Host Bus Emulation mode is enabled the IO signal lines on both channels work together and
the pins are configured as described in Table 3.12. The following sections give some details of the read
and write cycle waveforms and timings. The CLKOUT output clock can operate up to 60MHz.
In Host Bus Emulation mode the clock divisor has no effect. The clock divisor is used for serial data and is
a different part of the MPSSE block. In host bus emulation the 60MHz clock is always output and doesn’t
change with any commands.

 When Div By 5 is on the device will return 2 bytes when doing a read. When it is off the device will return 1
 byte when doing a read. The clock period is 16.67 nS so most devices would need the Div By 5 to be set on.
 IORDY can be held low permanently to extend all cycles.

4.8 Fast Opto-Isolated Serial Interface Mode Description
Fast Opto-Isolated Serial Interface Mode provides a method of communicating with an external device
over USB using 4 wires that can have opto-isolators in their path, thus providing galvanic isolation
between systems. If either channel A or channel B is enabled in Fast Opto-Isolated Serial mode then the
pins on channel B are switched to the fast serial interface configuration. The I/O interface for fast serial
mode is always on channel B, even if both channels are being used in this mode. An address bit is used
to determine the source or destination channel of the data. It therefore makes sense to always use at
least channel B or both for fast serial mode, but not A own its own.
Fast serial mode is enabled by setting the appropriate bits in the external EEPROM. The fast serial mode
can be held in reset by setting a bit value of 10 using the Set Bit Bang Mode command. While this bit is
set the device is held reset – data can be sent to the device, but it will not be sent out by the device until
the device is enabled again. This is done by sending a bit value of 0 using the set bit mode command.
See application note AN2232L-02, “Bit Mode Functions for the FT2232D for more details and examples.
When either Channel B or both Channel A and B are configured in Fast Opto-Isolated Serial Interface
mode the IO timing of the signals used are shown in
Figure 4.13 and the timings are shown in Table 4.6

4.8.1 Outgoing Fast Serial Data
To send fast serial data out of the FT2232H, the external device must drive the FSCLK clock. If the
FT2232H has data ready to send, it will drive FSDO output low to indicate the start bit. It will not do this
if it is currently receiving data from the external device. This is illustrated in Figure 4.14.

                              Figure 4.14 Fast Opto-Isolated Serial Interface Output Data
Notes:
      1. The first bit output (Start bit) is always 0.
      2. FSDO is always sent LSB first.
      3. The last serial bit output is the source bit (SRCE). It indicates which channel the data has come
          from. A ‘0’ means that it has come from Channel A, a ‘1’ means that it has come from Channel B.
      4. If the target device is unable to accept the data when it detects the START bit, it should stop the
          FSCLK until it can accept the data.
4.8.2 Incoming Fast Serial Data
An external device is allowed to send data into the FT2232H if FSCTS is high. On receipt of a zero START
bit on FSDI, the FT2232H will drop FSCTS on the next positive clock edge. The data from bits 0 to 7 are
then clocked in (LSB first). The last bit (DEST) determines where the data will be written to. The data can
be sent to either channel A or to channel B. If DEST= ‘0’, the data is sent to channel A, (assuming
channel A is enabled for fast serial mode, otherwise the data is sent to channel B). If DEST= ‘1’ the data
is sent to channel B, (assuming channel B is enabled for fast serial mode, otherwise the data will go to
channel A. (Either channel A, channel B or both channels must be enabled as fast serial mode or the
function is disabled). This is illustrated in Figure 4.15.

    3. The last received serial bit is the destination bit (DEST).It indicates which channel the data should
         go to. A ‘0’ means that it should go to channel A, a ‘1’ means that it should go to channel B.
    4. The target device should ensure that CTS is high before it sends data. CTS goes low after data bit
         0 (D0) and stays low until the chip can accept more data.
4.8.3 Fast Opto-Isolated Serial Data Interface Example
The following example, Figure 4.16 , shows two Agilent HCPL-2430 (see the semiconductor section at
www.agilent.com) high speed opto-couplers used to optically isolate an external device which
interfaced to USB using the FT2232H. In this example VCC5V is the USB VBUS supply and VCCE is the
supply to the external device.
Care must be taken with the voltage used to power the photo-LED’s. It must be the same voltage as that
the FT2232H I/Os are driving to, or the LED’s may be permanently on. Limiting resistors should be fitted
in the lines that drive the diodes. The outputs of the opto-couplers are open-collector and require a pull-
up resistor.

4.9 CPU-Style FIFO Interface Mode Description
CPU-style FIFO interface mode is designed to allow a CPU to interface to USB via the FT2232H. This mode
is enabled in the external EEPROM. The interface is achieved using a chip select bit (CS#) and address bit
(A0). When either Channel A or Channel B are in CPU-style Interface mode the IO signal lines are
configured as given in Table 3.11.
This mode uses a combination of CS# and A0 to determine the operation to be carried out. The following
truth-table, Table 4.7, gives the decode values for particular operations.

4.10 Synchrnous                and Asynchronous Bit-Bang Interface Mode
        Description
The FT2232H channel A or channel B can be configured as a bit-bang interface. There are two types of
bit-bang modes: synchronous and asynchronous.
Asynchronous Bit-Bang Mode
Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode is the same as BM-style Bit-Bang mode, except that the internal RD# and
WR# strobes (RDSTB# and WRSTB#) are now brought out of the device to allow external logic to be
clocked by accesses to the bit-bang IO bus.
On either or both channels any data written to the device in the normal manner will be self clocked onto
the data pins (those which have been configured as outputs). Each pin can be independently set as an
input or an output. The rate that the data is clocked out at is controlled by the baud rate generator.
For the data to change there has to be new data written, and the baud rate clock has to tick. If no new
data is written to the channel, the pins will hold the last value written.
Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode
The synchronous Bit-Bang mode will only update the output parallel port pins whenever data is sent from
the USB interface to the parallel interface. When this is done, the WRSTB# will activate to indicate that
the data has been read from the USB Rx FIFO buffer and written out on the pins. Data can only be
received from the parallel pins (to the USB Tx FIFO interface) when the parallel interface has been
written to.
With Synchronous Bit-Bang mode data will only be sent out by the FT2232H if there is space in the
FT2232H USB TXFIFO for data to be read from the parallel interface pins. This Synchronous Bit-Bang
mode will read the data bus parallel I/O pins first, before it transmits data from the USB RxFIFO. It is
therefore 1 byte behind the output, and so to read the inputs for the byte that you have just sent,
another byte must be sent.

For example :-
(1) Pins start at 0xFF
Send 0x55,0xAA
Pins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA
Data read = 0xFF,0x55
(2) Pins start at 0xFF
Send 0x55,0xAA,0xAA
(repeat the last byte sent)
Pins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA
Data read = 0xFF,0x55,0xAA
Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode differs from Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode in that the device parallel output
is only read when the parallel output is written to by the USB interface. This makes it easier for the
controlling program to measure the response to a USB output stimulus as the data returned to the USB
interface is synchronous to the output data.
Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command. A hex value of 1 will
enable Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode.
Synchronous Bit-Bang mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command. A hex value of 4 will
enable Synchronous Bit-Bang mode.
See application note AN2232-02, “Bit Mode Functions for the FT2232 for more details and examples of
using the bit-bang modes.

The WRSTB# goes active in t4. The WRSTB# goes active when data is read from the USB RXFIFO (i.e.
sent from the PC). The RDSTB# goes inactive when data is sampled from the pins and written to the USB
TXFIFO (i.e. sent to the PC). The SETUP command to the FT2232H is used to setup the bit-mode. This
command also contains a byte wide data mask to set the direction of each bit. The direction on each pin
doesn’t change unless a new SETUP command is used to modify the direction.
The WRSTB# and RDSTB# strobes is only a guide to what may be happening depending on the direction
of the bus. For example if all pins are configured as inputs, it is still necessary to write to these pins in
order to get the FT2232H to read those pins even though the data written will never appear on the pins.

4.11 RS232 UART Mode LED Interface Description
When configured in UART mode the FT2232H has two IO pins on each channel dedicated to controlling
LED status indicators, one for transmitted data the other for received data. When data is being
transmitted / received the respective pins drive from tri-state to low in order to provide indication on the
LED’s of data transfer. A digital one-shot timer is used so that even a small percentage of data transfer is
visible to the end user.
                                                                                VCCIO

In Figure 4.22, the transmit and receive LED indicators are wire-OR’ed together to give a single LED
indicator which indicates any transmit or receive data activity.
Note that the LED’s are connected to the same supply as VCCIO.
4.12 Send Immediate / Wake Up (SIWU#)
The SIWU# function is available in the FIFO modes and in bit bang mode.
The Send Immediate portion is used to flush data from the chip back to the PC. This can be used to get
short packets of data back to the PC without waiting for the latency timer to expire.
This mechanism should only be used when you have stopped sending data to the chip to avoid overrun.
The data transfer is flagged to the USB host by the falling edge of the signal.

     1. When using remote wake-up, ensure the resistors are pulled-up in suspend. Also ensure
          peripheral designs do not allow any current sink paths that may partially power the peripheral.
     2. If remote wake-up is enabled, a peripheral is allowed to draw up to 2.5mA in suspend. If remote
          wake-up is disabled, the peripheral must draw no more than 500uA in suspend.
     3. If a Pull-down is enabled, the FT2232H will not wake up from suspend.
 4.13 FT2232H Mode Selection
 The 2 channels of the FT2232H reset to 2 asynchronous serial interfaces.
 Following a reset the required mode of each channel is determined by the contents of the EEPROM
 (programmed using FT_PROG).
 The EEPROM contents determine if the 2 channels have been configured as FT232 asynchronous serial
 interface, FT245 FIFO interface, CPU-style FIFO interface or Fast Serial Interface.
 Following a reset, the EEPROM is read to determine which mode is configured. After device enumeration,
 an FT_SetBitMode command (refer to D2XX_Programmers_Guide) can be sent to the USB driver to
 switch the selected interface into the required mode – asynchronous bit-bang, synchronous bit-bang or
 MPSSE.
 When in FT245 FIFO mode, the FT_SetBitMode command can be used to select either Synchronous
 FIFO (FT_SetBitMode = 0x40) or Asynchronous FIFO mode. (Note that Asynchronous FIFO mode must
 be selected on both channels before selecting the Synchronous FIFO mode. This means that an EEPROM
 is needed to initially configure Asynchronous FIFO mode before software configures the Synchronous
 FIFO mode).
 When Synchronous FIFO mode selected, channel A uses all the memory resources of channel B. As such
 channel B is then not available. In this case the state of the channel B pins is determined when the
 configuration is switched to Asynchronous FIFO mode. If channel B had not been used for any data
 transfer before configuration of Asynchronous FIFO mode, then the channel B pins will remain in their
 default mode (D7:0=tri-stated but pulled high trough 75K resistor, TXE# =low, RXF# =high. RD# and
 WR# are inputs and should be pulled high). An MPSSE command, set_data_bits can be used to
 configure the channel B pins as inputs before configuring channel A as Synchronous FIFO. This avoids the
 channel B pins driving against any interfaces (such as SPI) which may have been configured previous to
 any switching of channel A to Synchronous FIFO mode. Refer to AN1121C-01 MPSSE Cmnd for the
 set_data_bits command and further information on the MPSSE used in MCU Host BUS Emulation mode.
 The    MPSSE     can    be   configured     directly    using    the D2XX    commands.        Refer     to    the
 D2XX_Programmers_Guide. The application note gives further explanation and examples for the
 MPSSE.

Figure 6.1 illustrates the FT2232H in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. In this application, the FT2232H requires that the VBUS (USB
+5V) is regulated down to +3.3V (using an LDO) to supply the VCCIO, VPLL, VPHY and VREGIN.
VREGIN is the +3.3V input to the on chip +1.8V regulator. The output of the on chip LDO regulator
(+1.8V) drives the FT2232H core supply (VCORE). This requires a minimum of a 3.3uF filter capacitor.

Figure 6.32 illustrates the FT2232H in a typical USB bus powered configuration similar to Figure 6.1. The
difference here is that the +1.8V for the FT2232H core (VCORE) has been regulated from the VBUS as
well as the +3.3V supply to the VPLL, VPHY, VCCIO and VREGIN.

Figure 6.3 illustrates the FT2232H in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply and does not draw current from the USB bus. In this example
an external power supply is used. This external supply is regulated to +3.3V.
Note that in this set-up, the EEPROM should be configured for self-powered operation and the option
“suspend on DBUS7 low” selected in FT_PROG. Also this configuration uses the pin BCBUS7, so this
assumes that MPSSE mode is not selected.

Figure 6.4 illustrates the FT2232H in a typical USB self-powered configuration similar to Figure 6.3. The
difference here is that the +1.8V for the FT2232H core has been regulated from the external power
supply.
Note that in this set-up, the EEPROM should be configured for self-powered operation and the option
“suspend on DBUS7 low” selected in FT_PROG. Also this configuration uses the pin BCBUS7, so this
assumes that MPSSE mode is not selected.

Figure 6.5 illustrates how to connect the FT2232H with a 12MHz ± 0.003% crystal. In this case loading
capacitors should to be added between OSCI, OSCO and GND as shown. A value of 27pF is shown as the
capacitor in the example – this will be good for many crystals but it is recommended to select the loading
capacitor value based on the manufacturer’s recommendations wherever possible. It is recommended to
use a parallel cut type crystal.
It is also possible to use a 12 MHz Oscillator with the FT2232H. In this case the output of the oscillator
would drive OSCI, and OSCO should be left unconnected. The oscillator must have a CMOS output drive
capability.

7    EEPROM Configuration
If an external EEPROM is fitted (93LC46/56/66) it can be programmed over USB using FT_PROG. The
EEPROM must be 16 bits wide and capable or working at a VCC supply of +3.0 to +3.6 volts.
Adding an external EEPROM allows the chip to be configured as FT232 asynchronous serial interface,
FT245 FIFO interface, CPU-style FIFO interface or Fast Serial Interface.
                                       Figure 7.1 EEPROM Interface
The external EEPROM can also be used to customise the USB VID, PID, Serial Number, Product
Description Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT2232H for OEM applications. Other parameters
controlled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down on Power-Off and I/O pin drive
strength.
If the FT2232H is used without an external EEPROM the chip defaults to a USB to FT232 asynchronous
serial interface port device. If no EEPROM is connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT2232H uses its
built-in default VID (0403), PID (6010) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value. In this case, the
device will not have a serial number as part of the USB descriptor.

7.1 Default EEPROM Configuration
The external EEPROM (if it’s fitted) can be programmed over USB using FT_PROG. This allows a blank
part to be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as part of the manufacturing and test process. Users
who do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their design
can apply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs.
See TN_100 USB Vendor ID/Product ID Guidelines for more information.
