4 Function Description
The FT312D is FTDI’s second dedicated Android Open Accessory Mode integrated circuit device or Android
Host. The FT312D USB host port is dedicated to support of the Android Open Accessory class and will
bridge data between this port and the UART interface.
4.1 Key Features
Easy to use Android Open Accessory IC translating the Device port of the Android device into UART
capabilities.
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs describe each function within FT312D. Please refer to the block diagram shown
in Figure 2.1.
4.2.1         UART Interface Module
The FT312DUART module controls the UART interface providing basic RXD, TXD signalling with
RTS#/CTS# hardware flow control. An additional TX_Active signal is supplied to control external RS485
transceivers for users wishing to create a USB to RS485 bridge. The UART supports baud rates from 300
baud to 921600 baud. A full description of the UART module is provided in Section 5.
4.2.2         Buffers
The FT312D provides internal buffering between the USB port and the UART port of the IC for smooth
data streaming.
The Android device can send NAK’s to the USB OUT token sent from the FT312D. This can happen when
the UART application on the Android is running in the background or multiple applications are launched in
the Android device. When the UART application on the Android device is not accepting data, the data will
be buffered in the UART RX buffer in FT312D. The UART RX buffer size is 5512 bytes.
The UART_TX buffer which stores data from the USB port, heading for the UART is 256 bytes.
4.2.3         USB Host
The USB Host block handles the parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel conversion of the USB physical
layer. This includes bit stuffing, CRC generation.
4.2.4         USB Transceivers
USB transceiver cells provide the physical USB device interface supporting USB 1.1 and USB 2.0
standards. Low-speed and full-speed USB data rates are supported. The output driver provides 3V3 level
slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential receiver and two single ended receivers provide USB
DATA IN, SE0 and USB Reset condition detection. These cells also include integrated internal pull-down
resistors as required for host mode.
4.3 Default Descriptor Strings
When the USB port is connected to the Android USB port, the Android platform will determine which
application to load based on the strings read from the FT312D. These strings are configurable with a
Windows utility: FT312D_Cofiguration available for download from the FTDI website. Please refer to the
application note AN_236 User Guide for FT312D Configuration to change the default string values.
Default values for the strings are set in the device as per Table 4.1.

5 UART Interface
The interface implements a standard asynchronous serial UART port with flow control, for example
RS232/422/485. The UART can support baud rates from 300 to 921600 with RTS/CTS flow control. The
UART can support baud rates from 300 to 115200 with no flow control.
Data transfer uses NRZ (Non-Return to Zero) data format consisting of 1 start bit, 7 or 8 data bits, an
optional parity bit, and one or two stop bits. When transmitting the data bits, the least significant bit is
transmitted first. Transmit and receive waveforms are illustrated in Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2.
                                  Figure 5-1 UART Receive Waveform
                                 Figure 5-2 UART Transmit Waveform
Baud rate (default =9600 baud), flow control settings (default = None), number of data bits (default=8),
parity (default is no parity) and number of stop bits (default=1) are all configurable from the Android
application. Please refer to FT31xD Android Programmers Guide for further details.
TX_ACTIVE is transmit enable, this output may be used in RS485 designs to enable the line driver for
transmit mode.
UART RX buffer size is 5512 bytes and UART TX buffer size is 256 bytes.
Note: UART software flow control with XON/XOFF is not supported
        UART hardware flow control with DTR/DSR is not supported
Note:
The FT312D has to enumerate the Android device before receiving data from the UART device.
This can be implemented by disconnecting the UART TXD signal of external UART device connected to the
FT312D RXD signal until after the FT312D has established the USB link with Android device.
The connection sequence should be:
1. Connect FT312D to Android and complete enumeration.
2. Connect the TXD of UART device to FT312D’s RXD then start to receive data.
There are two methods to implement this function:
1. When FT312D connects to the Android device and enumeration is completed, the
    USB_ERROR# will become Logic 0 (default Logic 1). This signal can be used to control the
    TTL gate (74LVC2G241, 74LVC1G125 or others) ON/OFF such that the TXD/RXD lines are
    connected/disconnected.

If the UART device has an enable pin(active high enable) such as on the GPS module, the USB_ERROR#
can also be used. The USB_ERROR# pin may be inverted with an NPN BJT then connected to the enable
pin of the GPS module.

6 USB Error Detection
Pin 32 of the device is provided to indicate a problem has occurred with the USB connection. The errors
are USB device not supported, USB hub not supported and USB device not responding. USB device not
supported would occur if the USB port was connected to a non-Android class device port. E.g. The
FT312D is not designed to host memory sticks or printers etc. USB hub not supported would be reported
if FT312D is connected to a USB hub. USB device not responding would occur if the USB device connected
to the FT312D host port did not respond and the enumeration failed. The signal states are as follows:
Pin state                                             Definition
Logic 0                                               Device connected to USB and functional

                                                      repeats every second.
Two 50ms logic 0 pulses                               Device not supported. These pulses occur at plug-
                                                      in and then the signal returns to logic 1. This then
                                                      repeats every second.
Three 50ms logic 0 pulses                             Hub not supported. These pulses occur at plug-in
                                                      and then the signal returns to logic 1. This then
                                                      repeats every second.

The UART signals are at 3V3 level and may be used to drive directly into a FPGA or MCU with a 3V3
interface, or could be level shifted with an RS232, RS422 or RS485 transceiver. The TX_ACTIVE signal is
used mostly with RS485 transceivers to enable the Transmit line drivers.
The unused pins may be left unterminated.

An example of using the FT312D as a USB to RS232 converter is illustrated in Figure 8.2. In this
application, a TTL to RS232 Level Converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT312D to
convert the TTL levels of the FT312D to RS232 levels. This level shift can be done using line drivers from
a variety of vendors e.g. Zywyn.
A suitable level shifting device is the Zywyn ZT3243F which is capable of RS232 communication at up to
1000k baud.

9 Package Parameters
FT312D is available in RoHS Compliant packages, QFN package (32QFN) and an LQFP package (32LQFP).
The packages are lead (Pb) free and use a ‘green’ compound. The package is fully compliant with
European Union directive 2002/95/EC.
The mechanical drawings of the packages are shown in Sections 9.2 - all dimensions are in millimetres.
The solder reflow profile for all packages can be viewed in Section 9.3.
9.1 FT312D Package Markings
9.1.1        QFN-32
An example of the markings on the QFN package are shown in Figure 9-1. The FTDI part number is too
long for the 32 QFN package so in this case the last two digits are wrapped down onto the date code line.
