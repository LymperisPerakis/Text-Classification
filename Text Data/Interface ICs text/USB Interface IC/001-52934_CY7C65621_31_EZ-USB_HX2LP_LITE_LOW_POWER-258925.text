Default Descriptors
This section presents the different descriptors that are available. There is a table for each that lists the functionality of each descriptor.
Device Descriptor
The standard device descriptor for CY7C65621/31 is based on the information found in the SPI EEPROM. The information in the
EEPROM overrides the default descriptor values. If no EEPROM is used, the CY7C65621/31 enumerates with the default descriptor
values as shown in the table. If a blank EEPROM is connected, the hub enumerates as vendor defined class instead of a hub class.
This is for the purpose of programming the EEPROM with the Cypress driver.

This request results in length bytes of data being read from the external memory device, and returned to the host. Data is read
beginning with address 0. This request fails if there is no external memory device present. This request is only valid if the hub is in
the Configured state; the request fails otherwise.

This request results in length bytes of data being written to the external memory device. Data is written beginning with address 0.
This request fails if there is no external memory device present. This request is only valid if the hub is in the Configured state or if
the external memory device write protect byte is set; the request fails otherwise.
