                   Rev. 1 — 2 August 2016                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              PTN5100D is a single port USB Type-C Power Delivery (PD) PHY and Protocol IC that
              provides Type-C Configuration channel interface and USB PD Physical and Protocol layer
              functions to a System PD Port Policy Controller (Policy Engine and Device Policy
              Manager, Alternate mode controller). It complies with USB PD[1] and Type-C[2]
              specifications. PTN5100D is architected to deliver robust performance, compliant
              behavior, configurability and system implementation flexibility that are essential to tide
              over interoperability and compliance hurdles in the platform applications.
              PTN5100D can support system realization of the following PD roles: (i) Consumer only
              (ii) Consumer/Provider. Further, it is register programmed to operate in Type-C specific
              Upstream Facing Port (UFP). It can work along with the PD policy controller to operate in
              other modes (DFP, DRP).
              PTN5100D operates from platform power supply VDD, or it can also be powered from
              USB power VBUS directly. The host interface operates on VIO supply to facilitate
              interfacing to systems that use IO supply rail different from VDD supply rail.
              It provides SPI/I2C interface for system host control/status update. The interface choice is
              pre-configured in NXP factory.
              PTN5100D is available in a small footprint package option: HVQFN20 4 mm x 4 mm,
              0.5 mm pitch.

                                   Note: HVQFN20 package ground is connected to exposed center pad. The exposed center pad
                                   must be connected to platform supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal,
                                   electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using
                                   a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board,
                                   thermal vias need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

                                                                                             USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
7. Functional description
                          PTN5100D is a 1-port USB Type-C PD Physical and Protocol Layer IC that can be used to
                          realize single or multi-port USB Type-C PD and/or Alternate mode implementations. It
                          complies with USB PD [1] and Type-C specifications [2]. PTN5100D is required to be
                          initialized after power-on by the PD policy controller MCU before the dedicated pin
                          CC_ORIENT behaves as specified in this data sheet specification.
                          PTN5100D can be partitioned into the following major functional blocks along with their
                          respective interfaces:
                            •   Type-C Configuration Channel functional block
                            •   USB Power Delivery function
                            •   Power FET Enable Control
                            •   MCU interface and Control
                          The following subsections describe the PTN5100D with its major functional blocks.
                     7.1 Type-C Configuration Channel functional block
                          Type-C Configuration Channel (CC) function operates as a front end to cable/plug
                          interface. This block implements Orientation detection, Cable/Plug insertion and removal
                          detection as per [2].
                          PTN5100D can operate under MCU control. To support use cases, PTN5100D
                          implements HW circuitry to perform the following operations:
                            •   Applying 'Rp' or 'Rd' depending on the (NVM) configured role
                            •   Detecting cable/plug connect and disconnect events
                            •   Indicating Type-C current limit level in a system under DFP role
                            •   Detecting the current level supported by remote end under UFP role
                            •   Identifying plug orientation and indicating through CC_ORIENT1 pin
                            •   Updating event, interrupt and status registers and raising interrupt signal using INT_N
                                pin
                          In order to provide reliable connect/disconnect event triggers, debouncing is also
                          implemented as per [2].
                          PTN5100D allows for register programmability to enable usage under different platform
                          configurations.
                     7.2 USB Power Delivery Function
                          In general, the Embedded Controller (EC) or System Management Controller (SMC)
                          handles the overall Application/Platform power management given the system states,
                          battery status, etc. It reviews capabilities and status of various power providers (USB PD,

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                      PTN5100D
                                                                                  USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                   AC-DC adapter, battery, docking, etc.) dynamically and determines a specific source for
                   powering/charging the platform - the power source selection is an important and platform
                   dependent aspect of Application power delivery scheme.
                     • For example, in some applications, platform host processor plays a central role in
                        controlling the various power sources including USB PD. To support this, PTN5100D
                        and Policy controller MCU can be configured to negotiate and agree on power
                        contract based on command/response exchanges with host processor
                     • In several applications, host processor may not even exist or it wants to play a
                        hands-off role. To support these applications, PTN5100D and Policy controller MCU
                        can be configured to operate autonomously
                   In a Type-C PD implementation, the system partitioning involves the following parts:
                     • Port PHY and Protocol layer functions  PTN5100D
                     • Port policy engine and device policy management, Alternate mode support 
                        Discrete policy controller MCU
                     • System management  host processor
                   PTN5100D implements USB PD PHY layer and HW intensive Protocol functions and it
                   works along with a discrete MCU to implement Full PD functionality. The combined 2-chip
                   system solution (PTN5100D and MCU) can be configured to support one or more of the
                   following PD roles:
                    1. PD Consumer
                    2. PD Consumer/Provider
                   The interface between PTN5100D and Policy controller MCU can be either SPI or I2C.
                   PTN5100D provides a transparent set of commands and register interface for the MCU to
                   control the operation and ensure safe/suitable system behavior/response. PTN5100D
                   Application Programming guide [3] describes the register set supported for the PD control,
                   status updates and operational control/sequences.
                   The policy controller MCU implements PD port policy layer as per [1]. The default PD
                   power profiles are configured in the MCU and the host processor could request for
                   specific profile and PD contract based on platform application. The 2-chip solution can
                   operate autonomously or under host processor control.

                       PTN5100D implements USB PD PHY layer function as follows:
                         •  Slew rate controlled IO
                         •  Bit transmission and data recovery
                         •  Bi-phase Mark Coding
                         •  4B5B Line coding
                         •  CRC computation and checking
                       It handles the following Protocol layer functions:
                         •  Data Packetization and Extraction
                         •  Good CRC Response
                         •  Automated Retries
                         •  Hard reset, Cable reset
                         •  Tx and Rx buffer management
                       It handles both Transmit and Receive operation and it maintains dedicated TX and RX
                       data buffers. To minimize chances of collision, PTN5100D checks the CC line before start
                       of transmission. Once the data is transmitted or received, the I2C interface status is
                       updated and MCU is interrupted.
                       BIST mode (Tx, Rx) is also supported.

                   7.3 Power FET control
                       PTN5100D implements three dedicated open drain IOs that can be used to control the
                       external power MOSFETs and enable/ disable VBUS source and sink power paths of the
                       system. These are enabled or disabled based on PD power role (provider or consumer) of
                       the Type-C interface. Based on PD negotiation and contract, the policy controller MCU
                       enables/disables the specific power path (source FET or sink FETs).
                         • EN_USBSRC: This pin is used to enable/disable the power MOSFETs that
                            corresponds to VBUS source (e.g. 5V regulated output). The FET enable can be
                            configured and controlled through the register interface by the MCU. The pin status is
                            monitored and updated in a status register.
                         • EN_USBFET1: This pin is used to enable/disable the power MOSFETs that
                            corresponds to USB PD power from external power sources or delivering VBUS
                            power to external peripherals. Its specific use as a VBUS source or sink path control

                              is programmable. The FET enable can be configured and controlled through the
                              register interface by the MCU. The pin status is monitored and updated in a status
                              register.
                           • EN_USBFET2: This pin is used to enable/disable the power MOSFETs that
                              corresponds to USB PD power from external power sources or delivering VBUS
                              power to external peripherals. It specific use as a VBUS source or sink path control is
                              programmable. The FET enable can be configured and controlled through the register
                              interface by the MCU. The pin status is monitored and updated in a status register.
                   7.4 MCU interface and control
                         PTN5100D works along with policy controller MCU to realize USB PD functionality and/or
                         Alternate mode support. The MCU can control and interface with PTN5100D through a
                         dedicated I2C/SPI interface. In a given system implementation, only one of the two
                         interfaces (I2C, SPI) can be used.
                         PTN5100D provides up to three I2C slave address combinations based on ternary pin
                         (SLV_ADDR) setting as per the table below.

                 7.4.1 I2C-bus interface
                         PTN5100D has a slave I2C interface through which it provides a mechanism for control
                         and status interaction/communication with the MCU. It supports Standard mode, Fast
                         mode and Fast mode plus.
               7.4.1.1   I2C writes
                         The following figure shows the basic protocol for I2C writes. A 16-bit offset is used to
                         address each register.

               7.4.1.2   I2C reads
                         The following figure shows the basic protocol for I2C reads. They start off like I2C writes
                         by specifying a 16-bit register offset. This is followed by a repeat start condition, the Slave
                         Address (Read), and the read data.
              SLAVE      R/W            REG                            REG                                  SLAVE        R/W

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         PTN5100D
                                                                                      USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
               7.4.1.3 I2C address auto-incrementing
                       Bursts are allowed during writes and reads. Bit 15 of the register offset is the
                       auto-increment indication. If ‘0’ then the internally generated MMIO address will not
                       increment with each data byte. If ‘1’, then the address will increment with each data byte.
                       A detailed description of the I2C-bus specification, with applications, is given in user
                       manual UM10204, “I2C-bus specification and user manual” [4]. Referring to I2C protocol,
                       PTN5100D positively acknowledges all 256 register offset addresses, though there are
                       certain undefined address offsets.
                7.4.2 SPI interface
                       PTN5100D provides an SPI slave interface as well. It supports SPI modes 1 and 2. This
                       interface exposes same register interface as that of I2C. Its main advantage is faster
                       command and data transport and relaxes MCU response time/latency requirements.
                7.4.3 Register interface
                       PTN5100D Application programming guide [3] describes the various registers with their
                       bit definitions, POR values and the various functions. Also, sample 'C' programs
                       corresponding to various functions and operations are given. This guide can be used by
                       the platform system architects to implement the EC firmware to control the operations with
                       PTN5100D. Refer to programming guide for more information. The register definitions are
                       also described in the guide.
                7.4.4 Relevant Interface pins - SLV_ADDR, SPI_CLK_I2C_SCL,
                       SPI_MOSI_I2C_SDA, SPI_CS, SPI_MISO, INT_N
                         • SLV_ADDR is a ternary input pin that is used to support up to 3 slave PTN5100D
                            devices on a given platform. This pin can be pulled to V_MCUPWR rail, left open or
                            pulled to GND.
                         • While in SPI mode, SPI_CLK_I2C_SCL, SPI_MISO, SPI_MOSI_I2C_SDA and
                            SPI_CS provide the necessary interface for connecting to SPI master controller on
                            the MCU.
                         • While in I2C mode, SPI_CLK_I2C_SCL and SPI_MOSI_I2C_SDA are used for I2C
                            clock and data interfacing to MCU
                         • INT_N pin is used to raise Active LOW level triggered interrupt signal to EC.
                            PTN5100D processes various events and raises interrupt that require SMC
                            intervention. Once all relevant events are processed by the MCU, the INT_N pin goes
                            HIGH. At POR, this pin remains HIGH (when VIO is valid). The specific events that
                            can generate the interrupt can be selected.
                   7.5 Power supplies
                       PTN5100D is designed to operate under various power supplies. It can operate under
                       both normal battery and dead battery environments (while drawing power from VBUS).
                       PTN5100D handles power supply transitions (VBUS, VDD) transparently and there is no
                       specific power supply ramp requirement imposed on the system (between VDD and VIO
                       rails) also.
                       The following table highlights the power supplies and operating conditions for PTN5100D.

                8.1.1.1      Application description
                             In this illustration, PTN5100D is inside Type-C cable adapter operating in UFP role. Some
                             example use cases are Type-C to DP adapter, Type-C to VGA adapter, Type-C to
                             Thunderbolt adapter etc. PTN5100D serves as PD PHY layer device for a Cable adapter
                             management MCU or dedicated PD MCU wherein PD policy management, Alternate
                             mode and VDM support are handled. The USB Billboard device is implemented as part of
                             adapter management MCU.
                             The cable adapter implementation operates on VCONN and/or VBUS supply. Discrete
                             depletion mode FET has to be used in the application for 'Ra' indication.
                             TVS protection diode (e.g. PESD5V0S1USF, PESD5V0S1UL, etc.) shall be used to
                             protect the CC1/2 pins from overshoot/undershoot during cable plug/unplug and cable
                             discharge events.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                      This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                      of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                      soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                         • Through-hole components
                         • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board

                                                                                    USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 17) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 18 and 19

                   Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                   soldering, see Figure 17.
