1.0       OVERVIEW
1.1       Introduction
The USB2642 offers a USB 2.0 compliant, versatile, cost-effective and energy-efficient hi-speed hub controller with 2
downstream USB ports and an SD/MMC flash media card interface. The dedicated flash media reader is internally
attached to a 3rd downstream port of the hub as a USB compound device. This combo solution supports today’s popular
multi-format flash media card formats. The flash media interface can support sustained transfer rates exceeding 35 MB/
s if the media and host support those rates.
The USB2642 also provides I2C over USB. The I2C bridge allows for control of any I2C device operating at 50kHz clock.
The USB2642 will attach to an upstream port as either a full-speed or full-/hi-speed hub. The hub supports low-speed,
full-speed, and hi-speed (if operating as a full-/hi-speed hub) downstream devices on all of the enabled downstream
ports.
All required resistors on the USB ports are integrated into the hub. This includes all series termination resistors on D+
and D- pins and all required pull-down and pull-up resistors. The over-current sense inputs for the downstream facing
ports have internal pull-up resistors.
The USB2642 includes programmable features such as:
PortMap which provides flexible port mapping and disable sequences. The downstream ports of a USB2642 hub can
be reordered or disabled in any sequence to support multiple platform designs with minimum effort. For any port that is
disabled, the USB2642 automatically reorders the remaining ports to
match the USB host controller’s port numbering scheme.
PortSwap which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair
pin locations. PortSwap allows direct alignment of USB signals (D+/D-)
to connectors avoiding uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differ-
ential signals on the PCB.
PHYBoost which enables four programmable levels of USB signal drive
strength in downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore
USB signal integrity. The diagram on the right shows an example of Hi-
Speed USB eye diagrams before (PHYBoost at 0%) and after (PHYBoost
at 12%) signal integrity restoration in a compromised system environ-
ment.

5.0       PIN DESCRIPTIONS
This section provides a detailed description of each signal. The signals are arranged in functional groups according to
their associated interface. The pin descriptions below are applied when using the internal default firmware and can be
referenced in Section 7.0, Configuration Options. The acronyms used in this chapter can be referenced in Appendix A:
"Acronyms".
An N at the end of a signal name indicates that the active (asserted) state occurs when the signal is at a low voltage
level. When the N is not present, the signal is asserted when it is at a high voltage level. The terms assertion and nega-
tion are used exclusively in order to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of active low and active high signals.
The term assert, or assertion, indicates that a signal is active, independent of whether that level is represented by a high
or low voltage. The term negate, or negation, indicates that a signal is inactive.

                                   As an output, these pins enables power downstream USB peripheral
                                   devices. See Section 5.3, "Port Power Control" for diagram and usage
                                   instructions.
                                   As an input, when the power is enabled, these pins monitor the over-
                                   current condition. When an over-current condition is detected, these pins
                                   turn the power off.
   VBUS_DET          39          I Detect Upstream VBUS Power
                                   The Microchip hub monitors VBUS_DET to determine when to assert the
                                   internal D+ pull-up resistor (signaling a connect event).
                                   When designing a detachable hub, connect this pin to the VBUS power
                                   pin of the USB port that is upstream of the hub.
                                   For self-powered applications with a permanently attached host, this pin
                                   should be pulled up, typically to VDD33.
                                   VBUS is a 3.3 volt input. A resistor divider must be used when connecting
                                   to 5 volts of USB power.
     RBIAS           47        I-R USB Transceiver Bias
                                   A 12.0 kΩ, ±1.0% resistor is attached from VSS to this pin in order to set
                                   the transceiver's internal bias currents.
 XTAL1 (CLKIN)       45     ICLKx  24 MHz Crystal Input/External Clock Input
                                   This pin can be connected to one terminal of the crystal or it can be
                                   connected to an external 24 MHz clock when a crystal is not used.
     XTAL2           44     OCLKx  24 MHz Crystal Output
                                   This is the other terminal of the crystal, or a no connect pin, when an
                                   external clock source is used to drive XTAL1 (CLKIN).
   VDD18PLL          46          - 1.8 V PLL Power Bypass
                                   This pin is the 1.8 V power bypass for the PLL. This pin requires an
                                   external bypass capacitor of 1.0 µF.
                                   If REG_EN is low, this pin serves as a power supply (1.8 V) for the device.

5.3        Port Power Control
5.3.1        PORT POWER CONTROL USING USB POWER SWITCH
The USB2642 has a single port power control and over-current sense signal for each downstream port. When disabling
port power, the driver will actively drive a 0. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation, the internal pull-up resistor will be
disabled at that time. When port power is enabled, the output driver is disabled, and the pull-up resistor is enabled cre-
ating an open drain output.
If there is an over-current situation, the USB Power Switch will assert the open drain OCS signal. The Schmitt trigger
input will detect this event as a low. The open drain output does not interfere. The over-current sense filter handles the
transient conditions, such as low voltage, while the device is powering up.

5.3.2       PORT POWER CONTROL USING A POLY FUSE
When using the USB2642 with a poly fuse, an external diode must be used (see Figure 5-2). When disabling port power,
the USB2642 driver will drive a 0. This procedure will have no effect since the external diode will isolate the pin from the
load. When port power is enabled, the USB2642 output driver is disabled, and the pull-up resistor is enabled which cre-
ates an open drain output. This means that the pull-up resistor is providing 3.3 volts to the anode of the diode. If there
is an over-current situation, the poly fuse will open. This will cause the cathode of the diode to go to zero volts. The
anode of the diode will be at 0.7 volts, and the Schmitt trigger input will register this as a low resulting in an over-current
detection. The open drain output does not interfere.

2DFU (device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the external ROM is
enabled and code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. Otherwise, code execution continues
from the internal ROM.
The SPI ROM required for the USB2642 is a recommended minimum of 1 Mbit and support 60 MHz. The frequency
used is set using the SPI_SPD_SEL. For 60 MHz operation, this pin must pulled up through a 100 kΩ resistor. SPI_SP-
D_SEL is used to choose the speed of the SPI interface. During RESET_N assertion, this pin will be tri-stated with the
weak pull-down resistor enabled. When RESET_N is negated, the value on the pin will be internally latched, and the pin
will revert to SPI_DO functionality, and the internal pull-down is disabled.
The firmware can determine the speed of operation on the SPI port by checking the SPI_SPEED in the SPI_CTL Register
(0x2400 - RESET = 0x02). Both 1- and 2-bit SPI operation is supported. For optimum throughput, a 2-bit SPI ROM is
recommended. Both mode 0 and mode 3 SPI ROMS are also supported.

7.0       CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
7.1       Hub
Microchip’s USB2642 hub is fully compliant with the Universal Serial Bus 2.0 Specification (References). See
Chapter 11 (Hub Specification) for general details regarding hub operation and functionality.
The hub provides a single Transaction Translator (TT) shared by both downstream ports. The TT contains 4 non-peri-
odic buffers.
7.1.1        HUB CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
The Microchip hub supports a large number of configurable features (some are mutually exclusive). There are two prin-
cipal ways to configure the hub:
• default settings
• settings loaded from an external EEPROM or SPI Flash device
7.1.1.1        Power Switching Polarity
The hub will only support active high power controllers.
7.1.2        VBUS DETECT
According to Section 7.2.1 of the USB 2.0 Specification, a downstream port can never provide power to its D+ or D- pull-
up resistors unless the upstream port’s VBUS is in the asserted (powered) state. The VBUS_DET pin on the hub mon-
itors the state of the upstream VBUS signal and will not pull-up the D+ resistor if VBUS is not active. If VBUS goes from
an active to an inactive state (not powered), the hub will remove power from the D+ pull-up resistor within 10 seconds.
7.2       Card Reader
The Microchip USB2642 is fully compliant with the following flash media card reader specifications:
• Secure Digital 2.0
   - SDSC, SDHC, and SDXC
   - mircoSD and reduced form factor media
   - Supports storage addressability of up to 2TB
• MultiMediaCard 4.2
   - 1/4/8 bit
   - includes support for eMMC devices
7.3       I2C over USB Bridge
USB2642 offers a I2C over USB bridge functionality. Host initiated SCSI pass-through commands are sent to USB2642
using Mass Storage Class driver to control I2C master interface. Additional support for detecting clock stretching during
reads is also provided.
The following features are exposed through host side I2C API:
• Write_I2C_Stream
   Send any length of data over the I2C interface.
   The sequence follows the I2C protocol for writing data.
• WriteRead_I2C_Stream
   Read any length of data over the I2C interface.
   The sequence follows the I2C protocol for reading data.
• GPIO_1_SET_OUTPUT
   This method allows an application to assert GPO1 pin. This can be driving RST of the I2C slave device.
For additional configuration information and protocol details, see “USB2642 I2C Over USB Bridge User’s Guide”.

USB2642
7.4       System Configurations
7.4.1        EEPROM/SPI INTERFACE
The USB2642 can be configured via a 2-wire (I2C) EEPROM (512x8) or an external SPI flash device containing the
firmware for the USB2642. If an external configuration device does not exist the internal default values will be used. If
one of the external devices is used for configuration, the OEM can update the values through the USB interface. The
hub will then attach to the upstream USB host.
The USBDM tool set is available in the Hub Card reader combo software release package.

     Bit            Name                                          Description
     7:0        USB_BM_ATT       Self- or Bus-Power: Selects between self- and bus-powered operation.
                                 The hub is either self-powered (draws less than 2 mA of upstream bus power)
                                 or bus-powered (limited to a 100 mA maximum of upstream power prior to
                                 being configured by the host controller).
                                 When configured as a bus-powered device, the Microchip hub consumes less
                                 than 100 mA of current prior to being configured. After configuration, the bus-
                                 powered Microchip hub (along with all associated hub circuitry, any embed-
                                 ded devices if part of a compound device, and 100 mA per externally avail-
                                 able downstream port) must consume no more than 500 mA of upstream
                                 VBUS current. The current consumption is system dependent, and the OEM
                                 must ensure that the USB 2.0 specifications are not violated.
                                 When configured as a self-powered device, <1 mA of upstream VBUS current
                                 is consumed and all ports are available, with each port being capable of
                                 sourcing 500 mA of current.
                                 80 = Bus-powered operation
                                 C0 = Self-powered operation

7.4.2.11      A4h-A5h: LUN 0 Power Configuration
The USB2642 has one internal FET which can be utilized for card power. The settings are stored in NVSTORE and
provide the following features:
1.  A card can be powered by an external FET or by an internal FET.
2.  The power limit is set to 200 mA default for the internal FET, but can be set to 100 mA.
Each media uses two bytes to store its LUN power configuration. Bit 3 selects between internal or external. For internal
FETs bits 0 through 2 are used for the power limit. Only 2 of the possible 8 values are currently specified.

      7          SELF_BUS_PWR         Self- or Bus-Power: Selects between self- and bus-powered operation.
                                      The hub is either self-powered (draws less than 2 mA of upstream bus
                                      power) or bus-powered (limited to a 100 mA maximum of upstream power
                                      prior to being configured by the host controller).
                                      When configured as a bus-powered device, the Microchip hub consumes
                                      less than 100 mA of current prior to being configured. After configuration, the
                                      bus-powered Microchip hub (along with all associated hub circuitry, any
                                      embedded devices if part of a compound device, and 100 mA per externally
                                      available downstream port) must consume no more than 500 mA of
                                      upstream VBUS current. The current consumption is system dependent, and
                                      the OEM must ensure that the USB 2.0 specifications are not violated.
                                      When configured as a self-powered device, <1 mA of upstream VBUS
                                      current is consumed and all ports are available, with each port being capable
                                      of sourcing 500 mA of current.

      5            HS_DISABLE         Hi-Speed Disable: Disables the capability to attach as either a Hi-/Full-Speed
                                      device, and forces attachment as Full-Speed only (i.e., no Hi-Speed support).

      3           EOP_DISABLE         EOP Disable: Disables EOP generation of EOF1 when in Full-Speed mode.
                                      During FS operation only, this permits the hub to send EOP if no
                                      downstream traffic is detected at EOF1. See Section 11.3.1 of the USB 2.0
                                      Specification (References) for additional details.
                                      0 : An EOP is generated at the EOF1 point if no traffic is detected.
                                      1 : EOP generation at EOF1 is disabled (normal USB operation).
                                      Generation of an EOP at the EOF1 point may prevent a host controller
                                      (operating in FS mode) from placing the USB bus in suspend.
     2:1         CURRENT_SNS          Over-Current Sense: Selects current sensing on a port-by-port basis, all
                                      ports ganged, or none (only for bus-powered hubs). The ability to support
                                      current sensing on a per port or ganged basis is dependent upon the
                                      hardware implementation.
                                      00 : ganged sensing (all ports together)

                                      When a hub is enumerated by a USB host controller, the hub is only
                                      permitted to report how many ports it has; the hub is not permitted to select
                                      a numerical range or assignment. The host controller will number the
                                      downstream ports of the hub starting with the number 1, up to the number
                                      of ports that the hub reported having.
                                      The host's port number is referred to as logical port number and the physical
                                      port on the hub is the physical port number. When remapping mode is

                                      numbers (assigned by the host).
                                      Note:     The OEM must ensure that contiguous logical port numbers are

7.4.5        I2C EEPROM
The I2C EEPROM interface implements a subset of the I2C Master Specification (refer to the Philips Semiconductor
Standard I2C-Bus Specification (References) for details on I2C bus protocols). The device’s I2C EEPROM interface is
designed to attach to a single dedicated I2C EEPROM, and it conforms to the Standard-mode I2C Specification (100
kbit/s transfer rate and 7-bit addressing) for protocol and electrical compatibility.
   Note:     Extensions to the I2C Specification are not supported. The device acts as the master and generates the
             serial clock SCL, controls the bus access (determines which device acts as the transmitter and which
             device acts as the receiver), and generates the START and STOP conditions.
7.4.5.1        Implementation Characteristics
The device will only access an EEPROM using the sequential read protocol.
7.4.5.2        Pull-Up Resistor
The circuit board designer is required to place external pull-up resistors (10 kΩ recommended) on the SPI_DO/SDA_EP/
SPI_SPD_SEL and SPI_CLK/SCL_EP lines (per SMBus 1.0 Specification (References) and EEPROM manufacturer
guidelines) to VDD33 in order to assure proper operation.
7.4.5.3        I2C EEPROM Slave Address
Slave address is 1010000b. 10-bit addressing is NOT supported.
7.4.6        IN-CIRCUIT EEPROM PROGRAMMING
The EEPROM can be programmed via automatic test equipment (ATE) by pulling RESET_N low which tri-states the
device’s EEPROM interface and allows an external source to program the EEPROM.
7.5        Default Configuration Option
The Microchip device can be configured via its internal default configuration. Please see Section 7.4.2, "EEPROM Data
Descriptor" for specific details on how to enable default configuration. Please refer to Table 7-1 for the internal default
values that are loaded when this option is selected.
7.6        Reset
There are two different resets that the device experiences. One is a hardware reset (either from the internal POR
(power-on reset) circuit or via the RESET_N pin) and the second is a USB bus reset.
7.6.1        EXTERNAL HARDWARE RESET_N
A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N for a minimum of 1 µs after all power supplies are within
operating range. While reset is asserted, the device (and its associated external circuitry) consumes less than IRST µA
of current from the upstream USB power source.

Assertion of RESET_N (external pin) causes the following:
1.   All downstream ports are disabled, and PRTCTL power to downstream devices is removed.
2.   The PHYs are disabled, and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
3.   All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
4.   All internal registers return to the default state (in most cases, 00h).
5.   The external crystal oscillator is halted.
6.   The PLL is halted.

Stresses above the specified parameters may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress rating only. Func-
tional operation of the device at any condition above those indicated in the operation sections of this specification is not
implied. When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies the absolute maximum ratings must not
be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage spikes on their outputs when the AC
power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the AC power line may appear on the DC output. When
this possibility exists, a clamp circuit should be used.

  Note 9-1      C0 is usually included (subtracted by the crystal manufacturer) in the specification for CL and should
                be set to ‘0’ for use in the calculation of the capacitance formulas in Figure 9-2. However, the OEM
                PCB itself may present a parasitic capacitance between XTAL1 and XTAL2. For an accurate
                calculation of C1 and C2, take the parasitic capacitance between traces XTAL1 and XTAL2 into
                account.
  Note 9-2      Each of these capacitance values is typically approximately 18 pF.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
•      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip‚Äôs code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such
acts allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
