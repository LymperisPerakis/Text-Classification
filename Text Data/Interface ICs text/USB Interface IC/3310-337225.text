Chapter 1 General Description
               The USB3310 is a highly integrated Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceiver (PHY) that supports systems
               architectures based on a 13, 19.2, 24 or 26MHz reference clock. The frequency of the reference clock
               is selected by configuration pins as shown in Section 5.9, "Pin Strap Configuration". It is designed to
               be used in both commercial and industrial temperature applications.
               The USB3310 meets all of the electrical requirements to be used as a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device,
               or an On-the-Go (OTG) device. In addition to the supporting USB signaling the USB3310 also provides
               USB UART mode
               USB3310 uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
               Link. The industry standard ULPI interface uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers
               between the Link and PHY, to facilitate a USB session. By using in-band signaling and status byte
               transfers the ULPI interface requires only 12 pins.
               The USB3310 uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
               less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
               latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
               adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.

               The USB3310 is designed to operate with an external reference clock at one of four frequencies as
               shown in the description of the REFSEL[1:0] pins in Table 2.1. By using an available reference, the
               USB3310 saves the cost of a crystal reference.
               The USB3310 includes a integrated 3.3V LDO regulator to generate its own supply from power applied
               at the VBAT pin. The voltage on the VBAT pin can range from 3.1 to 5.5V. The regulator dropout

              voltage is less than 100mV which allows the PHY to continue USB signaling when the voltage on
              VBAT drops to 3.1V. The USB transceiver will continue to operate at lower voltages, although some
              parameters may be outside the limits of the USB specifications. If the user would like to provide a 3.3V
              supply to the USB3310, the VBAT and VDD33 pins should be connected together as described in
              Section 5.5.1.
              The USB3310 also includes integrated pull-up resistors that can be used for detecting the attachment
              of a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to a USB Charger, a product using the USB3310 can
              charge its battery at more than the 500mA allowed when charging from a USB Host as described in
              Section 8.2.

5.2            Interface to DP/DM
               The blocks in the lower left-hand corner of Figure 5.1 interface to the DP/DM pins.
5.2.1          USB Transceiver
               The USB3310 transceiver includes the receivers and transmitters required to be compliant to the
               Universal Serial Bus Specification Rev 2.0. The DP/DM signals in the USB cable connect directly to
               the receivers and transmitters.
               The RX block consists of separate differential receivers for HS and FS/LS mode. Depending on the
               mode, the selected receiver provides the serial data stream through the multiplexer to the RX Logic
               block. For HS mode support, the HS RX block contains a squelch circuit to insure that noise is not
               interpreted as data. The RX block also includes a single-ended receiver on each of the data lines to
               determine the correct FS linestate.
               Data from the TX Logic block is encoded, bit stuffed, serialized and transmitted onto the USB cable
               by the TX block. Separate differential FS/LS and HS transmitters are included to support all modes.

                                        Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface - Multi-Frequency Reference Clock
                                                                                                                                                                 Datasheet
               The USB3310 TX block meets the HS signalling level requirements in the USB 2.0 Specification when
               the PCB traces from the DP and DM pins to the USB connector have very little loss. In some systems,
               it may be desirable to compensate for loss by adjusting the HS transmitter amplitude. The Boost bits
               in the HS TX Boost register may be configured to adjust the HS transmitter amplitude at the DP and
               DM pins.
5.2.2          Termination Resistors
               The USB3310 transceiver fully integrates all of the USB termination resistors on both DP and DM. This
               includes 1.5kΩ pull-up resistors, 15kΩ pull-down resistors and the 45Ω high speed termination
               resistors. These resistors require no tuning or trimming by the Link. The state of the resistors is
               determined by the operating mode of the PHY when operating in synchronous mode.
               The XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect and OpMode[1:0] bits in the Function Control register, and the
               DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register control the configuration. The possible
               valid resistor combinations are shown in Table 5.1, and operation is guaranteed in only the
               configurations shown. If a ULPI Register Setting is configured that does not match a setting in the
               table, the transceiver operation is not guaranteed and the settings in the last row of Table 5.1 will be
               used.

5.3             Bias Generator
               This block consists of an internal bandgap reference circuit used for generating the driver current and
               the biasing of the analog circuits. This block requires an external 8.06KΩ, 1% tolerance, reference
               resistor connected from RBIAS to ground. This resistor should be placed as close as possible to the
               USB3310 to minimize the trace length. The nominal voltage at RBIAS is 0.8V and therefore the resistor
               will dissipate approximately 80μW of power.
5.4             Integrated Low Jitter PLL
               The USB3310 uses an integrated low jitter phase locked loop (PLL) to provide a clean 480MHz clock.
               This clock is used by the PHY during both transmit and receive. The USB3310 requires reference clock
               to be driven on the REFCLK pin, at the frequency selected by REFSEL[1] and REFSEL[0] as
               described in Table 2.1.
               After the PLL has locked to the correct frequency, the USB3310 will de-assert DIR and the Link can
               begin using the ULPI interface. The USB3310 is guaranteed to start the clock within the time specified
               in Table 4.1. For Host applications, the ULPI AutoResume bit should be enabled. This is described in
               Section 6.2.4.4.
               The system must not drive voltage on the CLKOUT pin following POR or hardware reset that exceeds
               the value of VIH_ED provided in Table 4.3.
5.4.1          Reference Clock Requirements
               The reference clock is connected to the REFCLK pins as shown in the application diagram, Figure 8.8.
               The REFCLK pin is designed to be driven with a square wave from 0V to VDD18, but can be driven
               with a square wave from 0V to as high as 3.6V.
               When using an external reference clock, the USB3310 only uses the positive edge of the clock. The
               signal must comply with the VIH and VIL parameters provided in Table 4.3. It may be possible to AC
               couple the reference clock to change the common-mode voltage level when it is sourced by a device
               that does not comply with the VIH and VIL parameters. A DC bias network must be provided at the
               REFCLK pin when the reference clock is AC coupled. The component values provided in Figure 5.2
               are for example only. The actual values should be selected to satisfy system requirements.

               The USB3310 is tolerant to jitter on the reference clock, and the maximum jitter allowed is dependent
               on the frequency selected by REFSEL[1] and REFSEL[0]. Four reference clock frequencies are
               available as described in Table 2.1.
               When operating with a reference clock of 13MHz or 26MHz, the jitter should be limited to a peak to
               peak amplitude of less than 1nS over a 10uS time interval.

Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface - Multi-Frequency Reference Clock
Datasheet
              When operating with a reference clock of 19.2MHz or 24MHz, the peak amplitude of the jitter in the
              frequency band from 100KHz to 4MHz band must be limited to 250pS peak to peak. This requirement
              is illustrated in Figure 5.3.
              The edges of the reference clock do not need to be aligned in any way to the ULPI interface signals.
              The reference clock is used by a PLL to generate the 60MHz CLKOUT for the ULPI digital. There is
              no need to align the phase of the REFCLK and the 60MHz CLKOUT.
              The REFCLK should be enabled when the RESETB pin is brought high. The ULPI interface will start
              running after the time specified in Table 4.1. If the REFCLK enable is delayed relative to the RESETB
              pin, the ULPI interface will start operation delayed by the same amount. The REFCLK can be run at
              anytime the RESETB pin is low without causing the USB3310 to start-up or draw current.
              When the USB3310 is placed in Low Power Mode or carkit mode the REFCLK can be stopped after
              the final ULPI register write is complete. The STP pin is asserted to bring the USB3310 out of Low
              Power Mode. The REFCLK should be started at the same time STP is asserted to minimize the
              USB3310 start-up time.
              If the REFCLK is stopped while CLKOUT is running the PLL will come out of lock and the frequency
              of the CLKOUT signal will decrease to the minimum allowed by the PLL design. If the REFCLK is
              stopped during a USB session the session may drop.
5.5           Internal Regulators and POR
              The USB3310 includes integrated power management functions, including a Low-Dropout regulator
              that can be used to generate the 3.3V USB supply, and a POR generator.
5.5.1         Integrated Low Dropout Regulator
              The USB3310 has an integrated linear regulator. Power sourced at the VBAT pin is regulated to 3.3V
              and the regulator output is on the VDD33 pin. To ensure stability, the regulator requires an external
              bypass capacitor as specified in Table 4.7 placed as close to the pin as possible.
              The USB3310 regulator is designed to generate a 3.3 volt supply for the USB3310 only. Using the
              regulator to provide current for other circuits is not recommended and SMSC does not guarantee USB
              performance or regulator stability.
              During USB UART mode the regulator output voltage can be changed to allow the USB3310 to work
              with UARTs operating at different operating voltages. The regulator output voltage is controlled by the
              UART RegOutput[1:0] bits described in Section 7.1.4.4 and Table 4.7.
              The USB3310 regulator can be powered in the three methods as shown below.
              For USB Peripheral, Host, and OTG operations the regulator can be connected as shown in Figure 5.3
              or Figure 5.4 below. For OTG operation, the VDD33 supply on the USB3310 must be powered to
              detect devices attaching to the USB connector and detect a SRP during an OTG session. When using
              a battery to supply the USB3310 the battery voltage must be within the range of 3.1V to 5.5V

                           Figure 5.5 Powering the USB3310 from the USB Cable Vbus
               When using the USB3310 connected as shown in Figure 5.5, the ULPI interface will operate when
               Vbus is removed. When Vbus is removed the USB3310 should be placed into Low Power Mode until
               Vbus is detected through an interrupt. While the USB3310 is in Low Power Mode the status of VBUS,
               ID, DP, and DM can be monitored while drawing a minimum amount of current from the VDD18 supply
               as described in Section 6.2.6.4.
5.5.2          Power On Reset (POR)
               The USB3310 provides an internal POR circuit that generates a reset pulse after the VDD18 supply
               is stable. After the internal POR goes high and the RESETB pin is high, the USB3310 will release from
               reset and begin normal ULPI operation. Provided that REFCLK is present when the RESETB pin is
               brought high, the ULPI bus will be available in the time defined as TSTART as given in Table 4.1.
               The ULPI registers will power up in their default state summarized in Table 7.1 when the 1.8V supply
               is brought up. Cycling the 1.8 volt power supply will reset the ULPI registers to their default states.
               The RESETB pin can also be used to reset the ULPI registers to their default state (and reset all
               internal state machines) by bringing the pin low for a minimum of 1 microsecond and then high.
               The Link is not required to assert the RESETB pin. A pull-down resistor is not present on the RESETB
               pin and therefore the Link must drive the RESETB pin to the desired state at all times (including
               system start-up) or connect the RESETB pin to VDD18.
5.5.3          Recommended Power Supply Sequence
               For USB operation the USB3310 requires the VBAT, VDD33, and VDD18 supples.
               When the VBAT supply is applied the integrated regulator will automatically start-up and regulate
               VBAT to VDD33. If the VDD33 supply is powered and the VDD18 supply is not powered, the 3.3V
               circuits are powered off and the VDD33 current will be limited to 20uA.
               The ULPI interface will start operating after the VDD18 applied and the RESETB pin is brought high.
               The RESETB pin must be held low until the VDD18 supply is stable. If the Link is not ready to interface
               the USB3310 the Link may choose to hold the RESETB pin low until it is ready to control the ULPI
               interface.

powered as described above.Start-Up
                The power on default state of the USB3310 is ULPI Synchronous mode. The USB3310 requires the
                following conditions to begin operation: the power supplies must be stable, the REFCLK must be
                present and the RESETB pin must be high. After these conditions are met, the USB3310 will begin
                ULPI operation that is described in Section 6.1.
                Figure 5.6 below shows a timing diagram to illustrate the start-up of the USB3310. At T0, the supplies
                are stable and the USB3310 is held in reset mode. At T1, the Link drives RESETB high after the
                REFCLK has started. The RESETB pin may be brought high asynchronously to REFCLK. At this point
                the USB3310 will drive idle on the data bus and assert DIR until the internal PLL has locked. After the
                PLL has locked, the USB3310 will check that the Link has de-asserted STP and at T2 it will de-assert
                DIR and begin ULPI operation.
                The ULPI bus will be available as shown in Figure 5.6 in the time defined as TSTART given in Table 4.1.
                If the REFCLK signal starts after the RESETB pin is brought high, then time T0 will begin when
                REFCLK starts. TSTART also assumes that the Link has de-asserted STP. If the Link has held STP
                high the USB3310 will hold DIR high until STP is de-asserted. When the LINK de-asserts STP, it must
                drive a ULPI IDLE one cycle after DIR de-asserts.

                   The USB3310 provides full support for USB OTG protocol. OTG allows the USB3310 to be dynamically
                   configured as a host or device depending on the type of cable inserted into the Micro-AB receptacle.
                   When the Micro-A plug of a cable is inserted into the Micro-AB receptacle, the USB device becomes
                   the A-device. When a Micro-B plug is inserted, the device becomes the B-device. The OTG A-device
                   behaves similar to a Host while the B-device behaves similar to a peripheral. The differences are
                   covered in the OTG the “On-The-Go Supplement to the USB 2.0 Specification”. In applications where
                   only Host or Device is required, the OTG Module is unused.
                   The OTG Module is described in the following sections.

               The ID pin of the USB connector is monitored by the ID pin of the USB3310 to detect the attachment
               of different types of USB devices and cables. The block diagram of the ID detection circuitry is shown
               in Figure 5.7 and the related parameters are given in Table 4.6.

5.6.1.1        USB OTG Operation
               The USB3310 can detect ID grounded and ID floating to determine if an A or B cable has been
               inserted. The A plug will ground the ID pin while the B plug will float the ID pin. These are the only
               two valid states allowed in the OTG Protocol.
               To monitor the status of the ID pin, the Link activates the idPullup bit in the OTG Control register, waits
               50mS and then reads the status of the IdGnd bit in the USB Interrupt Status register. If an A cable has
               been inserted the IdGnd bit will read 0. If a B cable is inserted, the ID pin is floating and the IdGnd bit
               will read 1.
               The USB3310 provides an integrated weak pull-up resistor on the ID pin, RIDW. This resistor is present
               to keep the ID pin in a known state when the IdPullup bit is disabled and the ID pin is floated. In
               addition to keeping the ID pin in a known state, it enables the USB3310 to generate an interrupt to
               inform the link when a cable with a resistor to ground has been attached to the ID pin. The weak pull-
               up is small enough that the largest valid Rid resistor pulls the ID pin low and causes the IdGnd
               comparator to go low.
               After the link has detected an ID pin state change, the RID converter can be used to determine the
               resistor value as described in Section 5.6.1.2.

5.6.1.2       Measuring ID Resistance to Ground
              The Link can used the integrated resistance measurement capabilities to determine the value of an ID
              resistance to ground. The following table details the valid values of resistance to ground that the
              USB3310 can detect.

            ID RESISTANCE TO GROUND                                                 RID VALUE

              Note: IdPullUp = 0
              The Rid resistance can be read while the USB3310 is in Synchronous Mode. When a resistor to
              ground is attached to the ID pin, the state of the IdGnd comparator will change. After the Link has
              detected ID transition to ground, it can use the methods described in Section 6.5 to operate the Rid
              converter.
5.6.1.3       Using IdFloat Comparator (not recommended)
              Note: The ULPI specification details a method to detect a 102kΩ resistance to ground using the
                       IdFloat comparator. This method can only detect 0ohms, 102kΩ, and floating terminations of
                       the ID pin. Due to this limitation it is recommended to use the RID Converter as described in
                       Section 5.6.1.2.
              The ID pin can be either grounded, floated, or connected to ground with a 102kΩ external resistor. To
              detect the 102K resistor, set the idPullup bit in the OTG Control register, causing the USB3310 to apply
              the 100K internal pull-up connected between the ID pin and VDD33. Set the idFloatRise and idFloatFall
              bits in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers to enable the
              IdFloat comparator to generate an RXCMD to the Link when the state of the IdFloat changes. As
              described in Figure 6.3, the alt_int bit of the RXCMD will be set. The values of IdGnd and IdFloat are
              shown for the three types cables that can attach to the USB Connector in Table 5.4.

                 Float                                         0                                    1

                 GND                                           1                                    0
              Note: The ULPI register bits IdPullUp, IdFloatRise, and IdFloatFall should be enabled.
              To save current when an A Plug is inserted, the internal 102kΩ pull-up resistor can be disabled by
              clearing the IdPullUp bit in the OTG Control register and the IdFloatRise and IdFloatFall bits in both

               The IdGnd value can be read using the ULPI USB Interrupt Status register, bit 4. In host mode, it can
               be set to generate an interrupt when IdGnd changes by setting the appropriate bits in the USB Interrupt
               Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. The IdFloat value can be read by reading
               the ULPI Carkit Interrupt Status register bit 0.
               Note: The IdGnd switch has been provided to ground the ID pin for future applications.
5.6.2          VBUS Monitor and Pulsing
               The USB3310 includes all of the Vbus comparators required for OTG. The VbusVld, SessVld, and
               SessEnd comparators shown in Figure 5.8 are fully integrated into the USB3310. These comparators
               are used to monitor changes in the Vbus voltage, and the state of each comparator can be read from
               the USB Interrupt Status register.
               The VbusVld comparator is used by the Link, when configured as an A device, to ensure that the Vbus
               voltage on the cable is valid. The SessVld comparator is used by the Link when configured as both
               an A or B device to indicate a session is requested or valid. Finally the SessEnd comparator is used
               by the B-device to indicate a USB session has ended.
               Also included in the VBUS Monitor and Pulsing block are the resistors used for Vbus pulsing in SRP.
               The resistors used for VBUS pulsing include a pull-down to ground and a pull-up to VDD33 as shown
               in Figure 5.8.

5.6.2.1        SessEnd Comparator
               The SessEnd comparator is designed to trip when Vbus is less than 0.5 volts. When Vbus goes below
               0.5 volts the USB session is considered to be ended, and SessEnd will transition from 0 to 1. The
               SessEnd comparator can be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and
               USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. When disabled, the SessEnd bit in the USB Interrupt Status
               register will read 0. The SessEnd comparator trip points are detailed in Table 4.6.

5.6.2.2        SessVld Comparator
               The SessVld comparator is used when the PHY is configured as both an A and B device. When
               configured as an A device, the SessVld is used to detect Session Request protocol (SRP). When
               configured as a B device, SessVld is used to detect the presence of Vbus. The SessVld interrupts can
               be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable
               Falling registers. When the interrupts are disabled, the SessVld comparator is not disabled and its state
               can be read in the USB Interrupt Status register. The SessVld comparator trip point is detailed in
               Table 4.6.
               Note: The OTG Supplement specifies a voltage range for A-Device Session Valid and B-Device
                        Session Valid comparator. The USB3310 PHY combines the two comparators into one and
                        uses the narrower threshold range.
5.6.2.3        VbusVld Comparator
               The final Vbus comparator is the VbusVld comparator. This comparator is only used when the
               USB3310 is configured as an A-device. In the USB protocol the A-device supplies the VBUS voltage
               and is responsible to ensure it remains within a specified voltage range. The VbusVld comparator can
               be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable
               Falling registers. When disabled, bit 1 of the USB Interrupt Status register will return a 0. The VbusVld
               comparator trip points are detailed in Table 4.6.
               The internal VbusValid comparator is designed to ensure the Vbus voltage remains above 4.4V.
               The USB3310 includes the external vbus valid indicator logic as detail in the ULPI Specification. The
               external vbus valid indicator is tied to a logic one. The decoding of this logic is shown in Table 5.5
               below. By default this logic is disabled.

               Note 5.2     A peripheral should not use VbusVld to begin operation. The peripheral should use
                            SessVld because the internal VbusVld threshold can be above the Vbus voltage required
                            for USB peripheral operation.

5.6.2.4         Vbus Pulsing with Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors
                In addition to the internal Vbus comparators, the USB3310 also includes the integrated Vbus pull-up
                and pull-down resistors used for Vbus Pulsing. To discharge the Vbus voltage so that a Session
                Request can begin, the USB3310 provides a pull-down resistor from Vbus to Ground. This resistor is
                controlled by the DischargeVbus bit 3 of the OTG Control register. The pull-up resistor is connected
                between Vbus and VDD33. This resistor is used to pull Vbus above 2.1 volts so that the A-Device
                knows that a USB session has been requested. The state of the pull-up resistor is controlled by the
                bit 4 ChargeVbus of the OTG Control register. The Pull-Up and Pull-Down resistor values are detailed
                in Table 4.6.
5.6.2.5         Vbus Input Impedance
                The OTG Supplement requires an A-Device that supports Session Request Protocol to have a VBUS
                input impedance less than 100kΩ and greater the 40kΩ to ground. The USB3310 provides a 75kΩ
                resistance to ground, RVB. The RVB resistor tolerance is detailed in Table 4.6.
5.6.3           Driving External Vbus
                The USB3310 monitors VBUS as described in VBUS Monitor and Pulsing. However, no pins are
                available on the package to allow controlling an external VBUS supply or power switch. The Link
                typically controls the external VBUS supply or power switch as shown in Figure 5.9.

5.7           USB UART Support
              The USB3310 provides support for the USB UART interface as detailed in the ULPI specification and
              the CEA-936A specification. The USB3310 can be placed in UART Mode using the method described
              in Section 6.4, and the regulator output will automatically switch to the value configured by the UART
              RegOutput bits in the USB IO & Power Management register. While in UART mode, the Linestate
              signals cannot be monitored on the DATA[0] and DATA[1] pins.
5.8           USB Charger Detection Support
              To support the detection and identification of different types of USB chargers the USB3310 provides
              integrated pull-up resistors, RCD, on both DP and DM. These pull-up resistors along with the single
              ended receivers can be used to help determine the type of USB charger attached. Reference
              information on implementing charger detection is provided in Section 8.2.

5.9           Pin Strap Configuration
              The USB3310 is configured for the frequency of the reference clock by the REFSEL[1] and
              REFSEL[0] pins. The value on the REFSEL[1] and REFSEL[0] pins is latched when power is applied
              at VDD18, and the value is also latched when RESETB transitions from low to high. If a pin is
              connected to VDD18, the value of “1” is assigned. Connect the pin to ground to assign a “0.” Four
              reference clock frequencies are available as described in Table 2.1.

Chapter 6 ULPI Operation Overview
                 The USB3310 uses the industry standard ULPI digital interface to facilitate communication between
                 the PHY and Link (device controller). The ULPI interface is designed to reduce the number of pins
                 required to connect a discrete USB PHY to an ASIC or digital controller. For example, a full UTMI+
                 Level 3 OTG interface requires 54 signals while a ULPI interface requires only 12 signals.
                 The ULPI interface is documented completely in the “UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI)
                 Specification Revision 1.1” (www.ulpi.org). The following sections highlight the key operating modes
                 of the USB3310 digital interface.
6.1              Overview
                 Figure 6.1 illustrates the block diagram of the ULPI digital functions. It should be noted that this
                 USB3310 does not use a “ULPI wrapper” around a UTMI+ PHY core as the ULPI specification implies.

                 The advantage of a “wrapper less” architecture is that the USB3310 has a lower USB latency than a
                 design which must first register signals into the PHY’s wrapper before the transfer to the PHY core. A
                 low latency PHY allows a Link to use a wrapper around a UTMI Link and still make the required USB
                 turn-around timing given in the USB 2.0 specification.

Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface - Multi-Frequency Reference Clock
Datasheet
              RxEndDelay maximum allowed by the UTMI+/ULPI for 8-bit data is 63 high speed clocks. USB3310
              uses a low latency high speed receiver path to lower the RxEndDelay to 43 high speed clocks. This
              low latency design gives the Link more cycles to make decisions and reduces the Link complexity. This
              is the result of the “wrapper less” architecture of the USB3310. This low RxEndDelay should allow
              legacy UTMI Links to use a “wrapper” to convert the UTMI+ interface to a ULPI interface.
              In Figure 6.1, a single ULPI Protocol Block decodes the ULPI 8-bit bi-directional bus when the Link
              addresses the PHY. The Link must use the DIR output to determine direction of the ULPI data bus.
              The USB3310 is the “bus arbitrator”. The ULPI Protocol Block will route data/commands to the
              transmitter or the ULPI register array.
6.1.1         ULPI Interface Signals
              The UTIM+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) uses 12-pins to connect a full OTG Host / Device PHY to an
              SOC. A reduction of external pins on the PHY is accomplished by realizing that many of the relatively
              static configuration pins (xcvrselect[1:0], termselect, opmode[1:0], and DpPullDown DmPulldown to list
              a few,) can be implemented by having an internal static register array.
              An 8-bit bi-directional data bus clocked at 60MHz allows the Link to access this internal register array
              and transfer USB packets to and from the PHY. The remaining 3 pins function to control the data flow
              and arbitrate the data bus.
              Direction of the 8-bit data bus is controlled by the DIR output from the PHY. Another output, NXT, is
              used to control data flow into and out of the device. Finally, STP, which is in input to the PHY,
              terminates transfers and is used to start up and resume from Low Power Mode.
              The 12 signals are described below in Table 6.1.
                                            Table 6.1 ULPI Interface Signals
    SIGNAL        DIRECTION                                             DESCRIPTION
 CLKOUT          OUT              60MHz reference clock output. All ULPI signals are driven synchronous to the
                                  rising edge of this clock.
 DATA[7:0]       I/O              8-bit bi-directional data bus. Bus ownership is determined by DIR. The Link and
                                  PHY initiate data transfers by driving a non-zero pattern onto the data bus. ULPI
                                  defines interface timing for a single-edge data transfers with respect to rising edge
                                  of CLKOUT.
 DIR             OUT              Controls the direction of the data bus. When the PHY has data to transfer to the
                                  Link, it drives DIR high to take ownership of the bus. When the PHY has no data
                                  to transfer it drives DIR low and monitors the bus for commands from the Link. The
                                  PHY will pull DIR high whenever the interface cannot accept data from the Link,
                                  such as during PLL start-up.
 STP             IN               The Link asserts STP for one clock cycle to stop the data stream currently on the
                                  bus. If the Link is sending data to the PHY, STP indicates the last byte of data was
                                  on the bus in the previous cycle.
 NXT             OUT              The PHY asserts NXT to throttle the data. When the Link is sending data to the
                                  PHY, NXT indicates when the current byte has been accepted by the PHY. The
                                  Link places the next byte on the data bus in the following clock cycle.
              USB3310 implements a Single Data Rate (SDR) ULPI interface with all data transfers happening on
              the rising edge of the CLKOUT signal supplied by the PHY.
              The ULPI interface supports the two basic modes of operation: Synchronous Mode and Low Power
              Mode. In Synchronous Mode, all signals change synchronously with the 60MHz CLKOUT. In Low
              Power Mode the clock is off and the lower two bits of the data bus contain the linestate[1:0] signals.
              Interrupt outputs are generated while in Low Power Mode to enable the Link to receive an
              asynchronous interrupt when the Linestate, Vbus state, or ID state changes.

                Data is transferred on the rising edge of CLKOUT while operating in Synchronous Mode. The direction
                of the data bus is determined by the state of DIR. When DIR is high, the PHY is driving DATA[7:0].
                When DIR is low, the Link is driving DATA[7:0].
                Each time DIR changes, a “turn-around” cycle occurs where neither the Link nor PHY drive the data
                bus for one clock cycle. During the “turn–around“cycle, the state of DATA[7:0] is unknown and the
                PHY will not read the data bus.
                Because USB uses a bit-stuffing encoding, some means of allowing the PHY to throttle the USB
                transmit data is needed. The ULPI signal NXT is used to request the next byte to be placed on the
                data bus by the Link layer.

                The control and data timing relationships are given in Figure 6.2 and Table 4.2. The USB3310 provides
                CLKOUT and all timing is relative to the rising clock edge.

6.2             ULPI Register Access
                A command from the Link begins a ULPI transfer from the Link to the USB3310. Before reading a
                ULPI register, the Link must wait until DIR is low, and then send a Transmit Command Byte (TXD
                CMD) byte. The TXD CMD byte informs the USB3310 of the type of data being sent. The TXD CMD
                is followed by a data transfer to or from the USB3310. Table 6.2 gives the TXD command byte (TXD
                CMD) encoding for the USB3310. The upper two bits of the TX CMD instruct the PHY as to what type

               A ULPI register write operation is given in Figure 6.3. The TXD command with a register write
               DATA[7:6] = 10b is driven by the Link at T0. The register address is encoded into DATA[5:0] of the
               TXD CMD byte.

                    To write a register, the Link will wait until DIR is low, and at T0, drive the TXD CMD on the data bus.
                    At T2 the PHY will drive NXT high. On the next rising clock edge, T3, the Link will write the register
                    data. At T4, the PHY will accept the register data and the Link will drive an Idle on the bus and drive
                    STP high to signal the end of the data packet. Finally, at T5, the PHY will latch the data into the register
                    and drive NXT low. The Link will pull STP low.
                    NXT is used to control when the Link drives the register data on the bus. DIR is low throughout this
                    transaction since the PHY is receiving data from the Link. STP is used to end the transaction and data
                    is registered after the de-assertion of STP. After the write operation completes, the Link must drive a
                    ULPI Idle (00h) on the data bus or the USB3310 may decode the bus value as a ULPI command.
                    A ULPI extended register write operation is shown in Figure 6.4. To write an extended register, the Link
                    will wait until DIR is low, and at T0, drive the TXD CMD on the data bus. At T2 the PHY will drive NXT
                    high. On the next clock T3 the Link will drive the extended address. On the next rising clock edge, T4,
                    the Link will write the register data. At T5, the PHY will accept the register data and drive NXT low.
                    The Link will drive an Idle on the bus and drive STP high to signal the end of the data packet. Finally,
                    at T5, the PHY will latch the data into the register. The Link will pull STP low.

              At T0, the Link will place the TXD CMD on the data bus. At T2, the PHY will bring NXT high, signaling
              that the Link it is ready to accept the data transfer. At T3, the PHY reads the TXD CMD, determines
              it is a register read, and asserts DIR to gain control of the bus. The PHY will also de-assert NXT. At
              T4, the bus ownership has transferred back to the PHY and the PHY drives the requested register
              onto the data bus. At T5, the Link will read the data bus and the PHY will drop DIR low returning control
              of the bus back to the Link. After the turn around cycle, the Link must drive a ULPI Idle command at T6.
              A ULPI extended register read operation is shown in Figure 6.6.To read an extended register, the Link
              writes the TX CMD with the address set to 2Fh. At T2, the PHY will assert NXT, signaling the Link it
              is ready to accept the extended address. At T3, the Link places the extended register address on the
              bus. At T4, the PHY reads the extended address, and asserts DIR to gain control of the bus. The PHY
              will also de-assert NXT. At T5, the bus ownership has transferred back to the PHY and the PHY drives
              the requested register onto the data bus. At T6, the Link will read the data bus and the PHY will de-
              assert DIR returning control of the bus back to the Link. After the turn around cycle, the Link must
              drive a ULPI Idle command at T6.

6.2.3            ULPI RXCMD
                 The ULPI Link needs information which was provided by the following pins in a UTMI implementation:
                 linestate[1:0], rxactive, rxvalid and rxerror. When implementing the OTG functions the VBUS and ID
                 pin states must also be transferred to the Link.
                 ULPI defines a Receive Command Byte (RXCMD) that contains this information. The Encoding of the
                 RXCMD byte is given in the Table 6.3.
                 Transfer of the RXCMD byte occurs in Synchronous Mode when the PHY has control of the bus. The
                 ULPI Protocol Block shown in Figure 6.1 determines when to send an RXCMD. When a linestate
                 change occurs, the RXCMD is sent immediately if the DIR output is low.
                 When a USB Receive is occurring, RXCMD’s are sent whenever NXT = 0 and DIR = 1. During a USB
                 Transmit, the RXCMD’s are returned to the Link after STP is asserted.
                 To summarize a RXCMD transfer occurs:
                    When DIR is low and a linestate change occurs.
                    When Vbus and/or ID comparators change state.
                    During a USB receive when NXT is low.
                    After STP is asserted during a USB transmit command.
                    After the USB3310 deasserts DIR and STP is low during start-up
                    After the USB3310 exits Low Power Mode, Serial Modes, or Carkit Modes after detecting that the
                     Link has asserted STP.

                                occurs on any bit in the Carkit Interrupt Latch register. The Link must read the Carkit
                                Interrupt Latch register to determine the source of the interrupt. Section 5.6.1.3
                                describes how a change on the ID pin can generate an interrupt. Section 6.5
                                describes how an interrupt can be generated when the RidConversionDone bit is set.
              Notes:
              1. An ‘X’ is a do not care and can be either a logic 0 or 1.
              2. The value of VbusValid is defined in Table 5.5.
              Note 6.1     LineState: These bits in the RXCMD byte reflect the current state of the Full-Speed single
                           ended receivers. LineState[0] directly reflects the current state of DP. LineState[1] directly
                           reflects the current state of DM. When DP=DM=0 this is called "Single Ended Zero" (SE0).
                           When DP=DM=1, this is called "Single Ended One" (SE1).
6.2.4         USB3310 Transmitter
              The USB3310 ULPI transmitter fully supports HS, FS, and LS transmit operations. Figure 6.1 shows
              the high speed, full speed, and low speed transmitter block controlled by ULPI Protocol Block.
              Encoding of the USB packet follows the bit-stuffing and NRZI outlined in the USB 2.0 specification.
              Many of these functions are re-used between the HS and FS/LS transmitters. When using the
              USB3310, Table 5.1 should always be used as a guideline on how to configure for various modes of
              operation. The transmitter decodes the inputs of XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect, OpMode[1:0],
              DpPulldown, and DmPulldown to determine what operation is expected. Users must strictly adhere to
              the modes of operation given in Table 5.1.

                                           Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface - Multi-Frequency Reference Clock
                                                                                                                   Datasheet
                Several important functions for a device and host are designed into the transmitter blocks.
                The USB3310 transmitter will transmit a 32-bit long high speed sync before every high speed packet.
                In full and low speed modes a 8-bit sync is transmitted.
                When the device or host needs to chirp for high speed port negotiation, the OpMode = 10 setting will
                turn off the bit-stuffing and NRZI encoding in the transmitter. At the end of a chirp, the USB3310
                OpMode register bits should be changed only after the RXCMD linestate encoding indicates that the
                transmitter has completed transmitting. Should the opmode be switched to normal bit-stuffing and NRZI
                encoding before the transmit pipeline is empty, the remaining data in the pipeline may be transmitted
                in an bit-stuff encoding format.
                Please refer to the ULPI specification for a detailed discussion of USB reset and HS chirp.
6.2.4.1         High Speed Long EOP
                When operating as a Hi-Speed host, the USB3310 will automatically generate a 40 bit long End of
                Packet (EOP) after a SOF PID (A5h). The USB3310 determines when to send the 40-bit long EOP by
                decoding the ULPI TXD CMD bits [3:0] for the SOF. The 40-bit long EOP is only transmitted when the
                DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register are asserted. The Hi-Speed 40-bit long
                EOP is used to detect a disconnect in high speed mode.
                In device mode, the USB3310 will not send a long EOP after a SOF PID.
6.2.4.2         Low Speed Keep-Alive
                Low speed keep alive is supported by the USB3310. When in Low speed (10b), the USB3310 will send
                out two Low speed bit times of SE0 when a SOF PID is received.
6.2.4.3         UTMI+ Level 3
                Pre-amble is supported for UTMI+ Level 3 compatibility. When XcvrSelect is set to (11b) in host mode,
                (DpPulldown and DmPulldown both asserted) the USB3310 will pre-pend a full speed pre-amble before
                the low speed packet. Full speed rise and fall times are used in this mode. The pre-amble consists of
                the following: Full speed sync, the encoded pre-PID (C3h) and then full speed idle (DP=1 and DM =
                0). A low speed packet follows with a sync, data and a LS EOP.
                The USB3310 will only support UTMI+ Level 3 as a host. The USB3310 does not support UTMI+ Level
                3 as a peripheral. A UTMI+ Level 3 peripheral is an upstream hub port. The USB3310 will not decode
                a pre-amble packet intended for a LS device when the USB3310 is configured as the upstream port
                of a FS hub, XcvrSelect = 11b, DpPulldown = 0b, DmPulldown =0b.
6.2.4.4         Host Resume K
                Resume K generation is supported by the USB3310. When the USB3310 exits the suspended (Low
                Power Mode), the USB3310, when operating as a host, will transmit a K on DP/DM. The transmitters
                will end the K with SE0 for two Low Speed bit times. If the USB3310 was operating in high speed
                mode before the suspend, the host must change to high speed mode before the SE0 ends. SE0 is
                two low speed bit times which is about 1.2 us. For more details please see sections 7.1.77 and 7.9 of
                the USB Specification.
                In device mode, the resume K will not append an SE0, but release the bus to the correct idle state,
                depending upon the operational mode as shown in Table 5.1.
                The ULPI specification includes a detailed discussion of the resume sequence and the order of
                operations required. To support Host start-up of less than 1mS the USB3310 implements the ULPI
                AutoResume bit in the Interface Control register. The default AutoResume state is 0 and this bit should
                be enabled for Host applications.

6.2.4.5         No SYNC and EOP Generation (OpMode = 11)
                UTMI+ defines OpMode = 11 where no sync and EOP generation occurs in Hi-Speed operation. This
                is an option to the ULPI specification and not implemented in the USB3310.
6.2.4.6         Typical USB Transmit with ULPI
                Figure 6.7 shows a typical USB transmit sequence. A transmit sequence starts by the Link sending a
                TXD CMD where DATA[7:6] = 01b, DATA[5:4] = 00b, and Data[3:0] = PID. The TX CMD with the PID
                is followed by transmit data.

                During transmit the PHY will use NXT to control the rate of data flow into the PHY. If the USB3310
                pipeline is full or bit-stuffing causes the data pipeline to overfill NXT is de-asserted and the Link will
                hold the value on Data until NXT is asserted. The USB Transmit ends when the Link asserts STP while
                NXT is asserted.
                Note: The Link cannot assert STP with NXT de-asserted since the USB3310 is expecting to fetch
                         another byte from the Link.
                After the USB3310 completes transmitting, the DP/DM lines return to idle and a RXCMD is returned
                to the Link so the inter-packet timers may be updated by linestate.
                While operating in Full Speed or Low Speed, an End-of-Packet (EOP) is defined as SE0 for
                approximately two bit times, followed by J for one bit time. The transceiver drives a J state for one bit
                time following the SE0 to complete the EOP. The Link must wait for one bit time following line state
                indication of the SE0 to J transition to allow the transceiver to complete the one bit time J state. All bit
                times are relative to the speed of transmission.
                In the case of Full Speed or Low Speed, after STP is asserted each FS/LS bit transition will generate
                a RXCMD since the bit times are relatively slow.
6.2.5           USB Receiver
                The USB3310 ULPI receiver fully supports HS, FS, and LS transmit operations. In all three modes the
                receiver detects the start of packet and synchronizes to the incoming data packet. In the ULPI protocol,
                a received packet has the priority and will immediately follow register reads and RXCMD transfers.
                Figure 6.8 shows a basic USB packet received by the USB3310 over the ULPI interface.

                In Figure 6.8 the PHY asserts DIR to take control of the data bus from the Link. The assertion of DIR
                and NXT in the same cycle contains additional information that Rxactive has been asserted. When
                NXT is de-asserted and DIR is asserted, the RXCMD data is transferred to the Link. After the last byte
                of the USB receive packet is transferred to the PHY, the linestate will return to idle.
                The ULPI full speed receiver operates according to the UTMI / ULPI specification. In the full speed
                case, the NXT signal will assert only when the Data bus has a valid received data byte. When NXT is
                low with DIR high, the RXCMD is driven on the data bus.
                In full speed, the USB3310 will not issue a Rxactive de-assertion in the RXCMD until the DP/DM
                linestate transitions to idle. This prevents the Link from violating the two full speed bit times minimum
                turn around time.
6.2.5.1         Disconnect Detection
                A High Speed host must detect a disconnect by sampling the transmitter outputs during the long EOP
                transmitted during a SOF packet. The USB3310 only looks for a high speed disconnect during the long
                EOP where the period is long enough for the disconnect reflection to return to the host PHY. When a
                high speed disconnect occurs, the USB3310 will return a RXCMD and set the host disconnect bit in
                the USB Interrupt Status register.
                When in FS or LS modes, the Link is expected to handle all disconnect detection.
6.2.6           Low Power Mode
                Low Power Mode is a power down state to save current when the USB session is suspended. The
                Link controls when the PHY is placed into or out of Low Power Mode. In Low Power Mode all of the
                circuits are powered down except the interface pins, full speed receiver, VBUS comparators, and IdGnd
                comparator.
                Before entering Low Power Mode, the USB3310 must be configured to set the desired state of the
                USB transceiver. The XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect and OpMode[1:0] bits in the Function Control
                register, and the DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register control the
                configuration as shown in Table 5.1. The DP and DM pins are configured to a high impedance state
                by configuring OpMode[1:0] = 01. Pull-down resistors with a value of approximately 2MΩ are present

                on the DP and DM pins to avoid false linestate indications that could result if the pins were allowed to
                float.
6.2.6.1         Entering Low Power/Suspend Mode
                To enter Low Power Mode, the Link will write a 0 or clear the SuspendM bit in the Function Control
                register. After this write is complete, the PHY will assert DIR high and after a minimum of five rising
                edges of CLKOUT, drive the clock low. After the clock is stopped, the PHY will enter a low power state
                to conserve current. Placing the PHY in Suspend Mode is not related to USB Suspend. To clarify this
                point, USB Suspend is initiated when a USB host stops data transmissions and enters Full-Speed
                mode with 15KΩ pull-down resistors on DP and DM. The suspended device goes to Full-Speed mode
                with a pull-up on DP. Both the host and device remain in this state until one of them drives DM high
                (this is called a resume).

                While in Low Power Mode, the Data interface is redefined so that the Link can monitor Linestate and
                the Vbus voltage. In Low Power Mode DATA[3:0] are redefined as shown in Table 6.4. Linestate[1:0]
                is the combinational output of the Single-Ended Receivers. The “int” or interrupt signal indicates an
                unmasked interrupt has occurred. When an unmasked interrupt or linestate change has occurred, the
                Link is notified and can determine if it should wake-up the PHY.

                To exit Low Power Mode, the Link will assert STP. Upon the assertion of STP, the USB3310 will begin
                its start-up procedure. After the PHY start-up is complete, the PHY will start the clock on CLKOUT and
                de-assert DIR. After DIR has been de-asserted, the Link can de-assert STP when ready and start
                operating in Synchronous Mode. The PHY will automatically set the SuspendM bit to a 1 in the
                Function Control register.

                Should the Link de-assert STP before DIR is de-asserted, the USB3310 will detect this as a false
                resume request and return to Low Power Mode. This is detailed in section 3.9.4 of the ULPI 1.1
                specification.
6.2.6.3         Interface Protection
                ULPI protocol assumes that both the Link and PHY will keep the ULPI data bus driven by either the
                Link when DIR is low or the PHY when DIR is high. The only exception is when DIR has changed
                state and a turn around cycle occurs for 1 clock period.
                In the design of a USB system, there can be cases where the Link may not be driving the ULPI bus
                to a known state while DIR is low. Two examples where this can happen is because of a slow Link
                start-up or a hardware reset.
                START UP PROTECTION
                Upon start-up, when the PHY de-asserts DIR, the Link must be ready to receive commands and drive
                Idle on the data bus. If the Link is not ready to receive commands or drive Idle, it must assert STP
                before DIR is de-asserted. The Link can then de-assert STP when it has completed its start-up. If the
                Link doesn’t assert STP before it can receive commands, the PHY may interpret the data bus state as
                a TX CMD and transmit invalid data onto the USB bus, or make invalid register writes.

Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface - Multi-Frequency Reference Clock
Datasheet
              When the USB3310 sends a RXCMD the Link is required to drive the data bus back to idle at the end
              of the turn around cycle. If the Link does not drive the databus to idle the USB3310 may take the
              information on the data bus as a TXCMD and transmit data on DP and DM until the Link asserts stop.
              If the ID pin is floated the last RXCMD from the USB3310 will remain on the bus after DIR is de-
              asserted and the USB3310 will take this in as a TXCMD.
              A Link should be designed to have the default POR state of the STP output high and the data bus tri-
              stated. The USB3310 has weak pull-downs on the data bus to prevent these inputs from floating when
              not driven. These resistors are only used to prevent the ULPI interface from floating during events
              when the link ULPI pins may be tri-stated. The strength of the pull down resistors can be found in
              Table 4.3. The pull downs are not strong enough to pull the data bus low after a ULPI RXCMD, the
              Link must drive the data bus to idle after DIR is de-asserted.
              In some cases, a Link may be software configured and not have control of its STP pin until after the
              PHY has started. In this case, the USB3310 has in internal pull-up on the STP input pad which will
              pull STP high while the Link’s STP output is tri-stated. The STP pull-up resistor is enabled on POR
              and can be disabled by setting the InterfaceProtectDisable bit 7 of the Interface Control register.
              The STP pull-up resistor will pull-up the Link’s STP input high until the Link configures and drives STP
              high. After the Link completes its start-up, STP can be synchronously driven low.
              A Link design which drives STP high during POR can disable the pull-up resistor on STP by setting
              InterfaceProtectDisable bit to 1. A motivation for this is to reduce the suspend current. In Low Power
              Mode, STP is held low, which would draw current through the pull-up resistor on STP.
              WARM RESET
              Designers should also consider the case of a warm restart of a Link with a PHY in Low Power Mode.
              After the PHY enters Low Power Mode, DIR is asserted and the clock is stopped. The USB3310 looks
              for STP to be asserted to re-start the clock and then resume normal synchronous operation.
              Should the USB3310 be suspended in Low Power Mode, and the Link receives a hardware reset, the
              PHY must be able to recover from Low Power Mode and start its clock. If the Link asserts STP on
              reset, the PHY will exit Low Power Mode and start its clock.
              If the Link does not assert STP on reset, the interface protection pull-up can be used. When the Link
              is reset, its STP output will tri-state and the pull-up resistor will pull STP high, signaling the PHY to
              restart its clock.
6.2.6.4       Minimizing Current in Low Power Mode
              In order to minimize the suspend current in Low Power Mode, the OTG comparators can be disabled
              to reduce suspend current. In Low Power Mode, the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators are not
              needed and can be disabled by clearing the associated bits in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising
              and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. By disabling the interrupt in BOTH the rise and fall
              registers, the SessEnd and VbusVld comparators are turned off. The IdFloatRise and IdFloatFall bits
              in Carkit Interrupt Enable register should also be disabled if they were set. When exiting Low Power
              Mode, the Link should immediately re-enable the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators if host or OTG
              functionality is required.
              In addition to disabling the OTG comparators in Low Power Mode, the Link may choose to disable the
              Interface Protect Circuit. By setting the InterfaceProtectDisable bit high in the Interface Control register,
              the Link can disable the pull-up resistor on STP. When RESETB is low the Interface Protect Circuit
              will be disabled.
6.3           Full Speed/Low Speed Serial Modes
              The USB3310 includes two serial modes to support legacy Links which use either the 3pin or 6pin
              serial format. To enter either serial mode, the Link will need to write a 1 to the 6-pin FsLsSerialMode
              or the 3-pin FsLsSerialMode bits in the Interface control register. Serial Mode may be used to conserve
              power when attached to a device that is not capable of operating in Hi-Speed.

                                           Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface - Multi-Frequency Reference Clock
                                                                                                                   Datasheet
                The serial modes are entered in the same manner as the entry into Low Power Mode. The Link writes
                the Interface Control register bit for the specific serial mode. The USB3310 will assert DIR and shut
                off the clock after at least five clock cycles. Then the data bus goes to the format of the serial mode
                selected. Before entering either serial mode, the Link must set the ULPI transceiver to the appropriate
                mode as defined in Table 5.1.
                By default, the PHY will shut off the 60MHz clock to conserve power. Should the Link need the 60MHz
                clock to continue during the serial mode of operation, the ClockSuspendM bit[3] of the Interface Control
                Register should be set before entering a serial mode. If set, the 60 MHz clock will be present during
                serial modes.
                In serial mode, interrupts are possible from unmasked sources. The state of each interrupt source is
                sampled prior to the assertion of DIR and this is compared against the asynchronous level from
                interrupt source.
                Exiting the serial modes is the same as exiting Low Power Mode. The Link must assert STP to signal
                the PHY to exit serial mode. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR is de-asserted and the PHY
                will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI operation. The RESETB pin can
                also be pulsed low to reset the USB3310 and return it to Synchronous Mode.

6.4           Carkit Mode
              The USB3310 includes Carkit Mode to support a USB UART Mode.
              60MHz clock is stopped to conserve power by default. The Link may configure the 60MHz clock to
              continue by setting the ClockSuspendM bit of Interface Control before entering Carkit Mode. If set, the
              60 MHz clock will continue during the of operation.
              In Carkit Mode, interrupts are possible from unmasked sources. The state of each interrupt source is
              sampled prior to the assertion of DIR and this is compared against the asynchronous level from
              interrupt source. In Carkit Mode, the Linestate signals are not available per the ULPI specification.
              Exiting Carkit Mode is the same as exiting Low Power Mode as described in Section 6.2.6.2. The Link
              must assert STP to signal the PHY to exit serial mode. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR
              is de-asserted and the PHY will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI
              operation. The RESETB pin can also be pulsed low to reset the USB3310 and return it to Synchronous
              Mode.
6.4.1         USB UART Mode
              The USB3310 can be placed into UART Mode by first setting the TxdEn and RxdEn bits in the Carkit
              Control register. Then the Link can set the CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control register. The TxdEn
              and RxdEn bits must be written before the CarkitMode bit. After the CarkitMode bit is set, the ULPI
              interface will become redefined as described in Table 6.7, and the USB3310 will transmit data through
              the DATA[0] to DM of the USB connector and receive data on DP and pass the information the Link
              on DATA[1].
              When entering UART mode, the regulator output will automatically switch to the value configured by
              the UART RegOutput bits in the USB IO & Power Management register and a 125K RCD pull-up will
              be applied internally to DP and DM. This will hold the UART in its default operating state.
              While in UART mode, the transmit edge rates can be set to either the Full Speed USB or Low Speed
              USB edge rates by using the XcvrSelect[1:0] bits in the Function Control register.

6.5             RID Converter Operation
                The RID converter is designed to read the value of the ID resistance to ground and report back its
                value through the ULPI interface.
                When a resistor to ground is applied to the ID pin the state of the IdGnd comparator will change from
                a 1 to a 0 as described in Section 5.6.1. If the USB3310 is in ULPI mode, an RXCMD will be generated
                with bit 6 low. If the USB3310 is in Low Power Mode (or one of the other non-ULPI modes), the
                DATA[3] interrupt signal will go high.
                After the USB3310 has detected the change of state on the ID pin, the RID converter can be used to
                determine the value of ID resistance. To start a ID resistance measurement, the RidConversionStart
                bit is set in the Vendor Rid Conversion register.
                The Link can use one of two methods to determine when the RID Conversion is complete. One method
                is polling the RidConversionStart bit as described in Section 7.1.4.3. The preferred method is to set
                the RidIntEn bit in the Vendor Rid Conversion register. When RidIntEn is set, an RXCMD will be
                generated after the RID conversion is complete. As described in Table 6.3, the alt_int bit of the RXCMD
                will be set.
                After the RID Conversion is complete, the Link can read RidValue from the Vendor Rid Conversion
                register.
6.6             Headset Audio Mode
                This mode is designed to allow a user to view the status of several signals while using an analog audio
                headset with a USB connector. This feature, exclusive to SMSC, is provided as an alternate mode to
                the CarKit Mode defined in Section 6.4. In the CarKit Mode, the Link is unable to view the source of
                the interrupt on ID, except by returning to synchronous mode to read the ULPI registers. This forces
                the audio switches to be deactivated, and may glitch the audio signals. In addition, the Link cannot
                change the resistance on the ID pin without starting up the PHY to access the ULPI registers.
                The Headset Audio Mode is entered by writing to the Headset Audio Mode register, and allows the
                Link access to the state of the VBUS and ID pins during audio without glitching the audio connection.
                The Headset Audio mode also enables the Link to change the resistance on the ID pin and to change
                the audio headset attached from mono to stereo.
                The ULPI interface is redefined as shown in Table 6.8 when Headset Audio Mode is entered.

              Exiting Headset Audio Mode is the same as exiting Low Power Mode as described in Section 6.2.6.2.
              The Link must assert STP to signal the PHY to exit. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR is
              de-asserted and the PHY will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI
              operation. The RESETB pin can also be pulsed low to reset the USB3310 and return it to Synchronous
              Mode.

7.1             ULPI Register Array
                The USB3310 PHY implements all of the ULPI registers detailed in the ULPI revision 1.1 specification.
                The complete USB3310 ULPI register set is shown in Table 7.1. All registers are 8 bits. This table also
                includes the default states of the register upon POR, as described in Section 5.5.2. The RESET bit in
                the Function Control Register does not reset the bits of the ULPI register array. The Link should not
                read or write to any registers not listed in this table.
                The USB3310 supports extended register access. The immediate register set (00-3Fh) can be
                accessed through either an immediate address or an extended register address..

7.1.2           Carkit Control Registers
                The following registers are used to set-up and enable the USB UART functions.

                Address = 19-1Bh (read), 19h (write), 1Ah (set), 1Bh (clear)
                This register is used to program the USB3310 into and out of the carkit modes. When entering the
                carkit UART mode the Link must first set the desired TxdEn and the RxdEn bits and then transition to
                Carkit Mode by setting the CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control Register. When RxdEn is not set
                then the DATA[1] pin is held to a logic high.

Chapter 8 Application Notes
8.1           Application Diagram
              The USB3310 requires few external components as shown in the application diagram. In some
              applications, the power supplied on the VBUS pin of the USB connector is used as the source of
              system power. The USB 2.0 Specification restricts the voltage at the VBUS pin to a maximum value
              of 5.25V. In some applications, it may be required to provide protection to the USB331x VBUS pin and
              VBAT pin if the VBUS voltage exceeds USB 2.0 specifications.
              One method of protecting the VBUS pin from excessive voltage transients is to place a resistor
              (RVBUS) in series as shown in the application diagram. The resistor provides some protection against
              transients that exceed the value of VVMAX provided in Table 3.2. This resistor can be used when the
              USB3310 is powered from a Battery as shown in Figure 5.3 or from a 3.3V Supply as shown in
              Figure 5.4. When RVBUS is installed, the transient must not be allowed to exceed the value of VVBUS
              for longer than 500 μs.
              To protect the VBUS pin against a steady state voltage on the USB connector that exceed the value
              of VVMAX provided in Table 3.2, an Over Voltage Protection (OVP) component could be used in the
              place of RVBUS.
              Following POR or hardware reset, the voltage at CLKOUT must not exceed VIH_ED as provided in
              Table 4.3.

8.2               USB Charger Detection
                  Note: SMSC does not build, specify, design, or sell USB chargers. The following section is provided
                              as a reference to the end user so that they may implement a USB Charger detection method
                              that will work with the chargers selected to work with their end product.
                  The examples below are illustrated for reference only and are not intended to dictate a standard for a
                  USB Charger. The charger and detection method must be chosen to work together.
                  When attached to a USB Host the device is only allowed to draw 100mA until the completion of USB
                  enumeration. The USB3310 includes features that can be used to differentiate between a USB Host
                  and a Charger.
8.2.1             Detecting the ID Resistor in a Charger
                  The ID Resistor Detection feature of the USB3310 described in Section 5.6.1.2 may be used to detect
                  a resistor to ground. Some charger manufacturers use 100kΩ to ground at the ID pin of the USB
                  connector.

8.2.2           Detecting DP Shorted to DM
                USB Chargers and USB Hosts will present 5V nominal onto the Vbus terminal of the USB connector
                at all times. While in synchronous mode, the Link can detect SessVld in the RXCMD byte as shown
                in Table 6.3. In any of the non-synchronous modes, the Link must monitor the interrupt signal on
                DATA[3] as described in Table 6.4. When an interrupt occurs, the Link commands the USB3310 to exit
                Low Power Mode and reads registers to discover what caused the interrupt.
                In preparation for testing if a charger has connected the DP and DM pins in the USB connector, the
                DP and DM pins of the USB3310 must be placed into Non-Driving, FS mode using the Full Speed
                transceivers. This is done by writing 49h to the Function Control register at address 04h. Next, pull-up
                resistors can be enabled on the DP and DM pins. As described in Section 5.8, the pull-up resistors
                may be enabled individually. For example, setting bit 4 in the USB IO & Power Management register
                at address 3Ah will connect the ChargerPullupEnableDP resistor. Likewise, a write to the USB IO &
                Power Management register at address 3Ah with a 20h will connect the ChargerPullupEnableDM
                resistor.
                The linestate signals are monitored to determine whether the DP and DM pins are shorted. While in
                synchronous mode, the Link can monitor Linestate0 and Linestate1 in the RXCMD byte as shown in
                Table 6.3, or by reading the Debug register. In any of the non-synchronous modes, the Link can
                monitor linestate on DATA[0] and DATA[1] as described in Table 6.3. The DC Electrical Characteristics
                of the Single-Ended Receivers used to generate the linestate signals are provided in Table 4.5.

                                 If the linestates show a SE1 the charger has been detected.
                                 If the linestates show an SE0 you are connected to a host.
8.3             Reference Designs
                SMSC has generated reference designs for connecting the USB3310 to SOCs with a ULPI port. Please
                contact the SMSC sales office for more details.
8.4             ESD Performance
                The USB3310 is protected from ESD strikes. By eliminating the requirement for external ESD
                protection devices, board space is conserved, and the board manufacturer is enabled to reduce cost.
                The advanced ESD structures integrated into the USB3310 protect the device whether or not it is
                powered up.
8.4.1           Human Body Model (HBM) Performance
                HBM testing verifies the ability to withstand the ESD strikes like those that occur during handling and
                manufacturing, and is done without power applied to the IC. To pass the test, the device must have
                no change in operation or performance due to the event. All pins on the USB3310 except the REFCLK
                pin provide ±8kV HBM protection, as shown in Table 4.8.

8.4.2         EN/IEC 61000-4-2 Performance
              The EN/IEC 61000-4-2 ESD specification is an international standard that addresses system-level
              immunity to ESD strikes while the end equipment is operational. In contrast, the HBM ESD tests are
              performed at the device level with the device powered down.
              SMSC contracts with Independent laboratories to test the USB3310 to EN/IEC 61000-4-2 in a working
              system. Reports are available upon request. Please contact your SMSC representative, and request
              information on 3rd party ESD test results. The reports show that systems designed with the USB3310
              can safely provide the ESD performance shown in Table 4.8 without additional board level protection.
              In addition to defining the ESD tests, EN/IEC 61000-4-2 also categorizes the impact to equipment
              operation when the strike occurs (ESD Result Classification). The USB3310 maintains an ESD Result
              Classification 1 or 2 when subjected to an EN/IEC 61000-4-2 (level 4) ESD strike.
              Both air discharge and contact discharge test techniques for applying stress conditions are defined by
              the EN/IEC 61000-4-2 ESD document.
8.4.3         Air Discharge
              To perform this test, a charged electrode is moved close to the system being tested until a spark is
              generated. This test is difficult to reproduce because the discharge is influenced by such factors as
              humidity, the speed of approach of the electrode, and construction of the test equipment.
8.4.4         Contact Discharge
              The uncharged electrode first contacts the USB connector to prepare this test, and then the probe tip
              is energized. This yields more repeatable results, and is the preferred test method. The independent
              test laboratories contracted by SMSC provide test results for both types of discharge methods.
