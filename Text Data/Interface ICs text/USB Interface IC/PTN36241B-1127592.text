1. General description
              PTN36241B is a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 redriver IC that enhances signal quality by
              performing receive equalization on the deteriorated input signal followed by transmit
              de-emphasis maximizing system link performance. With its superior differential signal
              conditioning and enhancement capability, the device delivers significant flexibility and
              performance scaling for various systems with different PCB trace and cable channel
              conditions and still benefit from optimum power consumption.
              PTN36241B is a dual-channel device that supports data signaling rate of 5 Gbit/s through
              each channel. PTN36241B has two channels: one channel is facing the USB host, and
              another channel is facing the USB peripheral or device. Each channel consists of a
              high-speed Transmit (Tx) differential lane and a high-speed Receive (Rx) differential lane.
              PTN36241B has independent 5-level configuration pins for each channel to select receive
              equalization, transmit de-emphasis and output swing and these pins can be easily
              configured by board-strapping (for example, short, open, resistor). To support applications
              that require greater level of configurability, PTN36241B delivers intelligent multiplexing of
              I2C-bus interface onto 5-level configuration pins. By default, the device is configured with
              the board-strapped levels of configuration pins. When I2C-bus reads/writes are performed
              over these multiplexed pins, the device decodes I2C transactions and configures its
              internal functions appropriately.
              PTN36241B has built-in advanced power management capability that enables significant
              power savings under various different USB 3.0 Low-power modes (U2/U3). It can detect
              LFPS signaling and link electrical conditions and can dynamically activate/de-activate
              internal circuitry and logic. The device performs these actions without host software
              intervention and conserves power.
              PTN36241B goes through the compliance testing controlled by the internal state machine.
              No compliance pin is required.
              PTN36241B is powered from 3.3 V supply and is available in HVQFN24 4 mm  4 mm
              package with 0.5 mm pitch.

                       The following sections describe the individual block functions and capabilities of the
                       device in more detail.
                   8.1 Receive equalization
                       On the high-speed signal path, the device performs receive equalization providing
                       frequency selective gain based on the configuration pin AEQ (BEQ) setting. Table 4 lists
                       the configuration options available in this device.

                        short to GND                                                               7.5 dB
                        short to VDD(3V3)                                                          9 dB
                        pull-down resistor to GND[1]                                               6 dB

                       [1]   The value of these pull-up and pull-down resistors is 75 k.
                       Refer also to Section 8.4 for I2C-bus interface based configuration options for Rx
                       equalization of channels A and B.
                   8.2 Transmit de-emphasis and output swing
                       The PTN36241B device enhances signal content further by performing de-emphasis on
                       the high-speed signals. In addition, the device can provide flat frequency gain by boosting
                       output signal. Both flat and frequency selective gains prepare the system to cover up for
                       losses further down the link. Table 5 lists de-emphasis and Table 6 lists output swing
                       configuration options of PTN36241B.

                   8.3 Input signal threshold
                       To support various platforms that have different noise levels and still maintain sensitivity,
                       PTN36241B provides configuration option to set input signal threshold. When the signal
                       level falls below the threshold, the outputs are squelched and when signal is above the
                       threshold, redriving function is activated. Table 7 lists the possible input signal threshold
                       configuration options available with this device.

                          [1]  The value of these pull-up and pull-down resistors is 75 k.
                          Please refer also to Section 8.4 for I2C-bus interface based configuration options.
                   8.4 I2C-bus programmability
                          PTN36241B has I2C-bus interface that enables system integrator to program register
                          settings suitable for the application needs. Table 8 describes possible settings for different
                          functions of the device. Although the device can be pin configured through
                          board-strapping, it also allows the system integrator to override the settings by
                          programming the internal registers through I2C.
                          After power-on, the device samples the board-strapped pin values (as I2C is not
                          operational yet) but does not reflect these directly in the register (default) values. So in
                          applications using I2C-bus interface, the system integrator must program the internal
                          registers of the device for proper operation. Further, it is expected that the system
                          integrator performs I2C configuration after power-on and not during normal operation. If
                          such an operation is attempted during normal operation, the device may not behave as
                          specified.

                          PTN36241B supports programming of the internal registers through the I2C-bus interface.
                          Reading/writing the internal registers must be done according to the following protocol.
                          The read protocol contains two phases:
                           • Command phase
                           • Data phase

                              The command phase is an I2C write to PTN36241B that contains a single data byte
                              indicating the internal register address to read out. The data phase is an I2C read
                              operation that contains 4 bytes of data, starting from the least significant byte.
                              The I2C write operation contains only the command phase, which contains 8-bit internal
                              register address, followed by 4 bytes of data to be written to the register, starting from the
                              least significant byte.
                              PTN36241B is able to handle both single-byte and 4-byte write/read commands. 4-byte
                              read/write commands are address aligned with 2 LSBs as ‘0’. Figure 5 illustrates the
                              protocol used on the I2C-bus to read and write registers inside the device.

                       Table 9 shows how the PTN36241B device addresses can be selected by using ADD
                       (I2C-bus device address) pin.

                        pull-up resistor to VDD(3V3)          [1]              0011 110b
                        open                                                   0011 010b
                       [1]   The value of these pull-up and pull-down resistors is 75 k.
                       PTN36241B has built-in I2C access lock mechanism that helps avoid inadvertent
                       writes/reads into the device. After power-up, only register offset 0x40 can be written by the
                       host controller. So before accessing any register (register offset 0x00 to 0x07, 0x41), the
                       host controller is expected to write 0xAE at address 0x40. This would open the I2C lock
                       enabling the host controller to configure the device registers suitably as required for the
                       application.
                   8.5 Device control — mode, enable, power-on initialization
                       PTN36241B has a built-in reset circuitry that generates reset signal after power-on. All the
                       internal registers and state machines are initialized and the registers take default values
                       as defined in Table 8.
                       The CEN enable pin can be toggled asynchronously any time after power-on and the
                       device can be put in Active or Deep power-saving state.
                         • When CEN is HIGH, the device is in Active state and when it is LOW, device is in
                             Deep power-saving state.
                         • The values of the configuration pins (AEQ, ADE, BEQ, BDE, AOS, BOS, SQTH) are
                             sampled on power-on and whenever CEN is toggled asynchronously any time
                             afterwards.
                         • When CEN is toggled LOW to HIGH, the device undergoes an equivalent of power-on
                             reset operation. All registers/state machines are put to power-on condition.
                       The normal functioning of the redriver is not guaranteed when the configuration and/or
                       control pins are being changed. The typical device usage is to set these control and
                       configuration pins to pre-determined levels at power-on and not to change thereafter.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                      PTN36241B

                   8.6 Device states and power management
                       PTN36241B has implemented an advanced power management scheme that operates in
                       tune with USB 3.0 bus electrical condition. Although the device does not decode USB
                       power management commands (related to USB 3.0 U1/U2/U3 transitions) exchanged
                       between USB 3.0 host and peripheral/device, it relies on bus electrical conditions and
                       control pins/register settings to decide to be in one of the following states:
                         • Active state wherein device is fully operational, USB data is transported on
                           channels A and B. In this state, USB connection exists and the Receive Termination
                           indication remains active. But there is no need for Receive Termination detection.
                         • Power-saving state wherein the channels A and B are kept enabled. In this state,
                           squelching, LFPS detection and/or Receive termination detection circuitry are active.
                           Based on USB connection, there are 2 possibilities:
                           – No USB connection:
                              Receive Termination detection circuitry keeps polling periodically.
                              Receive Termination indication is not active.
                           – When USB connection exists, and when the link is in USB 3.0 U2/U3 mode:
                              Receive Termination detection circuitry keeps polling periodically.
                              Receive Termination indication is active.
                         • Deep power-saving or Shutdown state wherein the channel is in
                           Deep power-saving/Shutdown condition enabling significant power saving.
                           – DC common-mode voltage level is not maintained.
                           – Tx and Rx terminations are put to high-impedance condition.
                           – Transitioning to Active state would take several tens of microseconds.
                       Receive termination detection circuitry is implemented as part of a transmitter and
                       detect whether a load device with equivalent DC impedance ZRX_DC is present.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and

                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                         higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 18) than a SnPb process, thus
                         reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                         window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                         heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                         temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
