BM92T30MWV
1     Introduction
    BM92T30 is a full function Type-C USB-PD controller that supports USB Power Delivery using base-band communication. It
    is compatible with USB Type-C specification rev1.1 and USB Power Delivery specification rev2.0
    BM92T30 includes the following functional blocks: Type-C Physical Layer (base-band PHY), BMC encoder / decoder,
    USB-PD Protocol engine, two N-ch MOSFET switch drivers to control two MOSFETS each, OVP FET and SMBus interface
    for communicating with the host controller. It requires an external embedded controller that includes Device Policy Manager
    and GPIOs for Type-C USB-PD operation. BM92T30 is able to operate independently in an AC adapter or in a dead battery
    condition where the embedded controller is not operational. BM92T30 includes an EEPROM, enabling code updates via the
    SPI interface during prototyping phase.
    BM92T30 controller comes in four variations depending on Technical Note for their circuit design. Please refer for additional
    details
    Figure 1-1 shows the block diagram.

     5.5     Power supply management
           5.5.1 Outline
         This LSI has a power selector. It select the lowest power supply voltage from VSVR, VEX, or VB for low power
         consumption. Internal Power Supply (VCCIN) gives priority in order of VSVR, VEX, and VB. VCCIN supplied from the
         power selector is used to LSI main power source. LDOs (for internal only) are supplied from VCCIN, and output each
         internal supply voltage.
         Each power supply input have UVLO (2.8Vtyp) and OVLO (VSVR: 6.4Vtyp, VEX/VB: 6.4/15.0/28.0Vtyp).And POR
         (power on reset) signal is generated from detection of LDO28OK, LDO15DOK, LDO15AOK, and VCCIN.

    [PORT_CONT]
       This block chose the port mode according to the setting from MCU.
       (DFP)
       Variable current source is connected to CC terminal. These currents of each mode are 80μA±20%: Default Current,
       180μA±8%: Medium Current and 330μA±8%: High Current.
       (UFP)
       Pull-down resistor (Rd=5.1kΩ±10%) is connected to CC terminal.
       (DRP)
       Changing DFP and UFP is repeated frequently.
    [CC_DET]
      CC_DET has functions of “Attach / Detach Detection”, “Plug Orientation / Cable Twist Detection”, “Discovery and detect
      extension mode” and “USB Type-C VBUS Current Detection”.
       Attach / Detach is detected with monitoring voltage of CC terminal. When the voltage of CC terminal become under a
       threshold voltage at DFP, attach is detected. Oppositely, when the voltage of CC terminal become over a threshold voltage,
       detach is detected. When the voltage of CC terminal become over a threshold voltage at UFP, attach is detected.

BM92T30MWV
      Plug orientation and cable twist is detected from the relationship of two CC terminals. Because only one wire is connected
      to Rd, the difference between two CC terminals is generated.
      UFP can detect the maximum current of the power source by monitoring the voltage of CC terminal.
      It is possible to detect extension mode because DFP can detect Ra at Attach / Detach detection.
    [UFP_CLAMP]
      1.1V Clamp is used for UFP emulation at dead-battery condition.
    [VBUS_MONI]
      UFP detect Attach / Detach by existence of VBUS voltage. VBUSDET detects Attach when VBUS voltage over the
      threshold voltage. And it detects Detach when VBUS under the threshold voltage.
    [VCONNSW]
      VCONNSW is the power switch for VCONN source. It has OCP (1.3Atyp) function.
    [BB_PHY]
      If Type-C controller supports BBPD, CC terminal can output BBPD communication signal. (Refer to BB_PHY)

9     Operational Notes
(1) Reverse Connection of Power Supply
Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when connecting
the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power supply pins.
(2) Power Supply Lines
Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the digital and
analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog block. Furthermore,
connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value
when using electrolytic capacitors.
(3) Ground Voltage
Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
(4) Ground Wiring Pattern
When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but connected
to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal ground caused by large
currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations on the ground voltage. The ground
lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
(5) Thermal Consideration
Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in deterioration of
the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size and copper area to prevent
exceeding the Pd rating.
(6) Recommended Operating Conditions
These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained. The
electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
(7) Inrush Current
When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power supply.
Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and routing of
connections.
(8) Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
(9) Testing on Application Boards
When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may subject the IC to
stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply should always be turned off
completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection process. To prevent damage from static
discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during transport and storage.

Operational Notes – continued
(10) Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in damaging
the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin. Inter-pin shorts could be
due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and unintentional solder bridge
deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
(11) Unused Input Pins
Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and extremely
low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small charge acquired in this way
is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and cause unexpected operation of the IC. So
unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the power supply or ground line.
(12) Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them isolated. P-N
junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a parasitic diode or transistor.
For example (refer to figure below):
            When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
            When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual interference
among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to operate, such as
applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be avoided.
Figure xx. Example of monolithic IC structure
(13) Ceramic Capacitor
When using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with temperature and
the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
(14) Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe Operation
(ASO).
(15) Over Current Protection Circuit (OCP)
This IC incorporates an integrated overcurrent protection circuit that is activated when the load is shorted. This protection circuit
is effective in preventing damage due to sudden and unexpected incidents. However, the IC should not be used in applications
characterized by continuous operation or transitioning of the protection circuit.
