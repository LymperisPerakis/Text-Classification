                                                Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
General Description
            SMSC’s USB333x is a family of High Speed USB 2.0 Transceivers that provides a physical layer (PHY)
            solution well-suited for portable electronic devices. Both commercial and industrial temperature
            applications are supported.
            Each model in the USB333x family may use a 60MHz reference clock or the model-number specific
            reference clock shown in Order Numbers on page 2. The USB3330 and USB3333 can support several
            different frequencies driven on the REFCLK pin. The configuration of the frequency selection pins set
            the desired reference frequency.
            Several advanced features make the USB333x the transceiver of choice by reducing both eBOM part
            count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness eliminates the need for
            external ESD protection devices in typical applications. The internal Over-Voltage Protection circuit
            (OVP) protects the USB333x from voltages up to 30V on the VBUS pin. By using a reference clock
            from the Link, the USB333x removes the cost of a dedicated crystal reference from the design. The
            USB333x includes integrated 3.3V and 1.8V regulators, making it possible to operate the device from
            a single power supply.
            Versions of the USB333x with the integrated USB switch enable unique product features with a single
            USB port of connection.
            The USB333x is optimized for use in portable applications where a low operating current and standby
            current is essential. The USB333x also supports the Link Power Management protocol (LPM) to further
            reduce USB operating currents.
            The USB333x also includes integrated battery charger detection circuitry. These circuits are used to
            detect the attachment of a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to a USB Charger, a product using
            the USB333x can draw more than 500mA from the USB connector.
            The USB333x meets all of the electrical requirements for a High Speed USB Host, Device, or an On-
            the-Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition to the supporting USB signaling, the USB333x also provides
            USB UART mode and, in versions with the integrated USB switch, USB Audio mode.
            USB333x uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
            Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers between the Link and PHY to
            facilitate a USB session with only twelve pins.
            The USB333x uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
            less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
            latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
            adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.
