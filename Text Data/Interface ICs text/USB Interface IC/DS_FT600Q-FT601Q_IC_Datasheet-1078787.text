4 Function Description
FT60x is a high performance USB 3.0-to-FIFO interface bridge chip. This device can be used in those
applications which require high data throughput such as imaging devices and Multi-Channel FIFO ADC or
DAC devices etc.
The FIFO interface can support multi-voltage I/O (1.8V, 2.5V, 3.3V) and operating frequencies of
66.67MHz or 100MHz. 100MHz only for 2.5V and 3.3V.
There are 2 different proprietary synchronous bus protocols supported; one FIFO bus protocol is called
the “Multi-Channel FIFO” bus protocol and the other is the “245 Synchronous FIFO” bus protocol. The
latter being an extension of the interface introduced in the FT232H/FT2232H devices.
4.1 Key Features and Function Description
Functional Integration
The following features are integral to the IC design: FIFO protocol management, USB 3.0 controller,
USB3.0 and USB2.0 PHYs, GPIOs, power management, clock generation, power-on-reset (POR) and LDO
regulator.
USB 3.0 Protocol Controller
The USB 3.0 Protocol Controller manages the data stream from the device USB control endpoint. It
handles the USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the commands for
controlling the functional parameters of the FIFO in accordance with the USB 3.0 specification.
FIFO Management
This unit is used to manage all PIPE data or buffers in the FIFO memory; the data is sent or received
through the FIFO protocol layer. Through this block the FIFO memory can be allocated to each PIPE with
any size of memory as long as the total memory allocated to all PIPEs does not exceed the maximum
FIFO memory size which is 16KB. Additionally, the FIFO signals have a configurable high drive strength
capability and can be set to 18Ω, 25Ω, 35Ω and 50Ω.
Multi-Channel FIFO Bus protocol
The multi-Channel FIFO bus is a slave bus and is designed to handle Multi-Channel FIFO connectivity. The
bus protocol supports a total of 8 channels (4 INs and 4 OUTs). CLK is the clock output to the FIFO bus
master.
245 Synchronous FIFO Bus protocol
The 245 Synchronous FIFO bus is a slave bus with one IN and one OUT FIFO channel supported by this
bus protocol. CLK is the clock output to the FIFO bus master.
FIFO Bus Clock Option
The device provides the following FIFO bus clock frequency option: 100MHz.
FIFO RX/TX Buffer (16k bytes)
Data sent from the USB host controller to the FIFO via the USB data OUT endpoint is stored in the FIFO
RX (receive) buffer and is removed from the buffer by reading the contents of the FIFO using the RD#
pin. (RX relative to the USB interface).
Data written into the FIFO using the WR pin is stored in the FIFO TX (transmit) Buffer. The USB host
controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for data from the device data
IN endpoint. (TX relative to the USB interface).

                                                                                               Version 1.05

When the FT600 or FT601 is configured as the 245 Synchronous FIFO bus or 1 channel in the multi-
Channel FIFO bus mode, the FIFO buffer is configured as 4 KB * 2 (double buffered) each on the RX and
TX channels.
When the FT600 or FT601 is configured as 2 channels in the multi-Channel FIFO bus mode, the FIFO
buffer is configured as 2 KB * 2 (double buffered) each on RX and TX channel.
When the FT600 or FT601 is configured as 4 channels in the multi-Channel FIFO bus mode, the FIFO
buffer is configured as 1 KB * 2 (double buffered) each on RX and TX channel.
Internal LDO Regulator
The LDO regulator generates the +1.0V power supply for driving the internal core of the device. Not to be
used for external devices.
Reset Generator
The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device internal circuitry at
power up. The RESET_N input pin allows an external device to reset the FT60x. Active low.
Remote Wake Up Function
If USB is in suspend mode, and remote wake up has been enabled, driving the WAKEUP_N pin to low will
cause the FT60x device to request a resume from suspend on the USB bus. Normally this can be used to
wake up the host PC from suspend.
BCD(Battery Charge Detection) Function
Supports Battery Charging spec revision 1.2, it is optional for mapping the GPIO pin to indicate the detect
results. Refer to GPIO for the pin configuration in BCD mode.
GPIO (General purpose input and output) pins
GPOI[1:0] are multifunctional pins. The functions are configured by the chip configuration data. The
default chip configuration sets the GPIO pins as FIFO mode configuration input. At the power up, FT600
or FT601 sets the chip to 245 synchronous FIFO mode or multi-channel FIFO modes depending on the
GPIO[1:0] input, details in the table below:
    GPIO1      GPIO0     Chip mode
    0          0         1 channel, 245 Synchronous FIFO mode
    0          1         1 channel, Multi-Channel FIFO mode
    1          0         2 channel, Multi-Channel FIFO mode
    1          1         4 channel, Multi-Channel FIFO mode
To enable the GPIO function, the chip configuration must be updated to set the GPIO function.
To enable the BCD mode, the chip configuration must be updated to set the BCD mode.
When the FT600 or FT601 is configured to support BCD, the GPIO pins are set to output, output changes
according to BCD detection result.
    GPIO1      GPIO0     Chip mode
    0          0         No USB connection or BCD detection on going.
    0          1         SDP(standard downstream port) detected
    1          0         CDP(Charging downstream port) detected
    1          1         DCP(Dedicated charging port) detected

4.2 Multi-Channel FIFO Mode Protocols
This is a Slave bus and is designed to handle multi-channel connectivity. The bus protocol supports a
total of 4 bidirectional channels; each has 1 USB OUT and 1 USB IN endpoints. . CLK is the clock output
from the bus slave to the bus master.
The channel number denoted in this document as channel 1 to 3 mapped to USB endpoint number 2 to 5.
The USB OUT endpoint in Channel 1 is denoted as USB out channel 1, USB IN endpoint in channel 1 is
denoted as USB IN channel 1.
Correspondingly, the FIFO OUT is for data transmitted from USB host to device and FIFO IN is for data
transmitted from USB device to host.
WR_N is the bus master to bus slave data transaction request signal, and it is active low.
RXF_N is the bus slave to bus master data receive acknowledge signal, and it is active low.
TXE_N (optional signal, master can ignore this signal) is the bus slave to bus master FIFO idle status
valid signal, and it is low active.
DATA[31:0] is used as the 32-bit data bus during the data transfer phase. When the bus is in the idle
state DATA[31:16], DATA[7:0] and BE[3:0] are driven to logic”1” by the bus master, and DATA[15:8] is
driven by the bus slave to provide the FIFO status to the bus master. The upper nibble (DATA[15:12])
provides the 4 OUT channels FIFO status while the lower nibble (DATA[11:8]) provides the 4 IN channels
FIFO status. They are all active low.
For example, at idle, DATA[12] is logic”0” and DATA[8] is logic”0”, which indicates USB OUT channel 1
FIFO data is available to send and USB IN channel 1 FIFO space is empty to receive data respectively.
The external bus master will start a transfer cycle by asserting WR_N based on the channel FIFO status.
The first cycle after WR_N is asserted is the command phase, followed by the data phase when RXF_N is
asserted. At the command phase, the bus master will send the channel number which it intends to
transfer data with on DATA[7:0] and the Read/Write command on BE[3:0]. BE[3:0] = ‘h0 and BE[3:0] =
‘h1 indicates a master read or write respectively. There may also be a required turn-a-round for
DATA[31:0] and BE[3:0] after the command phase and at the end of data transaction. BE[1:0] is valid
for FT600 2 byte wide data interface.
Table 4.1 shows Multi-Channel FIFO mode command phase master read/write and channel address
setting.

⃰In Multi-channel FIFO mode master read operation, the bus master shall be able to read out the
 maximum possible data in the RX FIFO in one read transaction, i.e. when the FT600 or FT601 is
 configured in the 1 channel Multi-channel FIFO mode, the bus master shall be able to read out 4 KB in
 one bus transaction, and 2 KB or 1 KB in respect to the 2 channel or 4 channel mode. In write operation,
 if the bus master expects the data to be transferred over USB bus in the maximum possible packet length,
 it should write the data to the FIFO in a single bus transaction.

Case #1: If the bus master completes a 4KB write in one transaction then this data will be transferred
onto the USB bus in 4 full sized packets.
Case #2: If the bus master completes a 1KB write in one transaction then this data will be transferred
onto the USB bus in a single packet (1 packet).
Case #3: If the bus master completes a 1025 byte write in one transaction then this data will be
transferred onto the USB bus in one full sized packet with length of 1024 bytes (1KB) + one short sized
packet with a length of 1 byte.
The waveform below shows a FT601 master write transaction for 14 bytes at channel 1 with the bus
master terminating the transaction. There are turn-a-round cycles for DATA[15:8] after the command
phase and at the end of the data transaction. The BE[3:0] shows that the lower 2 bytes in D3 are valid at
the last word strobe in this transaction.

NOTE: There is no turnaround phase for BE pins as these remain inputs when the FIFO is being written
to by the master.
The waveform below shows a FT601 master write transaction where the FIFO at channel 1 uses all data
space first, the RXF_N reasserts when the FIFO data space is not available after D3. There are turn-a-
round cycles for DATA[15:8] after the command phase and at the end of the data transaction. The
BE[3:0] shows that the transaction is all in word aligned, all 4 bytes in D3 are valid at the last word
strobe in this transaction.

This FT601 and FT600 slave FIFO bus uses one IN and one OUT FIFO channel while in this mode.
CLK is the clock output to the bus master; it can be configured as 66 MHz or 100 MHz
TXE_N is an output signal, Transmit FIFO Empty. It is active low and when active it indicates the
Transmit FIFO has space and it is ready to receive data from the FIFO master.
RXF_N is an output signal, Receive FIFO Full. It is active low and when active it indicates the Receive
FIFO has data and it is ready to be read by the FIFO master.
OE_N is an input signal, Output Enable. It is active low and when it is driven low by the bus master, the
slave will drive the data and byte enable buses.
WR_N is an input signal, Write Enable. It is active low and when it is driven low by the bus master, the
master has write cycle access.
RD_N is an input signal, Read Enable. It is active low and when it is driven low by the bus master, the
master has read cycle access.
BE[3:0](BE[1:0] for FT600) is byte enable signal. In bus master read operation, the FT60X asserts the
signal for the valid bytes in a word strobe. In bus master write operation, the bus master assets the
signal for the valid bytes in a word strobe. Normally, all 4 bytes should be valid in a bus transaction
except in the last word strobe when the data transaction length not aligned at word boundary.

6 USB Power Configurations
The following sections illustrate possible USB power configurations for the FT60x. The illustrations have
omitted pin numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT600Q and FT601Q
package options.
All USB power configurations illustrated apply to both package options for the FT60x devices. Please refer
to Section 3 for the package option pin-out and signal descriptions.
6.1 USB Bus-Powered Configuration
Note: The reference designs here are for USB 3.0 Standard B or Micro-B connectors.

Figure 6.1 & 6.2 illustrate the FT60x in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus
powered device gets its power from the USB bus via an external LDO stepping the voltage down to
+3.3V.

                                                                   FT600Q-FT601Q IC Datasheet
                                                                                             Version 1.05

A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT60x and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application.
6.2 Self-Powered Configuration
                                 Figure 6.3 Self-Powered Configuration
Figure 6.3 illustrates the FT60x in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply, VCC33 and VCCIO, and does not draw current from the USB
bus. The basic rules for USB self-powered devices are as follows –
    i)   A self-powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub
         controller is powered down.
    ii) A self-powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB
         suspend as it has its own power supply.
    iii) A self-powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-powered
         USB hub.

7 Application Example
The following sections illustrate possible applications of the FT60x. The illustrations have omitted pin
numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT600Q and FT601Q package
options.

8 Package Parameters
The FT60x is available in two different packages based on the FIFO bus interface. The FT600Q is the QFN-
56 package 16-bit FIFO bus interface and the FT601Q is the QFN-76 package 32-bit FIFO interface.
8.1 QFN-56 Package Mechanical Dimensions
                               Figure 8.1 QFN-56 Package Dimensions
The FT600Q is supplied in a RoHS compliant 56 pin QFN package. The package is lead (Pb) free and uses
a ‘green’ compound. The package is fully compliant with European Union directive 2002/95/EC.
This package is nominally 7.0mm x 7.0 mm body and the pins are on a 0.4 mm pitch. The above
mechanical drawing shows the QFN-56 package. All dimensions are in millimetres. The centre pad on the
base of the FT600Q is internally connected to GND; the PCB should connect to ground and not have

8.3 QFN-76 Package Mechanical Dimensions
                              Figure 8.3 QFN-76 Package Dimensions
The FT601Q is supplied in a RoHS compliant leadless QFN-76 package. The package is lead ( Pb ) free,
and uses a ‘green’ compound. The package is fully compliant with European Union directive 2002/95/EC.
This package is nominally 9.0mm x 9.0mm body. The solder pads are on a 0.40mm pitch. The above
mechanical drawing shows the QFN-76 package.
The centre pad on the base of the FT601Q is internally connected to GND, the PCB should connect to
ground and not have signal tracking on the same layer as chip in this area.
