CY7C65211A can be configured as USB to UART interface. This                                         Configuration utility. Figure 8 shows timing diagram of this GPIO.
UART interface operates at TTL level and it can be converted to
RS485 interface using a GPIO and any half duplex RS485                                              RS485 is a multi-drop network – i.e. many devices can
transceiver IC (to convert TTL level to RS485 level) as shown in                                    communicate with each other over a single two wire cable
Figure 7. This GPIO (TXDEN) enables or disables the                                                 connection. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each
transmission of data through RS485 transceiver IC based on                                          end of the cable.

In a battery charger system, a 9-V spike on the VBUS is possible. The CY7C65211 VBUS pin is intolerant to voltage above 6 V. In
the absence of over-voltage protection (OVP) on the VBUS line, the VBUS should be connected to BUSDETECT (GPIO configured)
using the resistive network and the output of the battery charger to the VBUS pin of CY7C65211, as shown in Figure 10.

When the VBUS and VDDD are at the same voltage potential,                  When the VBUS > VDDD, a resistor voltage divider is required
the VBUS can be connected to the GPIO using a series resistor              to reduce the voltage from the VBUS down to VDDD for the GPIO
(Rs). This is shown in the following figure. If there is a charger         sensing the VBUS voltage. This is shown in the following figure.
