USB3503
1.0        GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The USB3503 is a low-power, USB 2.0 hub controller with HSIC upstream connectivity and three USB 2.0 downtream
ports. The USB3503 operates as a hi-speed hub and supports low-speed, full-speed, and hi-speed downstream devices
on all of the enabled downstream ports.
The USB3503 has been specifically optimized for mobile embedded applications. The pin-count has been reduced by
optimizing the USB3503 for mobile battery-powered embedded systems where power consumption, small package
size, and minimal BOM are critical design requirements. Standby mode power has been minimized. Instead of a dedi-
cated crystal, reference clock inputs are aligned to mobile applications. Flexible integrated power regulators ease inte-
gration into battery powered devices. All required resistors on the USB ports are integrated into the hub. This includes
all series termination resistors on D+ and D– pins and all required pull-down resistors on D+ and D– pins.
The USB3503 includes programmable features such as:
MultiTRAKTM Technology, which utilizes a dedicated Transaction Translator (TT) per port to maintain consistent full-
speed data throughput regardless of the number of active downstream connections. MultiTRAKTM outperforms conven-
tional USB 2.0 hubs with a single TT in USB full-speed data transfers.
PortMap, which provides flexible port mapping and disable sequences. The downstream ports of a USB3503 hub can
be reordered or disabled in any sequence to support multiple platform designs with minimum effort. For any port that is
disabled, the USB3503 hub controllers automatically reorder the remaining ports to match the USB host controller’s port
numbering scheme.
PortSwap, which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows direct alignment
of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors to avoid uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differential signals on the
PCB.
PHYBoost, which provides programmable levels of Hi-Speed USB signal drive
strength in the downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore USB sig-
nal integrity in a compromised system environment. The graphic on the right shows
an example of Hi-Speed USB eye diagrams before and after PHYBoost signal integ-
rity restoration.
VariSense, which controls the USB receiver sensitivity enabling programmable lev-
els of USB signal receive sensitivity. This capability allows operation in a sub-optimal
system environment, such as when a captive USB cable is used.
1.1        Customer Selectable Features
A default configuration is available in the USB3503 following a reset. This configuration may be sufficient for most appli-
cations. The USB3503 hub may also be configured by an external microcontroller. When using the microcontroller inter-
face, the hub appears as an I2C slave device.
The USB3503 hub supports customer selectable features including:
•  Optional customer configuration via I2C.
•  Supports compound devices on a port-by-port basis.
•  Customizable vendor ID, product ID, and device ID.
•  Configurable downstream port power-on time reported to the host.
•  Supports indication of the maximum current that the hub consumes from the USB upstream port.
•  Supports Indication of the maximum current required for the hub controller.
•  Configurable as a either a Self-Powered or Bus-Powered Hub
•  Supports custom string descriptors (up to 30 characters):
   - Product string
   - Manufacturer string
   - Serial number string
• When available, I2C configurable options for default configuration may include:
   - Downstream ports as non-removable ports
   - Downstream ports as disabled ports
   - USB signal drive strength
   - USB receiver sensitivity
   - USB differential pair pin location

3.3        Pin Descriptions
This section provides a detailed description of each signal. The signals are arranged in functional groups according to
their associated interface.
The terms assertion and negation are used. This is done to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of “active low”
and “active high” signal. The term “assert”, or “assertion” indicates that a signal is active, independent of whether that
level is represented by a high or low voltage. The term “negate”, or “negation” indicates that a signal is inactive.

3.3.3       REFERENCE CLOCK
The REFCLK input is can be driven with a square wave from 0 V to VDD33_BYP. The USB3503 only uses the positive
edge of the clock. The duty cycle is not critical.
The USB3503 is tolerant to jitter on the reference clock. The REFCLK jitter should be limited to a peak to peak jitter of
less than 1 ns over a 10 s time interval. If this level of jitter is exceeded the USB3503 high speed eye diagram may be
degraded.
To select the REFCLK input frequency, the REF_SEL pins must be set according to Table 3-3 and Table 3-4. To select
the primary REFCLK frequencies defined in Table 3-3, INT_N must be sampled high during the Hub.Init stage. If the
INT_N pin is not used, the INT_N pin should be tied to VDD33_BYP. To select the secondary REFCLK frequencies
defined in Table 3-4, INT_N must be sampled low during the Hub.Init stage. If the INT_N pin is not used, the INT_N pin
should be tied to ground. Since the INT_N pin is open-drain during normal function, selecting the secondary REFCLK
frequencies requires that the INT_N pin be driven low from an external source during Hub.Init and then, after startup,
that external source must turn into an input to receive the INT_N signal.

3.3.4       INTERRUPT
The general interrupt pin (INT_N) is intended to communicate a condition change within the hub. The conditions that
may cause an interrupt are captured within a register mapped to the serial port (Register E8h: Serial Port Interrupt Status
- INT_STATUS). The conditions that cause the interrupt to assert can be controlled through use of an interrupt mask
register (Register E9h: Serial Port Interrupt Mask - INT_MASK).
The general interrupt and all interrupt conditions are functionally latched and event driven. Once the interrupt or any of
the conditions have asserted, the status bit will remain asserted until the SOC negates the bit using the serial port. The
bits will then remain negated until a new event condition occurs. The latching nature of the register causes the status to
remain even if the condition that caused the interrupt ceases to be active. The event driven nature of the register causes
the interrupt to only occur when a new event occurs- when a condition is removed and then is applied again.
The function of the interrupt and the associated status and masking registers are illustrated in Figure 3-3. Registers &
Register bits shown in the figure are defined in Table 5-2, “Serial Interface Registers,” on page 19.

Figure 3-3 also shows an alternate configuration option (CFGP.INTSUSP) for a suspend interrupt. This option allows
the user to change the behavior of the INT_N pin to become a direct level indication of configuration and suspend status.
When selected, the INT_N indicates that the entire hub has entered the USB suspend state.
  Note:      Because INT_N is driven low when active, care must be taken when selecting the external pullup resistor
             value for this open drain output. A sufficiently large resistor must be selected to insure suspend current
             requirements can be satisfied for the system.

4.1       Operational Mode Flowchart
The flowchart in Figure 4-1 shows the modes of operation. It also shows how the USB3503 traverses through the Hub
mode stages (shown in bold.) The flow of control is dictated by control register bits shown in Italics as well as other
events such as availability of reference clock. Refer to Section 5.3, "Serial Interface Register Definitions," on page 21
for the detailed definition of the control register bits. In this specification register bits are referenced using the syntax
<Register>.<RegisterBit>. A summary of all registers can be found in Table 5-2, “Serial Interface Registers,” on
page 19.
The remaining sections in this chapter provide more detail on each stage and mode of operation.

4.2         Standby Mode
Standby Mode provides a very low power state for maximum power efficiency when no signaling is required. This is the
lowest power state. In Standby Mode all internal regulators are powered off, the PLL is not running, and core logic is
powered down in order to reduce power. Because core logic is powered off, no configuration settings are retained in this
mode and must be re-initialized after RESET_N is negated high.
4.2.1          EXTERNAL HARDWARE RESET_N
A valid hardware reset is defined as an assertion of RESET_N low for a minimum of 100us after all power supplies are
within operating range. While reset is asserted, the Hub (and its associated external circuitry) enters STANDBY MODE
and consumes extremely low current as defined in Table 10-5 and Table 10-6.
Assertion of RESET_N (external pin) causes the following:
•   All downstream ports are disabled.
•   All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
•   All internal registers return to the default state.
•   The PLL is halted.
After RESET_N is negated high in the Hub.Init stage, the Hub reads customer-specific data from the ROM.
4.3         Hub Mode
Hub Mode provides functions of configuration and high speed USB hub operation including connection and communi-
cation. Upon entering Hub Mode and initializing internal logic, the device passes through several sequential stages
based on a fixed time interval.
4.3.1          HUB INITIALIZATION STAGE (HUB.INIT)
The first stage is the initialization stage and occurs when Hub mode is entered based on the conditions in Table 4-1. In
this stage the 1.2V regulator is enabled and stabilizes, internal logic is reset, and the PLL locks if a valid REFCLK is
supplied. Configuration registers are initialized to their default state and REF_SEL[1:0] input values are latched. The
USB3503 will complete initialization and automatically enter the next stage after Thubinit. Because the digital logic within
the device is not yet stable, no communication with the device using the serial port is possible. Configuration registers
are initialized to their default state.
4.3.2          HUB WAIT REFCLK STAGE (HUB.WAITREF)
During this stage the serial port is not functional.
If the reference clock is provided before entering hub mode, the USB3503 will transition to the Hub Configuration stage
without pausing in the Hub Wait RefClk stage. Otherwise, the USB3503 will transition to the Hub configuration stage
once a valid reference clock is supplied and the PLL has locked.
4.3.3          HUB CONFIGURATION STAGE (HUB.CONFIG)
In this stage, the SOC has an opportunity to control the configuration of the USB3503 and modify any of the default
configuration settings specified in the integrated ROM. These settings include USB device descriptors, port electrical
settings such as PHY BOOST, and control features. The SOC implements the changes using the serial slave port inter-
face to write configuration & control registers.
See Section 5.3.29, "Register E7h: Serial Port Interlock Control - SP_ILOCK," on page 29 for definition of SP_ILOCK
register and how it controls progress through hub stages. If the SP_ILOCK.config_n bit has its default asserted low and
the bit is not written by the serial port, then the USB3503 completes configuration without any I2C intervention.
If the SP_ILOCK.config_n bit has its default negated high or the SOC negates the bit high using the serial port during
Thubconfig, the USB3503 will remain in the Hub Configuration Stage indefinitely. This will allow the SOC to update other
configuration and control registers without any remaining time-out restrictions. Once the SP_ILOCK.config_n bit is
asserted low by the SOC the device will transition to the next stage.

USB3503
4.3.4        HUB CONNECT STAGE (HUB.CONNECT)
Next, the USB3503 enters the Hub Connect Stage. See Section 5.3.32, "Register EEh: Configure Portable Hub - CFGP,"
on page 31 and Section 5.3.29, "Register E7h: Serial Port Interlock Control - SP_ILOCK," on page 29 for definition of
control registers which affect how the device transitions through the hub stages.
By using the appropriate controls, the USB3503 can be set to immediately transition, or instead to remain in the Hub
Connect Stage indefinitely until one of the SOC handshake events occur. When set to wait on the handshake, the SOC
may read or update any of the serial port registers. Once the SOC finishes accessing registers and is ready for USB
communication to start, it can perform one of the selected handshakes which that cause the USB3503 to connect within
Thubconnect and transition to the Hub Communication Stage.
4.3.5        HUB COMMUNICATION STAGE (HUB.COM)
Once it exits the Hub Connect Stage, the USB3503 enters Hub Communication Stage. In this stage full USB operation
is supported under control of the USB Host on the upstream port. The USB3503 will remain in the Hub Communication
Stage until the operating mode is changed by the system asserting RESET_N low.
While in the Hub Communication Stage, communication over the serial port is no longer supported and the resulting
behavior of the serial port if accessed is undefined. In order to re-enable the serial port interface, the device must exit
Hub Communication Stage. Exiting this stage is only possible by entering Standby mode.

5.0       CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
5.1       Hub Configuration Options
The Hub supports a number of features (some are mutually exclusive), and must be configured in order to correctly func-
tion when attached to a USB host controller. There are two principal ways to configure the hub: by writing to configuration
registers using the serial slave port, or by internal default settings. Any configuration registers which are not written by
the serial slave retain their default settings.
5.1.1        MULTI/SINGLE TT
The USB 2.0 Hub is fully specification compliant to the Universal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0 April 27,2000
(12/7/2000 and 5/28/2002 Errata). Please reference Chapter 11 (Hub Specification) for general details regarding Hub
operation and functionality.
For performance reasons, the Hub provides 1 Transaction Translator (TT) per port (defined as Multi-TT configuration),
and each TT has 1512 bytes of periodic buffer space and 272 Bytes of non- periodic buffer space (divided into 4 non-
periodic buffers per TT), for a total of 1784 bytes of buffer space for each Transaction Translator.
When configured as a Single-TT Hub (required by USB 2.0 Specification), the Single Transaction Translator will have
1512 bytes of periodic buffer space and 272 bytes of non-periodic buffer space (divided into 4 non-periodic buffers per
TT), for a total of 1784 bytes of buffer space for the entire Transaction Translator. Each Transaction Translator’s buf-
fer is divided as shown in Table 5-1, "Transaction Translator Buffer Chart".

5.2        Default Serial Interface Register Memory Map
The Serial Interface Registers are used to customize the USB3503 for specific applications. Reserved registers or
reserved bits within a defined register should not be written to non-default values or undefined behavior may result.

         0           config_n  If the SOC intends to update the default configuration using the serial port, this
                               register should be the first register updated by the SOC. In this way the timing
                               dependency between configuration and device operation can be minimized- the
                               SOC is only required to write to Serial Port Interlock Register within Thubconfig
                               and not all the registers it is attempting to configure.
                               Once all registers have been written for the desired configuration, the SOC
                               must clear this bit to ‘0’ for the device to resume normal operation using the
                               new configuration.
                               It may be desirable for the device to initiate autonomous operation with no SOC
                               intervention at all. This is why the default setting is to allow the device to initiate
                               automatic operation if the SOC does not intervene by writing the interlock
                               register within the allotted configuration timeout.
                               1 = Device will remain in Hub Mode.Configuration Stage indefinitely, and allow
                               SOC to write through the serial port to set any desired configuration.
                               0 = Device will transition out of Hub.Configuration Stage immediately after this
                               bit is asserted low through a serial port write. (A default low assertion results in
                               transition after a timeout.)

USB3503
6.0        SERIAL SLAVE INTERFACE
6.1        Overview
The serial slave interface on USB3503 is implemented as I2C. It is a standard I2C slave interface that operates at the
standard (100Kbps), fast (400Kbps), and the fast mode plus (1Mbps) modes.
The USB3503 I2C slave interface address is 0x08h.
REFCLK must be running for I2C to operate. The register map is outlined in section Section 5.3.
The I2C Slave Base Address is 0x08. The interrupt pin INT_N is used to communicate status changes on selected
events that are mapped into the Serial Port Interrupt Status Register. INT_N is asserted low whenever an unmasked bit
is set in the Serial Port Interrupt Status Register. SOC must update the Serial Port Interrupt Status Register to negate
the interrupt high.
The SOC can mask events to not cause the interrupt pin to transition by updating the Serial Port Interrupt Mask Register.
The status events will still be captured in the status register even if the interrupt pin is not asserted. The serial port has
limited speed and latency capability so events mapped into the serial ports and its interrupt are not expected to be
latency critical.

   Note 6-1       The largest pullup values which meet the customer application should be selected in order to
                  minimize power consumption. Pullup values must also have low enough resistance to support the
                  desired i2 C operating speed with the expected total capacitance in the application. Typical
                  applications are expected to use pullup values between 220Ω and 2.7kΩ for operation at 1MHz on
                  SCL and SDA. Larger pullup resistors may be acceptable for operation at 400KHz or 100KHz.

6.3          I2C Message format
6.3.1               SEQUENTIAL ACCESS WRITES
The I2C interface will support sequential writing of the register address space of the USB3503. This mode is useful for
configuring contiguous blocks of registers. Please see section on SOC interface for address definitions. Figure 6-2
shows the format of the sequential write operation. Where color is visible in the figure, blue indicates signaling from the
I2C master, and gray indicates signaling from the USB3503 slave:

                                                                 Register               Data value for                                  Data value for
                                                                 Address                   XXXXXX                                       XXXXXX + y

In this operation, following the 7-bit slave address, an 8-bit register address is written indicating the start address for
sequential write operation. Every data access after that is a data write to a data register where the register address incre-
ments after each access and ACK from the slave must occur. Sequential write access is terminated by a Stop condition.
6.3.2               SEQUENTIAL ACCESS READS
The   I2C   interface will support direct reading of the USB3503 registers. In order to read one or more register addresses,
the starting address must be set by using a write sequence followed by a read. The read register interface supports
auto-increment mode. The master should send a NACK instead of an ACK when the last byte has been transferred.
In this operation, following the 7-bit slave address, 8-bit register address is written indicating the start address for
sequential read operation to be followed. In the read sequence, every data access is a data read from a data register
where the register address increments after each access. Write sequence can end with optional Stop (P). If so the Read
sequence must start with a Start (S) otherwise it must start with Repeated Start (Sr).
Figure 6-3 shows the format of the read operation. Where color is visible in the figure, blue and gold indicate signaling
from the I2C master, and gray indicates signaling from the USB3503 slave.

7.0       USB DESCRIPTORS
A customer can indirectly affect which descriptors are reported via one of two methods. The two methods are: Internal
Default ROM Configuration, or direct load through the serial port interface.
The Hub will not electrically attach to the USB until after it has loaded valid data for all user- defined descriptor fields
(either through Internal Default ROM, or serial port).
7.1       USB Bus Reset
In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the Hub, the Hub does the following:
   Note 7-1      The Hub does not propagate the upstream USB reset to downstream devices.
•  Sets default address to 0.
•  Sets configuration to: Unconfigured.
•  Negates PRTPWR[3:1] register for all downstream ports.
•  Clears all TT buffers.
•  Moves device from suspended to active (if suspended).
•  Complies with Section 11.10 of the USB 2.0 Specification for behavior after completion of the reset sequence.
The Host then configures the Hub and the Hub's downstream port devices in accordance with the USB Specification.
7.2       Hub Attached as a High-Speed Device (Customer-Configured for Single-TT Support
          Only)
The following tables provide descriptor information for Customer-Configured Single-TT-Only Hubs attached for use with
High-Speed devices.

USB3503
8.0        BATTERY CHARGING
8.1        Downstream Port Battery Charging Support
The USB3503 can configure any of the downstream ports to support battery charger handshake.
The Hub’s role in downstream battery charging is to provide an acknowledge to a device’s query as to if the hub system
supports USB battery charging. The hub silicon does not provide any current or power FETs or any such thing to actually
charge the device. Those components would need to be provided as external components in the final Hub board design.

If the final Hub board design provides an external supply capable of supplying current per the battery charging specifi-
cation, the hub can be configured to indicate the presence of such a supply to the device. This indication is on a per/port
basis. i.e. the board can configure two ports to support battery charging (thru high current power FET’s) and leave the
other port as a standard USB port.
8.1.1         USB BATTERY CHARGING
In the terminology of the USB battery charging specification, if the port is configured to support battery charging, the
downstream port is a “Charging Host Port”. All AC/DC characteristics will comply with only this type. If the port is not
configured to support battery charging, the port is a “Standard Host Port”. AC/DC characteristics comply with the USB
2.0 specification.
A downstream port will only behave as a “Charging Host Port” or a “Standard Host Port”. The port will not switch between
“Charging Host Port” or Standard Host Port” at any time after initial power-up and configuration.
8.1.2         SPECIAL BEHAVIOR OF PRTPWR REGISTER
The USB Battery charging specification does not address system issues. It only defines a low level protocol for a device
and host (or hub) to communicate a simple question and optional answer.
Device queries if the host to which it is connected supports battery charging.
The host will respond that it does support battery charging or does not respond at all. There is no negative response.
(A lack of response is taken as a negative response)
When ports are configured for downstream battery charging, the corresponding PRTPWR setting will be controlled by
downstream battery charging logic instead of the normal hub logic.
PRTPWR setting will assert after initial hub customer configuration (Internal default/Serial register writes). PRTPWR will
remain asserted and under the control of the battery charge logic until one of two events.
1.    An overcurrent is detected on the corresponding OCS_N pin. In this case, PRTPWR setting will negate. The only
      way to re-enable the PRTPWR setting from this state is to RESET the USB3503.
2.    The hub enters Hub.Communication stage, connects on its upstream port and is enumerated by a USB host. In
      this case, control over the PRTPWR setting reverts back to the hub logic inside the USB3503 and the normal
      USB behavior applies. In this case, the host must enable PRTPWR.
Since the enumeration process for a hub sets the PORT_POWER feature for all downstream ports, this information can
be used to switch control over the PRTPWR setting between the battery charge logic and the hub logic.
• When the Hub PORT_POWER feature is ‘1’, the hub logic controls the PRTPWR setting.
• When the Hub PORT_POWER feature is ‘0’, the battery charging logic controls the PRTPWR setting.

No matter which controller is controlling the PRTPWR setting, an overcurrent event will always negate PRTPWR setting.
8.1.3        BATTERY CHARGING CONFIGURATION
Configuration of ports to support battery charging is done through serial port configuration load.
Register D0: Downstream Battery Charging Enable - BC_EN is allocated for Battery Charging support. The register,
starting from Bit 1, enables Battery charging for each down stream port when asserted. Bit 1 represents port 1 and so
on. Each port with battery charging enabled asserts the corresponding PRTPWR register bit.

USB3503
9.0       INTEGRATED POWER REGULATORS
9.1       Overview
The integrated power regulators are designed to provide significant flexibility to the system in providing power to the
USB3503. Several different configurations are allowed in order to align the USB3503 power structure to the supplies
available in the system.
9.1.1        3.3V REGULATOR
The USB3503 has an integrated regulator to convert from VBAT to 3.3V.
9.1.2        1.2V REGULATOR
The USB3503 has an integrated regulator to convert from a variable voltage input on VDD_CORE_REG to 1.2V. The
1.2V regulator shall be tolerant to the presence of low voltage (~0V) on the VDD_CORE_REG pin in order to support
system power solutions where a 1.8V supply is not always present in low power states.
The 1.2V regulator shall support an input voltage range consistent with a 1.8V input in order to reduce power consump-
tion in systems which provide multiple power supply levels. In addition the 1.2V regulator shall support an input voltage
up to 3.3V for systems which provide only a single power supply. The device will support operation where the 3.3V reg-
ulator output can drive the 1.2V regulator input such that VBAT is the only required supply.
9.2       Power Configurations
The USB3503 support operation with no back current when power is connected in each of the following configurations.
9.2.1        SINGLE SUPPLY CONFIGURATIONS
9.2.1.1        VBAT Only
bit VBAT should be tied to the VBAT system supply. VDD33_BYP regulator output and VDD_CORE_REG should be
tied together on the board. In this configuration the 3.3V regulator will be active, and the 3.3V to 1.2V regulator will be
active.
9.2.1.2        3.3V Only
VBAT should be tied to the 3.3V system supply. VDD33_BYP and VDD_CORE_REG pins should be tied together on
the board. In this configuration, the 3.3V regulator will operate in dropout. The 1.2V regulator will be active.
9.2.2        DOUBLE SUPPLY CONFIGURATIONS
9.2.2.1        VBAT + 1.8V
VBAT should be tied to the VBAT system supply. VDD33_BYP regulator output requires external capacitor.
VDD_CORE_REG should be tied to the 1.8V system supply. In this configuration, the 3.3V regulator and the 1.2V reg-
ulator will be active.
9.2.2.2        3.3V + 1.8V
VBAT should be tied to the 3.3V system supply. VDD33_BYP should be connected to the 3.3V external capacitor.
VDD_CORE_REG should be tied to the 1.8v system supply. In this configuration the 3.3V regulator will operate in drop-
out. The 1.2V regulator will be active.
9.3       Regulator Control Signals
The regulators are controlled by RESET_N. When RESET_N is brought high the VDD33 regulator will turn on. When
RESET_N is brought low the VDD33 regulator will turn off.

   Note 1: Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the
            device. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
        2: This is a stress rating only and functional operation of the device at any other condition above those indi-
            cated in the operation sections of this specification is not implied.
        3: When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the Absolute Max-
            imum Ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage spikes on
            their outputs when the AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the AC power line
            may appear on the DC output. When this possibility exists, it is suggested that a clamp circuit be used.

10.10 ESD Performance
The USB3503 is protected from ESD strikes. By eliminating the requirement for external ESD protection devices, board
space is conserved, and the board manufacturer is enabled to reduce cost. The advanced ESD structures integrated
into the USB3503 protect the device whether or not it is powered up.
10.10.1        HUMAN BODY MODEL (HBM) PERFORMANCE
HBM testing verifies the ability to withstand the ESD strikes like those that occur during handling and manufacturing,
and is done without power applied to the IC. To pass the test, the device must have no change in operation or perfor-
mance due to the event. All pins on the USB3503 provide ±5 kV HBM protection, as shown in Table 10-12.
10.10.2        EN 61000-4-2 PERFORMANCE
The EN 61000-4-2 ESD specification is an international standard that addresses system-level immunity to ESD strikes
while the end equipment is operational. In contrast, the HBM ESD tests are performed at the device level with the device
powered down.
Microchip contracts with Independent laboratories to test the USB3503 to EN 61000-4-2 in a working system. Reports
are available upon request. Please contact your representative, and request information on 3rd party ESD test results.
The reports show that systems designed with the USB3503 can safely provide the ESD performance without additional
board level protection.
In addition to defining the ESD tests, EN 61000-4-2 also categorizes the impact to equipment operation when the strike
occurs (ESD Result Classification). Both air discharge and contact discharge test techniques for applying stress condi-
tions are defined by the EN 61000-4-2 ESD document.
10.10.3        AIR DISCHARGE
To perform this test, a charged electrode is moved close to the system being tested until a spark is generated. This test
is difficult to reproduce because the discharge is influenced by such factors as humidity, the speed of approach of the
electrode, and construction of the test equipment.
10.10.4        CONTACT DISCHARGE
The uncharged electrode first contacts the pin to prepare this test, and then the probe tip is energized. This yields more
repeatable results, and is the preferred test method. The independent test laboratories contracted by Microchip provide
test results for both types of discharge methods.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
•      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO

OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of Micro-
chip devices in life support and/or safety applications is entirely at the buyer’s risk, and the buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
