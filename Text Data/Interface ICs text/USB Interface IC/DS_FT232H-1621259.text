1.1 Driver Support
The FT232H requires USB device drivers (listed below), available free from http://www.ftdichip.com, to
operate. The VCP version of the driver creates a Virtual COM Port allowing legacy serial port applications
to operate over USB e.g. serial emulator application TTY. Another FTDI USB driver, the D2XX driver, can
also be used with application software to directly access the FT232H through a DLL.

1.3 USB Compliant
The FT232H is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 specification and has been given the USB-IF Test-ID
(TID) 40770005.
The timing of the rise/fall time of the USB signals is not only dependant on the USB signal drivers, it is
also dependant system and is affected by factors such as PCB layout, external components and any
transient protection present on the USB signals. For USB compliance these may require a slight
adjustment. This timing can be modified through a programmable setting stored in the same external
EEPROM that is used for the USB descriptors. Timing can also be changed by adding appropriate passive
components to the USB signals.

3.2 FT232H Pin Descriptions
This section describes the operation of the FT232H pins. Both the LQFP and the QFN packages have the
same function on each pin. The function of many pins is determined by the configuration of the FT232H.
The following table details the function of each pin dependent on the configuration of the interface. Each
of the functions is described in the following table (Note: The convention used throughout this document
for active low signals is the signal name followed by #).

Pins marked ** default to tri-stated inputs with an internal 75KΩ (approx.) pull up resistor to VCCIO.
Pin marked *** default to GPIO line with an internal 75KΩ pull down resistor to GND. Using the EEPROM
this pin can be enabled USBVCC mode instead of GPIO mode.

Notes:
When used in Input Mode, the input pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 75kΩ (approx.) resistors. These
pins can be programmed to gently pull low during USB suspend (PWREN# = “1”) by setting an option in
the EEPROM.
3.4 ACBUS Signal Option
If the external EEPROM is fitted, the following options can be configured on the CBUS I/O pins using the
software utility FT_PROG which can be downloaded from the FTDI utilities page. CBUS signal options are
common to both package versions of the FT232H. The default configuration is described in section 7.

     Signal
    Option
     TXDEN        ACBUS0, ACBUS1, ACBUS2,        TXDEN = (TTL level). Used with RS485 level converters
                  ACBUS3, ACBUS4, ACBUS5,        to enable the line driver during data transmit. TXDEN is
                   ACBUS6, ACBUS8, ACBUS9        active from one bit time before the start bit is
                                                 transmitted on TXD until the end of the stop bit.
   *PWREN#        ACBUS0, ACBUS1, ACBUS2,        Output is low after the device has been configured by
                  ACBUS3, ACBUS4, ACBUS5,        USB, then high during USB suspend mode. This output
                   ACBUS6, ACBUS8, ACBUS9        can be used to control power to external logic P-Channel
                                                 logic level MOSFET switch. Enable the interface pull-down
                                                 option when using the PWREN# in this way.*
    TXLED#        ACBUS0, ACBUS1, ACBUS2,        TXLED = Transmit signalling output. Pulses low when
                  ACBUS3, ACBUS4, ACBUS5,        transmitting data (TXD) to the external device. This can
                   ACBUS6, ACBUS8, ACBUS9        be connected to an LED.
    RXLED#        ACBUS0, ACBUS1, ACBUS2,        RXLED = Receive signalling output. Pulses low when
                  ACBUS3, ACBUS4, ACBUS5,        receiving data (RXD) from the external device. This can
                   ACBUS6, ACBUS8, ACBUS9        be connected to an LED.
 TX&RXLED#        ACBUS0, ACBUS1, ACBUS2,        LED drive – pulses low when transmitting or receiving
                  ACBUS3, ACBUS4, ACBUS5,        data from or to the external device.

Note: UART is the device default mode.
3.5.2        FT232H Pins used in an FT245 Synchronous FIFO Interface
The FT232H can be configured as a FT245 synchronous FIFO interface. When configured in this mode, the
pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in Table 3.7. To set this mode the external
EEPROM must be set to 245 modes. A software command (FT_SetBitMode) is then sent by the application
to the FTDI D2XX driver to tell the chip to enter 245 synchronous FIFO mode. In this mode, data is
written or read on the rising edge of the CLKOUT. Refer to Figure 4.4 for timing details.

                                                      When high, do not read data from the FIFO. When
                                                      low, there is data available in the FIFO which can be

                                                      and RD# are both low. Note that the OE# pin must
                                                      be driven low at least 1 clock period before asserting
                                                      RD# low.
                                                      When high, do not write data into the FIFO. When
                                                      low, data can be written into the FIFO by driving

                                                        buffer each CLKOUT cycle until RD# goes high.
                                                        Enables the data byte on the D0...D7 pins to be
                                                        written into the transmit FIFO buffer when WR# is
             27                  WR#          INPUT     low. The next FIFO data byte is written to the
                                                        transmit FIFO buffer each CLKOUT cycle until WR#
                                                        goes high.
                                                        The Send Immediate / WakeUp signal combines two
                                                        functions on a single pin. If USB is in suspend mode

                                                        EEPROM, strobing this pin low will cause the device
                                                        to request a resume on the USB Bus. Normally, this
                                                        can be used to wake up the Host PC.

                                                        During normal operation (PWREN# = 0), if this pin is
                                                        strobed low any data in the device RX buffer will be

                                                        This can be used to optimize USB transfer speed for
                                                        some applications. Tie this pin to VCCIO if not used.

3.5.5        FT232H Pins used in an MPSSE
The FT232H has a Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine (MPSSE). This mode is enabled by sending a
software command (FT_SetBitMode) to the FTDI D2xx driver. The MPSSE can be configured to a number
of industry standard serial interface protocols such as JTAG, I2C or SPI (MASTER), or it can be used to
implement a proprietary bus protocol. For example, it is possible to connect FT232H’s to an SRAM
configurable FPGA such as supplied by Altera or Xilinx. The FPGA device would normally not be configured
(i.e. have no defined function) at power-up. Application software on the PC could use the MPSSE (and
D2XX driver) to download configuration data to the FPGA over USB. This data would define the hardware
function on power up. The MPSSE can be used to control a number of GPIO pins. When configured in this
mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the signals are shown in Table 3.10

The FT232H can be configured for use with high-speed bi-directional isolated serial data. A proprietary
FTDI protocol designed to allow galvanic isolated devices to communicate synchronously with the FT232H
using just 4 signal wires (over two dual opto-isolators), and two power lines. The peripheral circuitry
controls the data transfer rate in both directions, whilst maintaining full data integrity. 12 Mbps (USB full
speed) data rates can be achieved when using the proper high speed opto-isolators (see App Note AN-

4 Function Description
The FT232H USB 2.0 Hi-Speed (480Mb/s) to UART/FIFO is an FTDI’s 6th generation of ICs. It can be
configured in a variety of industry standard serial or parallel interfaces, such as UART, FIFO, JTAG, SPI
(MASTER) or I2C modes. In addition to these, the FT232H introduces the FT1248 interface and supports a
CPU-Style FIFO mode, bit-bang and a fast serial interface mode.
4.1 Key Features
USB Hi-Speed to UART/FIFO Interface. The FT232H provides USB 2.0 Hi-Speed (480Mbits/s) to
flexible and configurable UART/FIFO Interfaces.
Functional Integration. The FT232H integrates a USB protocol engine which controls the physical
Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) and handles all aspects of the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed
interface. The FT232H includes an integrated +1.8V/3.3V Low Drop-Out (LDO) regulator. It also includes
1Kbytes Tx and Rx data buffers. The FT232H integrates the entire USB protocol on a chip with no
firmware required.
MPSSE. Multi- Protocol Synchronous Serial Engines (MPSSE), capable of speeds up to 30 Mbits/s,
provides flexible synchronous interface configurations.
FT1248 interface. The FT232H supports a new proprietary half-duplex FT1248 interface with a variable
bi-directional data bus interface that can be configured as 1, 2, 4, or 8-bits wide and this enables the
flexibility to expand the size of the data bus to 8 pins. For details regarding 2-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit modes,
please refer to application note AN_167_FT1248_Serial_Parallel Interface Basics available from the FTDI

Data Transfer rate. The FT232H supports a data transfer rate up to 12 Mbaud when configured as an
RS232/RS422/RS485 UART interface up to 40 Mbytes/second over a synchronous 245 parallel FIFO
interface or up to 8 Mbyte/Sec over an asynchronous 245 FIFO interface. Please note the FT232H does
not support the baud rates of 7 Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10 Mbaud and 11 Mbaud.
Latency Timer. A feature of the driver used as a timeout to transmit short packets of data back to the
PC. The default is 16ms, but it can be altered between 0ms and 255ms.
Bus (ACBUS) functionality, signal inversion and drive strength selection. There are 11
configurable ACBUS I/O pins. These configurable options are:
     1.   TXDEN – transmit enable for RS485 designs.
     2.   PWREN# - Power control for high power, bus powered designs.
     3.   TXLED# - for pulsing an LED upon transmission of data.
     4.   RXLED# - for pulsing an LED upon receiving data.
     5.   TX&RXLED# - which will pulse an LED upon transmission OR reception of data.
     6.   SLEEP# - indicates that the device going into USB suspend mode.
     7.   CLK30 / CLK15 / CLK7.5 – 30MHz, 15MHz and 7.5MHz clock output signal options.
     8.   TriSt-PU – Input pulled up, not used
     9.   DRIVE 1 – Output driving high
     10.  DRIVE 0 – Output driving low
     11.  I/O mode – ACBUS Bit Bang
The ACBUS pins can also be individually configured as GPIO pins, similar to asynchronous bit bang mode.
It is possible to use this mode while the UART interface is being used, thus providing up to 4 general
purpose I/O pins which are available during normal operation.
The ACBUS lines can be configured with any one of these input/output options by setting bits in the
external EEPROM see section 0.

4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
Multi-Purpose UART/FIFO Controllers. The FT232H has one independent UART/FIFO Controller. This
controls the UART data, 245 FIFO data, Fast Serial (opto isolation) or Bit-Bang mode which can be
selected by SETUP (FT_SetBitMode) command. Each Multi-Purpose UART/FIFO Controller also contains
an MPSSE (Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine). Using this MPSSE, the Multi-Purpose UART/FIFO
Controller can be configured under software command, to have one of the MPSSE (SPI (MASTER), I2C,
and JTAG).
USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control. The USB Protocol Engine controls and manages the interface
between the UTMI PHY and the FIFOs of the chip. It also handles power management and the USB
protocol specification.
Port FIFO TX Buffer (1Kbytes). Data from the Host PC is stored in these buffers to be used by the
Multi-purpose UART/FIFO controllers. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control
block.
Port FIFO RX Buffer (1Kbytes). Data from the Multi-purpose UART/FIFO controllers is stored in these
blocks to be sent back to the Host PC when requested. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and
FIFO control block.
RESET Generator – The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT232H.
RESET# should be tied to VCCIO (+3.3V) if not being used.
Baud Rate Generators – The Baud Rate Generators provides an x16 or an x10 clock input to the
UART’s from a 120MHz reference clock and consists of a 14 bit pre-scaler and 4 register bits which
provide fine tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction). This determines the
Baud Rate of the UART which is programmable from 183 baud to 12 Mbaud. See FTDI application note
AN_120 on the FTDI website for more details.
EEPROM Interface. If the external EEPROM is fitted, the FT232H can be configured as an asynchronous
serial UART (default mode), parallel FIFO (245) mode, FT1248, fast serial (opto isolation) or CPU-Style
FIFO. The EEPROM should be a 16 bit wide configuration such as a 93LC56B or equivalent capable of a
1Mbit/s clock rate at VCCIO = +2.97V to 3.63V. The EEPROM is programmable in-circuit over USB using
a utility program called FT_Prog available from FTDI web site. Please note that the 93LC46B is not
compatible with the FT232H device.
+1.8/3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3/+1.8V LDO regulator generates +1.8 volts for the core and the
USB transceiver cell and +3.3V for the IO and the internal PLL and USB PHY power supply.
UTMI PHY. The Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) physical interface cell. This block
handles the Full speed / Hi-Speed SERDES (serialise – deserialise) function for the USB TX/RX data. It
also provides the clocks for the rest of the chip. A 12 MHz crystal must be connected to the OSCI and
OSCO pins or 12 MHz Oscillator must be connected to the OSCI, and the OSCO is left unconnected. A 12K
Ohm resistor should be connected between REF and GND on the PCB.
The UTMI PHY functions include:
        Supports 480 Mbit/s “Hi-Speed” (HS)/ 12 Mbit/s “Full Speed” (FS).
        SYNC/EOP generation and checking
        Data and clock recovery from serial stream on the USB.
        Bit-stuffing/unstuffing; bit stuff error detection.
        Manages USB Resume, Wake Up and Suspend functions.
        Single parallel data clock output with on-chip PLL to generate higher speed serial data clocks.

4.3 FT232 UART Interface Mode Description
The FT232H can be configured as a UART with external line drivers, similar to operation with the FTDI
FT232R devices. The following examples illustrate how to configure the FT232H with an RS232, RS422 or
RS485 interface.
4.3.1        RS232 Configuration
Figure 4.1 illustrates how the FT232H can be configured with an RS232 UART interface.

                                                                 Document No.: FT_000288 Clearance No.: FTDI #199
4.3.2        RS422 Configuration
Figure 4.2 illustrates how the FT232H can be configured as a RS422 interface.
                                 Figure 4.2 Dual RS422 Configuration
In this case the FT232H is configured as UART operating at TTL levels and a level converter device (full
duplex RS485 transceiver) is used to convert the TTL level signals from the FT232H to RS422 levels. The
PWREN# signal is used to power down the level shifters such that they operate in a low quiescent current
when the USB interface is in suspend mode.

4.3.3        RS485 Configuration
Figure 4.3 illustrates how the FT232H can be configured as a RS485 interface.
                                 Figure 4.3 Dual RS485 Configuration
In this case the FT232H is configured as a UART operating at TTL levels and a level converter device (half
duplex RS485 transceiver) is used to convert the TTL level signals from the FT232H to RS485 levels. With
RS485, the transmitter is only enabled when a character is being transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN
pin on the FT232H is provided for exactly that purpose, and so the transmitter enables are wired to the
TXDEN. RS485 is a multi-drop network – i.e. many devices can communicate with each other over a
single two wire cable connection. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable.
Links are provided to allow the cable to be terminated if the device is physically positioned at either end
of the cable.

4.4 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Interface Mode Description
When FT232H is configured in an FT245 Synchronous FIFO interface mode the IO timing of the signals
used are shown in Figure 4.4 which shows details for read and write accesses. The timings are shown in
Figure 4.4.Note that only a read or a write cycle can be performed at any one time. Data is read or
written on the rising edge of the CLKOUT clock.

                     Table 4.1 FT245 Synchronous FIFO Interface Signal Timings
This mode uses a synchronous interface to get high data transfer speeds. The chip drives a 60 MHz
CLKOUT clock for the external system to use.
Note that Asynchronous FIFO mode must be selected in the EEPROM before selecting the Synchronous
FIFO mode in software.
4.4.1        FT245 Synchronous FIFO Read Operation
A read operation is started when the chip drives RXF# low. The external system can then drive OE# low
to turn the data bus drivers around before acknowledging the data with the RD# signal going low. The
first data byte is on the bus after OE# is low. The external system can burst the data out of the chip by
keeping RD# low or it can insert wait states in the RD# signal. If there is more data to be read it will
change on the clock following RD# sampled low. Once all the data has been consumed, the chip will drive
RXF# high. Any data that appears on the data bus, after RXF# is high, is invalid and should be ignored.
4.4.2        FT245 Synchronous FIFO Write Operation
A write operation can be started when TXE# is low. WR# is brought low when the data is valid. A burst
operation can be done on every clock providing TXE# is still low. The external system must monitor TXE#
and its own WR# to check that data has been accepted. Both TXE# and WR# must be low for data to be
accepted.

4.5 FT245 Style Asynchronous FIFO Interface Mode Description
The FT232H can be configured as an asynchronous FIFO interface. This mode is similar to the
synchronous FIFO interface with the exception that the data is written to or read from the FIFO on the
falling edge of the WR# or RD# signals.
This mode does not provide a CLKOUT signal and it does not expect an OE# input signal. The following
diagrams illustrate the asynchronous FIFO mode timing.

high performance interface between the FT232H as a FT1248 slave and an external FT1248 master. The
FT1248 protocol is a dynamic bi-directional data bus interface that can be configured as 1, 2, 4, or 8-bits
wide.

In the FT1248 there are 3 distinct phases:
While SS_n is inactive, the FT1248 reflects the status of the write buffer and read buffers on the
MIOSIO[0] and MISO wires respectively. Additionally, the FT1248 slave block supports multiple slave
devices where a master can communicate with multiple FT1248 slave devices. When the slave is sharing
buses with other FT1248 slave devices, the write and read buffer status cannot be reflected on the
MIOSIO[0] and MISO wires during SS_n inactivity as this would cause bus contention. Therefore, it is
possible for the user to select whether they wish to have the buffer status switched on or off during
inactivity. When SS_n is active a command/bus size phase occurs first. Following the command phase is
the data phase, for each data byte transferred the FT1248 slave drives an ACK/NAK status onto the MISO
wire. The master can send multiple data bytes so long as SS_n is active, if a unsuccessful data transfer
occurs, i.e. a NAK happens on the MISO wire then the master should immediately abort the transfer by
de-asserting SS_n.

4.6.1        Bus Width Protocol Decode
In order for the FT1248 master to determine the bus width within the command phase the bus width is
encoded along with the actual commands on the first active clock edge when SS_n is active and has a
data width of 8-bits.
If any of the MIOSIO [7:4] signals are low then the data transfer width equals 8-bits.
If any of the MIOSIO [3:2] signals are low then the data transfer width equals 4-bits.
If MIOSIO [1] signal is low then the data transfer width equals 2-bits.
Else the bus width is defaulted to 1-bit.
Please note that if both of the MIOSIO bit signals are low then the data transfer width is equal to the
width of high priority MIOSIO bit signal. For example if both of the MIOSIO [7:3] signals are low then
the data transfer width equals 8-bits or if both of the MIOSIO [3:1] signals are low then the data transfer
width equals 4-bits.
In order to successfully decode the bus width, all MIOSIO signals must have pull up resistors. By default,
all MIOSIO signals shall be seen by the FT232H in FT1248 mode as logic ‘1’. This means that when a
FT1248 master does not wish to use certain MIOSIO signals the slave (FT232H) is still capable of
determining the requested bus width since any unused MIOSIO signals shall be pull up in the slave.
The remaining bits used during the command phase are used to contain the command itself which means
that it is possible to define up to 16 unique commands.

When SS_n is inactive the write buffer and read buffer status is reflected on the MIOSIO[0] and MISO
signals respectively. When the master wishes to initiate a data transfer, SS_n becomes active. As soon as
SS_n becomes active the SPI slave immediately stops driving the MIOSIO[0] signal and SPI master is not
allowed to begin driving the MIOSIO[0] signal until the first clock edge, this ensures that bus contention
is avoided.
On the first clock edge the command is shifted out for 7 clocks, on the 8 th clock cycle a bus turnaround is
required. The bus turnaround is required as the slave may be required to drive the MIOSIO[0] bus with
read data. The data phase occurs in response to the command and so long as SS_n remains active. The
data phase in 1-bit mode requires 8 clock cycles where the MIOSIO[0] signal transfers the requested
write or read data. The MISO signal indicates to the master the success of the transfer with an ACK or
NAK.
The status is reflected through the whole of the data phase and is valid from the first clock edge. If the
master is writing data to the slave, then on the last clock edge before it de-asserts SS_n must tristate
the MIOSIO[0] signal to enable the bus to be “turned” around as when SS_n becomes inactive the
FT1248 slave shall begin to drive the write buffer status onto the MIOSIO[0] signal. When the SPI slave
is driving the MIOSIO[0] (the master is reading data) no bus turnaround is required as when SS_n
becomes inactive it is required to drive the write buffer status to the FT1248 master.
4.7 Synchronous and Asynchronous Bit-Bang Interface Mode
The FT232H can be configured as a bit-bang interface. There are two types of bit-bang modes:
synchronous and asynchronous.
See application note AN2232-02 Bit Mode Functions for the FT232 for more details and examples of using
both Synchronous and Asynchronous bit-bang modes.
4.7.1        Asynchronous Bit-Bang Mode
Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode is the same as BM-style Bit-Bang mode, except that the internal RD# and
WR# strobes (RDSTB# and WRSTB#) are now brought out of the device to allow external logic to be
clocked by accesses to the bit-bang IO bus.
Any data written to the device in the normal manner will be self-clocked onto the data pins (those which
have been configured as outputs). Each pin can be independently set as an input or an output. The rate
that the data is clocked out at is controlled by the baud rate generator.
New data must be written, and the baud rate clock should tick to change the data. If no new data is
written to the chip, the pins configured for output will hold the last value written.
Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode is enabled using the FT_SetBitMode D2xx driver command with a hex value
of 0x01.
4.7.2        Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode
The synchronous Bit-Bang mode will only update the output parallel port pins whenever data is sent from
the USB interface to the parallel interface. When this is done, the WRSTB# will activate to indicate that
the data has been read from the USB Rx FIFO buffer and written out on the pins. Data can only be
received from the parallel pins (to the USB Tx FIFO interface) after the parallel interface has been written
to.
With Synchronous Bit-Bang mode data will only be sent out by the FT232H if there is space in the
FT232H USB TXFIFO for data to be read from the parallel interface pins. This Synchronous Bit-Bang mode
will read the data bus parallel I/O pins first, before it transmits data from the USB RxFIFO. It is therefore
1 byte behind the output, and so to read the inputs for the byte that you have just sent, another byte
must be sent.
For example:

Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode differs from Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode in that the device parallel output
is only read when the parallel output is written to by the USB interface. This makes it easier for the
controlling program to measure the response to a USB output stimulus as the data returned to the USB
interface is synchronous to the output data.
Synchronous Bit-Bang mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command with a hex value of
0x04.
An example of the synchronous bit-bang mode timing is shown in Figure 4.12

RDSTB# = this output rising edge indicates when data has been read from the I/O pins and sent to the
Host PC (via the USB interface).
The WRSTB# goes active in t5. The WRSTB# goes active when data is read from the USB RXFIFO (i.e.
sent from the PC). The RDSTB# goes inactive when data is sampled from the pins and written to the USB
TXFIFO (i.e. sent to the PC). The SETUP command to the FT232H is used to setup the bit-mode. This
command also contains a byte wide data mask to set the direction of each bit. The direction on each pin
doesn’t change unless a new SETUP command is used to modify the direction.
The WRSTB# and RDSTB# strobes are only a guide to what may be happening depending on the
direction of the bus. For example if all pins are configured as inputs, it is still necessary to write to these

4.8 MPSSE Interface Mode Description
MPSSE Mode is designed to allow the FT232H to interface efficiently with synchronous serial protocols
such as JTAG, I2C and SPI (MASTER) Bus. It can also be used to program SRAM based FPGA’s over USB.
The MPSSE interface is designed to be flexible so that it can be configured to allow any synchronous
serial protocol (industry standard or proprietary) to be implemented using the FT232H.
MPSSE is fully configurable, and is programmed by sending commands down the data stream. These can
be sent individually or more efficiently in packets. MPSSE is capable of a maximum sustained data rate of
30 Mbits/s.
When the FT232H is configured in MPSSE mode, the IO timing and signals used are shown in Figure 4.14
and Table 4.4 These show timings for CLKOUT=30MHz. CLKOUT can be divided internally to be provide a
slower clock.

MPSSE mode is enabled using the FT_SetBitMode D2xx driver command with a hex value of 0x02. A hex
value of 0x00 will reset the device. See application note AN135 – MPSSE Basics for more details and
examples.
The MPSSE command set is fully described in application note AN108 – Command Processor For MPSSE
and MCU Host Bus Emulation Modes.
4.8.1        MPSSE Adaptive Clocking
The Adaptive Clock mode correlates the CLK signal with a return clock RTCK. This is a technique used by
ARM® processors.
The FT232H will assert the TCK line and wait for the RTCK to be returned from the target device to
GPIOL3 line before changing the TDO (data out line).

4.9 Fast Serial Interface Mode Description
Fast Serial Interface Mode provides a method of communicating with an external device over USB using 4
wires that can have opto-isolators in their path, thus providing galvanic isolation between systems. Fast
serial mode is enabled by setting the appropriate bits in the external EEPROM. The fast serial mode can
be held in reset by setting a bit value of 0x10 using the FT_SetBitMode D2XX driver command. While this
bit is set the device is held reset – data can be sent to the device, but it will not be sent out by the device
until the device is enabled again. This is done by sending a bit value of 0x00 using the Set Bit Mode
command.
When the FT232H is configured in Fast Serial Interface mode the IO timing of the signals used are shown
in Figure 4.17 and the timings are shown in Table 4.5 Fast Serial Interface Signal Timings.

4.9.1         Outgoing Fast Serial Data
To send fast serial data out of the FT232H, the external device must drive the FSCLK clock. If the FT232H
has data ready to send, it will drive FSDO output low to indicate the start bit. It will not do this if it is
currently receiving data from the external device. This is illustrated in Figure 4.18.

Notes:
    1.   The first bit output (Start bit) is always 0.
    2.   FSDO is always sent LSB first.
    3.   The last serial bit output is the source bit (SRCE) is always 0.
    4.   If the target device is unable to accept the data when it detects the START bit, it should stop the
         FSCLK until it can accept the data.
4.9.2         Incoming Fast Serial Data
An external device is allowed to send data into the FT232H if FSCTS is high. On receipt of a zero START
bit on FSDI, the FT232H will drop FSCTS on the next positive clock edge. The data from bits 0 to 7 are
then clocked in (LSB first). The last bit (DEST) determines where the data will be written to. This bit is
always 0 with the FT232H. This is illustrated in Figure 4.19.

    1. The first bit input (Start bit) is always 0.
    2. FSDI is always received LSB first.
    3. The last received serial bit is the destination bit (DEST) is always 0.
    4. The target device should ensure that FSCTS is high before it sends data. FSCTS goes low after
         data bit 0 (D0) and stays low until the chip can accept more data.

4.9.3        Fast Serial Data Interface Example
Figure 4.20 shows example of two Agilent HCPL-2430 (see the semiconductor section at
www.avagotech.com) Hi-Speed opto-couplers used to optically isolate an external device which interfaced
to USB using the FT232H. In this example VCC5V is the USB VBUS supply and VCCE is the supply to the
external device.
Care must be taken with the voltage used to power the photo-LED. It must be the same voltage as that
which the FT232H I/Os are driving to, or the LED’s may be permanently on. Limiting resistors should be
fitted in the lines that drive the diodes. The outputs of the opto-couplers are open-collector and require a
pull-up resistor.

4.10 CPU-style FIFO Interface Mode Description
CPU-style FIFO interface mode is designed to allow a CPU to interface to USB via the FT232H. This mode
is enabled in the external EEPROM. The interface is achieved using a chip select bit (CS#) and address bit
(A0). When the FT232H is in CPU-style Interface mode, the IO signal lines are configured as given in
Table 4.6. This mode uses a combination of CS# and A0 to determine the operation to be carried out.
The following Truth-Table 4.7 gives the decode values for particular operations.

4.11 RS232 UART Mode LDE Interface Description
When configured in UART mode the FT232H has two IO pins dedicated to controlling LED status
indicators, one for transmitted data the other for received data. When data is being transmitted or
received the respective pins drive from tristate to low in order to provide indication on the LED’s of data
transfer. A digital one-shot timer is used so that even a small percentage of data transfer is visible to the
end user.
                                Figure 4.23 Dual LED UART Configuration
Figure 4.23 shows a configuration using two individual LED’s – one for transmitted data the other for
received data.

In Figure 4.24 transmit and receive LED indicators are wire-OR’ed together to give a single LED indicator
which indicates any transmit or receive data activity.
Note that the LED’s are connected to the same supply as VCCIO.
4.12 Send Immediate/Wake Up (SIWU#)
The SIWU# pin is available in the FIFO modes and in bit bang mode.
The Send Immediate portion is used to flush data from the chip back to the PC. This can be used to force
short packets of data back to the PC without waiting for the latency timer to expire.
To avoid overrunning, this mechanism should only be used when a process of sending data to the chip
has been stopped.
The data transfer is flagged to the USB host by the falling edge of the SIWU# signal. The USB host will
schedule the data transfer on the next USB packet.

When the pin is being used for a Wake Up function to wake up a sleeping PC a 20ms negative pulse on
this pin is required. When the pin is used to immediately flush the buffer (Send Immediate) a 250ns
negative pulse on this pin is required.

Notes:
1. When using remote wake-up, ensure the resistors are pulled-up in suspend. Also ensure peripheral
designs do not allow any current sink paths that may partially power the peripheral.
2. If remote wake-up is enabled, a peripheral is allowed to draw up to 2.5mA in suspend. If remote
wake-up is disabled, the peripheral must draw no more than 500uA in suspend.
3. If a Pull-down is enabled, the FT232H will not wake up from suspend when using SIWU#
4. In UART mode the RI# pin acts as the wake up pin.
4.13 FT232H Mode Selection
The FT232H defaults to asynchronous serial interface (UART) mode of operation.
After a reset the required mode is determined by the contents of the external EEPROM which can be
programmed using FT_Prog.
The EEPROM contents determine if the FT232H device is configured as FT232 asynchronous serial
interface, FT245 FIFO interface, CPU-style FIFO interface, FT1248 or Fast Serial Interface.
Following a reset, the EEPROM is read and the FT232H configured for the selected mode. After device
enumeration, the FT_SetBitMode command (refer to D2XX_Programmers_Guide) can be sent to the
USB driver to switch the selected interface into other modes – asynchronous bit-bang, synchronous bit-
bang or MPSSE – if required.
When in FT245 FIFO mode, the FT_SetBitMode command can be used to select Synchronous FIFO
(FT_SetBitMode = 0x40). Note that FT245 FIFO mode must be configured in the EEPROM before
selecting the Synchronous FIFO mode.
The drive strength selection, slew rate and Schmitt input function can also be configured in the EEPROM.
The MPSSE can be configured directly using the D2XX commands. The D2XX_Programmers_Guide is
available from the FTDI website. The application note AN_108 – Command Processor for MPSSE and MCU
Host Bus Emulation Modes gives further explanation and examples for the MPSSE.

6 FT232H Configurations
The following section illustrates possible USB power configurations for the FT232H.
All USB power configurations illustrated apply to both package options for the FT232H device.
6.1 USB Bus Powered Configuration
Bus Powered Application example 1: Bus powered configuration running on +5V.
                           Figure 6.1 Bus Powered Configuration Example 1
Figure 6.1 illustrates the FT232H in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the VBUS (+5V) which is connected to VREGIN. In this application, the
VREGIN is the +5V input to the on chip +3.3V/1.8V regulator. The output of the on chip LDO regulator
(+1.8V) drives pin 38, (VCORE), and pin 37, (VCCA).
The output of the on chip LDO regulator (3.3V) supplies 3.3V to the VCCIOs, VPLL and VPHY through pin
39, VCCD. Please note that when the FT232H running on +5V (VREGIN), the VCCD becomes an output.
Note:
        1. In this application, pin 40 (VREGIN) is the +5V input to the on chip +3.3V/1.8V regulator.
             Since the VREGIN is +5.0V, pin 39 (VCCD) becomes 3V3 output and supplies 3.3V to the
             VCCIOs, VPLL and VPHY.
        2. The output of the on chip LDO +3.3V/1.8V regulator (+1.8V) drives pin 38, the FT232H core
             supply (VCORE) and pin 37, the VCCA.

6.2 USB Self Powered Configuration
6.2.1        Self-Powered Application Example 1
Self-powered configuration running on 5V.
                           Figure 6.2 Self-Powered Configuration Example 1
Figure 6.2 illustrates the FT232H in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own external power supply which is connected to VREGIN. In this application the
VREGIN is the +5V input to the on chip +3.3V/1.8V regulator. The output of the on chip LDO regulator
(+1.8V) drives pin 38, VCORE and pin 37, VCCA. The output of the on chip LDO regulator (3.3V) supplies
3.3V to the VCCIOs, VPLL and VPHY through VCCD.
Please note that when the FT232H running on +5V (VREGIN), the VCCD becomes an output.
Note that in this set-up, the EEPROM should be configured for self-powered operation and the option
“suspend on ACBUS7 low” is enabled in FT_Prog. This configuration uses the ACBUS7 pin, when this
function is enabled ACBUS7 should not be used as a GPIO in MPSSE mode.

6.2.2        Self-Powered Application Example 2
Self-powered configuration running on 3.3V.
                          Figure 6.3 Self-Powered Configuration Example 2
Figure 6.3 illustrates the FT232H in a typical USB self-powered configuration similar to Figure 6.2. The
difference here is that the VREGIN is connected to the external 3V3 LDO regulator output which supplies
3.3V to the VCCIOs, VCCD, VPLL and VPHY. Please note that when the FT232H running on +3V3
(VREGIN), the VCCD becomes an input. In this application the VREGIN is the +3V3 input to the on
chip+3.3V/1.8V regulator. The output of the on chip LDO regulator (+1.8V) drives pin 38, VCORE and pin
37, VCCA.
Note that in this set-up, the EEPROM should be configured for self-powered operation and the option
“suspend on ACBUS7 low” selected in FT_Prog. This configuration uses the ACBUS7 pin, when this
function is enabled ACBUS7 should not be used as a GPIO in MPSSE mode.

6.3 Oscillator Configuration
                      Figure 6.4 Recommended FT232H Oscillator Configuration
Figure 6.4 illustrates how to connect the FT232H with a 12MHz ± 0.003% crystal. In this case loading
capacitors should to be added between OSCI, OSCO and GND as shown. A value of 27pF is shown as the
capacitor in the example – this will be good for many crystals but it is recommended to select the loading
capacitor value based on the manufacturer’s recommendations wherever possible. It is recommended to
use a fundamental mode, parallel cut type crystal.
It is also possible to use a 12 MHz Oscillator with the FT232H. In this case the output of the oscillator
would drive OSCI, and OSCO should be left unconnected. The oscillator must have a CMOS output drive
capability.

7 EEPROM Configuration
7.1 EEPROM Interface
The FT232H uses configuration data from an external EEPROM. The EEPROM must be 16 bits wide
(93LC56B) and powered from the same net as the core supply of +2.97 to +3.63 volts. Adding an
external (93LC56B) EEPROM allows the chip to be configured as a serial UART (RS232 mode), parallel
FIFO (245) mode, FT1248, fast serial (opto isolation) or CPU-Style FIFO.
                                      Figure 7.1 EEPROM Interface
The external EEPROM can also be used to customise the USB VID, PID, Serial Number, Product
Description Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT232H for OEM applications. Other parameters
controlled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down on Power-Off and I/O pin drive
strength.
If the FT232H is used without an external EEPROM the chip defaults to a USB to asynchronous serial
UART (RS232 mode) port device. If no EEPROM is connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT232H uses
its built-in default VID (0403), PID (6014) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value. In this case,
the device will not have a serial number as part of the USB descriptor.
7.2 Default EEPROM Configuration
The external EEPROM (if it’s fitted) can be programmed over USB using FT_Prog. This allows a blank part
to be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as part of the manufacturing and test process. Users who
do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their design can
apply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs.
