3.1 Audio Interfaces
3.1.1 Interface Signals
The CP2615 provides a Master Clock output and bidirectional I2S Master-mode interface for connection to an external converter. (For
brevity, the term “converter” is used to represent a codec, DAC, or ADC.) The figure below shows the signals that comprise the audio
interface.

                                                     Figure 3.1. Audio Interface Signals
I2S_MCLK (output): The 12 MHz Master Clock output is typically used by oversampling audio converters to drive their internal analog-
to-digital or digital-to-analog conversions.
I2S_LRCLK (output): The Left-Right Clock signal indicates which channel is currently being transferred on the interface. The I2S speci-
fication refers to this signal as WS (word select). The frequency of the I2S_LRCLK signal corresponds to the audio sample rate. The
I2S_LRCLK and I2S_MCLK signals are derived from the same source, and I2S_LRCLK is an integer submultiple of I2S_MCLK. (Both
of these attributes are typically required for proper codec operation.)
I2S_SCLK (output): The rising edge of Serial Clock indicates valid data on I2S_SDOUT and I2S_SDIN.
I2S_SDOUT (output): Serial Data Output from CP2615, typically connected to external DAC.
I2S_SDIN (input): Serial Data Input to CP2615, typically connected to external ADC.
The CP2615 operates in I2S Master Mode, and the I2S_LRCLK and I2S_SCLK signals are outputs from the CP2615. The external co-
dec must operate in I2S Slave Mode. The I2S_LRCLK and I2S_SCLK signals are inputs for this mode.
3.1.2 Audio Sample Rates
The CP2615 supports audio sample rates of 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz. If both Playback and Record are used simultaneously, they must
operate at the same sample rate. Table 3.1 I2S_MCLK and I2S_LRCLK Supported Sample Rates on page 10 describes the relation-
ship of I2S_MCLK and I2S_LRCLK for the supported sample rates:

3.1.3 Audio Sample Resolutions
The CP2615 can be configured to support any one of the following stereo Playback/Record modes:
 • Playback and Record: 16-bit resolution
 • Playback only: 24-bit or 16-bit resolution
 • Record only: 24-bit or 16-bit resolution

3.1.4 Audio Endpoint Synchronization
USB audio endpoint synchronization is defined in Table 5.12 Synchronization Characteristics of the Universal Serial Bus Specification
Revision 2.0. The CP2615 supports the synchronous or asynchronous endpoint synchronization methods for all input and output
streaming configurations. In synchronous mode, the CP2615 adjusts the frequency of I2S_MCLK and I2S_LRCLK to match the rate at
which Start-of-Frame (SOF) packets are received from the USB host. In asynchronous mode, the CP2615 does not adjust the I2S
clocks and instead relies on the USB host to provide the synchronization based on implicit feedback from the input endpoint.
3.2 USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus (USB) function controller in the CP2615 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with integrated transceiver
and on-chip matching and pullup resistors. The USB function controller manages all control, audio, HID, and IO interface transfers be-
tween the USB host and the CP2615.
3.2.1 Endpoint Usage
The USB endpoints are allocated as follows:

3.2.1.1 USB Control Endpoint
The USB control endpoint is used for enumeration and normal USB control functions.
3.2.1.2 HID Interface Endpoint
The HID endpoint is an interrupt IN endpoint that is used to report Consumer Control (i.e. volume up, volume down, etc.) button
presses.
3.2.1.3 Serial I/O Interface Endpoint
The Serial I/O endpoint is a bidirectional bulk interface that transfers either serial pass-through data with the CP2615 UART or I/O Pro-
tocol messages. A host application can use this interface to communicate with external devices or to interact with CP2615 general pur-
pose I/O.

3.2.1.3.1 I/O Protocol
The CP2615 implements a simple messaging protocol that provides USB host applications a means for observing and controlling vari-
ous I/O features. This custom protocol is named the I/O Protocol (IOP) and is implemented over the Serial I/O USB interface.
The I/O Protocol is a stateless, message based protocol that allows a USB host application to do the following:
 • Query device identification information.
 • Query GPIO configuration.
 • Observe and control the GPIO.15-0 pins.
 • Observe the analog pin GPIO.8/ADC.
 • Receive autonomous notifications of GPIO/ADC changes.
 • Perform small transfers on the I2C bus.
 • Query error status of the UART.
Any pin configured as a GPIO output can be controlled by the I/O Protocol. This allows a USB host application to control visual indica-
tors or other hardware connected to the CP2615.
The I/O Protocol supports two methods for observing GPIO.15-0 digital values and GPIO.8/ADC analog values. The USB host applica-
tion can poll the CP2615 by sending an appropriate IOP message and receiving the response. Alternatively, the USB host application
can request that IOP notification messages be sent automatically whenever specific GPIO pins change value. All GPIO pins, including
those assigned to alternate functions, may be monitored over the IOP.
For more information, see Application Note AN1139: CP2614 I/O Protocol.
3.2.1.4 Audio Streaming Endpoint
This is an isochronous unidirectional or bi-directional audio streaming endpoint that carries USB digital audio data between the USB
host and the CP2615. The audio streaming interface has several possible configurations.
3.2.2 USB Suspend
The USB Suspend and Resume modes are supported for power management of the CP2615 device. There are two optional Suspend
output signals that can be used to control power switching to external circuitry. These are SUSPEND (active high) and SUSPENDb
(active low). The CP2615 will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. On entering Suspend mode, the
configured Suspend output signals are asserted. The Suspend signals are also asserted after a CP2615 reset until device configuration
during USB enumeration is complete. The SUSPEND signal is logic high when the device is in the Suspend state, and logic low when
the device is in the normal mode. The SUSPENDb signal has the opposite logic value of SUSPEND.
The CP2615 exits Suspend mode when any of the following occur: Resume signaling is detected or generated, a USB Reset signal is
detected, or a device reset occurs. SUSPEND and SUSPENDb are weakly pulled to VIO in a high impedance state during a CP2615
reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pulldown (10 Ω) can be used to ensure SUSPEND remains low during reset.
The output mode (push-pull or open drain) of the optional suspend output signals is controlled by the CP2615 configuration. Refer to
the Configuration section for more details.
3.3 Asynchronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interface
The CP2615 provides an asynchronous serial (UART) interface whose function is determined by the device configuration. When ena-
bled, the UART interface provides a full duplex communication channel with a USB host application.
The UART interface consists of the GPIO.13/TX (transmit) and GPIO.14/RX (receive) data signals as well as the GPIO.11/RTS (ready
to send) and GPIO.15/CTS (clear to send) flow control signals. These signals are described in 3.4.1.1 GPIO.15, 11—UART Flow-Con-
trol Pins (RTS/CTS). Both the TX and RX signals must be configured to enable the UART interface. The use of RTS and CTS is option-
al depending on the use-case and baud rate.
The UART interface uses a fixed line configuration of 8 data bits, 1 stop bit and no parity (i.e., 8N1). Five common baud rates (115200,
57600, 38400, 19200 and 9600) are supported depending on the CP2615 functional configuration. Refer to the following sections for
more information on the supported baud rates.

3.3.1 Serial Pass-Through Mode
When the CP2615 is configured for serial pass-through, the UART interface is used exclusively to provide a bi-directional data stream
with a USB host application. The format and content of this communication stream is determined by the application and the CP2615
does not examine or interpret the data.
To ensure audio quality is not compromised, serial pass-through only supports low throughput communication. The table below summa-
rizes the supported UART configurations for this mode. Communication over the serial pass-through may become unreliable if any oth-
er configuration is used.

3.4 GPIO
The CP2615 supports sixteen user-configurable GPIO pins. Each of these GPIO pins can be used as an input, open-drain output or
push-pull output. GPIO pins are observed and controlled through the CP2615 I/O Protocol (IOP) which is accessed through the Serial
I/O interface. Alternately, GPIO pins can be assigned to various alternate functions that are directly controlled by the CP2615. The
available alternate functions are described in the following sections.
The function, mode and initial state of the sixteen GPIO pins is determined by the device configuration. More information regarding the
configuration and usage of these pins is available in AN1044: CP2615 Customization User Guide.
Alternate function outputs can be configured as open-drain or push-pull.
3.4.1 Fixed Alternate Pin Functions (GPIO.15-8)
GPIO.15-8 pins have fixed alternate functions that are listed in the table below. Each pin may be individually configured as either a
GPIO or its assigned alternate function. Alternate function pins are controlled directly by the CP2615, but their state can be read by the
IOP protocol.

                                                                                                                Functional Description
3.4.1.1 GPIO.15, 11—UART Flow-Control Pins (RTS/CTS)
The UART flow-control pins are used to prevent data loss by regulating the flow of UART data in either direction. These alternate func-
tions are available when the CP2615 has been configured to enable the Serial I/O interface described in 3.3.1 Serial Pass-Through
Mode. The pins are selected independently, so it is possible to have either or both configured.
GPIO.15/CTS, or Clear To Send, is an active-low input to the CP2615 and is driven logic low by an external UART device to signal that
it can receive data. The CP2615 will halt transmitting data while CTS is pulled high.
GPIO.11/RTS, or Request To Send, is an active-low output from the CP2615, which indicates that the CP2615 is ready to accept data.
The CP2615 will de-assert RTS whenever its internal buffers are nearly full. While RTS is high, the external UART device must stop
transmitting to avoid data loss.
3.4.1.2 GPIO.14, 13—UART Data Pins (TX/RX)
The UART data pins should be selected whenever the CP2615 has been configured for serial pass-through. Both pins must be selec-
ted, even if only one direction is used.
GPIO.14/RX is the receive data pin for the CP2615 UART. Serial data received on this pin will be sent to the host if serial pass-through
has been configured.
GPIO.13/TX is the transmit data pin for the CP2615 UART. Serial data from either the serial pass-through feature is transmitted on this
pin.
3.4.1.3 GPIO.12—Programmable Clock Output (CLKOUT)
GPIO.12/CLKOUT is a configurable CMOS clock output. The clock output appears at the pin after the device enters High Power Mode.
The clock output is removed from the pin when the device enters Low Power Mode or USB Suspend mode.
The output frequency is configurable through the use of a divider. When the divider is set to 0, the output frequency is 93.75 kHz. For
divider values between 1 and 255, the output frequency is determined by the formula:
                   48 MHz
CLKOUTfreq =
                 2 × divider
3.4.1.4 GPIO.10—Codec Reset Output (RESETOUTb)
GPIO.10/RESETOUTb is an active-low output that is typically used to drive the reset pin of the external codec. This pin is asserted (i.e.
driven low) when the CP2615 enters Low Power mode, and can be controlled at other times via user-configurable I2C command
strings. For more information, see 3.6.1.1 I2C Command Strings for Codec Configuration.

3.4.1.5 GPIO.9—Pushbutton Ladder Input (BUTTONS)
The CP2615 can be configured to report common consumer control buttons through the HID interface. When this feature is enabled,
GPIO.9/BUTTONS can be used with a simple resistor ladder and up to fourteen pushbuttons to provide media button input to the
CP2615. Additionally, HID media buttons can be connected as digital inputs to GPIO.7-0, which is described in 3.4.2.1 HID Media But-
tons.
To sense button presses, the CP2615 periodically samples the input voltage on GPIO.9/BUTTONS. Once the input remains steady for
a complete debounce period, the CP2615 converts the input value into a HID media button as determined by the device configuration.
USB HID reports are then sent to the host as the button is pressed and when it is released.
The CP2615 divides the GPIO.9/BUTTONS input into sixteen equal sized (Vdd/16) slots numbered from 0 to 15. The center of each
slot is given by the following equation, where n is the slot number.
       V DD
Vn =         × (1 + 2 × n)
        32
Slots 1 through 14 can be assigned to any button listed in Table 3.6 GPIO.7-0 Selectable Alternate Input Functions on page 17, while
slots 0 and 15 are reserved for the no button pressed condition. Slots can also be left unassigned, in which case they are ignored.
                                                                VDD

                                           Figure 3.2. Example GPIO.9/BUTTONS Input Circuit
An example circuit for driving GPIO.9/BUTTONS is shown in the igure above. The circuit in the figure only shows three switches, but
can easily be expanded by adding additional resistors and switches. While any switch is pressed a simple voltage divider of VDD is
formed and the voltage at GPIO.9/BUTTONS is easily calculated with the following equation.
                    ( )
                         n
                         ∑ Ri
                         1
V buttons = V DD ×         n
                     Rp + ∑ Ri
                           1
The values of the resistor ladder should be selected so that the divider formed by each switch produces a voltage that is near the center
of the switch’s assigned slot. A set of resistor values for a fourteen button ladder are provided in the table, Table 3.5 Resistor Values for
Example GPIO.9/BUTTONS Circuit on page 16. To guarantee proper operation, 1% tolerance resistors should be used.
The example circuit in the figure above has some features worth noting. First, with no button pressed Rp holds GPIO.9/BUTTONS in
slot 15 and the resistor ladder draws no current. Also, when multiple switches are pressed, the lowest numbered switch is recognized
while the others are ignored. This is because the lowest switch effectively shorts the resistor ladder of the higher switches.

3.4.1.6 GPIO.8—ADC Analog Input (ADC)
The ADC Analog Input alternate function provides a low-rate analog measurement channel that is reported through the I/O Protocol.
The analog value can be polled or automatically reported whenever the value change exceeds a programmable threshold. The CP2615
samples GPIO.8/ADC at approximately 50 samples per second and provides 10-bit resolution referenced to VDD. This pin can be used
to track a slow moving sensor value such as temperature.

3.4.2 Selectable Alternate Pin Functions (GPIO.7-0)
GPIO.7-0 pins have selectable alternate functions that can be mapped to any pin. The selectable alternate input functions and the se-
lectable alternate output functions are listed in the tables below. These predefined functions can be assigned to GPIO.7-0 in any order
and combination. Additionally, all output functions can be assigned to more than one pin if desired, and can be configured as open-
drain or push-pull. Alternate function pins are controlled directly by the CP2615, but their state can be read by the IOP protocol.

 PBMUTEb                             Audio Playback is Muted (active low)
3.4.2.1 HID Media Buttons
The CP2615 can be configured to report common consumer control buttons through the HID interface. These active low inputs are de-
bounced by the CP2615 and are used to generate the HID reports on both the leading and trailing edges of a button push. The suppor-
ted HID usages are indicated in Table 3.6 GPIO.7-0 Selectable Alternate Input Functions on page 17. These inputs should be connec-
ted to momentary pushbuttons through an external pull-up resistor. Note that buttons can also be connected to the CP2615 using
GPIO.9/BUTTONS as described in 3.4.1.5 GPIO.9—Pushbutton Ladder Input (BUTTONS).
3.4.2.2 Record Mute Toggle Button
This active low input is debounced by the CP2615 and is used to toggle the internal audio record mute state. The CP2615 record mute
state is toggled on a low-to-high transition. This input should be connected to a momentary pushbutton through an external pull-up re-
sistor.

3.4.2.3 PROFILE_SELECT
Configuring a GPIO or buttons (resistor ladder) switch as a PROFILE_SELECT input allows the user to select between multiple profiles
that are typically used to specify codec register writes that implement different equalization or audio effect settings. The CP2615 can be
configured with up to three fixed audio profiles, and a fourth profile can be dynamically programmed by the host.
Each time the PROFILE_SELECT button is pressed, the next non-blank profile string is applied in round robin fashion ([0]>[1]>[2]>[0]).
Blank profile strings (i.e. containing only the 00 terminator) are skipped. The currently-selected profile is saved to nonvolatile memory
and persists across CP2615 reset and power-cycle events. The currently-selected profile will be applied when audio streaming starts.
3.4.2.4 GESTURE
The CP2615 recognizes four gestures (i.e. distinct types of GESTURE button press):
 • Long press
 • Single click
 • Double click
 • Triple click
Each of these four gestures can be assigned to the any of these Alternate Input Functions that are described in Table 3.6 GPIO.7-0
Selectable Alternate Input Functions on page 17:
 • HID Media button functions (PLAY_PAUSE, FFWD, REW, MUTE, VOL+, VOL-, PLAY, STOP)
 • RECMUTE
 • PROFILE_SELECT
3.4.2.5 SUSPEND, SUSPENDb
These complimentary outputs are asserted while the CP2615 is in USB Suspend mode. The CP2615 enters USB Suspend mode when
it is powered and USB is disconnected or USB activity is stopped by the connected USB host. This situation occurs if the CP2615
accessory is self-powered (such as with a battery) and a connected USB host goes into standby mode (powers down) or USB is dis-
connected. If the accessory is device powered, then USB Suspend mode will not be used. The CP2615 enters a very low power state
while in USB Suspend mode, and the SUSPEND output signal(s) can be used to switch power to other circuitry in the accessory.
3.4.2.6 LOWPWR, LOWPWRb
These complimentary outputs are asserted whenever the CP2615 is in low power mode. The CP2615 enters low power mode when
both the audio and serial I/O interfaces are idle. The LOWPWR output signal(s) can be used to switch power to other circuitry in the
accessory in order to save power.
3.4.2.7 RMUTE, RMUTEb
The CP2615 asserts these complimentary outputs whenever it is muting the audio record channel. These signals reflect the state of the
CP2615 audio record mute and can be used to drive a visual indicator for user feedback or drive the mute control of a microphone pre-
amp.
3.4.2.8 PBMUTE, PBMUTEb
The CP2615 asserts these complimentary outputs whenever the host has commanded the CP2615 to mute the audio playback chan-
nel. These signals can be used to drive mute controls in the playback circuitry or to provide user feedback by driving a visual indicator.
3.5 Configuration
The CP2615 has an extensive set of configurable features and attributes. To streamline the product development process, the CP2615
Evaluation Kit provides tools that enable users to easily customize and program the CP2615 configuration parameters to meet the re-
quirements of their system.
In the production environment, the CP2615 configuration can be programmed in-situ using an industry-standard I2C EEPROM Pro-
grammer or equivalent. Customers can also order devices that are pre-programmed with their customized configuration.
Some of the configuration options of the CP2615 do not have a fixed length. For example, the manufacturer name and product name
strings do not have a fixed length. Also, the codec configuration data can be variable length. While the CP2615 does not enforce any
fixed length on these individual fields, the total configuration size can be a maximum of 2800 bytes. The baseline configuration length
with no codec configuration and minimal identification strings is about 575 bytes. The CP2615 customization tool will show you the size

3.6 I2C Interface
The I2C (inter-integrated-circuit) bus is a de facto standard two-wire digital interface. For detailed information on the I2C standard, see
the NXP I2C Bus Specification and User Manual.
The CP2615 operates in I2C Standard Mode at the nominal frequency of 100 kbits/s. For proper operation, the SCL (clock) and SDA
(data) lines require external pullup resistors that are sized to ensure that the SCL/SDA rise times satisfy the requirements of all devices
on the I2C bus. Improperly sized pullup resistors may cause data corruption or bus lockup.
The state of the CFGMODEb input pin when RSTb becomes deasserted determines whether the CP2615 operates in Normal Mode as
an I2C Master (CFGMODEb = high), or in Configuration Mode as an I2C Slave (CFGMODEb = low).
3.6.1 CP2615 I2C Operation in Normal Mode
In Normal Mode the CP2615 provides the following I2C functionality:
 • Execute pre-configured I2C write transactions in response to various system events (e.g. bootup, audio stream start/stop, volume/
    mute commands, audio profile switching, etc).
 • Support I2C pass-through operation, enabling the host to initiate read or write transactions with I2C slave devices.

3.6.1.1 I2C Command Strings for Codec Configuration
The CP2615 supports a number of configurable I2C command strings that are typically used to initialize and configure the codec and
other I2C slave devices in the system.
Table 3.8 Command Strings on page 21 lists the various I2C strings, describes when the strings are applied, and indicates if the given
I2C string requires a zero-terminator byte (0x00) to identify the end of all subcommands.

Each I2C command string consists of a length byte followed by an array of bytes containing one or more subcommands. As indicated in
Table 3.8 Command Strings on page 21, most I2C command strings must also be terminated with 0x00. The value of the length byte
includes the size of the subcommand array and zero terminator, but not the length byte itself.
The maximum length of any one I2C command string is 2000 bytes, including the length byte and the zero terminator byte. The length
byte should be set to the maximum value of 254 if the string is longer than 254 bytes. The maximum size of the entire CP2615 configu-
ration (which includes all I2C command strings, USB descriptors and other device configuration info) is 4608 bytes.
The subcommands which comprise an I2C command string are composed of a one-byte ASCII-encoded subcommand token followed
by the number of data bytes specific to that token. The ASCII-encoded tokens and their associated arguments are shown in Table
3.9 ASCII-encoded Tokens and Associated Arguments on page 21.

3.6.1.2 Example I2C Subcommands
This section contains examples of typical I2C subcommands. The examples use these conventions:
 • Tokens are shown as ASCII characters, e.g. ‘W’
 • Binary data is shown as hex (e.g. 0x01)
 • <SLA> represents the left-justified slave address
The following are examples typical I2C subcommands.
Write 0x44 to register 0x01 of slave device:
0x06 ‘W’ 0x03 <SLA> 0x01 0x44 ‘P’
Read 2 bytes from register 0x55 of slave device, using stop/start between Write/Read transactions:
0x09 ‘W’ 0x02 <SLA> 0x01 ‘P’ ‘R’ 0x02 ‘SLA’ ‘P’
Read 2 bytes from register 0xAA of slave device, using repeated start between Write/Read transactions:
0x09 ‘W’ 0x01 <SLA> 0xAA ‘R’ 0x02 ‘SLA’ ‘P’
Delay 20 ms (20 = 0x14):

3.6.1.3 I2C Pass-Through
The CP2615 I/O Protocol allows USB host applications to issue I2C write and read operations to I2C slave devices, and to the
CP2615’s internal user-accessible ROM. For more information on the I/O protocol, see 3.2.1.3.1 I/O Protocol.
Using pass-through mode, the host can also perform the following write and read operations which are recognized by the CP2615 and
are not passed through to the physical I2C bus:

3.6.2 CP2615 I2C Operation in Configuration Mode
The state of the CFGMODEb input pin at the conclusion of the device reset state determines whether the CP2615 operates normally
(CFGMODEb = high) or enters Configuration Mode (CFGMODEb = low). In Configuration Mode, the CP2615 emulates an I2C flash
EEPROM; all other device functionality is disabled. The CP2615 remains in Configuration Mode until it is reset or power-cycled. Refer
to the following figure for typical configuration connections.

CP2615 configuration.
 • Drive CFGMODEb and RSTb low (device power can be applied before or after this step)
 • Delay at least 15 µs (the minimum RSTb low time)
 • Drive RSTb high
 • Delay at least 100 ms
The configuration block consists of 2048 bytes of non-volatile flash memory mapped to address range 0x0000-0x07FF. Two bytes are
used in I2C Read and Write transactions to represent the address within the configuration block.
The CP2615 7-bit I2C Slave Address is 0011000. The corresponding 8-bit values for the CP2615 slave address plus the I2C Write/Read
bit are 0x30 (Write) and 0x31 (Read).
CP2615 code execution is temporarily halted during the execution of memory erase and write operations. If the external I2C Master
cannot tolerate NAKs or does not support retries, it must implement the appropriate delays after issuing I2C erase and write commands.
3.6.2.1 I2C Write Transactions
To prevent inadvertent flash erasure or corruption, each Write transaction must contain the flash keys (0xA5, 0xF1) between the ad-
dress MSB/LSB and the block of data to be written. Write transactions with invalid flash keys will be ignored. The maximum number of
data bytes that can be written per Write transaction is 62 bytes. The format of the Write transaction is:

3.6.2.2 I2C Read Transactions
The entire configuration block can be read with a single Read transaction (if the external I2C Master is capable) or by using multiple
Read transactions of smaller size. The format of the Read transaction is as follows:

3.6.2.4 Configuration Programming Example
The following sequence illustrates the actions required of an external I2C Master when programming the CP2615 configuration. The
sequence programs the new configuration data in blocks of 16 bytes, which is a typical size used by I2C EEPROM programmers.
 • Put the CP2615 into Configuration Mode.
 • Read the Configuration Lock Byte to ensure it is 0xFF (i.e. unlocked).
 • Erase the configuration.
 • Delay while configuration is being erased (see 2.1.7 I2C).
 • Read the Configuration Block to ensure all bytes are 0xFF.
 • For each block of 16 bytes to be written:
    • Execute Write transaction containing flash keys and 16 bytes of data.
    • Delay while configuration data is being written.
    • Execute 16-byte Read transaction to verify data.
 • Lock the configuration. (optional).
 • To return the CP2615 to normal operation, reset or power-cycle the device.
3.7 Voltage Regulator and Power
The CP2615 includes an internal voltage regulator that can be configured to operate in one of several modes. This allows it to be pow-
ered from an ordinary USB host or be self-powered.

3.7.2 USB 3.3 V Self-Powered Connection
Alternatively, if 3.0 to 3.6 V power source is supplied to the VDD pin, the CP2615 can function as a USB self-powered device with the
voltage regulator bypassed. For this configuration, the REGIN input should be tied to VDD to bypass the voltage regulator. A typical
connection diagram showing the device in a USB self-powered application with the regulator bypassed is shown in the figure below.
The USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match the device power usage and configuration. See application note

3.7.3 USB 5 V Self-Powered Connection
To use the regulator to provide VDD in a self-powered application, use the configuration shown in the diagram below. If REGIN may be
unpowered while VBUS is 5 V, a resistor divider (or functionally equivalent circuit) described in Note 3 of the figure is required to meet
the absolute maximum voltage on VBUS specification in 2.2 Absolute Maximum Ratings.

 Note:
 General
    1. All dimensions shown are in millimeters (mm) unless otherwise noted.
    2. This Land Pattern Design is based on the IPC-7351 guidelines.
 Solder Mask Design
    1. All metal pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance between the solder mask and the metal pad is to be 60 µm
       minimum, all the way around the pad.
 Stencil Design
    1. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used to assure good solder paste release.
    2. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
    3. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all perimeter pads.
    4. A 3x3 array of 1.0 mm square openings on 1.2 mm pitch should be used for the center ground pad.
 Card Assembly
    1. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
    2. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020 specification for Small Body Components.
