                USB Type-C CC smart protection
                Rev. 1.0 — 3 February 2020                                       Product data sheet
1 General description
             NX20P0477 is a single-chip USB Type-C (USB-C) port overvoltage protection solution
             integrating a corrosion prevention algorithm from moisture. CC1/CC2 pins in the system
             side are protected from 28 V short to VBUS.
             USB-C allows VBUS voltage to increase up to 20 V through Power delivery protocol.
             CC1/2 pins can be shorted to VBUS due to mechanical twisting and sliding of the
             connector since USB-C connector contact pins are 25 % closer to each other than a
             micro USB connector. Moisture or fine dust may also cause the 20 V VBUS pin to be
             shorted to adjacent pins.
             NX20P0477 enables CC pins to be more robust in even abnormal conditions.
             NX20P0477 is 28 V DC tolerant on CON_CC pins in connector side and quickly
             disconnects switches if the voltage is above overvoltage threshold, protecting CC pins in
             system side from high voltage.
             USB PD standard requires 80 µA, 180 µA or 330 µA as Rp to detect sink device, but this
             Rp current accelerates USB-C connector pin corrosion when CC pins are contaminated
             with water, especially salt water. Furthermore, CC/PD controller may recognize this water
             impedance as detected sink, providing 5 V through VBUS pin, which accelerates
             corrosion.
             NX20P0477 converts these USB standard Rp currents from CC/PD controller to ultra-low
             current source to prevent corrosion.
             NX20P0477 integrates IEC 61000-4-2 ESD protection of +6 kV contact discharge and
             +8 kV air discharge on CON_CC1 and CON_CC2, which helps to reduce external BOM
             cost.
             NX20P0477 CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 pins are designed to be protected from surge
             voltage up to +/-40 V.
             NX20P0477 is offered with 0.5 mm pitch, 9 bumps, 1.49 mm x 1.49 mm x 0.555 mm
             WLCSP package.

7       Functional description
                          NX20P0477 is placed between USB-C connector and CC/PD controller to protect CC
                          pins in System side CC/PD controller from 20 V VBUS short, ESD and Surge voltage.
                          NX20P0477 has corrosion prevention feature, which can be enabled by driving CP_EN
                          pin high. In this mode, the CC switch is off and Rp source from CC/PD controller is
                          converted to low current source integrated in NX20P0477. CC switch is turned on only
                          when true accessories are detected.
                          NX20P0477 has Rd clamp circuit on both CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 when VSYS is
                          below UVLO threshold, known as dead battery condition. It allows USB-C adapter to
                          detect SINK through the Rd clamp and start providing 5 V through VBUS. Main charger
                          regulates system voltage from 5 V VBUS. Once VSYS comes up, NX20P0477 enables
                          switchers and disconnects internal Rd clamp circuit from CON_CCx pins.

                          Figure 5 shows internal block diagram, where only one channel is shown. The other
                          channel has the same circuit. CC switch is comprised with back-to-back MOSFET to
                          truly isolate CC pin from CON_CC pin. There are four comparators in each CC channel.
                          COMP1 on CC pin detects Rp or Rd by external CC/PD controller. COMP1 comparator
                          output is used to enable internal Rd or Rp on CON_CC pin. COMP2 and COMP3 is used
                          to detect accessory plugged in connector or moisture inside connector. COMP4 detects
                          overvoltage on CON_CC pin.

                        both CC switches are turned off and Rd clamp circuit on CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 is
                        enabled. Once VSYS is above OVLO, then NX20P0477 transitions to Active state by
                        turning CC switch ON. If VBUS is not present for tCC_OFF_VBUS and CP_EN is high, it

                                                                                                                  USB Type-C CC smart protection
                      transitions to Wait.SNK or Wait.SRC depending on CCx voltage. When CP_EN is low,
                      NX20P0477 stays at Active state.
                7.2.2 Wait.SNK state
                      When VSYS is above UVLO threshold and comparator1 (CP1) on CC1 and CC2 pins
                      is high, NX20P0477 enters Wait.SNK state. Internal low current source is enabled on
                      CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 by turning CC switches off. When CP1 is driven low by
                      external CC/PD controller, the device transitions to Wait.SRC. If CP2 comparator on
                      CON_CCx is low, it moves to Active state. if CP2 is high and CP3 is low, then it enters
                      Moisture.det state. If FLAGB is driven low after detecting water on connector before, then
                      FLAGB is cleared when CP3 is detected high in this state.
                7.2.3 Wait.SRC state
                      When VSYS is above UVLO threshold and comparator1 (CP1) on CC1 and CC2 pins
                      is low, NX20P0477 enters Wait.SRC state. Internal Rd is enabled on CON_CC1 and
                      CON_CC2 by turning CC switches off. When CP1 is driven high by external CC/PD
                      controller, the device transitions to Wait.SNK. If CP2 comparator on CON_CCx is high, it
                      moves to Active state.
                7.2.4 Moisture.Det state
                      NX20P0477 transitions to Moisture.DET state from Wait.SNK state when CP2 is high and
                      CP3 is low, where FLAGB is driven low. The device transitions to Wait.SRC or Wait.SNK
                      depending to CP1 status on CCx pins.
                7.2.5 Active state
                      When either sink or source accessory is detected successfully, the device enters Active
                      status where both CCx switches are turned on and internal current source or Rd is turned
                      off. The rest of CC detection process is accomplished by external CC/PD controller. The
                      device exits Active state in tCC_OFF_VBUS after removing VBUS. If CP_EN is driven low,
                      the device remains in Active state.

                          USB PD standard requires 80 µA, 180 µA or 330 µA as Rp to detect sink device. But
                          it may accelerate corrosion when CC pins are contaminated with water, especially sea
                          water. Furthermore, CC/PD controller may recognize this water impedance as sink
                          detection, providing 5 V to VBUS pin and accelerating corrosion.
                          NX20P0477 isolates CC pin from CON_CC pin by turning CC switches off and imitating
                          CC/PD controller behavior monitoring CC pin status. If CC/PD controller terminates CC
                          pins with Rd, then NX20P0477 enables internal Rd on CON_CC pins. If the controller
                          sources Rp current, it enables internal low current source. NX20P0477 can detect any
                          accessory through connector with internal comparators synchronizing CC/PD Controller

                        battery accessory from water. NX20P0477 then turns ICC_SRC off and turns Rd on. Since
                        there is no source, CON_CC voltage falls below VCOMP2. After TCC_deb, NX20P077
                        detects as Dead battery accessory and turns on CC switch.

                        Water impedance can be simply modeled with resistance and capacitance. Tap water
                        and purified water show a few hundred kΩ and a few hundred nF capacitance. Sea water
                        has a few tens kΩ and around 1 μF capacitance. NX20P0477 utilizes this characteristic
                        to detect water from normal accessory.
                        When water comes into contact with a USB-C connector pin, CON_CC voltage drops
                        due to water impedance which is below VCOMP3. NX20P0477 detects a change and
                        enables internal current source for TSRC_WAIT, and then enables the current source for
                        TCC_deb. During this time, CON_CC voltage increases above VCOMP3 in case of tap
                        water, it detects as water, where CC switch stays off and FLAGB is pulled low. In case of
                        sea water, the voltage doesn’t go over VCOMP3 even if enabling internal current source
                        for TCC_deb, after then NX20P0477 turns off internal all current source and enables Rd.
                        CON_CC voltage doesn’t fall below VCOMP2 due to water capacitance.

                   7.5 Overvoltage protection
                         NX20P0477 has overvoltage protection of CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 up to 28 V. CC
                         switch overvoltage threshold is VOVPCC to guarantee 5 V VCONN power supply, which is
                         maximum 5.5 V by USB USB-C spec.
                         Once overvoltage on either channel is detected, the switch is quickly turned off within
                         tOVP_res, to prevent passing overvoltage to system side. If the voltage of the channel
                         triggered OVP comes down below overvoltage threshold for tOVP_Deb, NX20P0477 CC
                         switch turns back on.

                   7.6 CP_EN
                       CP_EN pin is a control pin that enables the corrosion prevention feature.
                       When CP_EN pin is driven high, corrosion prevention circuit is enabled. If CP_EN pin is
                       driven low, corrosion prevention circuit is disabled and enters active state by turning CC
                       switches on, where NX20P0477 acts as an overvoltage protection switch.
                   7.7 VBUS
                       VBUS pin detects VBUS presence and uses this signal to turn off CC switch. Whenever
                       an accessory is detected, VBUS comes up according to USB USB-C specification. When
                       accessory is removed, VBUS disappears. NX20P0477 turns off CC switch 2.5 sec after
                       VBUS is removed.
                   7.8 FLAGB
                       FLAGB pin is an open drain output to indicate moisture condition on USB-C connector
                       pins to application processor. When NX20P0477 detects water, such as tap or sea
                       water, it drives FLAGB low. If both CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 voltages exceed VCOMP3
                       in Wait.SNK state, it is regarded as dry condition on connector and FLAGB gets High-Z.
                       When VSYS voltage falls below UVLO threshold, FLAGB gets High-Z.

[1]   The overall Rth(j-a) can vary depending on the board layout. To minimize the effective Rth(j-a), all pins must have a solid connection to larger Cu layer
      areas e.g. to the power and ground layer. In multi-layer PCB applications, the second layer should be used to create a large heat spreader area right
      below the device. If this layer is either ground or power, it should be connected with several vias to the top layer connecting to the device ground or
      supply. Try not to use any solder-stop varnish under the chip
[2]   This Rth(j-a) is calculated based on JEDEX2S2P board. The actual Rth(j-a) value may vary in applications using different layer stacks and layouts.
