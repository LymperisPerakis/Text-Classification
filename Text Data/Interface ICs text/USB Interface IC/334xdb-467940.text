                                                              Enhanced Single Supply Hi-Speed USB ULPI Transceiver
General Description
            SMSC’s USB334x is a family of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceivers that provide a physical layer (PHY)
            solution well-suited for portable electronic devices. Both commercial and industrial temperature
            applications are supported.
            Each model in the USB334x family may use a 60MHz reference clock or the model-number specific
            reference clock shown on page 2.
            Several advanced features make the USB334x the transceiver of choice by reducing both eBOM part
            count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness eliminates the need for
            external ESD protection devices in typical applications. The internal Over-Voltage Protection circuit
            (OVP) protects the USB334x from voltages up to 30V on the VBUS pin. By using a reference clock
            from the Link, the USB334x removes the cost of a dedicated crystal reference from the design. The
            USB334x includes integrated 3.3V and 1.8V regulators, making it possible to operate the device from
            a single power supply.
            The USB334x is optimized for use in portable applications where a low operating current and standby
            currents are essential. The USB334x operates from a single supply and includes integrated regulators
            for its supplies. The USB334x also supports the USB Link Power Management protocol (LPM) to
            further reduce USB operating currents.
            The USB334x family is enabled with SMSC's RapidCharge AnywhereTM which supports USB-IF
            Battery Charging 1.2 for any portable device. RapidCharge AnywhereTM provides three times the
            charging current through a USB port over traditional solutions which translate up to 1.5Amps via
            compatible USB host or dedicated charger. In addition, this provides a complete USB charging
            ecosystem between device and host ports such as Dedicated Charging Port (DCP), Charging (CDP)
            and Standard (SDP) Downstream Ports.
            The USB334x meets all of the electrical requirements for a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device, or an On-the-
            Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition to the supporting USB signaling, the USB334x also provides USB
            UART mode and, in versions with the integrated USB switch, USB Audio mode.
            USB334x uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB transceiver
            to the Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers between the Link and
            PHY to facilitate a USB session with only twelve pins.
            The USB334x uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
            less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
            latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
            adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.
            Versions of the USB334x with the integrated USB switch enable a single USB port of connection.
