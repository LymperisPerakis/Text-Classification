NB7NPQ1102M
3.3 V USB 3.1 Gen-2
10Gbps Dual Channel /
Single Port Linear Redriver
Description
   The NB7NPQ1102M is a high performance single−Port linear
                                                                                           www.onsemi.com
redriver designed for USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 applications
that supports both 5 Gbps and 10 Gbps data rates. Signal integrity
degrades from PCB traces, transmission cables, and inter−symbol
interference (ISI). The NB7NPQ1102M compensates for these losses
by engaging varying levels of equalization at the input receiver, and
flat gain amplification on the output transmitter.
   The NB7NPQ1102M offers programmable equalization and flat
gain to optimize performance over various physical mediums.
   The NB7NPQ1102M contains an automatic receiver detect function                                WQFN30
which will determine whether the output is active. The receiver                                CASE 510CK
detection loop will be active if the corresponding channel’s signal
detector is idle for a period of time. The channel will then move to
Unplug Mode if a load is not detected, or it will return to Low Power

•   Limit the number of vias used on each data line. It is                                                                      •     Routing angles should be obtuse angles and kept to 135
