FAN6390MPX
                                                                                            www.onsemi.com
  The FAN6390MPX is a highly integrated, secondary−side power
adaptor controller supporting USB Type−C and USB Power Delivery
2.0/3.0. It includes a fully autonomous USB PD state machine which
is fully compliant with the latest USB PD 3.0 specification,
minimizing design time and cost. Support for the latest Programmable
Power Supply (PPS) rules allows for control of voltages from 3.3 V to                               WQFN24
21 V and current limits from 1 A to 3 A to meet a wide range of                                    MLP, QUAD
applications and power levels.                                                                     CASE 510BE
  To minimize BOM count, the FAN6390MPX includes internal
synchronous rectifier control, an NMOS gate driver for VBUS load
switch control, as well as Constant Voltage (CV) and Constant Current                      PIN CONNECTIONS

6. Function explanation refers to FAN6390MPX application note.
7. Based on compliance spec PPS case is current limit. Output voltage could be lower than the requested PPS voltage command during current
    limit. In order to operate at current limit region, FAN6390MPX series disable UVP and operates until VIN−OFF.
8. Except of PDO, all APDO power profiles are 100% CC.
