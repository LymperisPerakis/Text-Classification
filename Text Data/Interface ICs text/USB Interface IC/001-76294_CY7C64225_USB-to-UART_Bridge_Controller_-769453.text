Notes
 2. The 50,000 cycle Flash endurance per block will only be guaranteed if the Flash is operating within one voltage range. Voltage ranges are 3.0 V to 3.6 V and 4.75 V
    to 5.25 V.
 3. A maximum of 36 x 50,000 block endurance cycles is allowed. This may be balanced between operations on 36x1 blocks of 50,000 maximum cycles each, 36x2
    blocks of 25,000 maximum cycles each, or 36x4 blocks of 12,500 maximum cycles each (to limit the total number of cycles to 36x50,000 and that no single block
    ever sees more than 50,000 cycles).

Glossary
Asynchronous        A signal whose data is acknowledged or acted upon immediately, irrespective of any clock signal.
Buffer               1. A storage area for data that is used to compensate for a speed difference, when transferring data from one
                        device to another. Usually refers to an area reserved for I/O operations, into which data is read, or from which
                        data is written.
                     2. A portion of memory set aside to store data, often before it is sent to an external device or as it is received
                        from an external device.
                     3. An amplifier used to lower the output impedance of a system.
Flash               Flash is a type of non-volatile memory used to store small amounts of data that must be saved when power is
                    removed.
Reset               No Connect (NC)
VDD                 A name for a power net meaning “voltage drain” The most positive power supply signal. Usually 5 V or 3.3 V.
VSS                 A name for a power net meaning “voltage source” The most negative power supply signal.
Virtual COM Port A USB virtual COM port is a software interface that enables applications to access a USB device as if it were a
                    built-in serial port. Many USB virtual COM-port devices function as bridges that convert between USB and RS-232
                    or other asynchronous serial interfaces.
UART                A UART or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter translates between parallel bits of data and serial bits.
