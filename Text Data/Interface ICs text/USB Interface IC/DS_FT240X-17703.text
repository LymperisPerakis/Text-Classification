11     RD#     Input    data byte (if available) from the receive FIFO buffer when RD# goes from high
                        to low.
                        Writes the data byte on the D0...D7 pins into the transmit FIFO buffer when WR
12     WR      Input
                        goes from high to low. See Section 3.7 for timing diagram.
                        When high, do not write data into the FIFO. When low, data can be written into
20     TXE#    Output   the FIFO by strobing WR high, then low. During reset this signal pin is tristate.
                        See Section 3.7 for timing diagram.
                        When high, do not read data from the FIFO. When low, there is data available in
                        the FIFO which can be read by strobing RD# low, then high again. During reset
                        this signal pin is tristate. If the Remote Wakeup option is enabled in the internal
21     RXF#    Output   MTP memory, during USB suspend mode (PWREN# = 1) RXF# becomes an
                        input. This can be used to wake up the USB host from suspend mode by
                        strobing this pin low for a minimum of 20ms which will cause the device to
                        request a resume on the USB bus.
                            Table 3.4 FIFO Interface Group (see note 2)
Notes:
When used in Input Mode, the input pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 200kΩ resistors. These pins can
be programmed to gently pull low during USB suspend (PWREN# = “1”) by setting an option in the
internal MTP memory.

                              When high, do not read data from the FIFO. When low, there is data
                              available in the FIFO which can be read by strobing RD# low, then high

When used in Input Mode, the input pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 200kΩ resistors. These pins can
be programmed to gently pull low during USB suspend (PWREN# = “1”) by setting an option in the
internal MTP memory.
3.5 CBUS Signal Options
The following options can be configured on the CBUS I/O pins. CBUS signal options are common to both
package versions of the FT240X. These options can be configured in the internal MTP memory using the
software utility FT_PPROG, which can be downloaded from the FTDI Utilities (www.ftdichip.com). The
default configuration is described in Section 8.

4 Function Description
The FT240X is a USB to parallel FIFO interface device which simplifies USB implementations and reduces
external component count by fully integrating into the device an MTP memory and an integrated clock
circuit which requires no external crystal. It has been designed to operate efficiently with USB host
controllers by using as little bandwidth as possible when compared to the total USB bandwidth available.
4.1 Key Features
Functional Integration. Fully integrated MTP memory, clock generation, AVCC filtering, power-on-reset
(POR) and LDO regulator.
Configurable CBUS I/O Pin Options. The fully integrated MTP memory allows configuration of the
Control Bus (CBUS) functionality and drive strength selection. There are 2 configurable CBUS I/O options.
The configurable options are defined in section 3.5.
The CBUS lines can be configured with any one of these output options by setting bits in the internal MTP
memory. The device is shipped with the most commonly used pin definitions pre-programmed - see
Section 8 for details.
Asynchronous Bit Bang Mode. In asynchronous bit-bang mode, the eight FIFO lines can be switched
from the regular interface mode to an 8-bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the
device and they will be sequentially sent to the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer
(equivalent to the baud rate pre-scaler. This option will be described more fully in a separate application
note available from FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com).
Synchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT240X supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs from
asynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. This
makes it easier for the controlling program to measure the response to an output stimulus as the data
returned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R-01, available from FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
 High Output Drive Option. The parallel FIFO interface and the four FIFO handshake pins can be made
to drive out at three times the standard signal drive level thus allowing multiple devices to be driven, or
devices that require a greater signal drive strength to be interfaced to the FT240X. This option is
configured in the internal MTP memory.
Programmable FIFO RX Buffer Timeout. The FIFO RX buffer timeout is used to flush remaining data
from the receive buffer. This timeout defaults to 16ms, but is programmable over USB in 1ms increments
from 2ms to 255ms, thus allowing the device to be optimised for protocols that require fast response
times from short data packets.
Wake Up Function. If USB is in suspend mode, and remote wake up has been enabled in the internal
MTP memory (it is enabled by default). Strobing the SIWU# pin low for a minimum of 20ms will cause
the FT240X to request a resume from suspend on the USB bus. Normally this can be used to wake up the
host PC from suspend.
Source Power and Power Consumption. The FT240X is capable of operating at a voltage supply
between +3.3V and +5.25V with a nominal operational mode current of 8mA and a nominal USB suspend
mode current of 125µA. This allows greater margin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode
current limit of 2.5mA. An integrated level converter within allows the FT240X to interface to logic
running at +1.8V to +3.3V (5V tolerant).

4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within the FT240X. Please refer to the block diagram shown
in Figure 2.1.
Internal MTP Memory. The internal MTP memory in the FT240X is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID),
Product ID (PID), device serial number, product description string and various other USB configuration
descriptors. The FT240X is supplied with the internal MTP memory pre-programmed as described in
Section 8. A user area of the internal MTP memory is available to system designers to allow storing
additional data from the user application over USB. The internal MTP memory descriptors can be
programmed in circuit, over USB without any additional voltage requirement. The descriptors can be
programmed using the FTDI utility software called FT_PROG, which can be downloaded from FTDI Utilities
on the FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com).
+1.8V LDO Regulator. The +1.8 LDO regulator generates the +1.8V reference voltage for driving the
internal core of the IC.
+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the
USB transceiver cell output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the
3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on
USBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells
rather than to power external logic. However, it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a
+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.
USB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full-speed physical interface
to the USB cable. The output drivers provide +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential
input receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single-Ended-0 (SE0) and USB
reset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP.
The block also detects when connected to a USB power supply which will not enumerate the device but
still supply power and may be used for battery charging.
USB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock
and data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.
Internal 12MHz Oscillator. The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This
provides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference
clock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and FIFO controller blocks.
Clock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal
Oscillator function and generates the 48MHz. The 48Mz clock reference is used by the USB DPLL and the
Baud Rate Generator blocks.
Serial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it
performs bit stuffing/un-stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also verifies the CRC on the USB data
stream.
USB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control
endpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the
commands for controlling the functional parameters of the FIFO in accordance with the USB 2.0
specification Section 9.
FIFO RX Buffer (512 bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the FIFO via the USB data OUT
endpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer and is removed from the buffer by reading the contents
of the FIFO using the RD# pin. (Rx relative to the USB interface).
FIFO TX Buffer (512 bytes). Data written into the FIFO using the WR pin is stored in the FIFO TX
(transmit) Buffer. The USB host controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB
request for data from the device data IN endpoint. (Tx relative to the USB interface).
FIFO Controller with Programmable High Drive. The FIFO Controller handles the transfer of data
between the FIFO RX, the FIFO TX buffers and the external FIFO interface pins (D0 - D7).
Additionally, the FIFO signals have a configurable high drive strength capability which is configurable in
the MTP memory.
RESET Generator. The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT240X.
RESET# can be tied to VCC or left unconnected if not being used.

6 USB Power Configurations
The following sections illustrate possible USB power configurations for the FT240X. The illustrations have
omitted pin numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT240XS and FT240XQ
package options.
All USB power configurations illustrated apply to both package options for the FT240X device. Please refer
to Section 0 for the package option pin-out and signal descriptions.

                               Figure 6.1 Bus Powered Configuration
Figure 6.1 illustrates the FT240X in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows –
   i) On plug-in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.
   ii) In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA.
   iii) A bus powered high power USB device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use the
           PWREN# to keep the current below 100mA on plug-in and 2.5mA on USB suspend.
   iv) A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB bus powered hub.
   v) No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.
The power descriptors in the internal MTP memory of the FT240X should be programmed to match the
current drawn by the device.
A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT240X and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application. A suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from
Steward (www.steward.com), for example Steward Part # MI0805K601R-10.

                                      Figure 6.2 Self-Powered Configuration
Figure 6.2 illustrates the FT240X in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic
rules for USB self-powered devices are as follows –
   i)   A self-powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub
            controller is powered down.
   ii) A self-powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB
            suspend as it has its own power supply.
   iii) A self-powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-powered
            USB hub.
The power descriptor in the internal MTP memory of the FT240X should be programmed to a value of
zero (self-powered).
In order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus power (pin 1) is used to control the
VBUS_Sense pin of the FT240X device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ
resistor on USBDP is pulled up to +3.3V, thus identifying the device as a full speed device to the USB
host or hub. When the USB host or hub is powered off, VBUS_Sense pin will be low and the FT240X is
held in a suspend state. In this state the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is not pulled up to any power supply
(hub or host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1.5kΩ pull-up resistor. Failure to
do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.
Figure 6.3 illustrates a self-powered design which has a +3.3V to +5.25V supply.
Note:
   1. When the FT240X is in reset, the interface I/O pins are tri-stated. Input pins have internal 200kΩ
      pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external logic.

A requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode the application draws a
total current of less than 2.5mA. This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the
ability to power itself down into a low current state by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic
that cannot power itself down in this way, the FT240X provides a simple but effective method of turning
off power during the USB suspend mode.
Figure 6.4 shows an example of using a discrete P-Channel MOSFET to control the power to external
logic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier (www.irf.com) IRLML6402, or equivalent. It
is recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used
to limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the
transient power surge, caused when the MOSFET switches on, will reset the FT240X or the USB host/hub
controller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 6.4 powers up with a slew rate of
approximaely12.5V/Ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in
approximately 400 microseconds.
As an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used. A
suitable power switch IC for such an application is the Micrel (www.micrel.com) MIC2025-2BM or
equivalent.
With power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:
    i)    The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to
          automatically reset the logic when power is re-applied when moving out of suspend mode.
    ii) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the internal FT240X MTP memory.
    iii) The PWREN# pin should be used to switch the power to the external circuitry.
    iv) For USB high-power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up
        to 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in

   v) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered
       down using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.

7 Application Examples
The following sections illustrate possible applications of the FT240X. The illustrations have omitted pin
numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT240XS and FT240XQ package
options.
7.1 USB to MCU FIFO Interface
                                 Figure 7.1 USB to MCU FIFO Interface
A typical example of using the FT240X as a USB to Microcontroller (MCU) FIFO interface is illustrated in
Figure 7.1. This example uses two MCU I/O ports: one port (8 bits) to transfer data and the other port (4
or 5 bits) to monitor the TXE# and RXF# status bits and generate the RD# and WR strobes to the
FT240X, when required.
Using PWREN# for this function is optional.
7.2 Battery Charge Detection
An addition to the USB specification (http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/) is to allow for
additional charging profiles to be used for charging batteries in portable devices. These charging profiles
do not enumerate the USB port of the peripheral. The FT240X device will detect that a USB compliant
dedicated charging port (DCP) is connected. Once detected while in suspend mode a battery charge
detection signal is provided to allow external logic to switch to charging mode as opposed to operation
mode.

To use the FT240X with battery charging detection the CBUS pins must be reprogrammed to allow for the
BCD Charger output to switch the external charger circuitry on. The CBUS pins are configured in the
internal MTP memory with the free utility FTPROG. If the charging circuitry requires an active low signal
to enable it, the CBUS pin can be programmed to BCD Charger# as an alternative.
When connected to a USB compliant dedicated charging port (DCP, as opposed to a standard USB host)
the device USB signals will be shorted together and the device suspended. The BCD charger signal will
bring the LTC4053 out of suspend and allow battery charging to start. The charge current in the example
above is 1A as defined by the resistance on the PROG pin.
Alternatively the PWREN# And SLEEP pins may be used to control the LTC4053 such that a battery may
be charged from a standard host (low current) or from a dedicated charging port (high current). In such
a design as shown above the charge current would need to be limited to 0.4A to ensure that the USB
host power limit is not exceeded.

In the example above the FT240X SLEEP pin is used to enable/disable the LTC4053, while the PWREN#
signal alters the charging current by altering the resistance on the LTC4053 PROG pin.
To calculate the equivalent resistance on the LTC4053 PROG pin select a charge current, then Res =
1500V/Ichg
For more configuration options of the LTC4053 refer to:

Note: If the FT240X is connected to a standard host port such that the device is enumerated the battery
charge detection signal is inactive as the device will not be in suspend.

FT240X will scan its internal MTP memory and read the USB configuration descriptors stored there.
In many cases, the default values programmed into the MTP memory will be suitable and no re-
programming will be necessary. The defaults can be found in Section 8.1.
The MTP memory in the FT240X can be programmed over USB if the values need to be changed for a
particular application. Further details of this are provided from section 8.2 onwards.
Users who do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their
design can apply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs. See TN_100 USB Vendor ID/Product ID
Guidelines for more details.

8.2 Methods of Programming the MTP Memory
8.2.1 Programming the MTP memory over USB
The MTP memory on all FT-X devices can be programmed over USB. This method is the same as for the
EEPROM on other FTDI devices such as the FT232R. No additional hardware, connections or programming
voltages are required. The device is simply connected to the host computer in the same way that it would
be for normal applications, and the FT_Prog utility is used to set the required options and program the
device.
The FT_Prog utility is provided free-of-charge from the FTDI website, and can be found at the link below.
The user guide is also available at this link. Note that the FT-X devices require FT_Prog version 2.5 or
later.
http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm#FT_Prog
Additionally, D2XX commands can be used to program the MTP memory from within user applications.
For more information on the commands available, please see the D2XX Programmers Guide.

                              Figure 8.1: Simplified memory map for the FT-X
User Memory Area
The User Memory Areas are highlighted in Green on the memory map. They can be read and written via
USB on the FT240X. All locations within this range are freely programmable; no areas have special
functions and there is no checksum for the user area.
Note: The application should take into account the specification for the number of write cycles in Section
5.4 if it will be writing to the MTP memory multiple times.
Configuration Memory Area (writable)
This area stores the configuration data for the device, including the data which is returned to the host in
the configuration descriptors (e.g. the VID, PID and string descriptions) and also values which set the
hardware configuration (the signal assigned to each CBUS pin for example).
These values can have a significant effect on the behaviour of the device. Steps must be taken to ensure
that these locations are not written to un-intentionally by an application which is intended to access only
the user area.
This area is included in a checksum which covers configuration areas of the memory, and so changing
any value can also cause this checksum to fail.
Configuration Memory Area (non-writable)
This is a reserved area and the application should not write to this area of memory. Any attempt to write
these locations will fail.
