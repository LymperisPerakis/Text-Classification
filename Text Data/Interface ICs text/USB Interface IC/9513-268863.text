USB 2.0 Hub and 10/100 Ethernet Controller
Overview
              The LAN9513/LAN9513i is a high performance Hi-Speed USB 2.0 hub with a 10/100 Ethernet
              controller. With applications ranging from embedded systems, desktop PCs, notebook PCs, printers,
              game consoles, and docking stations, the LAN9513/LAN9513i is targeted as a high performance, low
              cost USB/Ethernet and USB/USB connectivity solution.
              The LAN9513/LAN9513i contains an integrated USB 2.0 hub, three integrated downstream USB 2.0
              PHYs, an integrated upstream USB 2.0 PHY, a 10/100 Ethernet PHY, a 10/100 Ethernet Controller, a
              TAP controller, and a EEPROM controller. A block diagram of the LAN9513/LAN9513i is provided in
              Figure 1 .
              The LAN9513/LAN9513i hub provides over 30 programmable features, including:
              PortMap (also referred to as port remap) which provides flexible port mapping and disabling
              sequences. The downstream ports of the LAN9513/LAN9513i hub can be reordered or disabled in any
              sequence to support multiple platform designs’ with minimum effort. For any port that is disabled, the
              LAN9513/LAN9513i automatically reorders the remaining ports to match the USB host controller’s port
              numbering scheme.
              PortSwap which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows
              direct alignment of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors avoiding uneven trace length or crossing of the
              USB differential signals on the PCB.
              PHYBoost which enables four programmable levels of USB signal drive strength in USB port
              transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore USB signal integrity that has been compromised by system
              level variables such as poor PCB layout, long cables, etc..
