USB5926C
2.0      INTRODUCTION
2.1      General Description
The Microchip USB5926C hub is a low-power, OEM configurable, USB 3.1 Gen 1 hub controller with 6 downstream
ports and advanced features for embedded USB applications. The USB5926C is fully compliant with the Universal Serial
Bus Revision 3.1 Specification and USB 2.0 Link Power Management Addendum. The USB5926C supports 5 Gbps
SuperSpeed (SS), 480 Mbps Hi-Speed (HS), 12 Mbps Full-Speed (FS), and 1.5 Mbps Low-Speed (LS) USB down-
stream devices on all enabled downstream ports.
The USB5926C supports the legacy USB speeds (HS/FS/LS) through a dedicated USB 2.0 hub controller that is the
culmination of five generations of Microchip hub controller design and experience with proven reliability, interoperability,
and device compatibility. The SuperSpeed hub controller operates in parallel with the USB 2.0 hub controller, decoupling
the 5 Gbps SS data transfers from bottlenecks due to the slower USB 2.0 traffic.
The USB5926C hub feature controller enables OEMs to configure their system using “Configuration Straps.” These
straps simplify the configuration process, assigning default values to USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports and GPIOs. OEMs can dis-
able ports, enable battery charging, and define GPIO functions as default assignments on power-up, removing the need
for OTP or external SPI ROM.
The USB5926C supports downstream battery charging via the integrated battery charger detection circuitry, which sup-
ports the USB-IF Battery Charging (BC1.2) detection method and most Apple devices. The USB5926C provides the
battery charging handshake and supports the following USB-IF BC1.2 charging profiles:
•  DCP: Dedicated Charging Port (Power brick with no data)
•  CDP: Charging Downstream Port (1.5A with data)
•  SDP: Standard Downstream Port (0.5A with data)
•  Custom profiles loaded via SMBus or OTP
Additionally, the USB5926C includes many powerful and unique features such as:
The Hub Feature Controller, which provides an internal USB device dedicated for use as a USB to I2C/UART/SPI/
GPIO interface, allowing external circuits or devices to be monitored, controlled, or configured via the USB interface.
PortSwap, which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows direct alignment
of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors to avoid uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differential signals on the
PCB.
PHYBoost, which provides programmable levels of Hi-Speed USB signal drive strength
in the downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore USB signal integrity
in a compromised system environment. The graphic on the right shows an example of
Hi-Speed USB eye diagrams before and after PHYBoost signal integrity restoration. in
a compromised system environment.
VariSense, which controls the USB receiver sensitivity enabling programmable levels of USB signal receive sensitivity.
This capability allows operation in a sub-optimal system environment, such as when a captive USB cable is used.
Port Split, which allows for the USB3.1 Gen1 and USB2.0 portions of downstream ports 3 and 4 to operate inde-
pendently and enumerate two separate devices in parallel in special applications.
USB Power Delivery Billboard Device, which allows an internal device to enumerate as a Billboard class device when
a Power Delivery Alternate Mode negotiation has failed. The Billboard device will enumerate temporarily to the host PC
when a failure occurs, as indicated by a digital signal from an external Power Delivery controller.
The USB5926C can be configured for operation through internal default settings. Custom OEM configurations are sup-
ported through external SPI ROM or OTP ROM. All port control signal pins are under firmware control in order to allow
for maximum operational flexibility, and are available as GPIOs for customer specific use.
The USB5926C is available in commercial (0°C to +70°C) and industrial (-40°C to +85°C) temperature ranges. An inter-
nal block diagram of the USB5926C is shown in Figure 2-1.

3.3       USB5926C Pin Descriptions
This section contains descriptions of the various USB5926C pins. The pin descriptions have been broken into functional
groups as follows:
•  USB 3.1 Gen 1 Pin Descriptions
•  USB 2.0 Pin Descriptions
•  Port Control Pin Descriptions
•  SPI Interface
•  USB Type-C Connector Controls
•  Miscellaneous Pin Descriptions
•  Configuration Strap Pin Descriptions
•  Power and Ground Pin Descriptions
The “_N” symbol in the signal name indicates that the active, or asserted, state occurs when the signal is at a low voltage
level. For example, RESET_N indicates that the reset signal is active low. When “_N” is not present after the signal
name, the signal is asserted when at the high voltage level.
The terms assertion and negation are used exclusively. This is done to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of
“active low” and “active high” signal. The term assert, or assertion, indicates that a signal is active, independent of
whether that level is represented by a high or low voltage. The term negate, or negation, indicates that a signal is inac-
tive.

                                             3.3 V.
                                             For self-powered applications with a permanently
                                             attached host, this pin must be connected to either 3.3 V
                                             or 5.0 V through a resistor divider to provide 3.3 V.
                                             In embedded applications, VBUS_DET may be controlled

3.5      Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions
Configuration straps are multi-function pins that are used during Power-On Reset (POR) or external chip reset
(RESET_N) to determine the default configuration of a particular feature. The state of the signal is latched following de-
assertion of the reset. Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. This section details the various
device configuration straps and associated programmable pin functions.
  Note:     The system designer must guarantee that configuration straps meet the timing requirements specified in
            Section 10.6.2, Power-On and Configuration Strap Timing and Section 10.6.3, Reset and Configuration
            Strap Timing. If configuration straps are not at the correct voltage level prior to being latched, the device
            may capture incorrect strap values.
3.5.1       CFG_STRAP CONFIGURATION
The CFG_STRAP pin is used to place the hub into preset modes of operation. The resistor options are a 200 kΩ pull-
down, 200 kΩ pull-up, 10 kΩ pull-down, 10 kΩ pull-up, 10 Ω pull-down, and 10 Ω pull-up as shown in Table 3-11.

3.5.2       PORT DISABLE CONFIGURATION (PRT_DIS_P[6:1] / PRT_DIS_M[6:1])
The PRT_DIS_P[6:1] and PRT_DIS_M[6:1] configuration straps are used in conjunction to disable the related port (6-1).
For PRT_DIS_Px (where x is the corresponding port 6-1):
    0 = Port x D+ Enabled
    1 = Port x D+ Disabled
For PRT_DIS_Mx (where x is the corresponding port 6-1):
    0 = Port x D- Enabled
    1 = Port x D- Disabled
  Note:     Both PRT_DIS_Px and PRT_DIS_Mx (where x is the corresponding port) must be tied to 3.3 V to disable
            the associated downstream port. Disabling the USB 2.0 port will also disable the corresponding USB 3.1
            Gen 1 port.

3.5.3        NON-REMOVABLE PORT CONFIGURATION (CFG_NON_REM)
The CFG_NON_REM configuration strap is used to configure the non-removable port settings of the device to one of
five settings. These modes are selected by the configuration of an external resistor on the CFG_NON_REM pin. The
resistor options are a 200 kΩ pull-down, 200 kΩ pull-up, 10 kΩ pull-down, 10 kΩ pull-up, 10 Ω pull-down and 10 Ω pull-
up as shown in Table 3-12.

3.5.5        GENERAL PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT CONFIGURATION (GPIOx)
General Purpose Inputs/Outputs may be used for application specific purposes. Any given GPIO may operate as an
input or an output. Inputs can apply an internal 50kΩ pull-down or pull-up resistor. Outputs may drive low or drive high
(3.3V). GPIOs may be configured and manipulated during runtime (while enumerated to a host) in one of two ways:
• SMBus configuration
• USB to GPIO bridging
3.5.5.1        SMBus configuration
The SMBus slave interface may be used to write to internal registers that configure the state of the GPIO. Refer to the
“Configuration Options for Microchip USB58xx and USB59xx Hubs” application note for additional details.
3.5.5.2        USB to GPIO Bridging
USB to GPIO Bridging may be used to write to internal registers that configure the state of the GPIO. USB to GPIO
bridging operates via host communication to the hub’s internal Hub Feature Controller. Refer to the “USB to GPIO Bridg-
ing for Microchip USB3.1 Gen 1 Hubs” application note for additional details.

5.0     MODES OF OPERATION
The device provides two main modes of operation: Standby Mode and Hub Mode. These modes are controlled via the
RESET_N pin, as shown in Table 5-1.
    TABLE 5-1:        MODES OF OPERATION
      RESET_N Input                                                   Summary
             0            Standby Mode: This is the lowest power mode of the device. No functions are active
                          other than monitoring the RESET_N input. All port interfaces are high impedance and
                          the PLL is halted. Refer to Section 8.3.2, External Chip Reset (RESET_N) for additional
                          information on RESET_N.
             1            Hub (Normal) Mode: The device operates as a configurable USB hub with battery
                          charger detection. This mode has various sub-modes of operation, as detailed in
                          Figure 5-1. Power consumption is based on the number of active ports, their speed,
                          and amount of data transferred.
The flowchart in Figure 5-1 details the modes of operation and how the device traverses through the Hub Mode stages
(shown in bold). The remaining sub-sections provide more detail on each stage of operation.

USB5926C
5.1        Standby Mode
If the RESET_N pin is asserted, the hub will be in Standby Mode. This mode provides a very low power state for maxi-
mum power efficiency when no signaling is required. This is the lowest power state. In Standby Mode all downstream
ports are disabled, the USB data pins are held in a high-impedance state, all transactions immediately terminate (no
states saved), all internal registers return to their default state, the PLL is halted, and core logic is powered down in order
to minimize power consumption. Because core logic is powered off, no configuration settings are retained in this mode
and must be re-initialized after RESET_N is negated high.
5.2        SPI Initialization Stage (SPI_INIT)
The first stage, the initialization stage, occurs on the deassertion of RESET_N. In this stage, the internal logic is reset,
the PLL locks if a valid clock is supplied, and the configuration registers are initialized to their default state. The internal
firmware then checks for an external SPI ROM. The firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid
signature of “2DFU” (device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the
external ROM is enabled and the code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid signa-
ture is not found, then execution continues from internal ROM (CFG_RD stage).
When using an external SPI ROM, a 1 Mbit, 60 MHz or faster ROM must be used. Both 1- and 2-bit SPI operation are
supported. For optimum throughput, a 2-bit SPI ROM is recommended. Both mode 0 and mode 3 SPI ROMs are also
supported.
If the system is not strapped for SPI Mode, code execution will continue from internal ROM (CFG_RD stage).
5.3        Configuration Read Stage (CFG_RD)
In this stage, the internal firmware loads the default values from the internal ROM and then uses the configuration strap-
ping options to override the default values. Refer to Section 3.5, Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions for
information on usage of the various device configuration straps.
5.4        Strap Read Stage (STRAP)
In this stage, the firmware registers the configuration strap settings and checks the state of CFG_STRAP. If
CFG_STRAP is set for CONFIG2, then the hub will check the state of the SMBDATA and SMBCLK pins. If 10k pull-up
resistors are detected on both pins, the device will enter the SOC_CFG stage. If 10k pull-up resistors are not detected
on both pins, the hub will transition to the OTP_CFG stage instead.
5.5        SOC Configuration Stage (SOC_CFG)
In this stage, the SOC can modify any of the default configuration settings specified in the integrated ROM, such as USB
device descriptors and port electrical settings.
There is no time limit on this mode. In this stage the firmware will wait indefinitely for the SMBus/I2C configuration. When
the SOC has completed configuring the device, it must write to register 0xFF to end the configuration.
5.6        OTP Configuration Stage (OTP_CFG)
Once the SOC has indicated that it is done with configuration, all configuration data is combined in this stage. The
default data, the SOC configuration data, and the OTP data are all combined in the firmware and the device is pro-
grammed.
After the device is fully configured, it will go idle and then into suspend if there is no VBUS or Hub.Connect present.
Once VBUS is present, and battery charging is enabled, the device will transition to the Battery Charger Detection
Stage. If VBUS is present, and battery charging is not enabled, the device will transition to the Connect stage.
5.7        Hub Connect Stage (Hub.Connect)
Once the CHGDET stage is completed, the device enters the Hub Connect stage. USB connect can be initiated by
asserting the VBUS pin function high. The device will remain in the Hub Connect stage indefinitely until the VBUS pin
function is deasserted.

5.8       Normal Mode
Lastly, the hub enters Normal Mode of operation. In this stage full USB operation is supported under control of the USB
Host on the upstream port. The device will remain in the normal mode until the operating mode is changed by the sys-
tem.

             ies within Microchip USB5926C product page at www.microchip.com/USB5926C.
7.1        SPI Master Interface
The device is capable of code execution from an external SPI ROM. When configured for SPI Mode, on power up the
firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid signature of 2DFU (device firmware upgrade) begin-
ning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the external ROM is enabled and the code execution begins
at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid signature is not found, then execution continues from internal
ROM.
    Note:    For SPI timing information, refer to Section 10.6.7, SPI Timing.
7.2        SMBus Slave Interface
The device includes an integrated SMBus slave interface, which can be used to access internal device run time registers
or program the internal OTP memory. SMBus slave detection is accomplished by setting the CFG_STRAP in the correct
configuration followed by detection of pull-up resistors on both the SMDAT and SMCLK signals during the hub’s boot-
up sequence. Refer to Section 3.5.1, CFG_STRAP Configuration for additional information.
    Note:    All configuration is to be performed via the Pro-Touch2 programming tool. For additional information on the
             Pro-Touch2 programming tool, refer to Software Libraries within Microchip USB5926C product page at

7.3        I2C Bridge Interface
The I2C Bridge interface implements a subset of the I2C Master Specification (Please refer to the Philips Semiconductor
Standard I2C-Bus Specification for details on I2C bus protocols). The I2C Bridge conforms to the Fast-Mode I2C Spec-
ification (400 kbit/s transfer rate and 7-bit addressing) for protocol and electrical compatibility. The device acts as the
master and generates the serial clock SCL, controls the bus access (determines which device acts as the transmitter
and which device acts as the receiver), and generates the START and STOP conditions. The I2C Bridge interface fre-
quency is configurable through the I2C Bridging commands. I2C Bridge frequencies are derived from the formula
626KHz/n, where n is any integer from 1 to 256. Refer to Section 3.5.1, CFG_STRAP Configuration for additional infor-
mation.
    Note:    Extensions to the I2C Specification are not supported.
             All configuration is to be performed via the Pro-Touch2 programming tool. For additional information on the
             Pro-Touch2 programming tool, refer to Software Libraries within Microchip USB5926C product page at

8.0        FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
This section details various USB5926C functions, including:
•  USB Type-C Receptacle Support
•  Battery Charging
•  Resets
•  Link Power Management (LPM)
•  Remote Wakeup Indicator
•  Port Control Interface
•  Port Split
8.1        USB Type-C Receptacle Support
The USB5926C has built-in support for the USB Type-C receptacle. There are 3 fundamental configurations:
• External USB 3.1 Gen 1 Multiplexer
• Internal USB3.1 Gen 1 Multiplexer, “Type-C Control Mode 1”
• Internal USB 3.1 Gen 1 Multiplexer, “Type-C Control Mode 2”
8.1.1         EXTERNAL USB 3.1 GEN 1 MULTIPLEXER
C_ATTACH[0:2] pins are used to signal to the hub when a valid USB Type-C connection has been detected. This func-
tionality requires an external USB Type-C controller such as a Microchip UTC2000 to monitor the USB Type-C recep-
tacle for a valid attach. This signal is used to enable and disable clocking to the USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHY in order to reduce
power consumption when there is no USB Type-C attach.
The polarity of the C_ATTACH[0:2] pins are controlled by the CC_POL pin. See Table 3-6 for details.
A diagram of a USB Type-C Downstream Facing Port with a USB5926C, Microchip UTC2000, and external multiplexer
is shown in Figure 8-1.

8.1.2       INTERNAL USB3.1 GEN 1 MULTIPLEXER, “TYPE-C CONTROL MODE 1”
“Type-C Control Mode 1” is enabled by setting the ALT_MUX_EN signal low or leaving it floating. While in “Type-C Con-
trol Mode 1”, the C_ATTACH[0:2] and AB[0:2] pins are used together to signal to the hub when a valid USB Type-C
connection has been detected and in what orientation the connection has been detected. This functionality requires an
external USB Type-C controller such as a Microchip UTC2000 to monitor the USB Type-C receptacle for a valid attach.
These signal are used to enable/disable the USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHYs appropriately according to the detected Type-C attach
and orientation. Unused USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHYs are disabled to conserve power.
The polarity of the C_ATTACH[0:2] pins and AB[0:2] are controlled by the CC_POL pin. See Table 3-6 for details.

8.2         Battery Charging
The device can be configured by an OEM to have any of the downstream ports support battery charging. The hub’s role
in battery charging is to provide acknowledgment to a device’s query as to whether the hub system supports USB battery
charging. The hub silicon does not provide any current or power FETs or any additional circuitry to actually charge the
device. Those components must be provided externally by the OEM.

If the OEM provides an external supply capable of supplying current per the battery charging specification, the hub can
be configured to indicate the presence of such a supply from the device. This indication, via the PRT_CTL[6:1] pins, is
on a per port basis. For example, the OEM can configure two ports to support battery charging through high current
power FETs and leave the other two ports as standard USB ports.

8.3         Resets
• Power-On Reset (POR)
• External Chip Reset (RESET_N)
• USB Bus Reset
8.3.1          POWER-ON RESET (POR)
A power-on reset occurs whenever power is initially supplied to the device, or if power is removed and reapplied to the
device. A timer within the device will assert the internal reset per the specifications listed in Section 10.6.2, Power-On
and Configuration Strap Timing.
8.3.2          EXTERNAL CHIP RESET (RESET_N)
A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N, after all power supplies are within operating range, per the
specifications in Section 10.6.3, Reset and Configuration Strap Timing. While reset is asserted, the device (and its asso-
ciated external circuitry) enters Standby Mode and consumes minimal current.
Assertion of RESET_N causes the following:
1.    The PHY is disabled and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
2.    All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
3.    All internal registers return to the default state.
4.    The external crystal oscillator is halted.
5.    The PLL is halted.
    Note:      All power supplies must have reached the operating levels mandated in Section 10.2, Operating Condi-
               tions**, prior to (or coincident with) the assertion of RESET_N.

8.3.3         USB BUS RESET
In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the device, the device performs the following:
1.   Sets default address to 0.
2.   Sets configuration to Unconfigured.
3.   Moves device from suspended to active (if suspended).
4.   Complies with the USB Specification for behavior after completion of a reset sequence.
The host then configures the device in accordance with the USB Specification.
   Note:      The device does not propagate the upstream USB reset to downstream devices.
8.4        Link Power Management (LPM)
The device supports the L0 (On), L1 (Sleep), and L2 (Suspend) link power management states. These supported LPM
states offer low transitional latencies in the tens of microseconds versus the much longer latencies of the traditional USB
suspend/resume in the tens of milliseconds. The supported LPM states are detailed in Table 8-1.

8.5        Remote Wakeup Indicator
The remote wakeup indicator feature uses SUSP_IND as a side band signal to wake up the host when in USB 2.0 sus-
pend. This feature is enabled and disabled via the HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT configuration bit in the hub configuration
space register HUB_CFG_3. The only way to control the bit is by configuration EEPROM, SMBus or internal ROM
default setting. The state is only modified during a power on reset, or hardware reset. No dynamic reconfiguring of this
capability is possible.
When HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT = ‘0’, Normal Resume Behavior per the USB 2.0 specification
When HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT = ‘1’, Modified Resume Behavior is enabled
   Note:     The SUSP_IND signal only indicates the USB2.0 state.
8.6        Port Control Interface
Port power and over-current sense share the same pin (PRT_CTLx) for each port. These functions can be controlled
directly from the USB hub, or via the processor. Additionally, smart port controllers can be controlled via the I2C inter-
face.
The device can be configured into one of the two following port control modes:
• Ganged Mode - A single GANG_PWR pin controls power and detects over-current events for all downstream
   ports.
• Individual Mode - Each port has an individual PRT_CTLx pin for independent port power control and over-current
   detection.
Port connection in various modes are detailed in the following subsections.

USB5926C
8.6.1        PORT CONNECTION IN GANGED MODE
Ganged Mode is enabled via SMBus or OTP configuration. GANG_PWR becomes the port control (PRTCTL) pin for all
downstream ports when the hub is configured for ganged port power control mode. All port power controllers should be
controlled from this pin when the hub is configured for ganged port power mode. While in this mode of operation, an
over-current event on any single downstream port will cause all downstream ports to be flagged for over-current.
8.6.2        PORT CONNECTION IN INDIVIDUAL MODE
8.6.2.1        Port Power Control using USB Power Switch
Individual mode is the default mode of operation. When operating in individual mode, the device will have one port power
control and over-current sense pin for each downstream port. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a
'0'. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation, the pull-up resistor will be disabled at that time. When port power is
enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable the pull-up resistor, making it an open drain output. If there is an
over-current situation, the USB Power Switch will assert the open drain OCS signal. The Schmidt trigger input will rec-
ognize that as a low. The open drain output does not interfere. The over-current sense filter handles the transient con-
ditions such as low voltage while the device is powering up.

When the port is enabled, the PRT_CTLx pin input is constantly sampled. Overcurrent events can be detected in one
of two ways:
• Single, continuous low pulse (consecutive low samples over tocs_single), as shown in Figure 8-8.
• Two short low pulses within a rolling window (two groupings of 1 or more low samples over tocs_double), as shown
   in Figure 8-9.

To maximize compatibility with various port power control topologies, the parameters tocs_single and tocs_double are con-
figurable via the Overcurrent Minimum Pulse Width Register and Overcurrent Inactive Timer Register.
The pin also has a turn-on “lockout” feature where the state of the pin is ignored for a configured amount of time imme-
diately after port power is turned on. This prevents slow ramp times due to parasitic resistance/capacitance attached to
the pin from triggering false overcurrent detections. This parameter is configurable via the Overcurrent Lockout Timer
Register.

8.6.2.2         Port Power Control using Poly Fuse
When using the device with a poly fuse, there is no need for an output power control. To maintain consistency, the same
circuit will be used. A single port power control and over-current sense for each downstream port is still used from the
Hub's perspective. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a '0'. This will have no effect as the external
diode will isolate pin from the load. When port power is enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable the pull-up
resistor. This means that the pull-up resistor is providing 3.3 volts to the anode of the diode. If there is an over-current
situation, the poly fuse will open. This will cause the cathode of the diode to go to 0 volts. The anode of the diode will
be at 0.7 volts, and the Schmidt trigger input will register this as a low resulting in an over-current detection. The open
drain output does not interfere.
   Note:      The USB 2.0 and USB 3.1 Gen 1 bPwrOn2PwrGood descriptors must be set to 0 when using poly-fuse
              mode. Refer to the “Configuration Options for the USB58xx and USB59xx” Microchip application note for
              details on how to change these values.

8.7       Port Split
8.7.1        FEATURE OVERVIEW
This feature allows the USB 2.0 and USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHYs associated with any downstream port to be operationally
separated. The intention of this feature is to allow a system designer to connect an embedded USB 3.x device to the
USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHY, while allowing the USB 2.0 PHY to be used as either a standard USB 2.0 port or with a separate
embedded USB 2.0 device.
This feature operates outside of the provisions of the USB specifications. Operation is intended for specialized applica-
tions only. Contact your local sales representative for additional information.
In order to maintain a positive end user experience, it is recommended that only permanently attached, embedded USB
3.x devices be connected to the USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHY when enabling the Port Split feature. This prevents end users from
attempting to connect USB High-Speed, Full-Speed, or Low-Speed devices to an exposed USB port which only has USB
3.1 Gen 1 connections.

8.7.2        PORT SPLITTING CONFIGURATION
Downstream ports 3 and 4 may be configured for Port Splitting. Port Splitting is configured via register configuration
through SMBus during the hub configuration stage (SOC_CFG) or via the hub’s internal OTP memory.
When Port Splitting is enabled, the existing PRT_CTLx pin associated with that port will continue to control the USB 2.0
portion of the port in an identical matter. A new pin function assigned to a GPIOx pin will be activated and configured to
control the USB 3.1 Gen 1 portion of the port. This new pin is named PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT where x indicates the
respective port. Note that overcurrent detection is not supported on the PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT pin. These new pins
are assigned as shown in Table 8-5.

8.7.2.2         Link Timeout Reset
Port Splitting is intended for use with embedded USB 3.x devices only. When Port Splitting is enabled, the hub constantly
monitors the USB 3.1 Gen 1 Link to see if a valid USB 3.1 Gen 1 Link is established. If there is no valid USB 3.1 Gen 1
Link for a configured amount of time (see below), then the hub will toggle assertion of the associated “PRTPWRx-
_USB3_SPLIT” pin in an attempt to reset the embedded USB 3.1 Gen 1 device and re-establish the USB 3.1 Gen 1 Link.
The timer is always reset and restarted whenever the timeout occurs.
A valid USB 3.1 Gen 1 link is qualified by the LTSSM_STATE register status for the port. A normal Link will actively
switch through many Link states.
If the hub detects that the Link is staying in one of the following Link states the entire duration of the timeout timer, then
the Link is stuck in an invalid state and PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT will be toggled in order to attempt to re-establish the
Link.
•   SIS.Disabled(0x4)
•   Rx.Detect(0x5)
•   SS.Inactive(0x6)
•   Polling(0x7)
•   Recovery(0x8)
•   HotReset (0x9)
The Link Timeout Reset value is configured via register 0x4171 and can be overridden by OTP. The default value is
0x05, which selects a Timeout value of 1 second. Setting the register to 0x00 will disable the Link Timeout Reset feature.
The duration of the Link reset (time which PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT signal stays low) can be configured in register
0x4176. The default duration is 400ms with a configurable range of 350ms to 2.9s.

USB Billboard is supported by the USB5926C in conjunction with an external USB Power Delivery capable controller
that supports the USB PD stack and alternate mode negotiation.
When a USB Type-C enabled product supports alternate modes for enhanced capability beyond what is available
through USB connectivity alone, that product must support a USB Billboard endpoint so that a user will be notified by
an operating system when the enhanced capability is not enabled due to an alternate mode mismatch.
A good example of alternate mode functionality is support for a DisplayPort monitor that many docking stations provide.
In this case, the docking station offers DisplayPort (DP) capability over the USB-C connector as an alternate mode.The
DP monitor will only function correctly when a successful alternate mode negotiation occurs between the docking station
and the notebook PC (this is the USB-C to USB-C connection). In order for the alternate mode negotiation to succeed,
the Notebook and the Docking Station must both support DP over USB-C, and have the DP messaging capability
enabled to support alternate mode negotiation. If the alternate mode negotiation is successful, then the notebook and
the Docking Station both change their multiplexers to enable DP signaling over USB Type-C. In this case, no USB Bill-
board messages need to be displayed.

USB5926C
If the above example instead uses a notebook that doesn’t support DP over USB-C, then the alternate mode negotiation
will fail. The docking station will not have a way to enable the DP monitor capability, reducing functionality for the cus-
tomer. For this is the reason, USB Billboard capability is mandated. In this case, a USB Billboard device class endpoint
must appear on a hub port within the Docking Station, and it must provide text and or a web site link which will provide
information to the user regarding the corrective steps required to use the feature.
In the case of the USB5926C, all of the above mentioned negotiation capability will occur outside of the USB5926C via
an external USB Power Delivery capable device that contains a full USB PD stack and can communicate via USB PD
messaging. In an alternate mode failure case, the USB5926C will provide that message by allowing the USB host to
enumerate an internal USB Billboard Device Class just after the failure in response to a signal from the external USB
PD controller. The Billboard Device descriptors will contain the failure message to the USB Host. The message itself will
be prerecorded in the device’s OTP memory.
8.8.1         BILLBOARD ENABLE IN OTP AND GPIOx PIN USE
Any of the GPIOx pins may be selected to use as the BILLBOARD_EN input. By default, GPIO68 is selected when the
Billboard feature is enabled.
The BILLBOARD_EN input signal is active low. When the pin is driven low by a Power Delivery controller to indicate
an alternate mode negotiation failure, the Billboard functionality will activate.

8.8.2         BILLBOARD ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY
When the applicable GPIOx pin is 0, which indicates that Billboard device must be displayed, the following sequence
of events will occur:
1.   USB5926C will force the Hub Feature Controller internal device to disconnect from the USB Hub port (emulating
     a physical detach)
2.   USB5926C will force the Hub Feature Controller to re-connect with descriptors that will show the Hub Feature
     Controller endpoint is a Billboard device, compliant to version 1.1 of the Billboard device class specification.
3.   USB5926C will start a timer (Timer A) when the Host sets the Hub Feature Controller USB address. This timer
     will be used to ensure that the Billboard endpoint will not remain permanently attached if it is never accessed.
     The default Timer A timeout is 20 seconds.
4.   This implementation will only support Billboard when a failure occurs, therefore the Device Container uses a
     static list of device capabilities and will only expose the Billboard Device on failure to enter into Modal Operation
     and will set the bmConfigured descriptor field to “Unspecified Error” (00b) by default.
5.   The Hub Feature Controller will Provide the iAlternateModeString when the host requests it, and will start a timer
     (Timer B). The default Timer B timeout is 20 seconds.
6.   When either timer expires, the USB5926C will force the Hub Feature Controller internal device to disconnect from
     the USB Hub port (emulating a physical detach).
7.   USB5926C will force the Hub Feature Controller to re-connect with the standard Hub Feature Controller Func-
     tionality.

USB5926C
9.0       COMPLIANCE UPDATE
In order to be USB-IF certified , silicon revision C and newer of the USB5926C supports the USB 3.1 Engineering
Change Notices (ECNs) included in the Universal Serial Bus Revision 3.2 Specification. This allows the latest revision
of the USB5926C to be certified in compliance with USB-IF logo testing for the new USB Type-C™ industry initiative.
The following compliance updates are supported:
• Pending Header Packet (HP) Timer (TD7.9, TD7.11, TD7.26)
• Power Management (PM) Timer (TD7.18, TD7.20, TD7.23)
• Unacknowledged Connect and Remote Wake Test Failure (TD10.25)
These USB 3.1 ECNs can be found as part of the Universal Serial Bus Revision 3.2 Specification zip file, which can be
downloaded from the USB developers website (http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/).
9.1       Pending Header Packet (HP) Timer (TD7.9, TD7.11, TD7.26)
A turn around time is defined between the communication of a Host and Device (Link Partners) for an acknowledgment
of a USB connection. The time is budgeted between a number of steps (Transmit/Receive data path of the initiator, the
delay in the cable, and the response time of the responder). If the time is exceeded, no USB communication is initiated.
The ECN calls to relax the timing from 3us to 10us at the link and PHY layers to allow for an extended propagation delay
to account for the usage of active cables and retimers in new SuperSpeed Plus designs.
Impact to Legacy Systems:
• A new host with a retimer connected to an active cable AND a legacy device
• A legacy host connected to an active cable and a new device with or without a retimer
9.2       Power Management (PM) Timer (TD7.18, TD7.20, TD7.23)
There are three timers for link power management: PM_LC_TIMER, PM_ENTRY_TIMER, and Ux_EXIT_TIMER. The
PM_LC_TIMER is used for a port initiating an entry request to a low power link state. The PM_ENTRY_TIMER is used
for a port accepting the entry request to a low power link state. Ux_EXIT_TIMER is used for a port to initiate the exit
from U1 or U2 to a low power state.
The ECN calls to increase the maximum timeout values to accommodate for the new connectivity models with retimers
and active cables beyond the standard USB-IF transmission lengths.
Impact to Legacy Systems:
• No impact to USB 3.0 or early USB 3.1 ecosystems
9.3       Unacknowledged Connect and Remote Wake Test Failure (TD10.25)
If a USB3 port with a connected device is placed into Suspend and RemoteWake is set but the RemoteWake mask
(C_PORT_CONNECTION bit) has not been cleared, the USB3 hub will automatically issue a wake up signal to the host.
In legacy systems, if a USB3 port with a connected device was placed into Suspend and RemoteWake is set without
the mask bit being cleared, the USB3 hub would NOT issue a wake up signal to the host.
Impact to Legacy Systems:
• No impact – with the new implementation, a remote wake is automatically initiated if the mask bit is not set. In
   older systems the remote wake may or may not have been executed.

  Note 1: When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the absolute max-
             imum ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage spikes on
             their outputs when AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the AC power line may
             appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested to use a clamp circuit.

10.4      Power Consumption
The values shown below represent typical power consumption as measured during various modes of operation. Power
dissipation is determined by temperature, supply voltage, and external source/sink requirements.
The following measurements were taken with VDD33 equal to 3.3V, VDD12 equal to 1.2V, at an ambient temperature
of 25°C.
   Note:     A USB 3.x hub operates both the USB 3.x and USB 2.0 interfaces in parallel on it’s upstream port connec-
             tion. A port operating under the SS/HS condition indicates that a USB 3.x hub was connected to it.

   Note:     Actual power consumption will vary depending on the capabilities of the USB host, the devices connected,
             data type, and data bus utilization. The published data represents typical power consumption of the hub at
             nominal ambient temperature and supply voltage while large file transfers are active between USB host and
             USB Mass Storage class devices on all downstream ports.

10.7        Clock Specifications
The device can accept either a 25MHz crystal or a 25MHz single-ended clock oscillator (±50ppm) input. If the single-
ended clock oscillator method is implemented, XTALO should be left unconnected and XTALI/CLKIN should be driven
with a nominal 0-3.3V clock signal. The input clock duty cycle is 40% minimum, 50% typical and 60% maximum.
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XTALI/XTALO). The following circuit design (Figure 10-6) and specifications (Table 10-10) are required to ensure
proper operation.

             the value of the two external load capacitors. These two external load capacitors determine the accuracy of
             the 25.000 MHz frequency.
10.7.2       EXTERNAL REFERENCE CLOCK (CLKIN)
When using an external reference clock, the following input clock specifications are suggested:
• 25 MHz
• 50% duty cycle ±10%, ±100 ppm
• Jitter < 100 ps RMS

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
           intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
           knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
           Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
           mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of
    Microchip devices in life support and/or safety applications is entirely at the buyer’s risk, and the buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and
    hold harmless Microchip from any and all damages, claims, suits, or expenses resulting from such use. No licenses are conveyed, implic-
