                 Rev. 1.1 — 25 July 2017                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
             PTN5100 is a single port USB Type-C Power Delivery (PD) PHY and Protocol IC that
             provides Type-C Configuration channel interface and USB PD Physical and Protocol layer
             functions to a System PD Port Policy Controller (Policy Engine and Device Policy
             Manager, Alternate mode controller). It complies with USB PD[1] and Type-C[2]
             specifications and delta updates of PD spec. This IC is targeted for a wide range of
             platforms (Standard Notebook PCs, Desktop PCs, Chromebooks, Tablets, Convertibles,
             Smart phones) and PC Accessories (e.g. Docks, Monitors, Cable adapters etc.)
             applications. PTN5100 is architected to deliver robust performance, compliant behavior,
             configurability and system implementation flexibility that are essential to tide over
             interoperability and compliance hurdles in the platform applications.
             PTN5100 can support system realization of the following PD roles: (i) Provider (P) only, (ii)
             Provider/Consumer (P/C) (iii) Consumer only (C) (iv) Consumer/Provider (C/P). Further, it
             can be register programmed to operate in Type-C specific Upstream Facing Port (UFP),
             Downstream Facing Port (DFP) or Dual Role Port (DRP) role.
             PTN5100 implements VCONN low RON switch with register programmable Forward
             Current protection feature. The VCON switch also provides Reverse current protection
             feature to detect reverse current flow into the system whenever (inductive or) charged
             cable is unplugged from the connector.
             PTN5100 operates from platform power supply VDD, or it can also be powered from USB
             power VBUS directly, which is especially required for operation under Dead Battery (DB)
             condition and certain platform use cases. The host interface operates on VIO supply to
             facilitate interfacing to systems that use IO supply rail different from VDD supply rail.
             It provides SPI/I2C interface for system host control/status update. The interface choice is
             pre- configured in NXP factory.
             PTN5100 is available in a small footprint package option: HVQFN20 4 mm x 4 mm,
             0.5 mm pitch.

                                   Note: HVQFN20 package ground is connected to exposed center pad. The exposed center pad
                                   must be connected to platform supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal,
                                   electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using
                                   a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board,
                                   thermal vias need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

                                                                                     USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                            a. Controlled by a PD policy controller or Alternate mode control MCU or existing
                                processor
                       On the host and device use cases, different PD roles are possible: (P), (P/C), (C), (C/P).
                       PTN5100 supports two levels of configurability and programmability:
                         • NVM configuration options - configurability in the factory through NVM configuration
                            utility
                         • I2C/SPI register programmable - read/write accesses at application/Firmware (FW)
                            level
                       PTN5100 can be partitioned into the following major functional blocks along with their
                       respective interfaces:
                         •  Type-C Configuration Channel functional block
                         •  USB Power Delivery function
                         •  VCONN Low RON Switch
                         •  Power FET Enable Control
                         •  MCU interface and Control
                       The following subsections describe the PTN5100 with its major functional blocks.
                   7.1 Type-C Configuration Channel functional block
                       Type-C Configuration Channel (CC) function operates as a front end to cable/plug
                       interface.
                       PTN5100 can operate autonomously or under MCU control. To support use cases
                       especially with autonomous mode, PTN5100 implements HW circuitry to perform the
                       following operations:
                         •  Applying 'Rp' or 'Rd' depending on the (NVM) configured role
                         •  Detecting cable/plug connect and disconnect events
                         •  Indicating Type-C current limit level in a system under DFP role
                         •  Detecting the current level supported by remote end under UFP role
                         •  Identifying plug orientation and indicating through CC_ORIENT pin
                         •  Identifying Type-C Debug accessory detection and indicating through
                            DBGACC_FOUND pin
                         • Updating event, interrupt and status registers and raising interrupt signal using INT_N
                            pin
                       In order to provide reliable connect/disconnect event triggers, debouncing is also
                       implemented as per [2].
                       PTN5100 allows for NVM configurability and/or register programmability to enable usage
                       under different platform configurations.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                              PTN5100
                                                                                     USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                   7.2 USB Power Delivery Function
                       In general, the Embedded Controller (EC) or System Management Controller (SMC)
                       handles the overall Application/Platform power management given the system states,
                       battery status, etc. It reviews capabilities and status of various power providers (USB PD,
                       AC-DC adapter, battery, docking, etc.) dynamically and determines a specific source for
                       powering/charging the platform - the power source selection is an important and platform
                       dependent aspect of Application power delivery scheme.
                         • For example, in some computing applications, EC plays a central role in controlling
                            the various power sources including USB PD. To support this, PTN5100 and Policy
                            controller MCU can be configured to negotiate and agree on power contract based on
                            command/response exchanges with EC
                         • In several applications, EC may not even exist or EC wants to play a hands-off role.
                            To support these applications, PTN5100 and Policy controller MCU can be configured
                            to operate autonomously
                       In a Type-C PD implementation, the system partitioning involves the following parts:
                         • Port PHY and Protocol layer functions  PTN5100
                         • Port policy engine and device policy management, Alternate mode support 
                            Discrete policy controller MCU
                         • System management  EC or SMC
                       PTN5100 implements USB PD PHY layer and HW intensive Protocol functions and it
                       works along with a discrete MCU to implement Full PD functionality. The combined 2-chip
                       system solution (PTN5100 and MCU) can be configured to support one or more of the
                       following PD roles:
                        1. PD Consumer (C)
                        2. PD Consumer/Provider (C/P)

                        4. PD Provider/Consumer (P/C)
                       The interface between PTN5100 and Policy controller MCU can be either SPI or I2C.
                       PTN5100 provides a transparent set of commands and register interface for the MCU to
                       control the operation and ensure safe/suitable system behavior/response. PTN5100
                       Application Programming guide [3] describes the register set supported for the PD control,
                       status updates and operational control/sequences.
                       The policy controller MCU implements PD port policy layer as per [1]. The default PD
                       power profiles are configured in the MCU and the EC could request for specific profile and
                       PD contract based on platform application. The 2-chip solution can operate autonomously
                       or under EC control.

                       PTN5100 implements USB PD PHY layer function as follows:
                         •  Slew rate controlled IO
                         •  Bit transmission and data recovery
                         •  Bi-phase Mark Coding
                         •  4B5B Line coding
                         •  CRC computation and checking
                       It handles the following Protocol layer functions:
                         •  Data Packetization and Extraction
                         •  Good CRC Response
                         •  Automated Retries
                         •  Hard reset, Cable reset
                         •  Tx and Rx buffer management
                       It handles both Transmit and Receive operation and it maintains dedicated TX and RX
                       data buffers. To minimize chances of collision, PTN5100 checks the CC line before start of
                       transmission. Once the data is transmitted or received, the I2C interface status is updated
                       and MCU is interrupted.
                       BIST mode (Tx, Rx) is also supported.
                       Note: NXP is open to engage on Firmware licensing to give a head start to customers on
                       USB PD Policy and Alternate mode Firmware front. Please contact NXP for further details.
                   7.3 VCONN Switch
                       Type-C specification defines a dedicated power pin VCONN_IN to deliver power to full
                       featured cables, dongles and cable adapters.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                PTN5100
                                                                                       USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                       PTN5100 implements very low RON switch that can deliver up to 1 A current. Depending
                       on the pin over which CC communication is established, VCONN power is delivered into
                       the other CC pin. With patented architecture, the switch implements Soft Start behavior to
                       avoid heavy inrush current flow.
                       The VCONN switch is to be used only when VCONN_IN lies within the valid range (2.7 V
                       to 5.5 V).
                       The VCONN switch can be enabled or disabled by Firmware. When in disabled condition,
                       it presents Hi-Z condition. The switch implements two important features related to
                       robustness:
                          • Forward Current Protection (FCP) that monitors over current condition (over current
                            limit is register programmable) and trips the connection by disabling the switch
                          • Reverse Current Protection (RCP) that avoids reverse current flow back into the
                            system due to inductive effects of cable unplug events
                       Further, both FCP and RCP circuitry shall be activated only when VCONN_IN is within
                       valid range.
                7.3.1 Forward Current Protection (FCP)
                       PTN5100 implements Forward current protection in VCONN switch that keeps monitoring
                       for a current flow above the preconfigured level from the system side and whenever the
                       threshold is exceeded, the switch is opened and an interrupt event is raised. The switch
                       remains open until the port controller MCU reads the status and re-enables the switch.
                7.3.2 Reverse Current Protection (RCP)
                       PTN5100 implements Reverse Current Protection in VCONN switch that watches for any
                       instantaneous reverse current flow back into the system via VCONN and whenever the
                       preconfigured threshold is exceeded, the switch is opened and an interrupt event is
                       raised. The switch remains open until the port controller MCU reads the status and
                       re-enables the switch.
                   7.4 Power FET control
                       PTN5100 implements three dedicated open drain IOs that can be used to control the
                       external power MOSFETs and enable/ disable VBUS source and sink power paths of the
                       system. These are enabled or disabled based on PD power role (provider or consumer) of
                       the Type-C interface. Based on PD negotiation and contract, the policy controller MCU
                       enables/disables the specific power path (source FET or sink FETs).
                          • EN_USBSRC: This pin is used to enable/disable the power MOSFETs that
                            corresponds to VBUS source (e.g. 5V regulated output). The FET enable can be
                            configured and controlled through the register interface by the MCU. The pin status is
                            monitored and updated in a status register.
                          • EN_USBFET1: This pin is used to enable/disable the power MOSFETs that
                            corresponds to USB PD power from external power sources or delivering VBUS
                            power to external peripherals. Its specific use as a VBUS source or sink path control
                            is programmable. The FET enable can be configured and controlled through the
                            register interface by the MCU. The pin status is monitored and updated in a status
                            register.

                           • EN_USBFET2: This pin is used to enable/disable the power MOSFETs that
                              corresponds to USB PD power from external power sources or delivering VBUS
                              power to external peripherals. It specific use as a VBUS source or sink path control is
                              programmable. The FET enable can be configured and controlled through the register
                              interface by the MCU. The pin status is monitored and updated in a status register.
                   7.5 MCU interface and control
                         PTN5100 works along with policy controller MCU to realize USB PD functionality and/or
                         Alternate mode support. The MCU can control and interface with PTN5100 through a
                         dedicated I2C/SPI interface. In a given system implementation, only one of the two
                         interfaces (I2C, SPI) can be used. This selection can be static configured via NVM.
                         PTN5100 provides up to three I2C slave address combinations based on ternary pin
                         (SLV_ADDR) setting as per the table below.

                 7.5.1 I2C-bus interface
                         PTN5100 has a slave I2C interface through which it provides a mechanism for control and
                         status interaction/communication with the MCU. It supports Standard mode, Fast mode
                         and Fast mode plus.

                         The following figure shows the basic protocol for I2C writes. A 16-bit offset is used to
                         address each register.

                         The following figure shows the basic protocol for I2C reads. They start off like I2C writes
                         by specifying a 16-bit register offset. This is followed by a repeat start condition, the Slave
                         Address (Read), and the read data.

               7.5.1.3 I2C address auto-incrementing
                       Bursts are allowed during writes and reads. Bit 15 of the register offset is the
                       auto-increment indication. If ‘0’ then the internally generated MMIO address will not
                       increment with each data byte. If ‘1’, then the address will increment with each data byte.
                       A detailed description of the I2C-bus specification, with applications, is given in user
                       manual UM10204, "I2C-bus specification and user manual" [4]. Referring to I2C protocol,
                       PTN5100 positively acknowledges all 256 register offset addresses, though there are
                       certain undefined address offsets.
                7.5.2 SPI interface
                       PTN5100 provides an SPI slave interface as well. It supports SPI modes 1 and 2. This
                       interface exposes same register interface as that of I2C. Its main advantage is faster
                       command and data transport and relaxes MCU response time/latency requirements.
                7.5.3 Register interface
                       PTN5100 Application programming guide [3] describes the various registers with their bit
                       definitions, POR values and the various functions. Also, sample 'C' programs
                       corresponding to various functions and operations are given. This guide can be used by
                       the platform system architects to implement the EC firmware to control the operations with
                       PTN5100. Refer to programming guide for more information. The register definitions are
                       also described in the guide.
                7.5.4 Relevant Interface pins - SLV_ADDR, SPI_CLK_I2C_SCL,
                       SPI_MOSI_I2C_SDA, SPI_CS, SPI_MISO, INT_N
                         • SLV_ADDR is a ternary input pin that is used to support up to 3 slave PTN5100
                            devices on a given platform. This pin can be pulled to V_MCUPWR rail, left open or
                            pulled to GND.
                         • While in SPI mode, SPI_CLK_I2C_SCL, SPI_MISO, SPI_MOSI_I2C_SDA and
                            SPI_CS provide the necessary interface for connecting to SPI master controller on
                            the MCU.
                         • While in I2C mode, SPI_CLK_I2C_SCL and SPI_MOSI_I2C_SDA are used for I2C
                            clock and data interfacing to MCU
                         • INT_N pin is used to raise Active LOW level triggered interrupt signal to EC. PTN5100
                            processes various events and raises interrupt that require SMC intervention. Once all
                            relevant events are processed by the MCU, the INT_N pin goes HIGH. At POR, this
                            pin remains HIGH (when VIO is valid). The specific events that can generate the
                            interrupt can be selected.
                   7.6 Power supplies
                       PTN5100 is designed to operate under various power supplies. It can operate under both
                       normal battery and dead battery environments (while drawing power from VBUS).
                       PTN5100 handles power supply transitions (VBUS, VDD) transparently and there is no
                       specific power supply ramp requirement imposed on the system (between VDD and VIO
                       rails) also.
                       The following table highlights the power supplies and operating conditions for PTN5100.

                           perform battery charging and/or powering of the platform.

                                                                                USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                     • Source VBUS 5 V (if not under dead battery)
                     • Charge from VBUS PD and AC barrel power, if applicable
                     • Source VCONN power
                   The EC communicates with controller MCU via an I2C bus and control the operations.
                   The PTN5100 and MCU can operate autonomously or under the control of EC.
                   Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the configurations with discrete MOSFETs and Power
                   switches respectively. PTN5100 controls the power FETs/switch to determine charging
                   (Green colored FETs/switch on VBUS power inputs) and 5 V VBUS power delivery
                   (Orange colored FETs/switch on VBUS). If NXP5P3090 is used, then the Active HIGH
                   switch enable control is required to be generated based on the EN_USBSRC control
                   output.
                   An important aspect to consider here is that PTN5100 would indicate a 'Rd' pulldown
                   (UFP) under dead battery condition and this enables the port partner to provide VBUS at
                   5 V (provided the port partner is capable of acting as DFP). However, after system starts
                   up, role swap has to be performed to become DFP. This is handled by PTN5100 and MCU
                   together.
                   CC_ORIENT and DBGACC_FOUND outputs can be used by the platform, if necessary.

              8.1.2.1         Brief description
                              In this illustration also, the 2-chip solution (PTN5100+ Policy controller & Alternate mode
                              control MCU) is behind Type-C receptacle and it is configured to act as a PD Provider
                              (Autonomous mode) based on pre-configured Power profiles. The PC system uses the
                              ATX or similar power supply and it can deliver power to all USB ports. In this diagram,
                              there is no EC to interface with and so, the 2-chip solution (MCU and PTN5100) is
                              configured for autonomous operation.

                                                                                 USB Type-C power delivery PHY and protocol IC
                   For USB ports, this application:
                     • Sources VBUS 5 V
                     • Sources USB PD power (specific wattage depends on the system application)
                     • Sources VCONN power
                   Figure 9 and Figure 10 illustrate the configurations with discrete MOSFETs and Power
                   switches respectively. PTN5100 controls the power FETs/switches to VBUS 5V and PD
                   power (Orange colored FETs/Switch). The handshake with power supply unit is
                   dependent on OEM/ODM design.
                   An important aspect to consider here is that a Desktop PC does not have dead battery
                   condition though it can be unpowered. If not powered, it presents 'Open' on CC pins. After
                   power up initialization, PTN5100 would indicate 'Rp'. After PD negotiation, the Desktop
                   platform could deliver higher voltage/current.
                   CC_ORIENT and DBGACC_FOUND connections can be used based on platform need.

               8.1.3.1 Application description
                       In this illustration, PTN5100 is behind Type-C receptacle and it is configured to act as a
                       PD consumer/ Provider. It is important to note that there is no dedicated policy controller
                       MCU associated with the PD functionality as this application can operate with 5V, 3A only.
                       Under normal battery/powered condition, PTN5100 is configured as DFP, DRP or UFP
                       based on register configuration setting and it performs cable/plug connect and disconnect
                       detection, orientation detection. However, on dead battery condition, it defaults to UFP
                       role. The power path FET control may or may not be used in the application depending on
                       the capabilities of System PMIC.
                       This application is expected to
                         • Receive VBUS 5 V @ 3 A
                         • Provides VBUS 5 V @ 3 A
                         • Sourcing VCONN power is dependent on the Type-C role taken
                       PTN5100 operates autonomously but it is possible for the system processor to control it
                       via I2C interface. Though there may not be a need to negotiate higher voltage/current, the
                       platform may still need to support Alternate modes and VDMs. The Application Processor
                       is used to handle those capabilities.

                8.1.4.1     Application description
                            In this illustration, PTN5100 is inside Type-C cable adapter operating in UFP role. Some
                            example use cases are Type-C to DP adapter, Type-C to VGA adapter, Type-C to
                            Thunderbolt adapter etc. PTN5100 serves as PD PHY layer device for a Cable adapter
                            management MCU or dedicated PD MCU wherein PD policy management, Alternate
                            mode and VDM support are handled. The USB Billboard device is assumed to be
                            implemented as part of adapter management MCU.
                            The cable adapter implementation operates on VCONN supply. Discrete depletion mode
                            FET has to be used in the application for 'Ra' indication on CC pin.

                 8.1.5.1     Application description
                             The example applications are Multi-function monitor, Dock or Printer. PTN5100 is
                             configured for Charging UFP role. The policy controller MCU would probe PTN5100 to
                             make sure there is no dead battery device connected at the other end. If a pulldown 'Rd' is
                             detected at the remote cable end, this platform supplies VBUS 5V. Once the remote end
                             system is capable of performing power role swap, the roles would be reversed.
                             This application is expected to:
                                • Receive VBUS 5 V (or provide power during Dead battery operation - VBUS 5 V)
                                • Provides VBUS PD power
                             The PD software running on the MCU controls the power FETs/switches to determine
                             VBUS 5 V and USB PD power delivery (Orange colored power FETs/switch on VBUS).

               8.1.6.1 Application description
                       In a USB PD based hard drive application, PTN5100 + Policy controller MCU operates
                       autonomously. At POR, PTN5100 presents UFP role and starts to receive VBUS 5 V.
                       Then based on configured power profile, PD negotiation and contracting is performed.
                       The MCU interfaces with Hard drive electronics and delivers power after handshake. The
                       MCU's GPIO pins can be reused to handshake with DCDC converter and the handshake
                       mechanism is OEM platform dependent.
                       This application is expected to:
                         • Receive VBUS 5 V, USB PD power

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 25) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 19 and 20

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 25.
