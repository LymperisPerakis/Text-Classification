Overview
   S1R72U16 is a USB host storage controller LSI that supports USB2.0-compliant high-speed mode and
   IDE. Only “adding” S1R72U16 to the IDE bus of existing systems enables to add USB HS host function
   for USB storage device. Also S1R72U16 supports the 16bit general CPU interf ace.
   It is possible to add the USB2.0 high speed f unction f or USB storage easily with ATA/ATAPI driv ers and CF
   Driv ers,
   so the sy stem with S1R72U16 can support many kind of USB storage such like as a USB memory .
