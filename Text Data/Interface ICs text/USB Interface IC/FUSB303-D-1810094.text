FUSB303 Autonomous USB
Type-CE Port Controller
with I2C and GPIO Control
FUSB303
Description                                                                            www.onsemi.com
  The FUSB303 device is a fully autonomous USB Type−C™
controller optimized for 15 W or less applications. The FUSB303
offers CC logic detection for Source Port role, Sink Port role, DRP,
and accessory detection support, as well as Dead Battery support as
defined in USB−C specifications. The FUSB303 features configurable
address I2C access to support multiple ports per system or it can
operate autonomously configured by just pins. The FUSB303 features                            QFN12
ultra−low power during operation, and an ultra−thin, 12−Lead QFN                           CASE 722AG
package.

5. A fast−mode     I2C−bus device can be used in a standard−mode    I2C−bus
   system, but the requirement tSU;DAT 250 ns must be met. This is
   automatically the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the
   SCL/OUT2 signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the
   SCL/OUT2 signal, it must output the next data bit to the I2C_ line tr_max +
   tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the standard−mode I2C bus
   specification) before the SCL/OUT2 line is released
6. Cb equals the total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with high−speed devices, faster fall times are allowed according to the I2C
   specification

10. If more than one bit is set to 1b simultaneously then an order of priority will be used. First priority is DISABLED, second is ERROR_REC,
    third is FORCE_SRC, fourth is FORCE_SNK, fifth is UNATT_SRC, last is UNATT_SNK. The highest priority bit will take precedence and
    all other bits will be cleared automatically.
11. The DISABLED bit must be manually cleared. Also DISABLED bit has a higher priority over Portrole register since the DISABLED bit has
    to be cleared in order to execute the new Portrole register settings. However, all other Manual register bits don’t have a lot of meaning if the
    Portrole register is changed and so Portrole register setting should have higher priority than all bits except for DISABLED bit.
