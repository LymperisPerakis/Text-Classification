  Features                                           Brief Description
• Overvoltage Protection:                          The KTU1108 provides ESD, surge, and over-voltage
   24VDC Tolerance on CC1/2                       protection (OVP) for USB Type-C ports’ CC1 and CC2 (CC
    ■ Robust 25V overshoot clamping                and VCONN) lines. ESD protection meets IEC61000-4-2
   CC1/2 OVP = 5.8V                               standards, eliminating the need for external TVS diodes.
   Ultra-fast 15ns Response Time                  Surge protection meets IEC61000-4-5 standards,
• Surge Protection                                 increasing immunity from power surges such as lightning
   ±80V Surge Tolerance on CC1/2                  strikes on the power lines while the USB cable is
• IEC61000-4-2 ESD Protection                      connected.     Overvoltage protection (OVP) eliminates
   ±15kV air gap on CC1/2                         system damage due to physical or moisture-related shorts
   ±8kV contact on CC1/2
                                                   between the signal pins and VBUS at elevated PD voltage
   ±2kV HBM on all pins
                                                   levels.
• Moisture Detection Compatible                    The CC1/2 switches are low on-resistance to minimize
   Over 10MΩ to ground on CC1/2                   power dissipation for passing VCONN power up to 1.25A.
• CC Switches:                                     During dead battery conditions, internal 5.1kΩ resistors
   1.25A, 240mΩ, 370pF, 13.2MHz                   automatically pull down on CC1/2 to ensure that the up-
   Automatic 5.1kΩ dead battery pull-down         stream source provides 5V to VBUS.
• 2.5V to 5.5V Operating Voltage Range             The KTU1108 is packaged in RoHS and Green compliant
• -40°C to 85°C Operating Temperature Range        1.29mm x 1.69mm wafer-level chip-scale package
• Pb-free 12 bump WLCSP (0.4mm pitch)              (WLCSP).
