4    Functional Description
The VNC1L is the first of FTDI‟s Vinculum family of Embedded USB host controller integrated circuit
devices. Vinculum can also encapsulate certain USB device classes handling the USB Host Interface and
data transfer functions using the in-built MCU and embedded Flash memory. When interfacing to mass
storage devices, such as USB Flash drives, Vinculum transparently handles the FAT File Structure using a
simple to implement command set. Vinculum provides a cost effective solution for introducing USB host
capability into products that previously did not have the hardware resources to do so.
The VNC1L has a Combined Interface which interfaces a controlling application with the Command
Monitor. The combined interfaces are UART, Parallel FIFO and SPI.
The VNC1L is supplied un-programmed. It can be programmed before assembly or it can be configured
“in the field” with configuration option firmware available from the Vinculum website at
http://www.ftdichip.com.
4.1 Key Features
The VNC1L has the following key features:
         Two independent USB Host ports.
         8 or 32-bit V-MCU Core.
         Dual DMA controllers for hardware acceleration.
         64k Embedded Flash Program Memory.
         4k internal Data SRAM.
         2 x USB 2.0 Slow speed or Full speed Host or Slave ports.
         Automatic Low or Full Speed selection.
         UART, SPI and Parallel FIFO interfaces.
         Up to 28 GPIO pins depending on configuration.
         Low power operation (25mA running/2mA standby).
         FTDI firmware easily updated in the field.
         Multi-processor configuration capable.
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within VNC1L. Please refer to the block diagram shown in
Figure 2.1.
USB Transceivers 1 and 2 - The two USB transceiver cells provide the physical USB device interface
supporting USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 standards. Low-speed and full-speed USB data rates are supported.
Each output driver provides +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential receiver and two
single ended receivers provide USB DATA IN, SE0 and USB Reset condition detection. These cells also
include integrated internal USB pull-up or pull-down resistors as required for host or slave mode.
USB Serial Interface Engine (SIE) - These blocks handle the parallel to serial and serial to parallel
conversion of the USB physical layer. This includes bit stuffing packets, CRC generation, USB frame
generation and protocol error checking.
12 MHz Oscillator - The 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock input to the Clock
Multiplier PLL from an external 12MHz crystal.
Clock Multiplier PLL - The Clock Multiplier PLL takes the 12MHz input from the Oscillator Cell and
generates 24MHz and 48MHz reference clock signals, which are required by the USB SIE Blocks, the MCU
core, System Timer and UART prescalar blocks.
Program and Test Logic - This block provides a means of programming the onboard E-FLASH memory.
When PROG# is pulled low and the device is reset by pulsing the #RESET low, the onboard E-FLASH
memory is bypassed by an internal hard-coded bootstrap Loader ROM which contains code to allow the E-
FLASH memory to be programmed via commands to the UART interface. FTDI provides a software utility

                                    Vinculum VNC1L Embedded USB Host Controller IC Datasheet Version 2.02
                                                                                     Clearance No.: FTDI# 50
which allows VNC1L to be programmed using this method. The TEST pin is used in manufacturing to
enhance the testability of the various internal blocks and should be tied to GND.
DMA Controller 1 and 2 - The twin DMA controllers in VNC1L greatly enhance performance by allowing
data from the two USB SIE controllers, UART, FIFO and SPI interfaces to be transferred between each
other via the data SRAM with minimal MCU intervention.
Data SRAM - This 4k x 8bit block acts as the data (variable) memory for the Vinculum MCU, though it
can also be accessed transparently to the MCU by the twin DMA controllers.
NPU (Numeric Co-processor) – Operations which extensively utilise 32-bit arithmetic, such as
calculations relating to the FAT file system, are enhanced by the 32-bit co-processor block.
UART Prescaler - This block provides the master transmit/receive clock for the UART block. By varying
the prescaler value, the baud rate of the UART can be adjusted over a range of 300baud to 1Mbaud.
System Timer - The system timer provides a regular interrupt to VNC1L firmware.
Vinculum MCU Core – Processor core based on FTDI‟s proprietary 8-bit embedded MCU architecture.
VMCU has a Harvard architecture i.e. separate code and data space. It supports 64k bytes of program
code, 64k bytes of (paged) data space and 256 bytes of I/O space and uses “enhanced CISC” technology.
Typically VMCU instructions replace several lines of code in conventional CISC or RISC processors giving
RISC like performance in CISC architecture with the advantage over both of excellent code compression
in the program ROM space.
E-FLASH Program ROM - The VNCL1L has 64k bytes of embedded Flash (E-FLASH) memory. No special
programming voltages are necessary for programming the onboard E-FLASH as these are provided
internally on-chip. VNC1L devices are supplied blank and require to be initially programmed using the
Bootstrap Loader.
Bootstrap Loader ROM - This is a small block of hard-coded ROM (512 x 8 bits) which bypasses the
main E-FLASH memory when PROG# is pulled low. This provides a means of programming the entire E-
FLASH memory via the UART interface. A blank device must be programmed with the Bootstrap Loader
via the UART interface. A device already programmed may be upgraded via either the UART interface or
the USB interface.
UART and FIFO Logic - Optional serial and parallel interfaces to VNC1L that are equivalent to the
interfaces on FTDI‟s FT232 and FT245 ICs.
GPIO Blocks - General purpose I/O pins. Not all I/O pins are available to the user for a particular
configuration. Restrictions on use are shown in Table 3.4.
4.3 Programming VNC1L
The VNC1L is shipped as a blank device. It must be programmed (when in bootloader mode) with
firmware before use. It can be programmed either pre-assembly, using the VPROG-1 stand alone
programmer or programmed in-circuit via the UART interface.
The VNC1L bootloader uses the UART interface to load new firmware into the Vinculum Flash memory. To
enable the bootloader, the PROG# pin must be driven low and VNC1L must then be reset by driving the
RESET# pin low then high. Run mode can be enabled by driving the PROG# pin high and then resetting
VNC1L by driving the RESET# pin low then high.
When VNC1L firmware is updated via a microcontroller with a UART, the microcontroller must be capable
of at least 115200 baud.
The firmware can be upgraded in to the Flash memory via the UART interface or via a USB interface.
Examples of how to connect VNC1L in each of these modes is given in http://www.ftdichip.com

5    Firmware Control Interface
There are three firmware interface options for the command monitor on the combined control and data
interface. The command monitor interface options are UART, FIFO or SPI. The mode of operation is
selected using VNC1L pins 46 and 47.The pin connections used to select the mode of the interface are
shown in Table 5.1:
                     Pin No.

Table 5.1 Combined Interface Selection
Important : Pins ACBUS5 and ACBUS6 should not be tied directly to GND or VCC.
Pins ACBUS5 and ACBUS6 should be pulled high or low using a resistor of around 47kΩ. These pins are
read only at reset, but may then become outputs after the interface choice has been selected. When FIFO
mode is selected ACBUS5 will be used as an output by VNC1L Firmware.
5.1 UART Interface
When the data and control buses are configured in UART mode, the interface implements a standard
asynchronous serial UART port with flow control. The UART can support baud rates from 300baud to
1Mbaud.
Data transfer uses NRZ (Non-Return to Zero) data format consisting of 1 start bit, 7 or 8 data bits, an
optional parity bit, and one or two stop bits. When transmitting the data bits, the least significant bit is
transmitted first. Transmit and receive waveforms are illustrated in Figure 5.1 and Figure 5.2:
.
Figure 5.1 UART Receive Waveform
Figure 5.2 UART Transmit Waveform
Baud rate (default =9600 baud), flow control settings (default = RTS/CTS), number of data bits
(default=8), parity (default is no parity) and number of stop bits (default=1) are all configurable using
the firmware command interface. Please refer to http://www.ftdichip.com (or latest version).

Table 5.2 Data and Control Bus Signal Mode Options - UART Interface
In RS485 designs, a transmit data enable signal, TXDEN, may be used to signal that a transmit operation
is in progress. TXDEN will be set high one bit-time before data is transmitted and return low one bit time
after the last bit of a data frame has been transmitted.
The ring indicator pin, RI#, is used to wake up VNC1L from suspend mode. The suspend mode can be
entered using a firmware monitor command.

5.2 SPI Interface
When the data and control buses are configured in SPI mode, the interface operates as an SPI Slave. An
SPI master is required to provide the clock (SCLK) signal and set the chip select (CS) for the duration of
the transaction. The SPI interface is a polled 4-wire interface which can operate at speeds up to 12MHz
The SPI interface differs from most other implementations in that it uses a 13 clock sequence to transfer
a single byte of data. In addition to a „Start‟ state, the SPI master must send two setup bits which
indicate data direction and target address. The encoding of the setup bits is shown in Table 5.3. A single
data byte is transmitted in each SPI transaction, with the most significant bit transmitted first.
After each transaction VNC1L returns a single status bit. This indicates if a Data Write was successful or a
Data Read was valid.

Table 5.4 Data and Control Bus Signal Mode Options - SPI Interface
The VNC1L SPI interface uses 4 signal lines: SCLK, CS, SDI and SDO. The signals SDI, SDO and CS
are always clocked on the rising edge of the SCLK signal.
CS signal must be raised high for the duration of the entire transaction. For data transactions, the CS
must be released for at least one clock cycle after a transaction has completed. It is not necessary to
release CS between Status Read operations.
The „Start‟ state of SDI and CS high on the rising edge of SCLK initiates the transfer. The transfer finishes
after 13 clock cycles, and the next transfer starts when SDI is high during the rising edge of SCLK.
The following Figure 5.3 and Table 5.5 give details of the bus timing requirements.

5.2.2 SPI Master Data Read Transaction
The SPI master must periodically poll for new data in VNC1L Transmit Buffer. It is recommended that
this is done first before sending any command.
The Start and Setup sequence is sent to VNC1L by the SPI master, see Figure 5.4.
The VNC1L clocks out data from its Transmit Buffer on subsequent rising edge clock cycles provided by
the SPI master. This is followed by a status bit generated by VNC1L. The Data Read status bit is defined
in Table 5.6.
If the status bit indicates New Data then the byte received is valid. If it indicates Old Data then the
Transmit Buffer in VNC1L is empty and the byte of data received in the current transaction should be
disregarded.

Table 5.6 SPI Master Data Read Status Bit
Figure 5.4 SPI Master Data Read (VNC1L Slave Mode)
The status bit is only valid until the next rising edge of SCLK after the last data bit.
During the Data Read operation the CS signal must not be de-asserted.
The transfer completes after 13 clock cycles and the next transfer can begin when SDI and CS are high
during the rising edge of SCLK.
5.2.3 SPI Master Data Transaction
During an SPI master Data Write operation the Start and Setup sequence is sent by the SPI master to
VNC1L, see Figure 5.5. This is followed by the SPI master transmitting each bit of the data to be written
to VNC1L. The VNC1L then responds with a status bit on SDO on the rising edge of the next clock cycle.
The SPI master must read the status bit at the end of each write transaction to determine if the data was
written successfully to VNC1L Receive Buffer. The Data Write status bit is defined in Table 5.7. The status
bit is only valid until the next rising edge of SCLK after the last data bit.
If the status bit indicates Accept then the byte transmitted has been added to VNC1L Receive Buffer. If it
shows Reject then the Receive Buffer is full and the byte of data transmitted in the current transaction
should be re-transmitted by the SPI master to VNC1L.
Any application should poll VNC1L Receive Buffer by retrying the Data Write operation until the data is

5.2.4 SPI Master Status Read Transaction
The VNC1L has a status byte which determines the state of the Receive and Transmit Buffers. The SPI
master must poll VNC1L and read the status byte.
The Start and Setup sequence is sent to VNC1L by the SPI master, see Figure 5.6. The VNC1L clocks out
its status byte on subsequent rising edge clock cycles from the SPI master. This is followed by a status
bit generated by VNC1L (also on the SDO) which will always be zero (indicating new data).
The meaning of the bits within the status byte sent by VNC1L during a Status Read operation is described
in Table 5.8.
The result of the Status Read transaction is only valid during the transaction itself.
Data read and data write transactions must still check the status bit during a Data Read or Data Write
cycle regardless of the result of a Status Read operation.

7     Application Examples
7.1 Example VNC1L Schematic (MCU – UART Interface)
VNC1L can be configured to communicate with a microcontroller using a UART interface. An example of
this is shown in Figure 7.1.
Figure 7.1 VNC1L Schematic (MCU - UART Interface)
Notes:
     1. It is recommended that 68pF loading capacitors are used with the 12MHz oscillator.
     2. VNC1L is shipped as a blank device. Initial in-circuit programming (using the downloaded .rom
         file) can only be done via the UART interface.
     3. When in bootstrap mode (PROG# is low and RESET# toggled) then ACBUS5 and ACBUS6 are
         ignored and the device is forced into UART mode.
     4. VNC1L can also be programmed, pre-assembly, using the VPROG1 VNC1L stand-alone
         programmer – see http://www.ftdichip.com

7.2 Block Diagram - VNC1L Programming Via USB Interface
VNC1L can be programmed from a PC USB port using an FTDI USB-serial converter such as the FT232R.
This is the fastest way to reprogram VNC1L Flash memory as data can be transferred to VNC1L at up to
1MBaud.
The required connections between VNC1L and an FT232R device for controlling the PROG# and RESET#
pins is shown in Figure 7.2.

Figure 7.2 VNC1L –Block Diagram of Programming Using USB Connection
Note that CBUS Bit Bang mode must be enabled in the FT232R EEPROM for CBUS2 and CBUS3 to enable
this operation. See FTDI application note “AN232R-01 Bit Bang Modes for the FT232R and FT245R” for
details of how to use CBUS Bit Bang mode. This is available at http://www.ftdichip.com).
To enable the bootloader, the PROG# pin must be held low and the RESET# pin must be pulsed low then
high again (this resets VNC1L).
Run mode can be enabled by driving the PROG# pin high and then resetting VNC1L by driving the
RESET# pin low then high.
