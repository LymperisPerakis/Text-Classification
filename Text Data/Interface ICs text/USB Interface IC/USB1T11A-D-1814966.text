Please note: As part of the Fairchild Semiconductor integration, some of the Fairchild orderable part numbers
will need to change in order to meet ON Semiconductor’s system requirements. Since the ON Semiconductor
product management systems do not have the ability to manage part nomenclature that utilizes an underscore
(_), the underscore (_) in the Fairchild part numbers will be changed to a dash (-). This document may contain
device numbers with an underscore (_). Please check the ON Semiconductor website to verify the updated
device numbers. The most current and up-to-date ordering information can be found at www.onsemi.com. Please
email any questions regarding the system integration to Fairchild_questions@onsemi.com.

     USB1T11A — Universal Serial Bus Transceiver
     Features                                                            Description
      Complies with Universal Serial Bus Specification 1.1              The USB1T11A is a one-chip, generic USB transceiver.
      Utilizes Digital Inputs and Outputs to Transmit and               It is designed to allow 5.0V or 3.3V programmable and
        Receive USB Cable Data                                           standard logic to interface with the physical layer of the
                                                                         Universal Serial Bus. It is capable of transmitting and
      Supports 12Mbit/s “Full Speed” and 1.5Mbit/s                      receiving serial data at both full-speed (12Mbit/s) and
        “Low Speed” Serial Data Transmission                             low-speed (1.5Mbit/s) data rates.
      Compatible with the VHDL “Serial Interface Engine”                The input and output signals of the USB1T11A conform
        from USB Implementers' Forum                                     with the “Serial Interface Engine.” Implementation of the
      Supports Single-ended Data Interface                              serial interface engine allows designers to make USB-
                                                                         compatible devices with off-the-shelf logic to modify and

     Absolute Maximum Ratings
     Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may damage the device. The device may not function or be
     operable above the recommended operating conditions and stressing the parts to these levels is not recommended.
     In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions may affect device
     reliability. The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only.
