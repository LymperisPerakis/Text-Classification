High-Temperature Drivers
Atmel driver ICs are available for high-temperature appli­
cations in mechatronic solutions such as turbocharger or
exhaust gas recirculation systems. Many flaps have to
be controlled by DC motor driver ICs, which are located
very close to the hot engine. Due to the advantages
of our proprietary Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) technology
(Atmel SMART-I.S.®), these driver ICs can withstand
ambient temperatures up to 150ºC/302ºF and chip
temperatures up to 200ºC/392ºF.

Li-ion Battery Management
With the ATA6870N, Atmel provides a measurement and monitoring circuit designed for high-cell-count Li-ion battery
systems in industrial and automotive applications such as electrical and hybrid electrical vehicles, ebikes or uninteruptible
power supplies. It monitors the battery-cell voltage and the battery-cell temperature with a 12-bit ADC. The circuit also
provides active and passive charge-balancing capability for each battery cell. Up to 16 circuits (96 cells) can be cascaded in
one string.
Intelligent Battery Sensor
The Atmel megaAVR® ATmega32HVE2 and ATmega64HVE2 MCUs improve the performance and longevity of 12V
standard lead-acid batteries. Designed for intelligent battery sensor applications, the devices determine the state of charge
and state of health for 12V standard lead-acid batteries by measuring the battery voltage, current and temperature.
For cars with idle-stop-go function, this feature is mandatory to retain sufficient battery energy for a guaranteed engine
start. Combined with the Atmel ATA6870N Li-ion battery monitor IC, it forms an ideal system solution for replacing
12V standard lead-acid batteries with Li-ion batteries.
