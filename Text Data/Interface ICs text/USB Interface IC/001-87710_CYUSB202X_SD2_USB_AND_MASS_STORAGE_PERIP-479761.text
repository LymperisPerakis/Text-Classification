    modes causes the SD2 to stop working.                       CYUSB2025-BZXI
2. USB enumeration failure in USB boot mode when SD2            CYUSB2024-BZXI            Rev. D       Workaround provided
    is self-powered.                                            CYUSB2025-BZXI
3. Bus collision is seen when the I2C block is used as a        CYUSB2024-BZXI            Rev. D       Use SD2 in single I2C master
    master in the I2C Multi-master configuration.               CYUSB2025-BZXI                         environment only
1. Turning off VIO1 during Normal, Suspend and Standby modes causes the SD2 to stop working.
   ■Problem     Definition
      Turning off the VIO1 during Normal, Suspend and Standby modes will cause the SD2 to stop working.
   ■Parameters      Affected
      N/A
   ■Trigger    Conditions
      This condition is triggered when the VIO1 is turned off during Normal, Suspend, and Standby modes.
   ■Scope     Of Impact
      SD2 stops working.
   ■Workaround
      VIO1 must stay on during Normal, Suspend, and Standby modes.
   ■Fix   Status
      No fix. Workaround is required.

2. USB enumeration failure in USB boot mode when SD2 is self-powered.
   ■Problem   Definition
    When SD2 is self-powered and not connected to the USB host, it enters low-power mode and does not wake up when connected
    to USB host afterwards. This is because the bootloader does not check the VBUS pin on the connector to detect USB connection.
    It expects that the USB bus is connected to the host when it is powered on.
   ■Parameters    Affected
    N/A
   ■Trigger  Conditions
    This condition is triggered when SD2 is self-powered in USB boot mode.
   ■Scope   Of Impact
    Device does not enumerate
   ■Workaround
    Reset the SD2 device after connecting to USB host using the RESET pin.
   ■Fix  Status
    No fix. Workaround is required.
3. Bus collision is seen when the I2C block is used as a master in the I2C Multi-master configuration.
   ■Problem   Definition
    When SD2 is used as a master in the I2C multi-master configuration, there can be occasional bus collisions.
   ■Parameters    Affected
    NA
   ■Trigger  Conditions
    This condition is triggered only when the SD2 I2C block operates in Multi-master configuration.
   ■Scope   Of Impact
    The SD2 I2C block can transmit data when the I2C bus is not idle leading to bus collisions.
   ■Workaround
    Use SD2 in a single I2C master environment only.
   ■Fix  Status
    No fix. Workaround is required.
