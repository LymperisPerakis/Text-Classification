                                                                  Hi-Speed USB Device Transceiver with UTMI Interface
General Description
            The USB3250 provides the Physical Layer (PHY) interface to a USB 2.0 Device Controller. The IC is
            available in a 56 pin QFN.
            The USB3250 is a USB 2.0 physical layer transceiver (PHY) integrated circuit. SMSC's proprietary
            technology results in low power dissipation, which is ideal for building a bus powered USB 2.0
            peripheral. The PHY can be configured for either an 8-bit unidirectional or a 16-bit bidirectional parallel
            interface, which complies with the USB Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) specification. It
            supports 480Mbps transfer rate, while remaining backward compatible with USB 1.1 legacy protocol
            at 12Mbps.
            All required termination for the USB 2.0 Transceiver is internal. Internal 5.25V short circuit protection
            of DP and DM lines is provided for USB compliance.
            While transmitting data, the PHY serializes data and generates SYNC and EOP fields. It also performs
            needed bit stuffing and NRZI encoding. Likewise, while receiving data, the PHY de-serializes incoming
            data, stripping SYNC and EOP fields and performs bit un-stuffing and NRZI decoding.

                                                    mode). When in 8-bit mode, this specification refers to CLKOUT
                                                    as CLK60. When in 16-bit mode, CLKOUT is referred to as

 TXVALID        Input   High      Transmit Valid. Indicates that the TXDATA bus is valid for
                                  transmit. The assertion of TXVALID initiates the transmission of
                                  SYNC on the USB bus. The negation of TXVALID initiates EOP
                                  on the USB.

                                  must not be changed on the de-assertion or assertion of TXVALID.
                                  The PHY must be in a quiescent state when these inputs are
                                  changed.
 TXREADY       Output   High      Transmit Data Ready. If TXVALID is asserted, the SIE must
                                  always have data available for clocking into the TX Holding
                                  Register on the rising edge of CLKOUT. TXREADY is an
                                  acknowledgement to the SIE that the transceiver has clocked the
                                  data from the bus and is ready for the next transfer on the bus. If
                                  TXVALID is negated, TXREADY can be ignored by the SIE.
 VALIDH         Bidir   N/A       Transmit/Receive High Data Bit Valid (used in 16-bit mode
                                  only). When TXVALID = 1, the 16-bit data bus direction is
                                  changed to inputs, and VALIDH is an input. If VALIDH is asserted,
                                  DATA[15:0] is valid for transmission. If deasserted, only DATA[7:0]
                                  is valid for transmission. The DATA bus is driven by the SIE.
                                  When TXVALID = 0 and RXVALID = 1, the 16-bit data bus
                                  direction is changed to outputs, and VALIDH is an output. If
                                  VALIDH is asserted, the DATA[15:0] outputs are valid for receive.
                                  If deasserted, only DATA[7:0] is valid for receive. The DATA bus
                                  is read by the SIE.
 RXVALID       Output   High      Receive Data Valid. Indicates that the RXDATA bus has received
                                  valid data. The Receive Data Holding Register is full and ready to
                                  be unloaded. The SIE is expected to latch the RXDATA bus on the
                                  rising edge of CLKOUT.
