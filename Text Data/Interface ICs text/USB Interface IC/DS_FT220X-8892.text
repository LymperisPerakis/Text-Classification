                                                                                               Version 1.4

4 Function Description
The FT220X is a USB to FTDI Proprietary FT1248 interface device which simplifies USB implementations
and reduces external component count by fully integrating an MTP memory and an integrated clock
circuit which requires no external crystal. It has been designed to operate efficiently with USB host
controllers by using as little bandwidth as possible when compared to the total USB bandwidth available.
4.1 Key Features
Functional Integration. Fully integrated MTP memory, clock generation, AVCC filtering, Power-On-
Reset and LDO regulator.
Configurable CBUS I/O Pin Options. The fully integrated MTP memory allows configuration of the
Control Bus (CBUS) functionality and drive strength selection. There is 1 configurable CBUS I/O pin. The
configurable options are defined in section 3.3.
The CBUS line can be configured with any one of these output options by setting bits in the internal MTP
memory. The device is supplied with the most commonly used pin definitions pre-programmed - see
Section 9 for details.
Asynchronous Bit Bang Mode with RD# and WR# Strobes. The FT220X supports FTDI’s previous
chip generation bit-bang mode. In bit-bang mode, the 4 MIOSI data lines can be switched from the
regular interface mode to a 4-bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the device and
they will be sequentially sent to the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer (equivalent to the
baud rate pre-scalar).
Synchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT220X supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs from
asynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. This
makes it easier for the controlling program to measure the response to an output stimulus as the data
returned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R-01, available from FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
Source Power and Power Consumption. The FT220X is capable of operating at a voltage supply
between +3.3V and +5.25V with a nominal operational mode current of 8mA and a nominal USB suspend
mode current of 125µA. This allows greater margin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode
current limit of 2.5mA. An integrated level converter within the FT1248 interface allows the FT220X to
interface to logic running at +1.8V, 2.5V, +3.3V or +5V. (Note: External pull-ups are recommended for
IO <3V3).
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within the FT220X. Please refer to the block diagram shown
in Figure 2.1
Internal MTP Memory. The internal MTP memory in the FT220X is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID),
Product ID (PID), device serial number, product description string and various other USB configuration
descriptors. The internal MTP memory is also used to configure the CBUS pin functions. The FT220X is
supplied with the internal MTP memory pre-programmed as described in Section 9. A user area of the
internal MTP memory is available to system designers to allow storing additional data from the user
application over USB. The internal MTP memory descriptors can be programmed in circuit, over USB
without any additional voltage requirement. The descriptors can be programmed using the FTDI utility
software called FT_PROG, which can be downloaded from FTDI Utilities on the FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com).
+1.8V LDO Regulator. The +1.8V LDO regulator generates the +1.8V reference voltage for driving the
internal core of the IC.
+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the
USB transceiver cell output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the
3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on
USBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells
rather than to power external logic. However, it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a
+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.

USB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full-speed physical interface
to the USB cable. The output drivers provide +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential
input receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single-Ended-0 (SE0) and USB
reset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP.
The block also detects when connected to a USB power supply which will not enumerate the device but
still supply power and may be used for battery charging.
USB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock
and data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.
Internal 12MHz Oscillator - The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This
provides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference
clock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and UART FIFO controller blocks.
Clock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal
Oscillator function and generates the 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz and 6MHz reference clock signals. The 48Mz
clock reference is used by the USB DPLL and the Baud Rate Generator blocks.
Serial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it
performs bit stuffing/un-stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also checks the CRC on the USB data
stream.
USB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control
endpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the
commands for controlling the functional parameters of the FT1245 in accordance with the USB 2.0
specification chapter 9.
FIFO RX Buffer (512 bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the FT1248 interface via the
USB data OUT endpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer. Data is removed from the buffer to the
FT1248 transmit register under control of the FT1248 FIFO controller. (Rx relative to the USB interface).
FIFO TX Buffer (512 bytes). Data from the FT1248 receive register is stored in the TX buffer. The USB
host controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for data from the device
data IN endpoint. (Tx relative to the USB interface).
FT1248 interface controller. Controls the FT1248 interface, dynamically switching the width of the bus
as commanded by the external bus master.
RESET Generator - The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT220X.
RESET# can be tied to 3V3OUT.

5 FT1248 Interface Description
The FT1248 protocol has a dynamic bi-directional data bus interface that can be configured as 1, 2, 4, or
8-bits wide (only 4 bit wide on the FT220X) providing users with the flexibility to configure the interface
with performance, pin count and PCB area in mind. For example, 1-bit mode it requires 8 clock cycles to
get 8 data bits and in 8-bit mode all 8 bits are sent with one clock.
 In the FT1248 there are 3 distinct phases:
While CS# is inactive, the FT1248 reflects the status of the write buffer and read buffers within the
FT220X on the MIOSIO[0] and MISO wires respectively. The buffers are 512 Bytes each and the status
will reflect if at least one byte of space is available for the external device to write to and whether at least
one byte is available to be read by the external device.
Additionally, the FT1248 slave block supports multiple slave devices where a master can communicate
with multiple SPI slave devices. When the slave is sharing buses with other SPI slave devices, the write
and read buffer status cannot be reflected on the MIOSIO[0] and MISO wires during CS# inactivity as
this would cause bus contention. Therefore, it is possible for the user to select whether they wish to have
the buffer status switched on or off during inactivity.
(This setting may be applied in the internal MTP memory with FT_PROG at the same time as selecting
FT1248 mode).
When CS# is active a command/bus size phase occurs first. Following the command phase is the data
phase, for each data byte transferred the FT1248 slave drives an ACK/NAK status onto the MISO wire.
The master can send multiple data bytes so long as CS# is active, if a unsuccessful data transfer occurs,
i.e. a NAK happens on the MISO wire then the master should immediately abort the transfer by de-
asserting CS#.
                                Figure 5.1: FT1248 Basic Waveform Protocol
5.1 Determining the Dynamic Bus Width
The bus width is dynamic. In order for the FT220X, in FT1248 mode, to determine the bus width within
the command phase, the bus width is encoded along with the actual commands on the first active clock
edge when CS# is active and has a data width of 4-bits.
If any of the MIOSIO[3:2] signals are driven low by the external host then the data transfer width equals
4-bits
If MIOSIO[1] signal is driven low by the external host then the data transfer width equals 2-bits
Else the bus width is defaulted to 1-bit
In order to successfully decode the bus width, all MIOSIO signals must have pull up resistors. By default,
all MIOSIO signals shall be seen by the FT220X in FT1248 mode as logic ‘1’from the internal resistors.
This means that when a FT1248 master does not wish to use certain MIOSIO signals, the slave (FT220X)
is still capable of determining the requested bus width since any unused MIOSIO signals shall be pulled
up by default.
The remaining bits used during the command phase are used to contain the command itself which means
that it is possible to define up to 16 unique commands.

5.3 LSB or MSB Selection
The data can be sent/received Least Significant Bit First (LSB) or Most Significant Bit First (MSB). To
determine which mode is used by the FT1248 interface of the FT220X the MTP memory must be set.
This may be selected with FT_PROG.
5.4 Clock Phase/Polarity
The FT1248 slave does not need to have any knowledge of clock rate as this is supplied by the FT1248
master. However the relationship between clock and data needs to be controllable, to allow the slave to
operate in the same way as the master such that data is correctly driven and sampled on the correct
clock phases. By configuring the polarity and phase of CLK with respect to the data it is possible to match
the FT1248 master.
There are 4 possible modes which are determined by the Clock Polarity (CPOL) and Clock Phase (CPHA)
signals. The different combinations of these signals are commonly referred to as modes, see Table 5.2
below. For the FT1248 slave, only 2 of these 4 modes are supported. CPHA will always be set to 1 in the
FT1248 slave because data is available or driven on to MIOSIO wires on the first clock edge after CS# is
active and is therefore sampled on the trailing edge of the first clock pulse. When CPHA equals 0, it
means data must be available or driven onto the MIOSIO wires on the first leading edge of the clock after
CS# is active. However, during this period between CS# becoming active and the first leading clock edge
is when the MIOSIO wires are being “turned around” as when CS# is inactive the FT1248 slave is driving
the write buffer status. Supporting CPHA = 0 would result in bus contention and therefore, shall not be
supported.
                                   Mode     CPOL   CPHA    Supported

                               Table 5.2: CPOL & CPHA Mode Numbers
When CPOL is 1, the idle state of the clock is high. When CPOL is 0, the idle state of the clock is low. It
should be noted that clock phase and polarity need to be identical for the master and attached slave
device.

5.4.1        CPHA = 1
When CPHA is set to ‘1’, the first edge after CS# goes low will be used to shift (or drive) the first data bit
onto MIOSIO. Every odd numbered edge after this will shift out the next data bit. Incoming data will be
sampled on the second or trailing SCLK edge and every even edge thereafter.
Figure 5.3 shows this for both CPOL = 0 and CPOL = 1.

                                Figure 7.1 Bus Powered Configuration
Figure 7.1 Illustrates the FT220X in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows –
   i)      On plug-in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.
   ii)     In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA.
   iii)    A bus powered high power USB device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use one of
           the CBUS pins configured as PWREN# and use it to keep the current below 100mA on plug-in
           and 2.5mA on USB suspend.
   iv)     A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB bus powered hub.
   v)      No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.
The power descriptors in the internal MTP memory of the FT220X should be programmed to match the
current drawn by the device.
A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT220X and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application. A suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from
Steward (www.steward.com), for example Steward Part # MI0805K400R-10.
Note: If using PWREN# (available using the CBUS) the pin should be pulled to VCCIO using a 10kΩ
resistor.

                                      Figure 7.2 Self Powered Configuration
Figure 7.2 illustrates the FT220X in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic
rules for USB self-powered devices are as follows –
   i)      A self-powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub
           controller is powered down.
   ii)     A self-powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB
           suspend as it has its own power supply.
   iii)    A self-powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-
           powered USB hub.
The power descriptor in the internal MTP memory of the FT220X should be programmed to a value of
zero (self-powered).
In order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus power (pin 1) is used to control the
VBUS_Sense pin of the FT220X device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ
resistor on USBDP is pulled up to +3.3V, thus identifying the device as a full speed device to the USB
host or hub. When the USB host or hub is powered off, VBUS_Sense pin will be low and the FT220X is
held in a suspend state. In this state the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is not pulled up to any power supply
(hub or host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1.5kΩ pull-up resistor. Failure to
do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.
Figure 7.2 illustrates a self-powered design which has a +3.3V to +5.25V supply.
Note:
   1. When the FT220X is in reset, the FT1248 interface I/O pins are tri-stated. Input pins have
      internal 75kΩ pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some
      external logic.

                        Figure 7.3 Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration
A requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode, the application draws a
total current of less than 2.5mA. This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the
ability to power itself down into a low current state by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic
that cannot power itself down in this way, the FT220X provides a simple but effective method of turning
off power during the USB suspend mode.
Figure 7.3 shows an example of using a discrete P-Channel MOSFET to control the power to external
logic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier (www.irf.com) IRLML6402, or equivalent. It
is recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used
to limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the
transient power surge, caused when the MOSFET switches on, will reset the FT220X or the USB host/hub
controller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 7.3 powers up with a slew rate of
approximaely12.5V/Ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in
approximately 400 microseconds.
As an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used. A
suitable power switch IC for such an application is the Micrel (www.micrel.com) MIC2025-2BM or
equivalent.
With power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:
    i)   The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to
         automatically reset the logic when power is re-applied when moving out of suspend mode.
    ii) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the internal FT220X MTP memory.
    iii) One of the CBUS Pins should be configured as PWREN# in the internal FT220X MTP memory, and
         used to switch the power supply to the external circuitry.
    iv) For USB high-power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up
        to 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in
        the Max Power field in the internal FT220X MTP memory. A high-power bus powered application
        uses the descriptor in the internal FT220X MTP memory to inform the system of its power
        requirements.
    v) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered
       down using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.

7.4 USB Battery Charging Detection
A            recent            addition            to           the           USB            specification
(http://www.usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/BCv1.2_011912.zip ) is to allow for additional charging
profiles to be used for charging batteries in portable devices. These charging profiles do not enumerate
the USB port of the peripheral. The FT220X device will detect that a USB compliant dedicated charging
port (DCP) is connected. Once detected while in suspend mode a battery charge detection signal is then
provided to allow external logic to switch to charging mode as opposed to operation mode.

To use the FT220X with battery charging detection the CBUS pin must be reprogrammed to allow for the
BCD Charger output to switch the external charger circuitry on. The CBUS pins are configured in the
internal MTP memory with the free utility FT_PROG. If the charging circuitry requires an active low signal
to enable it, the CBUS pin can be programmed to BCD Charger# as an alternative.

When connected to a USB compliant dedicated charging port (DCP, as opposed to a standard USB host)
the device USB signals will be shorted together and the device suspended. The BCD charger signal will
bring the LTC4053 out of suspend and allow battery charging to start. The charge current in the example
above is 1A as defined by the resistance on the PROG pin.
To calculate the equivalent resistance on the LTC4053 PROG pin select a charge current, then Res =
1500V/Ichg
For more configuration options of the LTC4053 refer to:
AN_175_Battery Charging Over USB
Note: If the FT220X is connected to a standard host port such that the device is enumerated the battery
charge detection signal is inactive as the device will not be in suspend.

8 Application Examples
The following sections illustrate possible applications of the FT220X. The illustrations have omitted pin
numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT220XS and FT220XQ package
options.

                    Figure 8.1 Application Example showing USB to FT1248 host
The FT1248 can be used with 1-bit. 2-bit, or 4-bit wide data. The Figure 8.1 is showing 1 bit mode. By
using 4 data bits you need fewer clock cycles to get the data across.
The FT220X is the slave device and the external FPGA/MCU is the bus master. The FT220X will auto
detect the bus width from the initial command byte sent by the controller. If not using all 4 data lines the
pins may be left unterminated as an internal pull-up ensures the device detects logic 1.
Timing diagrams for 1-bit accesses can be seen in figures 8.2 and 8.3.
For further information on the mode see AN_167 FT1248 Basics from the FTDI website.

9 Internal MTP Memory Configuration
The FT220X includes an internal MTP memory which holds the USB configuration descriptors, other
configuration data for the chip and also user data areas. Following a power-on reset or a USB reset the
FT220X will scan its internal MTP memory and read the USB configuration descriptors stored there.
In many cases, the default values programmed into the MTP memory will be suitable and no re-
programming will be necessary. The defaults can be found in Section 9.1.
The MTP memory in the FT220X can be programmed over USB if the values need to be changed for a
particular application. Further details of this are provided from section 9.2 onwards.
Users who do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their
design can apply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs. See TN_100 – USB Vendor ID/Product ID
Guidelines for more details.
9.1 Default Values
The default factory programmed values of the internal MTP memory are shown in Table 9.1.

9.2 Method of Programming the MTP Memory
9.2.1       Programming the MTP memory over USB
The MTP memory on all FT-X devices can be programmed over USB. This method is the same as for the
EEPROM on other FTDI devices such as the FT232R. No additional hardware, connections or programming
voltages are required. The device is simply connected to the host computer in the same way that it would
be for normal applications, and the FT_Prog utility is used to set the required options and program the
device.
The FT_Prog utility is provided free-of-charge from the FTDI website, and can be found at the link below.
The user guide is also available at this link.
http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm#FT_Prog
Additionally, D2XX commands can be used to program the MTP memory from within user applications.
For more information on the commands available, please see the D2XX Programmers Guide below.
9.3 Memory Map
The FT-X family MTP memory has various areas which come under three main categories:
       User Memory Area
       Configuration Memory Area (writable)
       Configuration Memory Area (non-writable)

User Memory Area
The User Memory Areas are highlighted in Green on the memory map. They can be read and written via
both USB and FT1248 on the FT220X. All locations within this range are freely programmable; no areas
have special functions and there is no checksum for the user area.
Note: The application should take into account the specification for the number of write cycles in Section
6.4 if it will be writing to the MTP memory multiple times.
Configuration Memory Area (writable)
This area stores the configuration data for the device, including the data which is returned to the host in
the configuration descriptors (e.g. the VID, PID and string descriptions) and also values which set the
hardware configuration (the signal assigned to each CBUS pin for example).
These values can have a significant effect on the behaviour of the device. Steps must be taken to ensure
that these locations are not written to un-intentionally by an application which is intended to access only
the user area.
This area is included in a checksum which covers configuration areas of the memory, and so changing
any value can also cause this checksum to fail.
Configuration Memory Area (non-writable)
This is a reserved area and the application should not write to this area of memory. Any attempt to write
these locations will fail.
9.4 Hardware Requirements
The hardware is the same as for a typical USB-FT1248 application and no additional hardware or
programming voltages are required. For the USB connections, either a bus-powered configuration (see
Section 7.1and 7.3) or a self-powered configuration (see Section 7.2) could be used.
