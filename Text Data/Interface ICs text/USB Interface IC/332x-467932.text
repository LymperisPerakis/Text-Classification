Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
Datasheet
Chapter 1 General Description
                    SMSC’s USB332x is a family of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceivers that provides a physical layer (PHY)
                    solution well-suited for portable electronic devices. Both commercial and industrial temperature
                    applications are supported.
                    Each model in the USB332x family may use a 60MHz reference clock, or the model-number specific
                    reference clock shown in Order Numbers on page 2.
                    Several advanced features make the USB332x the transceiver of choice by reducing both electrical
                    bill of material (eBOM) part count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness
                    eliminates the need for external ESD protection devices in typical applications. The internal Over-
                    Voltage Protection circuit (OVP) protects the USB332x from voltages up to 30V. By using a reference
                    clock from the Link, the USB332x removes the cost of a dedicated crystal reference from the design.
                    And the integrated USB switch enables unique product features with a single USB port of connection.
                    The USB332x meets all of the electrical requirements to be used as a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device, or
                    an On-the-Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition to the supporting USB signaling, the USB332x also
                    provides USB UART mode and USB Audio mode.
                    USB332x uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
                    Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers between the Link and PHY to
                    facilitate a USB session with only 12 pins.
                    The USB332x uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
                    less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
                    latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
                    adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.
                                                                        REFCLK

                                                      Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
                                                                                                                Datasheet
            The USB332x includes an integrated 3.3V Low Drop Out (LDO) linear voltage regulator that may
            optionally be used to generate 3.3V from power applied at the VBAT pin. The voltage on the VBAT
            pin can range from 3.1 to 5.5V. The regulator dropout voltage is less than 100mV which allows the
            PHY to continue USB signaling when the voltage on VBAT drops to 3.1V. The USB transceiver will
            continue to operate at lower voltages, although some parameters may be outside the limits of the USB
            specifications. If the user would like to provide a 3.3V supply to the USB332x, the VBAT and VDD33
            pins should be connected together as described in Section 5.5.1.
            The USB332x also includes integrated pull-up resistors that can be used for detecting the attachment
            of a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to a USB Charger, a product using the USB332x can
            charge its battery at more than the 500mA allowed when charging from a USB Host as described in
            Section 8.2.
            In USB UART mode, the USB332x DP and DM pins are redefined to enable pass-through of
            asynchronous serial data. The USB332x can only enter UART mode when the user programs the part
            into this mode, as described in Section 6.5.1.
            In USB audio mode, a switch connects the DP pin to the SPK_R pin, and another switch connects he
            DM pin to the SPK_L pin. These switches are shown in the lower left-hand corner of Figure 5.1.The
            USB332x can be configured to enter USB audio mode as described in Section 6.5.2. In addition, these
            switches are on when the RESETB pin of the USB332x is asserted. The USB audio mode enables
            audio signalling from a single USB port of connection, and the switches may also be used to connect
            Full Speed USB from another PHY onto the USB cable.

5.2.1        USB Transceiver
             The USB332x transceiver includes the receivers and transmitters required to be compliant to the
             Universal Serial Bus Specification Rev 2.0. The DP/DM signals in the USB cable connect directly to
             the receivers and transmitters.
             The RX block consists of separate differential receivers for HS and FS/LS mode. Depending on the
             mode, the selected receiver provides the serial data stream through the multiplexer to the RX Logic
             block. For HS mode support, the HS RX block contains a squelch circuit to insure that noise is not

               interpreted as data. The RX block also includes a single-ended receiver on each of the data lines to
               determine the correct FS linestate.
               Data from the TX Logic block is encoded, bit stuffed, serialized and transmitted onto the USB cable
               by the TX block. Separate differential FS/LS and HS transmitters are included to support all modes.
               The USB332x TX block meets the HS signalling level requirements in the USB 2.0 Specification when
               the PCB traces from the DP and DM pins to the USB connector have very little loss. In some systems,
               it may be desirable to compensate for loss by adjusting the HS transmitter amplitude. The Boost bits
               in the HS TX Boost register may be configured to adjust the HS transmitter amplitude at the DP and
               DM pins.
5.2.2          Termination Resistors
               The USB332x transceiver fully integrates all of the USB termination resistors on both DP and DM. This
               includes 1.5kΩ pull-up resistors, 15kΩ pull-down resistors and the 45Ω high speed termination
               resistors. These resistors require no tuning or trimming by the Link. The state of the resistors is
               determined by the operating mode of the PHY when operating in synchronous mode.
               The XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect and OpMode[1:0] bits in the Function Control register, and the
               DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register control the configuration. The possible
               valid resistor combinations are shown in Table 5.1, and operation is guaranteed in only the
               configurations shown. If a ULPI Register Setting is configured that does not match a setting in the
               table, the transceiver operation is not guaranteed and the settings in the last row of Table 5.1 will be
               used.

Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
Datasheet
                The USB332x uses the 27% resistor ECN resistor tolerances. The resistor values are shown in
                Table 4.5.
 5.3            Bias Generator
                This block consists of an internal bandgap reference circuit used for generating the driver current and
                the biasing of the analog circuits. This block requires an external 8.06KΩ, 1% tolerance, reference
                resistor connected from RBIAS to ground. This resistor should be placed as close as possible to the
                USB332x to minimize the trace length. The nominal voltage at RBIAS is 0.8V +/- 10% and therefore
                the resistor will dissipate approximately 80μW of power.
 5.4            Integrated Low Jitter PLL
                The USB332x uses an integrated low jitter phase locked loop (PLL) to provide a clean 480MHz clock
                required for HS USB signal quality. This clock is used by the PHY during both transmit and receive.
                The USB332x PLL requires an accurate frequency reference to be driven on the REFCLK pin.
                The system must not drive voltage on the CLKOUT pin following POR or hardware reset that exceeds
                the value of VIH_ED provided in Table 4.4.
 5.4.1          REFCLK Frequency Selection
                The USB332x is designed to operate in one of two available modes. In the first mode, a 60MHz ULPI
                clock is driven on the REFCLK pin. In the second mode, the unique reference clock frequency shown
                in Order Numbers on page 2 is driven on the REFCLK pin. The the Link is driving the ULPI clock in
                the first mode, and this is referred to as ULPI Clock In Mode. In the second mode, the USB332x
                generates the ULPI clock, and this is referred to as ULPI Clock Out Mode.
                During start-up, the USB332x monitors the CLKOUT pin. If a connection to VDD18 is detected, the
                USB332x is configured for a 60MHz ULPI reference clock driven into the REFCLK pin. Section 5.4.1.1
                and Section 5.4.1.2 describe how to configure the USB332x for either ULPI Clock In Mode or ULPI
                Clock Out Mode.
 5.4.1.1        ULPI Clock In Mode (60MHz REFCLK Mode)
                When using ULPI Clock In Mode, the Link must supply the 60MHz ULPI clock to the USB332x. In this
                mode the 60MHz ULPI Clock is connected to the REFCLK pin, and the CLKOUT pin is tied high to
                VDD18. An example of ULPI Clock In Mode is shown in Figure 8.2. After the PLL has locked to the
                correct frequency, the USB332x will de-assert DIR and the Link can begin using the ULPI interface.
                The USB332x is guaranteed to start the clock within the time specified in Table 4.2. For Host
                applications, the ULPI AutoResume bit should be enabled. This is described in Section 6.2.4.4.

5.4.1.2    ULPI Clock Out Mode
           When using ULPI Clock Out Mode, the USB332x generates the 60MHz ULPI clock used by the Link.
           In this mode, the REFCLK pin must be driven with the model-specific frequency, and the CLKOUT pin
           sources the 60MHz ULPI clock to the Link. An example of ULPI Clock Out Mode is shown in Figure 8.1
           After the PLL has locked to the correct frequency, the USB332x generates the 60MHz ULPI clock on
           the CLKOUT pin, and de-asserts DIR to indicate that the PLL is locked. The USB332x is guaranteed
           to start the clock within the time specified in Table 4.2, and it will be accurate to within ±500ppm. For
           Host applications the ULPI AutoResume bit should be enabled. This is described in Section 6.2.4.4.
           When using ULPI Clock Out Mode, the edges of the reference clock do not need to be aligned in any
           way to the ULPI interface signals. There is no need to align the phase of the REFCLK and the
           CLKOUT.

                can be driven with a square wave from 0V to as high as 3.6V. The USB332x uses only the positive
                edge of the REFCLK.
                If a digital reference is not available, the REFCLK pin can be driven by an analog sine wave that is
                AC coupled into the REFCLK pin. If using an analog clock the DC bias should be set at the mid-point
                of the VDD18 supply using a bias circuit as shown in Figure 5.4. The amplitude must be greater than
                300mV peak to peak. The component values provided in Figure 5.4 are for example only. The actual
                values should be selected to satisfy system requirements.
                The REFCLK amplitude must comply with the signal amplitudes shown in Table 4.4 and the duty cycle
                in Table 4.2.

5.4.3           REFCLK Jitter
                The USB332x is tolerant to jitter on the reference clock. The REFCLK jitter should be limited to a peak
                to peak jitter of less than 1nS over a 10uS time interval. If this level of jitter is exceeded when
                configured for either ULPI Clock In Mode or ULPI Clock Out Mode, the USB332x Hi-Speed eye
                diagram may be degraded.
                The frequency accuracy of the REFCLK must meet the +/- 500ppm requirement as shown in Table 4.2.
5.4.4           REFCLK Enable/Disable
                The REFCLK should be enabled when the RESETB pin is brought high. The ULPI interface will start
                running after the time specified in Table 4.2. If the REFCLK enable is delayed relative to the RESETB
                pin, the ULPI interface will start operation delayed by the same amount. The REFCLK can be run at
                anytime the RESETB pin is low without causing the USB332x to start-up or draw current.
                When the USB332x is placed in Low Power Mode or Carkit Mode, the REFCLK can be stopped after
                the final ULPI register write is complete. The STP pin is asserted to bring the USB332x out of Low
                Power Mode. The REFCLK should be started at the same time STP is asserted to minimize the
                USB332x start-up time.
                If the REFCLK is stopped while CLKOUT is running, the PLL will come out of lock and the frequency
                of the CLKOUT signal will decrease to the minimum allowed by the PLL design. If the REFCLK is
                stopped during a USB session, the session may drop.

    5.5     Internal Regulators and POR
            The USB332x includes integrated power management functions, including a Low-Dropout regulator
            that can be used to generate the 3.3V USB supply, and a POR generator described in Section 5.5.2.
    5.5.1   Integrated Low Dropout Regulator
            The USB332x has an integrated linear regulator. Power sourced at the VBAT pin is regulated to 3.3V
            and the regulator output is on the VDD33 pin. To ensure stability, the regulator requires an external
            bypass capacitor (COUT) as specified in Table 4.9 placed as close to the pin as possible.
            The USB332x regulator is designed to generate a 3.3 volt supply for the USB332x only. Using the
            regulator to provide current for other circuits is not recommended and SMSC does not guarantee USB
            performance or regulator stability.
            During USB UART mode the regulator output voltage can be changed to allow the USB332x to work
            with UARTs operating at different operating voltages. The regulator output is configured to the voltages
            shown in Table 4.9 with the UART RegOutput[1:0] bits in the USB IO & Power Management register.
            The USB332x regulator can be powered in the three methods as shown below.
            For USB Peripheral, Host, and OTG operations the regulator can be connected as shown in Figure 5.5
            or Figure 5.6 below. For OTG operation, the VDD33 supply on the USB332x must be powered to
            detect devices attaching to the USB connector and detect a SRP during an OTG session. When using
            a battery to supply the USB332x, the battery voltage must be within the range of 3.1V to 5.5V
.

               For peripheral only or host only operation, the VBAT supply shown below in Figure 5.7 may be
               connected to the VBUS pin of the USB connector for bus powered applications. In this configuration,
               external overvoltage protection is required to protect the VBAT supply from any transient voltage
               present at the VBUS pin of the USB connector.
               The VBAT input must never be exposed to a voltage that exceeds VVBAT. (See Table 3.2)

5.5.2       Power On Reset (POR)
            The USB332x provides a POR circuit that generates an internal reset pulse after the VDD18 supply is
            stable. After the internal POR goes high and the RESETB pin is high, the USB332x will release from
            reset and begin normal ULPI operation as described in Section 5.5.4.
            The ULPI registers will power up in their default state summarized in Table 7.1 when the 1.8V supply
            is brought up. Cycling the 1.8 volt power supply will reset the ULPI registers to their default states.
            The RESETB pin can also be used to reset the ULPI registers to their default state (and reset all
            internal state machines) by bringing the pin low for a minimum of 1 microsecond and then high.
            The Link is not required to assert the RESETB pin. A pull-down resistor is not present on the RESETB
            pin and therefore the Link must drive the RESETB pin to the desired state at all times (including
            system start-up) or connect the RESETB pin to VDD18.
5.5.3       Recommended Power Supply Sequence
            The power supplies can be applied to the USB332x in any order. The order in which the supplies are
            brought up is not important. For USB operation the USB332x requires the VBAT, VDD33, and VDD18
            supples.
            When the VBAT supply is applied the integrated regulator will automatically start-up and regulate
            VBAT to VDD33. If the VDD33 supply is powered and the VDD18 supply is not powered, the 3.3V
            circuits are powered off and the VDD33 current will be limited to 20uA as shown in Table 4.1,
            "Operating Current".
            The ULPI interface will start operating after the VDD18 supply is applied and the RESETB pin is
            brought high. The RESETB pin must be held low until the VDD18 supply is stable. If the Link is not
            ready to interface the USB332x, the Link may choose to hold the RESETB pin low until it is ready to
            control the ULPI interface.

                                                       be limited to the RESET Mode current. (Note 5.2)

5.5.4       Start-Up
            The power on default state of the USB332x is ULPI Synchronous mode. The USB332x requires the
            following conditions to begin operation: the power supplies must be stable, the REFCLK must be

                present and the RESETB pin must be high. After these conditions are met, the USB332x will begin
                ULPI operation that is described in Chapter 6, ULPI Operation.
                Figure 5.8 below shows a timing diagram to illustrate the start-up of the USB332x. At T0, the supplies
                are stable and the USB332x is held in reset mode. At T1, the Link drives RESETB high after the
                REFCLK has started. The RESETB pin may be brought high asynchronously to REFCLK. At this point
                the USB332x will drive idle on the data bus and assert DIR until the internal PLL has locked. After the
                PLL has locked, the USB332x will check that the Link has de-asserted STP and at T2 it will de-assert
                DIR and begin ULPI operation.
                The ULPI bus will be available as shown in Figure 5.8 in the time defined as TSTART given in Table 4.2.
                If the REFCLK signal starts after the RESETB pin is brought high, then time T0 will begin when
                REFCLK starts. TSTART also assumes that the Link has de-asserted STP. If the Link has held STP
                high the USB332x will hold DIR high until STP is de-asserted. When the LINK de-asserts STP, it must
                drive a ULPI IDLE one cycle after DIR de-asserts.

 5.6            USB On-The-Go (OTG)
                The USB332x provides full support for USB OTG protocol. OTG allows the USB332x to be dynamically
                configured as a host or device depending on the type of cable inserted into the Micro-AB receptacle.
                When the Micro-A plug of a cable is inserted into the Micro-AB receptacle, the USB device becomes
                the A-device. When a Micro-B plug is inserted, the device becomes the B-device. The OTG A-device
                behaves similar to a Host while the B-device behaves similar to a peripheral. The differences are
                covered in the “On-The-Go Supplement to the USB 2.0 Specification”. In applications where only Host
                or Device is required, the OTG Module is unused.
 5.6.1          ID Resistor Detection
                The ID pin of the USB connector is monitored by the ID pin of the USB332x to detect the attachment
                of different types of USB devices and cables. For device only applications that do not use the ID signal
                the ID pin should be connected to VDD33. The block diagram of the ID detection circuitry is shown in
                Figure 5.9 and the related parameters are given in Table 4.7.

           The USB332x can detect ID grounded and ID floating to determine if an A or B cable has been
           inserted. The A plug will ground the ID pin while the B plug will float the ID pin. These are the only
           two valid states allowed in the OTG Protocol.
           To monitor the status of the ID pin, the Link activates the IdPullup bit in the OTG Control register, waits
           50mS and then reads the status of the IdGnd bit in the USB Interrupt Status register. If an A cable has
           been inserted the IdGnd bit will read 0. If a B cable is inserted, the ID pin is floating and the IdGnd bit
           will read 1.
           The USB332x provides an integrated weak pull-up resistor on the ID pin, RIDW. This resistor is present
           to keep the ID pin in a known state when the IdPullup bit is disabled and the ID pin is floated. In
           addition to keeping the ID pin in a known state, it enables the USB332x to generate an interrupt to
           inform the link when a cable with a resistor to ground has been attached to the ID pin. The weak pull-
           up is small enough that the largest valid Rid resistor pulls the ID pin low and causes the IdGnd
           comparator to go low.
           After the link has detected an ID pin state change, the RID converter can be used to determine the
           resistor value as described in Section 5.6.1.2.
5.6.1.2    Measuring ID Resistance to Ground
           The Link can used the integrated resistance measurement capabilities to determine the value of an ID
           resistance to ground. The following table details the valid values of resistance, to ground, the USB332x
           can detect.

                Note: IdPullUp = 0
                The Rid resistance can be read while the USB332x is in Synchronous Mode. When a resistor to ground
                is attached to the ID pin, the state of the IdGnd comparator will change. After the Link has detected
                ID transition to ground, it can use the methods described in Section 6.6 to operate the Rid converter.
 5.6.1.3        Using IdFloat Comparator
                Note: The ULPI specification details a method to detect a 102kΩ resistance to ground using the
                         IdFloat comparator. This method can only detect 0ohms, 102kΩ, and floating terminations of
                         the ID pin. Due to this limitation it is recommended to use the RID Converter as described in
                         Section 5.6.1.2.
                The ID pin can be either grounded, floated, or connected to ground with a 102kΩ external resistor. To
                detect the 102K resistor, set the idPullup bit in the OTG Control register, causing the USB332x to apply
                the 100K internal pull-up connected between the ID pin and VDD33. Set the idFloatRise and idFloatFall
                bits in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers to enable the
                IdFloat comparator to generate an RXCMD to the Link when the state of the IdFloat changes. As
                described in Figure 6.3, the alt_int bit of the RXCMD will be set. The values of IdGnd and IdFloat are
                shown for the three types cables that can attach to the USB Connector in Table 5.4.

                            GND                                          0                              0
                Note: The ULPI register bits IdPullUp, IdFloatRise, and IdFloatFall should be enabled.
                To save current when an A Plug is inserted, the internal 102kΩ pull-up resistor can be disabled by
                clearing the IdPullUp bit in the OTG Control register and the IdFloatRise and IdFloatFall bits in both
                the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. If the cable is removed
                the weak RIDW will pull the ID pin high.
                The IdGnd value can be read using the ULPI USB Interrupt Status register, bit 4. In host mode, it can
                be set to generate an interrupt when IdGnd changes by setting the appropriate bits in the USB Interrupt
                Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. The IdFloat value can be read by reading
                the ULPI Carkit Interrupt Status register bit 0.

5.6.2      VBUS Monitor and Pulsing
           The USB332x includes all of the VBUS comparators required for OTG. The VBUSVld, SessVld, and
           SessEnd comparators shown in Figure 5.10 are fully integrated into the USB332x. These comparators
           are used to monitor changes in the VBUS voltage, and the state of each comparator can be read from
           the USB Interrupt Status register.
           The VbusVld comparator is used by the Link, when configured as an A device, to ensure that the
           VBUS voltage on the cable is valid. The SessVld comparator is used by the Link when configured as
           both an A or B device to indicate a session is requested or valid. Finally the SessEnd comparator is
           used by the B-device to indicate a USB session has ended.
           Also included in the VBUS Monitor and Pulsing block are the resistors used for VBUS pulsing in SRP.
           The resistors used for VBUS pulsing include a pull-down to ground and a pull-up to VDD33.
           In some applications, voltages much greater than 5.5V may be present at the VBUS pin of the USB
           connector. The USB332x includes an overvoltage protection circuit that protects the VBUS pin of the
           USB332x from excessive voltages as shown in Figure 5.10.

5.6.2.1    SessEnd Comparator
           The SessEnd comparator is designed to trip when VBUS is less than 0.5 volts. When VBUS goes
           below 0.5 volts the USB session is considered to be ended, and SessEnd will transition from 0 to 1.
           The SessEnd comparator can be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising
           and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. When disabled, the SessEnd bit in the USB Interrupt Status
           register will read 0. The SessEnd comparator trip points are detailed in Table 4.7.

 5.6.2.2        SessVld Comparator
                The SessVld comparator is used when the PHY is configured as both an A and B device. When
                configured as an A device, the SessVld is used to detect Session Request protocol (SRP). When
                configured as a B device, SessVld is used to detect the presence of VBUS. The SessVld interrupts
                can be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable
                Falling registers. When the interrupts are disabled, the SessVld comparator is not disabled and its state
                can be read in the USB Interrupt Status register. The SessVld comparator trip point is detailed in
                Table 4.7.
                Note: The OTG Supplement specifies a voltage range for A-Device Session Valid and B-Device
                         Session Valid comparator. The USB332x PHY combines the two comparators into one and
                         uses the narrower threshold range.
 5.6.2.3        VbusVld Comparator
                The final VBUS comparator is the VbusVld comparator. This comparator is only used when the
                USB332x is configured as an A-device. In the USB protocol the A-device supplies the VBUS voltage
                and is responsible to ensure it remains within a specified voltage range. The VbusVld comparator can
                be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable
                Falling registers. When disabled, bit 1 of the USB Interrupt Status register will return a 0. The VbusVld
                comparator trip points are detailed in Table 4.7.
                The internal VbusValid comparator is designed to ensure the VBUS voltage remains above 4.4V.
                The USB332x includes the external vbus valid indicator logic as detail in the ULPI Specification. The
                external vbus valid indicator is tied to a logic one. The decoding of this logic is shown in Table 5.5
                below. By default this logic is disabled.

                             SessVld because the internal VbusVld threshold can be above the VBUS voltage required
                             for USB peripheral operation.

5.6.2.4     VBUS Pulsing with Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors
            In addition to the internal VBUS comparators, the USB332x also includes the integrated VBUS pull-up
            and pull-down resistors used for VBUS Pulsing during OTG Session Request Protocol. To discharge
            the VBUS voltage so that a Session Request can begin, the USB332x provides a pull-down resistor
            from VBUS to Ground. This resistor is controlled by the DischargeVbus bit 3 of the OTG Control
            register. The pull-up resistor is connected between VBUS and VDD33. This resistor is used to pull
            VBUS above 2.1 volts so that the A-Device knows that a USB session has been requested. The state
            of the pull-up resistor is controlled by the bit 4 ChargeVbus of the OTG Control register. The Pull-Up
            and Pull-Down resistor values are detailed in Table 4.7.
            The internal VBUS Pull-up and Pull-down resistors are designed to include the RVBUS external resistor
            in series. This external resistor is used by the VBUS Overvoltage protection described below.
5.6.2.5     VBUS Input Impedance
            The OTG Supplement requires an A-Device that supports Session Request Protocol to have a VBUS
            input impedance less than 100kΩ and greater the 40kΩ to ground. The USB332x provides a 75kΩ
            resistance to ground, RVB. The RVB resistor tolerance is detailed in Table 4.7.
5.6.2.6     VBUS Overvoltage Protection
            The USB332x provides an integrated overvoltage protection circuit to protect the VBUS pin from
            excessive voltages that may be present at the USB connector. The overvoltage protection circuit works
            with an external resistor (RVBUS) by drawing current across the resistor to reduce the voltage at the
            VBUS pin.
            When voltage at the VBUS pin exceeds 5.5V, the Overvoltage Protection block will sink current to
            ground until VBUS is below 5.5V. The current drops the excess voltage across RVBUS and protects the
            USB332x VBUS pin. The required RVBUS value is dependent on the operating mode of the USB332x
            as shown in Table 5.6.

            The Overvoltage Protection circuit is designed to protect the USB332x from continuous voltages up to
            30V on the RVBUS resistor.
            The RVBUS resistor must be sized to handle the power dissipated across the resistor. The resistor
            power can be found using the equation below:
                                                                                               2

                For example, protecting a peripheral or device only application to 15V would require a 10kΩ RVBUS
                resistor with a power rating of 0.01W. To protect an OTG product to 15V would require a 1kΩ RVBUS
                resistor with a power rating of 0.1W.
 5.6.3          Driving External VBUS
                The USB332x monitors VBUS as described in VBUS Monitor and Pulsing. The USB332x does not
                provide an external output for the DrvVbusExternal ULPI register. For OTG and Host applications, the
                external VBUS supply or power switch must be controlled by the Link as shown in Figure 8.2.
 5.7            USB UART Support
                The USB332x provides support for the USB UART interface as detailed in the ULPI specification and
                the former CEA-936A specification. The USB332x can be placed in UART Mode using the method
                described in Section 6.5, and the regulator output will automatically switch to the value configured by
                the UART RegOutput bits in the USB IO & Power Management register. While in UART mode, the
                Linestate signals cannot be monitored on the DATA[0] and DATA[1] pins.
 5.8            USB Charger Detection Support
                To support the detection and identification of different types of USB chargers the USB332x provides
                integrated pull-up resistors, RCD, on both DP and DM. These pull-up resistors along with the single
                ended receivers can be used to help determine the type of USB charger attached. Reference
                information on implementing charger detection is provided in Section 8.2.

                Note: ChargerPullupEnableDP and ChargerPullupEnableDM are enabled in the USB IO & Power
                         Management register.
 5.9            USB Audio Support
                Note: The USB332x supports “USB Digital Audio” through the USB protocol in ULPI and USB Serial
                         modes described in Section 6.
                The USB332x provides two low resistance analog switches that allow analog audio to be multiplexed
                over the DP and DM terminals of the USB connector. The audio switches are shown in Figure 5.1. The
                electrical characteristics of the USB Audio Switches are provided in Table 4.8.
                During normal USB operation the switches are off. When USB Audio is desired the switches can be
                turned “on” by enabling the SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn bits in the Carkit Control register as
                described in Section 6.5.2. These bits are disabled by default. The USB Audio Switches can also be
                enabled by asserting the RESETB pin or removing the voltage at VDD18 as shown in Table 5.8. While
                using the USB switches, VDD18 is not required, but 3.3V must be present at VDD33. The integrated
                3.3V LDO regulator may be used to generate VDD33 from power applied at the VBAT pin.

            Note: SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, and MicEn are enabled in the Carkit Control register.
            In addition to USB Audio support the switches can also be used to multiplexed a second FS USB PHY
            to the USB connector. The signal quality will be degraded slightly due to the “on” resistance of the
            switches. The USB332x single-ended receivers described in Section 5.2.1 are disabled when either
            USB Audio switch is enabled.
            The USB332x does not provide the DC bias for the audio signals. The SPK_R and SPK_L pins should
            be biased to 1.65V when audio signals are routed through the USB332x. This DC bias is necessary
            to prevent the audio signal from swinging below ground and being clipped by ESD Diodes.
            When the system is not using the USB Audio switches, the SPK_R and SPK_L pins should not be
            connected.

Chapter 6 ULPI Operation
6.1              Overview
                 The USB332x uses the industry standard ULPI digital interface to facilitate communication between
                 the PHY and Link (device controller). The ULPI interface is designed to reduce the number of pins
                 required to connect a discrete USB PHY to an ASIC or digital controller. For example, a full UTMI+
                 Level 3 OTG interface requires 54 signals while a ULPI interface requires only 12 signals.
                 The ULPI interface is documented completely in the “UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) Specification
                 Revision 1.1”. The following sections describe the operating modes of the USB332x digital interface.
                 Figure 6.1 illustrates the block diagram of the ULPI digital functions. It should be noted that this
                 USB332x does not use a “ULPI wrapper” around a UTMI+ PHY core as the ULPI specification implies.

            low latency PHY allows a Link to use a wrapper around a UTMI Link and still make the required USB
            turn-around timing given in the USB 2.0 specification.
            RxEndDelay maximum allowed by the UTMI+/ULPI for 8-bit data is 63 high speed clocks. USB332x
            uses a low latency high speed receiver path to lower the RxEndDelay to 43 high speed clocks. This
            low latency design gives the Link more cycles to make decisions and reduces the Link complexity. This
            is the result of the “wrapper less” architecture of the USB332x. This low RxEndDelay should allow
            legacy UTMI Links to use a “wrapper” to convert the UTMI+ interface to a ULPI interface.
            In Figure 6.1, a single ULPI Protocol Block decodes the ULPI 8-bit bi-directional bus when the Link
            addresses the PHY. The Link must use the DIR output to determine direction of the ULPI data bus.
            The USB332x is the “bus arbitrator”. The ULPI Protocol Block will route data/commands to the
            transmitter or the ULPI register array.
6.1.1       ULPI Interface Signals
            The UTIM+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) uses twelve pins to connect a full OTG Host / Device PHY to an
            SOC. A reduction of external pins on the PHY is accomplished by realizing that many of the relatively
            static configuration pins (xcvrselect[1:0], termselect, opmode[1:0], and DpPullDown DmPulldown to list
            a few,) can be implemented by having an internal static register array.
            An 8-bit bi-directional data bus clocked at 60MHz allows the Link to access this internal register array
            and transfer USB packets to and from the PHY. The remaining 3 pins function to control the data flow
            and arbitrate the data bus.
            Direction of the 8-bit data bus is controlled by the DIR output from the PHY. Another output, NXT, is
            used to control data flow into and out of the device. Finally, STP, which is in input to the PHY,
            terminates transfers and is used to start up and resume from Low Power Mode.
            The twelve signals are described below in Table 6.1.
                                          Table 6.1 ULPI Interface Signals
   SIGNAL       DIRECTION                                            DESCRIPTION
 CLK           I/O              60MHz ULPI clock. All ULPI signals are driven synchronous to the rising edge of
                                this clock. This clock can be either driven by the PHY or the Link as described in
                                Section 5.4.1
 DATA[7:0]     I/O              8-bit bi-directional data bus. Bus ownership is determined by DIR. The Link and
                                PHY initiate data transfers by driving a non-zero pattern onto the data bus. ULPI
                                defines interface timing for a single-edge data transfers with respect to rising edge
                                of the ULPI clock.
 DIR           OUT              Controls the direction of the data bus. When the PHY has data to transfer to the
                                Link, it drives DIR high to take ownership of the bus. When the PHY has no data
                                to transfer it drives DIR low and monitors the bus for commands from the Link. The
                                PHY will pull DIR high whenever the interface cannot accept data from the Link,
                                such as during PLL start-up.
 STP           IN               The Link asserts STP for one clock cycle to stop the data stream currently on the
                                bus. If the Link is sending data to the PHY, STP indicates the last byte of data was
                                on the bus in the previous cycle.
 NXT           OUT              The PHY asserts NXT to throttle the data. When the Link is sending data to the
                                PHY, NXT indicates when the current byte has been accepted by the PHY. The
                                Link places the next byte on the data bus in the following clock cycle.
            USB332x implements a Single Data Rate (SDR) ULPI interface with all data transfers happening on
            the rising edge of the 60MHz ULPI Clock while operating in Synchronous Mode. The direction of the
            data bus is determined by the state of DIR. When DIR is high, the PHY is driving DATA[7:0]. When
            DIR is low, the Link is driving DATA[7:0].

                Each time DIR changes, a “turn-around” cycle occurs where neither the Link nor PHY drive the data
                bus for one clock cycle. During the “turn–around“cycle, the state of DATA[7:0] is unknown and the
                PHY will not read the data bus.
                Because USB uses a bit-stuffing encoding, some means of allowing the PHY to throttle the USB
                transmit data is needed. The ULPI signal NXT is used to request the next byte to be placed on the
                data bus by the Link layer.
                The ULPI interface supports the two basic modes of operation: Synchronous Mode and asynchronous
                modes that include Low Power Mode, Serial Modes, and Carkit Mode. In Synchronous Mode, all
                signals change synchronously with the 60MHz ULPI clock. In asynchronous modes the clock is off and
                the ULPI bus is redefined to bring out the signals required for that particular mode of operations. The
                description of synchronous Mode is described in the following sections while the descriptions of the
                asynchronous modes are described in Section 6.3, Section 6.4, and Section 6.5.
 6.1.2           ULPI Interface Timing in Synchronous Mode
                The control and data timing relationships are given in Figure 6.2 and Table 4.3. All timing is relative to
                the rising clock edge of the 60MHz ULPI Clock.

 6.2             ULPI Register Access
                A command from the Link begins a ULPI transfer from the Link to the USB332x. Before reading a ULPI
                register, the Link must wait until DIR is low, and then send a Transmit Command Byte (TXD CMD)
                byte. The TXD CMD byte informs the USB332x of the type of data being sent. The TXD CMD is
                followed by a data transfer to or from the USB332x. Table 6.2 gives the TXD command byte (TXD
                CMD) encoding for the USB332x. The upper two bits of the TX CMD instruct the PHY as to what type
                of packet the Link is transmitting. The ULPI registers retain their contents when the PHY is in Low
                Power Mode, Full Speed/Low Speed Serial Mode, or Carkit Mode.

              DATA[7:6] = 10b is driven by the Link at T0. The register address is encoded into DATA[5:0] of the

                bus and drive STP high to signal the end of the data packet. Finally, at T5, the PHY will latch the data
                into the register and the Link will pull STP low.
                NXT is used to control when the Link drives the register data on the bus. DIR is low throughout this
                transaction since the PHY is receiving data from the Link. STP is used to end the transaction and data
                is registered after the de-assertion of STP. After the write operation completes, the Link must drive a
                ULPI Idle (00h) on the data bus or the USB332x may decode the bus value as a ULPI command.
                A ULPI extended register write operation is shown in Figure 6.4. To write an extended register, the Link
                will wait until DIR is low, and at T0, drive the TXD CMD on the data bus. At T2 the PHY will drive NXT
                high. On the next clock T3 the Link will drive the extended address. On the next rising clock edge, T4,
                the Link will write the register data. At T5, the PHY will accept the register data and drive NXT low.

            At T0, the Link will place the TXD CMD on the data bus. At T2, the PHY will bring NXT high, signaling
            the Link it is ready to accept the data transfer. At T3, the PHY reads the TXD CMD, determines it is
            a register read, and asserts DIR to gain control of the bus. The PHY will also de-assert NXT. At T4,
            the bus ownership has transferred back to the PHY and the PHY drives the requested register onto
            the data bus. At T5, the Link will read the data bus and the PHY will drop DIR low returning control of
            the bus back to the Link. After the turn around cycle, the Link must drive a ULPI Idle command at T6.
            A ULPI extended register read operation is shown in Figure 6.6.To read an extended register, the Link
            writes the TX CMD with the address set to 2Fh. At T2, the PHY will assert NXT, signaling the Link it
            is ready to accept the extended address. At T3, the Link places the extended register address on the
            bus. At T4, the PHY reads the extended address, and asserts DIR to gain control of the bus. The PHY
            will also de-assert NXT. At T5, the bus ownership has transferred back to the PHY and the PHY drives
            the requested register onto the data bus. At T6, the Link will read the data bus and the PHY will de-
            assert DIR returning control of the bus back to the Link. After the turn around cycle, the Link must
            drive a ULPI Idle command at T6.

 6.2.3          ULPI RXCMD
                The ULPI Link needs information which was provided by the following pins in a UTMI implementation:
                linestate[1:0], rxactive, rxvalid and rxerror. When implementing the OTG functions, the VBUS and ID
                pin states must also be transferred to the Link.
                ULPI defines a Receive Command Byte (RXCMD) that contains this information. The Encoding of the
                RXCMD byte is given in the Table 6.3.
                Transfer of the RXCMD byte occurs in Synchronous Mode when the PHY has control of the bus. The
                ULPI Protocol Block shown in Figure 6.1 determines when to send an RXCMD.
                A RXCMD can occur:
                    When a linestate change occurs.
                    When VBUS or ID comparators change state.
                    During a USB receive when NXT is low.
                    After the USB332x deasserts DIR and STP is low during start-up
                    After the USB332x exits Low Power Mode, Serial Modes, or Carkit Mode after detecting that the
                     Link has de-asserted STP, and DIR is low.
                When a USB Receive is occurring, RXCMD’s are sent whenever NXT = 0 and DIR = 1. During a USB
                Transmit, the RXCMD’s are returned to the Link after STP is asserted.
                If an RXCMD event occurs during a USB transmit, the RXCMD is blocked until STP de-asserts at the
                end of the transmit. The RXCMD contains the status that is current at the time the RXCMD is sent.

                         reflects the current state of DM. When DP=DM=0 this is called "Single Ended Zero" (SE0).
                         When DP=DM=1, this is called "Single Ended One" (SE1).
6.2.4       USB332x Transmitter
            The USB332x ULPI transmitter fully supports HS, FS, and LS transmit operations. Figure 6.1 shows
            the high speed, full speed, and low speed transmitter block controlled by ULPI Protocol Block.
            Encoding of the USB packet follows the bit-stuffing and NRZI outlined in the USB 2.0 specification.
            Many of these functions are re-used between the HS and FS/LS transmitters. When using the
            USB332x, Table 5.1 should always be used as a guideline on how to configure for various modes of
            operation. The transmitter decodes the inputs of XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect, OpMode[1:0],
            DpPulldown, and DmPulldown to determine what operation is expected. Users must strictly adhere to
            the modes of operation given in Table 5.1.

Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
Datasheet
                Several important functions for a device and host are designed into the transmitter blocks.
                The USB332x transmitter will transmit a 32-bit long high speed sync before every high speed packet.
                In full and low speed modes a 8-bit sync is transmitted.
                When the device or host needs to chirp for high speed port negotiation, the OpMode = 10 setting will
                turn off the bit-stuffing and NRZI encoding in the transmitter. At the end of a chirp, the USB332x
                OpMode register bits should be changed only after the RXCMD linestate encoding indicates that the
                transmitter has completed transmitting. Should the opmode be switched to normal bit-stuffing and NRZI
                encoding before the transmit pipeline is empty, the remaining data in the pipeline may be transmitted
                in an bit-stuff encoding format.
                Please refer to the ULPI specification for a detailed discussion of USB reset and HS chirp.
 6.2.4.1        High Speed Long EOP
                When operating as a Hi-Speed host, the USB332x will automatically generate a 40 bit long End of
                Packet (EOP) after a SOF PID (A5h). The USB332x determines when to send the 40-bit long EOP by
                decoding the ULPI TXD CMD bits [3:0] for the SOF. The 40-bit long EOP is only transmitted when the
                DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register are asserted. The Hi-Speed 40-bit long
                EOP is used to detect a disconnect in high speed mode.
                In device mode, the USB332x will not send a long EOP after a SOF PID.
 6.2.4.2        Low Speed Keep-Alive
                Low speed keep alive is supported by the USB332x. When in Low speed (10b), the USB332x will send
                out two Low speed bit times of SE0 when a SOF PID is received.
 6.2.4.3        UTMI+ Level 3
                Pre-amble is supported for UTMI+ Level 3 compatibility. When XcvrSelect is set to (11b) in host mode,
                (DpPulldown and DmPulldown both asserted) the USB332x will pre-pend a full speed pre-amble before
                the low speed packet. Full speed rise and fall times are used in this mode. The pre-amble consists of
                the following: Full speed sync, the encoded pre-PID (C3h) and then full speed idle (DP=1 and DM =
                0). A low speed packet follows with a sync, data and a LS EOP.
                The USB332x will only support UTMI+ Level 3 as a host. The USB332x does not support UTMI+ Level
                3 as a peripheral. A UTMI+ Level 3 peripheral is an upstream hub port. The USB332x will not decode
                a pre-amble packet intended for a LS device when the USB332x is configured as the upstream port
                of a FS hub, XcvrSelect = 11b, DpPulldown = 0b, DmPulldown =0b.
 6.2.4.4        Host Resume K
                Resume K generation is supported by the USB332x. When the USB332x exits the suspended (Low
                Power Mode), the USB332x, when operating as a host, will transmit a K on DP/DM. The transmitters
                will end the K with SE0 for two Low Speed bit times. If the USB332x was operating in high speed
                mode before the suspend, the host must change to high speed mode before the SE0 ends. SE0 is
                two low speed bit times which is about 1.2 us. For more details please see sections 7.1.77 and 7.9 of
                the USB Specification.
                In device mode, the resume K will not append an SE0, but release the bus to the correct idle state,
                depending upon the operational mode as shown in Table 5.1.
                The ULPI specification includes a detailed discussion of the resume sequence and the order of
                operations required. To support Host start-up of less than 1mS the USB332x implements the ULPI
                AutoResume bit in the Interface Control register. The default AutoResume state is 0 and this bit should
                be enabled for Host applications.

6.2.4.5         No SYNC and EOP Generation (OpMode = 11)
                UTMI+ defines OpMode = 11 where no sync and EOP generation occurs in Hi-Speed operation. This
                is an option to the ULPI specification and not implemented in the USB332x.
6.2.4.6         Typical USB Transmit with ULPI
                Figure 6.7 shows a typical USB transmit sequence. A transmit sequence starts by the Link sending a
                TXD CMD where DATA[7:6] = 01b, DATA[5:4] = 00b, and Data[3:0] = PID. The TX CMD with the PID
                is followed by transmit data.

                During transmit the PHY will use NXT to control the rate of data flow into the PHY. If the USB332x
                pipeline is full or bit-stuffing causes the data pipeline to overfill NXT is de-asserted and the Link will
                hold the value on Data until NXT is asserted. The USB Transmit ends when the Link asserts STP while
                NXT is asserted.
                Note: The Link cannot assert STP with NXT de-asserted since the USB332x is expecting to fetch
                         another byte from the Link.
                After the USB332x completes transmitting, the DP and DM lines return to idle and a RXCMD is
                returned to the Link so the inter-packet timers may be updated by linestate.
                While operating in Full Speed or Low Speed, an End-of-Packet (EOP) is defined as SE0 for
                approximately two bit times, followed by J for one bit time. The transceiver drives a J state for one bit
                time following the SE0 to complete the EOP. The Link must wait for one bit time following line state
                indication of the SE0 to J transition to allow the transceiver to complete the one bit time J state. All bit
                times are relative to the speed of transmission.
                In the case of Full Speed or Low Speed, after STP is asserted each FS/LS bit transition will generate
                a RXCMD since the bit times are relatively slow.
6.2.5           USB Receiver
                The USB332x ULPI receiver fully supports HS, FS, and LS transmit operations. In all three modes the
                receiver detects the start of packet and synchronizes to the incoming data packet. In the ULPI protocol,
                a received packet has the priority and will immediately follow register reads and RXCMD transfers.
                Figure 6.8 shows a basic USB packet received by the USB332x over the ULPI interface.

                In Figure 6.8 the PHY asserts DIR to take control of the data bus from the Link. The assertion of DIR
                and NXT in the same cycle contains additional information that Rxactive has been asserted. When
                NXT is de-asserted and DIR is asserted, the RXCMD data is transferred to the Link. After the last byte
                of the USB receive packet is transferred to the PHY, the linestate will return to idle.
                The ULPI full speed receiver operates according to the UTMI / ULPI specification. In the full speed
                case, the NXT signal will assert only when the Data bus has a valid received data byte. When NXT is
                low with DIR high, the RXCMD is driven on the data bus.
                In full speed, the USB332x will not issue a Rxactive de-assertion in the RXCMD until the DP/DM
                linestate transitions to idle. This prevents the Link from violating the two full speed bit times minimum
                turn around time.
 6.2.5.1        Disconnect Detection
                A High Speed host must detect a disconnect by sampling the transmitter outputs during the long EOP
                transmitted during a SOF packet. The USB332x only looks for a high speed disconnect during the long
                EOP where the period is long enough for the disconnect reflection to return to the host PHY. When a
                high speed disconnect occurs, the USB332x will return a RXCMD and set the host disconnect bit in
                the USB Interrupt Status register.
                When in FS or LS modes, the Link is expected to handle all disconnect detection.
 6.3            Low Power Mode
                Low Power Mode is a power down state to save current when the USB session is suspended. The
                Link controls when the PHY is placed into or out of Low Power Mode. In Low Power Mode all of the
                circuits are powered down except the interface pins, full speed receiver, VBUS comparators, and IdGnd
                comparator.
                Before entering Low Power Mode, the USB332x must be configured to set the desired state of the
                USB transceiver. The XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect and OpMode[1:0] bits in the Function Control
                register, and the DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register control the
                configuration as shown in Table 5.1. The DP and DM pins are configured to a high impedance state
                by configuring OpMode[1:0] = 01. Pull-down resistors with a value of approximately 2MΩ are present

                float.
6.3.1           Entering Low Power/Suspend Mode
                To enter Low Power Mode, the Link will write a 0 or clear the SuspendM bit in the Function Control
                register. After this write is complete, the PHY will assert DIR high and after a minimum of five rising
                edges of CLKOUT, drive the clock low. After the clock is stopped, the PHY will enter a low power state
                to conserve current. Placing the PHY in Suspend Mode is not related to USB Suspend. To clarify this
                point, USB Suspend is initiated when a USB host stops data transmissions and enters Full-Speed
                mode with 15KΩ pull-down resistors on DP and DM. The suspended device goes to Full-Speed mode
                with a pull-up on DP. Both the host and device remain in this state until one of them drives DM high
                (this is called a resume).

                While in Low Power Mode, the Data interface is redefined so that the Link can monitor Linestate and
                the VBUS voltage. In Low Power Mode DATA[3:0] are redefined as shown in Table 6.4. Linestate[1:0]
                is the combinational output of the Single-Ended Receivers. The “int” or interrupt signal indicates an
                unmasked interrupt has occurred. When an unmasked interrupt or linestate change has occurred, the
                Link is notified and can determine if it should wake-up the PHY.

                Note 6.2      LineState: These signals reflect the current state of the Full-Speed single ended receivers.
                              LineState[0] directly reflects the current state of DP. LineState[1] directly reflects the current
                              state of DM. When DP=DM=0 this is called "Single Ended Zero" (SE0). When DP=DM=1,
                              this is called "Single Ended One" (SE1).
                An unmasked interrupt can be caused by the following comparators changing state: VbusVld, SessVld,
                SessEnd, and IdGnd. If any of these signals change state during Low Power Mode and the bits are
                enabled in either the USB Interrupt Enable Rising or USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers, DATA[3]
                will assert. During Low Power Mode, the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators can have their interrupts
                masked to lower the suspend current as described in Section 6.3.4.
                While in Low Power Mode, the Data bus is driven asynchronously because all of the PHY clocks are
                stopped during Low Power Mode.
 6.3.2          Exiting Low Power Mode
                To exit Low Power Mode, the Link will assert STP. Upon the assertion of STP, the USB332x will begin
                its start-up procedure. After the PHY start-up is complete, the PHY will start the clock on CLKOUT and
                de-assert DIR. After DIR has been de-asserted, the Link can de-assert STP when ready and start
                operating in Synchronous Mode. The PHY will automatically set the SuspendM bit to a 1 in the
                Function Control register.

                Should the Link de-assert STP before DIR is de-asserted, the USB332x will detect this as a false
                resume request and return to Low Power Mode. This is detailed in section 3.9.4 of the ULPI 1.1
                specification.
 6.3.3          Interface Protection
                ULPI protocol assumes that both the Link and PHY will keep the ULPI data bus driven by either the
                Link when DIR is low or the PHY when DIR is high. The only exception is when DIR has changed
                state and a turn around cycle occurs for 1 clock period.
                In the design of a USB system, there can be cases where the Link may not be driving the ULPI bus
                to a known state while DIR is low. Two examples where this can happen is because of a slow Link
                start-up or a hardware reset.

6.3.3.1     Start up Protection
            Upon start-up, when the PHY de-asserts DIR, the Link must be ready to receive commands and drive
            Idle on the data bus. If the Link is not ready to receive commands or drive Idle, it must assert STP
            before DIR is de-asserted. The Link can then de-assert STP when it has completed its start-up. If the
            Link doesn’t assert STP before it can receive commands, the PHY may interpret the data bus state as
            a TX CMD and transmit invalid data onto the USB bus, or make invalid register writes.
            When the USB332x sends a RXCMD the Link is required to drive the data bus back to idle at the end
            of the turn around cycle. If the Link does not drive the databus to idle the USB332x may take the
            information on the data bus as a TXCMD and transmit data on DP and DM until the Link asserts stop.
            If the ID pin is floated the last RXCMD from the USB332x will remain on the bus after DIR is de-
            asserted and the USB332x will take this in as a TXCMD.
            A Link should be designed to have the default POR state of the STP output high and the data bus tri-
            stated. The USB332x has weak pull-downs on the data bus to prevent these inputs from floating when
            not driven. These resistors are only used to prevent the ULPI interface from floating during events
            when the link ULPI pins may be tri-stated. The strength of the pull down resistors can be found in
            Table 4.4. The pull downs are not strong enough to pull the data bus low after a ULPI RXCMD, the
            Link must drive the data bus to idle after DIR is de-asserted.
            In some cases, a Link may be software configured and not have control of its STP pin until after the
            PHY has started. In this case, the USB332x has in internal pull-up on the STP input pad which will
            pull STP high while the Link’s STP output is tri-stated. The STP pull-up resistor is enabled on POR
            and can be disabled by setting the InterfaceProtectDisable bit 7 of the Interface Control register.
            The STP pull-up resistor will pull-up the Link’s STP input high until the Link configures and drives STP
            high. After the Link completes its start-up, STP can be synchronously driven low.
            A Link design which drives STP high during POR can disable the pull-up resistor on STP by setting
            InterfaceProtectDisable bit to 1. A motivation for this is to reduce the suspend current. In Low Power
            Mode, STP is held low, which would draw current through the pull-up resistor on STP.
6.3.3.2     Warm Reset
            Designers should also consider the case of a warm restart of a Link with a PHY in Low Power Mode.
            After the PHY enters Low Power Mode, DIR is asserted and the clock is stopped. The USB332x looks
            for STP to be asserted to re-start the clock and then resume normal synchronous operation.
            Should the USB332x be suspended in Low Power Mode, and the Link receives a hardware reset, the
            PHY must be able to recover from Low Power Mode and start its clock. If the Link asserts STP on
            reset, the PHY will exit Low Power Mode and start its clock.
            If the Link does not assert STP on reset, the interface protection pull-up can be used. When the Link
            is reset, its STP output will tri-state and the pull-up resistor will pull STP high, signaling the PHY to
            restart its clock.
6.3.4       Minimizing Current in Low Power Mode
            In order to minimize the suspend current in Low Power Mode, the OTG comparators can be disabled
            to reduce suspend current. In Low Power Mode, the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators are not
            needed and can be disabled by clearing the associated bits in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising
            and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. By disabling the interrupt in BOTH the rise and fall
            registers, the SessEnd and VbusVld comparators are turned off. The IdFloatRise and IdFloatFall bits
            in Carkit Interrupt Enable register should also be disabled if they were set. When exiting Low Power
            Mode, the Link should immediately re-enable the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators if host or OTG
            functionality is required.
            In addition to disabling the OTG comparators in Low Power Mode, the Link may choose to disable the
            Interface Protect Circuit. By setting the InterfaceProtectDisable bit high in the Interface Control register,
            the Link can disable the pull-up resistor on STP. When RESETB is low the Interface Protect Circuit
            will be disabled.

 6.4            Full Speed/Low Speed Serial Modes
                The USB332x includes two serial modes to support legacy Links which use either the 3pin or 6pin
                serial format. To enter either serial mode, the Link will need to write a 1 to the 6-pin FsLsSerialMode
                or the 3-pin FsLsSerialMode bits in the Interface control register. Serial Mode may be used to conserve
                power when attached to a device that is not capable of operating in Hi-Speed.
                The serial modes are entered in the same manner as the entry into Low Power Mode. The Link writes
                the Interface Control register bit for the specific serial mode. The USB332x will assert DIR and shut
                off the clock after at least five clock cycles. Then the data bus goes to the format of the serial mode
                selected. Before entering Serial Mode the Link must set the ULPI transceiver to the appropriate mode
                as defined in Table 5.1.
                In ULPI Clock Out Mode, the PHY will shut off the 60MHz clock to conserve power. Should the Link
                need the 60MHz clock to continue during the serial mode of operation, the ClockSuspendM bit[3] of
                the Interface Control Register should be set before entering a serial mode. If set, the 60 MHz clock
                will be present during serial modes.
                In serial mode, interrupts are possible from unmasked sources. The state of each interrupt source is
                sampled prior to the assertion of DIR and this is compared against the asynchronous level from
                interrupt source.
                Exiting the serial modes is the same as exiting Low Power Mode. The Link must assert STP to signal
                the PHY to exit serial mode. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR is de-asserted and the PHY
                will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI operation. The RESETB pin can
                also be pulsed low to reset the USB332x and return it to Synchronous Mode.

6.5          Carkit Mode
             The USB332x includes Carkit Mode to support a USB UART and USB Audio Mode.
             By entering Carkit Mode, the USB332x current drain is minimized. When operating in ULPI Clock In
             Mode (60MHz REFCLK Mode), the CLKOUT is stopped to conserve power by default. The Link may
             configure the 60MHz clock to continue by setting the ClockSuspendM bit of the Interface Control
             register before entering Carkit Mode. If set, the 60 MHz clock will continue during the Carkit Mode of
             operation.
             In Carkit Mode, interrupts are possible if they have been enabled in the Carkit Interrupt Enable register.
             The state of each interrupt source is sampled prior to the assertion of DIR and this is compared against
             the asynchronous level from interrupt source. In Carkit Mode, the Linestate signals are not available
             per the ULPI specification.
             Exiting Carkit Mode is the same as exiting Low Power Mode as described in Section 6.3.2. The Link
             must assert STP to signal the PHY to exit serial mode. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR
             is de-asserted and the PHY will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI
             operation. The RESETB pin can also be pulsed low to reset the USB332x and return it to Synchronous

 6.5.1          USB UART Mode
                The USB332x can be placed into UART Mode by first setting the TxdEn and RxdEn bits in the Carkit
                Control register. Then the Link can set the CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control register. The TxdEn
                and RxdEn bits must be written before the CarkitMode bit.

                After the CarkitMode bit is set, the ULPI interface will become redefined as described in Table 6.8, and
                the USB332x will transmit data through the DATA[0] to DM of the USB connector and receive data on
                DP and pass the information the Link on DATA[1].
                When entering UART mode, the regulator output will automatically switch to the value configured by
                the UART RegOutput bits in the USB IO & Power Management register and a pull-up will be applied
                internally to DP and DM. This will hold the UART in its default operating state.
                While in UART mode, the transmit edge rates can be set to either the Full Speed USB or Low Speed
                USB edge rates by using the XcvrSelect[1:0] bits in the Function Control register.

6.5.2       USB Audio Mode
            When the USB332x is powered in Synchronous Mode, the Audio switches can be enabled by asserting
            the SpkLeftEn, or SpkRightEn bits in the Carkit Control register. After the register write is complete,
            the USB332x will immediately enable or disable the audio switch. Then the Link can set the
            CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control register. The SpkLeftEn, or SpkRightEn bits must be written
            before the CarkitMode bit.

            After the CarkitMode bit is set, the ULPI interface will become redefined as described in Table 6.8.
6.6         RID Converter Operation
            The RID converter is designed to read the value of the ID resistance to ground and report back its
            value through the ULPI interface.
            When a resistor to ground is applied to the ID pin the state of the IdGnd comparator will change from
            a 1 to a 0 as described in Section 5.6.1. If the USB332x is in ULPI mode, an RXCMD will be generated
            with bit 6 low. If the USB332x is in Low Power Mode (or one of the other non-ULPI modes), the
            DATA[3] interrupt signal will go high.
            After the USB332x has detected the change of state on the ID pin, the RID converter can be used to
            determine the value of ID resistance. To start a ID resistance measurement, the RidConversionStart
            bit is set in the Vendor Rid Conversion register.
            The Link can use one of two methods to determine when the RID Conversion is complete. One method
            is polling the RidConversionStart bit as described in Section 7.1.3.3. The preferred method is to set
            the RidIntEn bit in the Vendor Rid Conversion register. When RidIntEn is set, an RXCMD will be
            generated after the RID conversion is complete. As described in Table 6.3, the alt_int bit of the RXCMD
            will be set.
            After the RID Conversion is complete, the Link can read RidValue from the Vendor Rid Conversion
            register.
6.7         Headset Audio Mode
            This mode is designed to allow a user to view the status of several signals while using an analog audio
            headset with a USB connector. This feature, exclusive to SMSC, is provided as an alternate mode to
            the CarKit Mode defined in Section 6.5. In the CarKit Mode, the Link is unable to view the source of
            the interrupt on ID, except by returning to synchronous mode to read the ULPI registers. This forces
            the audio switches to be deactivated, and may glitch the audio signals. In addition, the Link cannot
            change the resistance on the ID pin without starting up the PHY to access the ULPI registers.
            The Headset Audio Mode is entered by writing to the Headset Audio Mode register, and allows the
            Link access to the state of the VBUS and ID pins during audio without glitching the audio connection.
            The Headset Audio mode also enables the Link to change the resistance on the ID pin and to change
            the audio headset attached from mono to stereo.

                Exiting Headset Audio Mode is the same as exiting Low Power Mode as described in Section 6.3.2.
                The Link must assert STP to signal the PHY to exit. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR is
                de-asserted and the PHY will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI
                operation. The RESETB pin can also be pulsed low to reset the USB332x and return it to Synchronous
                Mode.

7.1            ULPI Register Array
               The USB332x PHY implements all of the ULPI registers detailed in the ULPI revision 1.1 specification.
               The complete USB332x ULPI register set is shown in Table 7.1. All registers are 8 bits. This table also
               includes the default state of each register upon POR or de-assertion of RESETB, as described in
               Section 5.5.2. The RESET bit in the Function Control Register does not reset the bits of the ULPI
               register array. The Link should not read or write to any registers not listed in this table.
               The USB332x supports extended register access. The immediate register set (00-3Fh) can be
               accessed through either a immediate address or an extended register address.

            This register is used to program the USB332x into and out of the Carkit Mode. When entering the
            UART mode the Link must first set the desired TxdEn and the RxdEn bits and then transition to Carkit
            Mode by setting the CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control Register. When RxdEn is not set then the
            DATA[1] pin is held to a logic high.

                If using USB UART mode the UART data will appear at the SPK_L and SPK_R pins if the
                corresponding SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn switches are enabled.
                If using USB Audio the TxdEn and RxdEn bits should not be set when the SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or
                MicEn switches are enabled. The USB single-ended receivers described in Section 5.2.1 are disabled
                when either SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn are set.

Chapter 8 Application Notes
8.1         Application Diagram
            The USB332x requires few external components as shown in the application diagrams. The USB 2.0
            Specification restricts the voltage at the VBUS pin to a maximum value of 5.25V. In some applications,
            the voltage will exceed this voltage, so the USB332x provides an integrated overvoltage protection
            circuit. The overvoltage protection circuit works with an external resistor (RVBUS) to lower the voltage
            at the VBUS pin.
            Following POR or hardware reset, the voltage at CLKOUT must not exceed VIH_ED as provided in
            Table 4.4.

8.2              Reference Designs
                 SMSC has generated reference designs for connecting the USB332x to SOCs with a ULPI port. Please
                 contact the SMSC sales office for more details.
8.3              ESD Performance
                 The USB332x is protected from ESD strikes. By eliminating the requirement for external ESD
                 protection devices, board space is conserved, and the board manufacturer is enabled to reduce cost.
                 The advanced ESD structures integrated into the USB332x protect the device whether or not it is
                 powered up.
8.3.1            Human Body Model (HBM) Performance
                 HBM testing verifies the ability to withstand the ESD strikes like those that occur during handling and
                 manufacturing, and is done without power applied to the IC. To pass the test, the device must have
                 no change in operation or performance due to the event. All pins on the USB332x except the REFCLK,
                 SPK_L, and SPK_R pins provide ±8kV HBM protection, as shown in Table 4.10.

 8.3.2          EN/IEC 61000-4-2 Performance
                The EN/IEC 61000-4-2 ESD specification is an international standard that addresses system-level
                immunity to ESD strikes while the end equipment is operational. In contrast, the HBM ESD tests are
                performed at the device level with the device powered down.
                SMSC contracts with Independent laboratories to test the USB332x to EN/IEC 61000-4-2 in a working
                system. Reports are available upon request. Please contact your SMSC representative, and request
                information on 3rd party ESD test results. The reports show that systems designed with the USB332x
                can safely provide the ESD performance shown in Table 4.10 without additional board level protection.
                In addition to defining the ESD tests, EN/IEC 61000-4-2 also categorizes the impact to equipment
                operation when the strike occurs (ESD Result Classification). The USB332x maintains an ESD Result
                Classification 1 or 2 when subjected to an EN/IEC 61000-4-2 (level 4) ESD strike.
                Both air discharge and contact discharge test techniques for applying stress conditions are defined by
                the EN/IEC 61000-4-2 ESD document.
 8.3.3          Air Discharge
                To perform this test, a charged electrode is moved close to the system being tested until a spark is
                generated. This test is difficult to reproduce because the discharge is influenced by such factors as
                humidity, the speed of approach of the electrode, and construction of the test equipment.
 8.3.4          Contact Discharge
                The uncharged electrode first contacts the USB connector to prepare this test, and then the probe tip
                is energized. This yields more repeatable results, and is the preferred test method. The independent
                test laboratories contracted by SMSC provide test results for both types of discharge methods.
