                USB D+/D- protection IC
                Rev. 1.1 — 19 August 2019                                        Product data sheet
1 General description
             NX20P0408 is a single chip USB data lines protection solution that provides 28V short-
             to-VBUS protection to system side D+ and D- pins located near VBUS pins.
             USB Type-C allows VBUS voltage to increase up to 20V through Power delivery protocol.
             D+ and D- pins can be shorted to VBUS due to mechanical twisting and sliding of the
             connector since Type-C connector contact pins are 25% closer to each other than a
             micro USB connector. Moisture or fine dust may also cause the 20V VBUS pin to be
             shorted to adjacent pins.
             NX20P0408 enables D+/D- to be robust in even abnormal conditions. NX20P0408 is
             28V DC tolerant on D+/D- pin in connector side and quickly disconnects switches if
             the voltage is above overvoltage threshold, protecting D+/D- in system side from high
             voltage.
2 Features and benefits
             • USB Type-C D+/D- short protection to VBUS
               – CON_DP / CON_DN : 28VDC
             • Low Rdson switch : 4Ω

                   7.1 Power status
                       When VSYS is below VSYSUVLO, NX20P0408 stays in shutdown mode, where bias,
                       switches and all comparators are disabled.
                       NX20P0408 enters standby mode when VSYS exceed VSYSUVLO. USB switch is
                       controlled by SWEN.

                   7.2 Overvoltage protection
                       NX20P0408 has short circuit protection of CON_DP and CON_DN up to 28V. USB
                       switch overvoltage threshold is VOVP to secure turn the switch off and prevent high
                       voltage to USB phy in system side.
                       Once overvoltage on any channel is detected, the switch is quickly turned off within
                       tOVP_RES, to prevent overvoltage to system side. FLAG pin goes LOW in tFLAG_RES to
                       inform system of the fault condition. If the voltage of the channel triggered OVP comes
                       down below overvoltage threshold for tOVP_DEB, the switch is turned back on and FLAG
                       pin gets Hi-Z.
                       Each of the four switches for DP and DN has its own OVP comparator and is controlled
                       by its comparator independently. If DP voltage exceeds OVP threshold, the DP switch is
                       turned off, but the other switches stay ON.
                                                                             CON_DP/

                       NX20P0408 has a pair of USB switches controlled by SWEN when SYS power is valid.
                       The switch bandwidth is 1.5GHz so that it can be used to protect USB D+/D- from
                       overvoltage.

[1]   The overall Rth(j-a) can vary depending on the board layout. To minimize the effective Rth(j-a), all pins must have a solid connection to larger Cu layer areas
      e.g. to the power and ground layer. In multi-layer PCB applications, the second layer should be used to create a large heat spreader area right below the
      device. If this layer is either ground or power, it should be connected with several vias to the top layer connecting to the device ground or supply. Try not
      to use any solder-stop varnish under the chip.
[2]   This Rth(j-a) is calculated based on JEDEX2S2P board. The actual Rth(j-a) value may vary in applications using different layer stacks and layouts.
