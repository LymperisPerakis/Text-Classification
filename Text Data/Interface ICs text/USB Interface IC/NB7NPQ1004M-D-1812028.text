   The NB7NPQ1004M is a high performance 2−Port linear redriver
designed for USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 applications that
supports both 5 Gbps and 10 Gbps data rates. Signal integrity degrades                                           MARKING

Typical Layout Practices                                                  • RX and TX differential pairs should always be placed and
• RX and TX pairs should maintain as close to a 90 W                         routed on the same layer directly above a ground plane.
   differential impedance as possible.                                       This will help reduce EMI and noise on the data lines.
•  Limit the number of vias used on each data line. It is                 •  Routing angles should be obtuse angles and kept to 135
   suggested that 2 or fewer are used.                                       degrees or larger.
•  Traces should be routed as straight and symmetric as                   •  To minimize crosstalk, TX and RX data lines should be
   possible.                                                                 kept away from other high speed signals.
