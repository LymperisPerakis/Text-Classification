Notes
 3. During power up or reset event, device P1[0] and P1[1] may disturb the I2C bus. Use alternate pins if issues are encountered.
 4. These are the in-system serial programming (ISSP) pins that are not High Z at power on reset (POR).

Notes
 5. During power up or reset event, device P1[0] and P1[1] may disturb the I2C bus. Use alternate pins if issues are encountered.
 6. These are the in-system serial programming (ISSP) pins that are not High Z at power on reset (POR).

Register Reference
The section discusses the registers of the enCoRe V device. It lists all the registers in mapping tables, in address order.

The register conventions specific to this section are listed in the  The enCoRe V device has a total register address space of

Notes
 7. When VDD remains in the range from 1.71 V to 1.9 V for more than 50 µsec, the slew rate when moving from the 1.71 V to 1.9 V range to greater than 2 V must be
    slower than 1 V/500 µsec to avoid triggering POR. The only other restriction on slew rates for any other voltage range or transition is the SRPOWER_UP parameter.
 8. Errata: For Port 1 pins P1[1], P1[4], and P1[5] 300 Ohm external resistor is needed to meet this spec. Refer to “Errata” on page 35 for more details.
 9. If powering down in standby sleep mode, to properly detect and recover from a VDD brown out condition any of the following actions must be taken:
     • Bring the device out of sleep before powering down.
     • Assure that VDD falls below 100 mV before powering back up.
     • Set the No Buzz bit in the OSC_CR0 register to keep the voltage monitoring circuit powered during sleep.
     • Increase the buzz rate to assure that the falling edge of VDD is captured. The rate is configured through the PSSDC bits in the SLP_CFG register.
        For the referenced registers, refer to the enCoRe V Technical Reference Manual. In deep sleep mode, additional low power voltage monitoring circuitry allows
        VDD brown out conditions to be detected for edge rates slower than 1 V/ms.

 10. Higher storage temperatures reduce data retention time. Recommended storage temperature is +25 °C ± 25 °C. Extended duration storage temperatures above 85 °C
     degrade reliability.
 11. The temperature rise from ambient to junction is package specific. See Package Handling on page 31. The user must limit the power consumption to comply with this
     requirement.

Note
 20. A Fast mode I2C bus device can be used in a standard mode I2C bus system, but the requirement tSUDAT  250 ns must then be met. This is automatically the case
     if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the
     SDA line trmax + tSUDAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the standard mode I2C bus specification) before the SCL line is released.

Package Diagram
This section illustrates the packaging specifications for the enCoRe V USB device, along with the thermal impedances for each
package.
Important Note Emulation tools may require a larger area on the target PCB than the chip’s footprint. For a detailed description of
the enCoRe V emulation tools and their dimensions, refer to the development kit.

Package Handling
Some IC packages require baking before they are soldered onto a PCB to remove moisture that may have been absorbed after leaving
the factory. A label on the package has details about the actual bake temperature and the minimum bake time to remove this moisture.
The maximum bake time is the aggregate time that the parts exposed to the bake temperature. Exceeding this exposure may degrade
device reliability.

Notes
 21. TJ = TA + Power x JA.
 22. To achieve the thermal impedance specified for the package, solder the center thermal pad to the PCB ground plane.
 23. Higher temperatures may be required based on the solder melting point. Typical temperatures for solder are 220 ± 5 °C with Sn-Pb or 245 ± 5 °C with Sn-Ag-Cu paste.
     Refer to the solder manufacturer specifications.

Errata
This section describes the errata for the enCoRe V – CY7C643xx. Details include errata trigger conditions, scope of impact, available
workaround, and silicon revision applicability.
Contact your local Cypress Sales Representative if you have questions.
CY7C643xx Errata Summary
The following Errata item applies to the CY7C643xx data sheets.
1. Latch up susceptibility when maximum I/O sink current exceeded
    ■ PROBLEM DEFINITION
       P1[3], P1[6], and P1[7] pins are susceptible to latch up when the I/O sink current exceeds 25 mA per pin on these pins.
    ■ PARAMETERS AFFECTED
       LU – Latch up current. Per JESD78A, the maximum allowable latch up current per pin is 100 mA. Cypress internal specification
       is 200 mA latch up current limit.
    ■ TRIGGER CONDITIONS
       Latch up occurs when both the following conditions are met:
       A. The offending I/O is externally connected to a voltage higher than the I/O high state, causing a current to flow into the pin
            that exceeds 25 mA.
       B. A Port1 I/O (P1[1], P1[4], and P1[5] respectively) adjacent to the offending I/O is connected to a voltage lower than the I/O
            low state. This causes a signal that drops below Vss (signal undershoot) and a current greater than 200 mA to flow out of
            the pin.
    ■ SCOPE OF IMPACT
       The trigger conditions outlined in this item exceed the maximum ratings specified in the CY7C643xx data sheets.
    ■ WORKAROUND
       Add a series resistor > 300  to P1[3], P1[6], and P1[7] pins to restrict current to within latch up limits.
    ■ FIX STATUS
       This issue will be corrected in the next new silicon revision.
2. Does not meet USB 2.0 specification for D+ and D- rise/fall matching when supply voltage is under 3.3 V
    ■ PROBLEM DEFINITION
       Rising to falling rate matching of the USB D+ and D- lines has a corner case at lower supply voltages, such as those under 3.3 V.
    ■ PARAMETERS AFFECTED
       Rising to falling rate matching of the USB data lines.
    ■ TRIGGER CONDITION(S)
       Operating the VCC supply voltage at the low end of the chip’s specification (under 3.3 V) may cause a mismatch in the rising
       to falling rate.
    ■ SCOPE OF IMPACT
       This condition does not affect USB communications but could cause corner case issues with USB lines’ rise/fall matching
       specification. Signal integrity tests were run using the Cypress development kit and excellent eye was observed with supply
       voltage of 3.15 V.
