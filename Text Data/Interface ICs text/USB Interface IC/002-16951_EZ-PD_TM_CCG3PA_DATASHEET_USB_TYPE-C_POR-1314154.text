General Description
EZ-PD™ CCG3PA is Cypress’ highly integrated USB Type-C port controller that complies with the latest USB Type-C and PD
standards and is targeted for PC power adapters, mobile chargers, car chargers, and power bank applications. In such applications,
CCG3PA provides additional functionalities and BOM integration advantages. CCG3PA uses Cypress’ proprietary M0S8 technology
with a 32-bit Arm® Cortex™-M0 processor, 64-KB flash, a complete Type-C USB-PD transceiver, all termination resistors required for
a Type-C port, an integrated feedback control circuitry for voltage (VBUS) regulation and system-level ESD protection. It is available
in 24-pin QFN and 16-pin SOIC packages.

Note
 1. Out of the two SCB blocks (SCB0 and SCB1), while the SCB0’s I2C functionality is mapped out to the P0.0/P0.1 GPIO pins, the I2C functionality
    of SCB1 provides flexibility to have it mapped either on P1.0/P1.1 OR P2.2/P2.3 GPIO pins.
 2. TCPWM_line_0 can be mapped to port pins P1.0, P0.0, P2.0 or P2.2.
 3. TCPWM_line_1 can be mapped to port pins P1.1, P0.1, P2.1 or P2.3.
 4. AXRES pin will be internally pulled up during the Power On I/O initialization time (see Table 6 for more details).
 5. See Table 9 and Table 10 for specifications related to these pins.

Application Diagrams
Figure 6 and Figure 7 show the application diagrams of CCG3PA-based Power Adapter with Opto-Coupler Feedback control using
16-pin SOIC and 24-pin QFN parts respectively. In an opto-feedback power adapter, CCG3PA implements a shunt regulator and the
feedback to the primary controller is through an opto-coupler. The current drawn through the CATH path is proportional to the potential
difference between FB pin and the internal bandgap reference voltage. At default 5-V VBUS, the FB pin will be held at the voltage set
by the bandgap reference voltage using internal VBUS resistor dividers.
If VBUS needs to be changed from default 5 V, using internal IDACs and an error amplifier, CCG3PA draws a proportional current
through the CATH pin. This in turn gets coupled to the primary controller through the opto-coupler.

Figure 8 shows the application diagram of CCG3PA based power adapter with Direct Feedback control. In this application, VBUS is
maintained at a constant voltage. The default value of VBUS upon power up (which is usually at 5 V) is set up by choosing the
appropriate resistor divider that will set the FB node at a voltage expected by the secondary controller.
Feedback node is regulated using internal IDACs. Whenever a change in VBUS voltage is needed, CCG3PA will either source or sink
a proportional current at feedback node, based on the amount of voltage change needed.

Figure 9 shows the application diagram of a CCG3PA based power adapter application with direct feedback control for two port car
charger. The car charger application can charge portable devices connected to the Type-C and Type-A port simultaneously. The
Type-C port supports USBPD 3.0 QC 4.0, Apple Charging 2.4A, and AFC. The Type-A port supports QC 3.0, Apple Charging and AFC.

Figure 10 shows the application diagram of a CCG3PA based power bank application. It shows dual port power bank implementation
using CCG3PA device. The power bank application can charge portable devices connected to the Type-C and Type-A port
simultaneously. The Type-C port can be configured to support USBPD 3.0 QC 4.0, Apple Charging 2.4A, and AFC. The Type-A port
can be configured to support QC3.0, Apple Charging, and AFC.
The battery can be charged from Type-C and USBPD power adapters or BC1.2 power adapters.
