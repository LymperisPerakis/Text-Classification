 USB331x Family
 Highly Integrated, Hi-Speed USB 2.0 ULPI Transceiver Family for Portable
 Consumer Electronics Applications
 The USB331x family of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 transceivers provides a highly integrated, small
 footprint solution designed for portable consumer electronics devices including cell phones,
 PDAs, portable media players and GPS/personal navigation devices. The USB331x family
 eliminates the need for external USB switches and electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection
 devices, which minimizes eBOM part count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. The
 USB331x provides an extremely flexible solution which allows the USB connector to act as
 a single port of connection for high speed data transfer, battery charging and stereo/mono
 audio accessories.
