     Caution 1: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open
                circuit between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the
                IC is operated over the absolute maximum ratings.
     Caution 2: Should by any chance the maximum junction temperature rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in deterioration of the
                properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, design a PCB with thermal resistance taken into consideration by
                increasing board size and copper area so as not to exceed the maximum junction temperature rating.
     (Note 1) For the DC input voltage, when VBUS is shorted to CC1 or CC2, maximum short voltage becomes “VB”.

   (Note 9) (OCP detection current) = (OCP detection voltage) / (External current sense resistor). This item prescribes OCP detection voltage. For example, when
            INOM is set less than 2A, the tolerance does not become smaller than ±2mV (When external current sense resistor is 10mΩ, the OCP level tolerance
            converted into current is equivalent to ±0.2A).

BD93W21F
Function Description
    1.   PDOs (Power Data Object)
         BD93W21F can have up to seven PDOs. Voltage and current values of PDO are defined by Parameter Setting.
    2.   ACDC Bridge Control
         Error amplifier is integrated. It changes the target value automatically in conjunction with PDO.
         Without depending on the output voltage, the gain of the error amplifier becomes fixed. The influence by which the
         output voltage gives to a frequency response is reduced by this.

             4.   Emergency Control
                  When an external abnormal factor occurs as well as a prescribed abnormality state such as OVP and OCP
                  continuously, the IC stops action automatically.
             5.   Watchdog Timer
                  BD93W21F has watchdog timer function. When fault occurs for FW program action, the IC detects this and resets the
                  system.
             6.   OVP/OCP/SCP Function
                  BD93W21F is integrated with OVP, OCP, and SCP. The detection level changes with PDO automatically.
                  Each protection function is defined by Parameter Setting.
             7.   Safety Peak Power
                  When PDO reaches Peak Current as shown below, OCP detection mask is OFF.
                  This prevents OCP to Peak Current miss-detection.

         The compensation value is changed by Parameter Setting. When the cable impedance (DCR) and the compensation
         value have difference, the IR Drop (VIR) will be different from the expected value.
         As shown in the figure below, when load current changes to a no-load state, depending on the value of the load current
         and the set value of DCR, VBUS voltage will overshoot momentarily.
         Please set the OVP voltage so that the overshoot voltage does not exceed OVP.

Operational Notes
     1.    Reverse Connection of Power Supply
           Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
           connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
           supply pins.
     2.    Power Supply Lines
           Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the
           digital and analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog
           block. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and
           aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic capacitors.
     3.    Ground Voltage
           Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
     4.    Ground Wiring Pattern
           When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
           connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
           ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
           on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
     5.    Recommended Operating Conditions
           The function and operation of the IC are guaranteed within the range specified by the recommended operating
           conditions. The characteristic values are guaranteed only under the conditions of each item specified by the electrical
           characteristics.
     6.    Inrush Current
           When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may
           flow instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
           supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring,
           and routing of connections.
     7.    Testing on Application Boards
           When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
           subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
           should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
           process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
           transport and storage.

     8.    Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
           Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
           damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
           Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment)
           and unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
     9.    Unused Input Pins
           Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
           extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
           charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
           cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
           power supply or ground line.
     10. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
           This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
           isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
           parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
           Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
           interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
           operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should
           be avoided.

     11. Ceramic Capacitor
          When using a ceramic capacitor, determine a capacitance value considering the change of capacitance with
          temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
     12. Over Current Protection Circuit (OCP)
           This IC incorporates an integrated overcurrent protection circuit that is activated when the load is shorted. This
           protection circuit is effective in preventing damage due to sudden and unexpected incidents. However, the IC should
           not be used in applications characterized by continuous operation or transitioning of the protection circuit.

              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification
