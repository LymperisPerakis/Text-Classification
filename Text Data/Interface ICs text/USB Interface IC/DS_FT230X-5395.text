Notes:
1. When used in Input Mode, the input pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 75kΩ (approx) resistors.
These pins can be programmed to gently pull low during USB suspend (PWREN# = “1”) by setting an
option in the MTP memory.

Notes:
1. When used in Input Mode, the input pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 75kΩ (approx) resistors.
These pins can be programmed to gently pull low during USB suspend (PWREN# = “1”) by setting an
option in the MTP memory.

4    Function Description
The FT230X is a compact USB to a basic serial UART interface device which simplifies USB
implementations in a small optimised package, with minimum UART signals and reduces external
component count by fully integrating an MTP memory, and an integrated clock circuit which requires no
external crystal. It has been designed to operate efficiently with USB host controllers by using as little
bandwidth as possible when compared to the total USB bandwidth available.
4.1 Key Features
Functional Integration. Fully integrated MTP memory, clock generation, AVCC filtering, Power-On-
Reset (POR) and LDO regulators.
Configurable CBUS I/O Pin Options. The fully integrated MTP memory allows configuration of the
Control Bus (CBUS) functionality and drive strength selection. There are 4 configurable CBUS I/O pins.
These configurable options are detailed in section 3.3.
The CBUS lines can be configured with any one of these output options by setting bits in the internal MTP
memory. The device is shipped with the most commonly used pin definitions pre-programmed - see
Section 8 for details.
Asynchronous Bit Bang Mode with RD# and WR# Strobes. The FT230X supports FTDI’s previous
chip generation bit-bang mode. In bit-bang mode, the four UART lines can be switched from the regular
interface mode to a 4-bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the device and they will
be sequentially sent to the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer (equivalent to the baud rate
pre-scalar). In the FT230X device this mode has been enhanced by outputting the internal RD# and WR#
strobes signals which can be used to allow external logic to be clocked by accesses to the bit-bang I/O
bus. This option will be described more fully in a separate application note available from FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com).
Synchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT230X supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs from
asynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. This
makes it easier for the controlling program to measure the response to an output stimulus as the data
returned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R-01, available from FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
Source Power and Power Consumption. The FT230X is capable of operating at a voltage supply
between +3.3V and +5.25V with a nominal operational mode current of 8mA and a nominal USB suspend
mode current of 125µA. This allows greater margin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode
current limit of 2.5mA. An integrated level converter within the UART interface allows the FT230X to
interface to UART logic running at +1.8V to +3.3V (5V tolerant).
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within the FT230X. Please refer to the block diagram shown
in Figure 2.1.
Internal MTP Memory. The internal MTP memory in the FT230X is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID),
Product ID (PID), device serial number, product description string and various other USB configuration
descriptors. The internal MTP memory is also used to configure the CBUS pin functions. The FT230X is
supplied with the internal MTP memory pre-programmed as described in Section 8. A user area of the
internal MTP memory is available to system designers to allow storing additional data from the user
application over USB. The internal MTP memory descriptors can be programmed in circuit, over USB
without any additional voltage requirement. The descriptors can be programmed using the FTDI utility
software called FT_PROG, which can be downloaded from FTDI Utilities on the FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com).
+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the
USB transceiver cell output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the
3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on
USBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells
rather than to power external logic. However, it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a
+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.
+1.8V LDO Regulator. The +1.8V LDO regulator generates the +1.8V reference voltage for internal use
driving the IC core functions of the serial interface engine and USB protocol engine.

USB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full-speed physical interface
to the USB cable. The output drivers provide +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential
input receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single-Ended-0 (SE0) and USB
reset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP.
The block also detects when connected to a USB power supply which will not enumerate the device but
still supply power and may be used for battery charging.
USB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock
and data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.
Internal 12MHz Oscillator . The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This
provides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference
clock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and UART FIFO controller blocks.
Clock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal
Oscillator function and generates the 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz and 6MHz reference clock signals. The 48Mz
clock reference is used by the USB DPLL and the Baud Rate Generator blocks.
Serial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it
performs bit stuffing/un-stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also verifies the CRC on the USB data
stream.
USB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control
endpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the
commands for controlling the functional parameters of the UART in accordance with the USB 2.0
specification chapter 9.
FIFO RX Buffer (512 bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the UART via the USB data OUT
endpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer. Data is removed from the buffer to the UART transmit
register under control of the UART FIFO controller. (Rx relative to the USB interface).
FIFO TX Buffer (512 bytes). Data from the UART receive register is stored in the TX buffer. The USB
host controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for data from the device
data IN endpoint. (Tx relative to the USB interface).
UART FIFO Controller. The UART FIFO controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and
TX buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers.
UART Controller with Programmable Signal Inversion and High Drive. Together with the UART
FIFO Controller the UART Controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and FIFO TX
buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers. It performs asynchronous 7 or 8 bit parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the data on the RS232 (or RS422 or RS485) interface.
Control signals supported by UART mode include RTS, CTS. The UART Controller also provides a
transmitter enable control signal pin option (TXDEN) to assist with interfacing to RS485 transceivers.
RTS/CTS and XON / XOFF handshaking options are also supported. Handshaking is handled in hardware to
ensure fast response times. The UART interface also supports the RS232 BREAK setting and detection
conditions.
Additionally, the UART signals can each be individually inverted and have a configurable high drive
strength capability (using FT_PROG). Both these features are configurable in the MTP memory.
Baud Rate Generator - The Baud Rate Generator provides a 16x clock input to the UART Controller
from the 48MHz reference clock. It consists of a 14 bit pre-scalar and 3 register bits which provide fine
tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction or “sub-integer”). This determines the
baud rate of the UART, which is programmable from 183 baud to 3 Mbaud.
The FT230X supports all standard baud rates and non-standard baud rates from 183 Baud up to 3
Mbaud. Achievable non-standard baud rates are calculated as follows -
Baud Rate = 3000000 / (n + x)
where ‘n’ can be any integer between 2 and 16,384 ( = 2 ) and ‘x’ can be a sub-integer of the value 0,
                                                            14
0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, or 0.875. When n = 1, x = 0, i.e. baud rate divisors with values
between 1 and 2 are not possible.
This gives achievable baud rates in the range 183.1 baud to 3,000,000 baud. When a non-standard baud
rate is required simply pass the required baud rate value to the driver as normal, and the FTDI driver will
calculate the required divisor, and set the baud rate. See FTDI application note AN232B-05 on the FTDI
website (www.ftdichip.com) for more details.

                                   Figure 6.1 Bus Powered Configuration
Figure 6.1 Illustrates the FT230X in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows:
    i) On plug-in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.
    ii) In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA.
    iii) A bus powered high power USB device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use one of the
         CBUS pins configured as PWREN# and use it to keep the current below 100mA on plug-in and
         2.5mA on USB suspend.
    iv) A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB bus powered hub.
    v) No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.
The power descriptors in the internal MTP memory of the FT230X should be programmed to match the
current drawn by the device.
A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT230X and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application. A suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from
Laird Technologies for example Part # MI0805K601R-10.

Figure 6.2 illustrates the FT230X in a typical USB self powered configuration. A USB self powered device
gets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic
rules for USB self powered devices are as follows –
   i)   A self powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub
        controller is powered down.
   ii) A self powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB
        suspend as it has its own power supply.
   iii) A self powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self powered
        USB hub.
The power descriptor in the internal MTP memory of the FT230X should be programmed to a value of
zero (self powered).
In order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus power (pin 1) is used to control the
VBUS_Sense pin of the FT230X device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ
resistor on USBDP is pulled up to +3.3V, thus identifying the device as a full speed device to the USB
host or hub. When the USB host or hub is powered off, VBUS_Sense pin will be low and the FT230X is
held in a suspend state. In this state the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is not pulled up to any power supply
(hub or host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1.5kΩ pull-up resistor. Failure to
do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.
Figure 6.2 illustrates a self powered design which has a +3.3V to +5.25V supply.
Note:
   1. When the FT230X is in reset, the UART interface I/O pins are tri-stated. Input pins have internal
      75kΩ pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external
      logic.

A requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode, the application draws a
total current of less than 2.5mA. This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the
ability to power itself down into a low current state by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic
that cannot power itself down in this way, the FT230X provides a simple but effective method of turning
off power during the USB suspend mode.
Figure 6.3 shows an example of using a discrete P-Channel MOSFET to control the power to external
logic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier IRLML6402, or equivalent. It is
recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used
to limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the
transient power surge, caused when the MOSFET switches on, will reset the FT230X or the USB host/hub
controller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 6.3 powers up with a slew rate of
approximaely12.5V/ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in
approximately 400 microseconds.
As an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used. A
suitable power switch IC for such an application is the Micrel MIC2025-2BM or equivalent.
With power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:
    i)   The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to
         automatically reset the logic when power is re-applied when moving out of suspend mode.
    ii) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the internal FT230X MTP memory.
    iii) One of the CBUS Pins should be configured as PWREN# in the internal FT230X MTP memory, and
         used to switch the power supply to the external circuitry.
    iv) For USB high-power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up
        to 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in
        the Max Power field in the internal FT230X MTP memory. A high-power bus powered application
        uses the descriptor in the internal FT230X MTP memory to inform the system of its power
        requirements.
    v) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered
       down using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.

An example of using the FT230X as a USB to RS232 converter is illustrated in Figure 7.1. In this
application, a 3V3 TTL to RS232 Level Converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT230X to
convert the 3V3 levels of the FT230X to RS232 levels. This level shift can be done using line drivers from
a variety of vendors e.g. Zywyn. A useful feature on some of these devices is the SHDN# pin which can
be used to power down the device to a low quiescent current during USB suspend mode.
A suitable level shifting device is the Zywyn ZT3243F which is capable of RS232 communication at up to
1000k baud.
In example shown, the CBUS1 and CBUS2 have been configured as TXLED# and RXLED# and are being
used to drive two LEDs.

                        Figure 7.2 Application Example Showing USB to RS485 Converter
An example of using the FT230X as a USB to RS485 converter is shown in Figure 7.2. In this application,
a 3V3-TTL to RS485 level converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT230X to convert the
TTL levels of the FT230X to RS485 levels.
This example uses the Zywyn ZT3485 device. Equivalent devices are available from Maxim and Analogue
Devices. The ZT3485 is a RS485 device in a compact 8 pin SOP package. It has separate enables on both
the transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the transmitter is only enabled when a character is being
transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN signal CBUS pin option on the FT230X is provided for exactly this
purpose and so the transmitter enable is wired to CBUS2 which has been configured as TXDEN. Similarly,
CBUS3 has been configured as PWREN#. This signal is used to control the ZT3485’s receiver enable. The
receiver enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB
suspend mode. RS485 is a multi-drop network; so many devices can communicate with each other over a
two wire cable interface. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. A link
(which provides the 120Ω termination) allows the cable to be terminated if the ZT3485 is physically
positioned at either end of the cable.
In this example the data transmitted by the FT230X is also present on the receive path of the
ZT3485.This is a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the
transmitted data from the received data stream. With the FT230X it is possible to do this entirely in
hardware by modifying the example shown in Figure 7.2 by logically OR’ing the FT230X TXDEN and the
ZT3485 receiver output and connecting the output of the OR gate to the RXD of the FT230X.
Note that the TXDEN is activated 1 bit period before the start bit. TXDEN is deactivated at the same time
as the stop bit. This is not configurable.

An example of using the FT230X as a USB to RS422 converter is shown in Figure 7.3. In this application,
two TTL to RS422 Level Converter ICs are used on the serial UART interface of the FT230X to convert the
TTL levels of the FT230X to RS422 levels. There are many suitable level converter devices available. This
example uses Zywyn ZT3491 devices which have enables on both the transmitter and receiver. Since the
ZT3491 transmitter enable is active high, it is connected to a CBUS pin in SLEEP# configuration. The
ZT3491 receiver enable is active low and is therefore connected to a CBUS pin PWREN# configuration.
This ensures that when both the ZT3491 transmitters and receivers are enabled then the device is active,
and when the device is in USB suspend mode, the ZT3491 transmitters and receivers are disabled. If a
similar application is used, but the design is USB BUS powered, it may be necessary to use a P-Channel
logic level MOSFET (controlled by PWREN#) in the VCC line of the ZT3491 devices to ensure that the USB
standby current of 2.5mA is met.
The ZT3491 is specified to transmit and receive data at a rate of up to 16 Mbaud. In this example the
maximum data rate is limited to 3 Mbaud by the FT230X.

7.4 USB Battery Charging Detection
An addition to the USB specification (http://www.usb.org) is to allow for additional charging profiles to be
used for charging batteries in portable devices. These charging profiles do not enumerate the USB port of
the peripheral. The FT230X device will detect that a USB compliant dedicated charging port (DCP) is
connected. Once detected while in suspend mode, a battery charge detection signal is provided to allow
external logic to switch to charging mode as opposed to operation mode.
To use the FT230X with battery charging detection the CBUS pins must be reprogrammed to allow for the
BCD Charger output to switch the external charger circuitry on. The CBUS pins are configured in the
internal MTP memory with the free utility FT_PROG. If the charging circuitry requires an active low signal
to enable it, the CBUS pin can be programmed to BCD Charger# as an alternative.
When connected to a USB compliant dedicated charging port (DCP, as opposed to a standard USB host)
the device USB signals will be shorted together and the device suspended. The BCD charger signal will
bring the LTC4053 out of suspend and allow battery charging to start. The charge current in Figure 7.4 is

Alternatively the PWREN# And SLEEP# pins may be used to control the LTC4053 such that a battery may
be charged from a standard host (low current) or from a dedicated charging port (high current). In such
a design as shown in Figure 7.5 the charge current would need to be limited to 0.4A to ensure that the
USB host power limit is not exceeded.

In Figure 7.5 the FT230X SLEEP# pin is used to enable/disable the LTC4053, while the PWREN# signal
alters the charging current by altering the resistance on the LTC4053 PROG pin.
A third option shown in Figure 7.6 uses the SLEEP# signal from the FT230X to enable / disable the
battery charger. The BCD# and PWREN# signals are then used to alter the resistance on the PROG pin of
the LTC4053 which controls the charge current drawn from the USB connector.

7.5 LED Interface
Any of the CBUS I/O pins can be configured to drive an LED. The FT230X has 3 configuration options for
driving LEDs from the CBUS. These are TXLED#, RXLED#, and TX&RXLED#. Refer to Section 3.3 for
configuration options.

An example of using the FT230X to drive LEDs is shown in Figure 7.7. In this application one of the CBUS
pins is used to indicate transmission of data (TXLED#) and another is used to indicate receiving data
(RXLED#). When data is being transmitted or received the respective pins will drive from tri-state to low
in order to provide indication on the LEDs of data transfer. A digital one-shot is used so that even a small
percentage of data transfer is visible to the end user.

Another example of using the FT230X to drive LEDs is shown in Figure 7.8. In this example one of the
CBUS pins is used to indicate when data is being transmitted or received by the device (TX&RXLED). In
this configuration the FT230X will drive only a single LED.

8    Internal MTP Memory Configuration
The FT230X includes an internal MTP memory which holds the USB configuration descriptors, other
configuration data for the chip and also user data areas. Following a power-on reset or a USB reset the
FT230X will scan its internal MTP memory and read the USB configuration descriptors stored there.
In many cases, the default values programmed into the MTP memory will be suitable and no re-
programming will be necessary. The defaults can be found in Section 8.1.
The MTP memory in the FT230X can be programmed over USB if the values need to be changed for a
particular application. Further details of this are provided from section 8.2 onwards.
Users who do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their
design can apply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs. See TN_100 USB Vendor ID/Product ID
Guidelines for more details.
8.1 Default Values
The default factory programmed values of the internal MTP memory are shown in Table 8.1.

8.2 Methods of Programming the MTP Memory
8.2.1 Programming the MTP memory over USB
The MTP memory on all FT-X devices can be programmed over USB. This method is the same as for the
EEPROM on other FTDI devices such as the FT232R. No additional hardware, connections or programming
voltages are required. The device is simply connected to the host computer in the same way that it would
be for normal applications, and the FT_Prog utility is used to set the required options and program the
device.
The FT_Prog utility is provided free-of-charge from the FTDI website, and can be found at the link below.
The user guide is also available at this link.
http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Utilities.htm#FT_Prog
Additionally, D2XX commands can be used to program the MTP memory from within user applications.
For more information on the commands available, please see the D2XX Programmers Guide below.

User Memory Area
The User Memory Areas are highlighted in Green on the memory map. They can be read and written via
USB on the FT230X. All locations within this range are freely programmable; no areas have special
functions and there is no checksum for the user area.
Note that the application should take into account the specification for the number of write cycles in
Section 5.4 if it will be writing to the MTP memory multiple times.
Configuration Memory Area (writable)
This area stores the configuration data for the device, including the data which is returned to the host in
the configuration descriptors (e.g. the VID, PID and string descriptions) and also values which set the
hardware configuration (the signal assigned to each CBUS pin for example).
These values can have a significant effect on the behaviour of the device. Steps must be taken to ensure
that these locations are not written to un-intentionally by an application which is intended to access only
the user area.
This area is included in a checksum which covers configuration areas of the memory, and so changing
any value can also cause this checksum to fail.
Configuration Memory Area (non-writable)
This is a reserved area and the application should not write to this area of memory. Any attempt to write
these locations will fail
