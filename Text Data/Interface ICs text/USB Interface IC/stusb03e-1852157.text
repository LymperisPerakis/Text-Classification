STUSB03E                                                                                   Functional description
8          Functional description
The STUSB03E is designed to provide USB connectivity in mobile systems where available system
supply voltages are not able to satisfy USB requirements. The STUSB03E can operate down to supply
voltages of 1.6V and still meet USB physical layer specifications. As shown in the circuit above, the
STUSB03E takes advantage of the USB supply voltage, VBUS, to operate the transceiver. The system
voltage, VIF, is used to set the reference voltage used by the digital I/O lines interfacing to the system
controller. Internal circuitry provides translation between the USB and system voltage domains. VIF will
typically be the main supply voltage rail for the controller.
In addition, a 3.3V, 10% termination supply voltage, VPU, is provided to support speed selection. VPU can
be disabled or enabled under software control via the CON input. This allows for software-controlled
connect or disconnect states. A 1.5K resistor is required to be connected between this pin and the D- line
when operating in low speed mode. In full speed mode either an internal pull-up resistor or an external
one connected between VPU pin and D+ line can be used; the desired configuration is chosen by tying
RSEL pin to VIF or GND.
The use of ESD transient protection devices is not required for operation, but is recommended.

         In order to meet environmental requirements, ST offers these devices in ECOPACK® packages.
         These packages have a Lead-free second level interconnect. The category of second Level
         Interconnect is marked on the package and on the inner box label, in compliance with JEDEC
         Standard JESD97. The maximum ratings related to soldering conditions are also marked on
         the inner box label. ECOPACK is an ST trademark. ECOPACK specifications are available at:
