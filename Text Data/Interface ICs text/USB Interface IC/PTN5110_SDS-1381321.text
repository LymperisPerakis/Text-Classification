1. General description
             PTN5110 is a single-port TCPC compliant USB Power Delivery (PD) PHY IC that
             implements Type-C Configuration Channel (CC) interface and USB PD Physical layer
             functions to a Type-C Port Manager (TCPM) that handles PD Policy management. It is
             designed to comply with USB PD [1], Type-C [2] and TCPC [3] specifications. This IC is
             targeted primarily for use in system platforms (e.g. Notebook PCs, Desktop PCs,
             Chromebooks, Tablets, Convertibles, etc.). Other use cases may be feasible depending
             on the application architecture, e.g. docks, monitors, accessories, cable adapters,
             smartphones etc.
             It can support various Type-C roles: Sink, Source, Sink with accessory support or DRP. It
             implements Type-C CC analog portion (i.e Rd/Rp/Ra detection, Rd/Rp indication) and PD
             Tx/Rx PHY and protocol state machines as per [3]. PTN5110 supports TCPM in system
             realization of the following PD roles:
               1. Provider (P)
               2. Provider/Consumer (P/C)
               3. Consumer (C)
               4. Consumer/Provider (C/P)
             PTN5110 integrates VCONN load switch with programmable current limit, reverse
             leakage current blocking and Over Temperature Protection (OTP). It implements two
             enable control outputs for controlling load switches/FETs on VBUS source and/or sink
             power paths. It also implements VBUS voltage monitoring/measurement, VBUS Force
             discharge and Bleed discharge features as defined in [3]. PTN5110 implements I2C-bus
             interface registers, finite state machines and control flow, etc. as defined in [3]. Please
             refer to [3] for description of I2C registers, control descriptions, flow diagrams, etc.
             PTN5110 provides the majority of relevant IO capability for the host processor/TCPM to
             easily control and manage the Type-C/PD interface via the TCPC interface:
               • VBUS Power path control of source and sink power rails (EN_SRC, EN_SNK1)
               • Up to four different slave addresses can be selected based on SLV_ADDR
               • ILIM_5V_VBUS that allows TCPM to set two different current limits on VBUS 5 V
                  Load switch.
               • FRS_EN that allows for arming 5 V SRC load switch for Fast Role Swap (FRS)
                  support
               • DBG_ACC that can be used by host TCPM indicate Type-C debug accessory
                  detection
             PTN5110 offers tremendous flexibility to platform integrators by supporting a wide range
             of power supply input voltages.

7. Functional description
                       PTN5110 is a TCPC compliant USB Type-C PD PHY IC that can be used to realize single
                       or multi-port USB Type-C PD and/or Alternate mode implementations. It is designed to
                       comply with USB PD [1], Type-C [2] and TCPC [3] specifications.
                       PTN5110 can be partitioned into the following major functional blocks along with their
                       respective interfaces:
                         •  Type-C Configuration Channel function
                         •  USB Power Delivery function
                         •  VCONN switch and control
                         •  VBUS Power path Control
                         •  TCPC I2C-bus interface and Control
                         •  Power management
                         •  Power supply
                       The following subsections describe the PTN5110 with its major functional blocks.
                   7.1 Type-C Configuration Channel functional block
                       Type-C Configuration Channel (CC) function operates as a front end to cable/plug
                       interface. This block implements Orientation detection (TCPM detects orientation and
                       informs TCPC of the result), Cable/Plug insertion (only initial indication, TCPM verifies
                       connection and tells TCPC when the connection is valid) and removal detection under
                       different roles (SRC, DRP, SNK including accessory support) as per [2][3].
                       In particular, PTN5110 supports Type-C functionality
                         •  Applying 'Rp (for CC1)', 'Rp (for CC2)', or 'Rd' depending on the configured role
                         •  Detecting cable/plug connect and disconnect events
                         •  Indicating Type-C current limit level in a system under Source role
                         •  Detecting the current level supported by remote end under Sink role
                         •  Supports TCPM in identifying plug orientation and indicating through TCPCi register
                            interface
                         • Implements VBUS thresholds, monitoring and measurement
                         • Discharging VBUS and VCONN based on Type-C status/PD Policy (managed by
                            TCPM)
                         • Supports TCPM in identifying Type-C Debug accessory detection and indicating
                            through TCPCi register interface and DBG_ACC pin. TCPM implements Type-C
                            Debug scheme
                         • Supports TCPM in Audio accessory detection and indication via status register
                         • Updating event, interrupt and status registers using ALERT_N pin
                         • Try.SRC/ Try.SNK feature can be enabled

                   7.2 USB power delivery function
                       TCPM handles the PD policy management and interfacing to Application/Platform power
                       management given the system states, battery status, etc. It reviews capabilities and status
                       of various power providers (USB PD, AC-DC adapter, battery, docking, etc.) dynamically
                       and determines a specific source for powering/charging the platform; the power source
                       selection is an important and platform dependent aspect of Application power delivery
                       scheme.
                         • For example, in some computing applications, EC (with integrated TCPM function)
                            plays a central role in controlling the various power sources including USB PD. To
                            support this, PTN5110 facilitates this by helping to send/receive USB PD messages. It
                            implements PD PHY and Protocol functions as per [3].
                         • In several applications, EC may not even exist or EC wants to play a hands-off role.
                            To support these applications, a dedicated TCPM can be utilized that works with
                            PTN5110 to realize PD functionality.
                       In a Type-C PD implementation, the system partitioning involves the following parts:
                         • Port PHY function  PTN5110 (TCPC PHY implemented as per [3])
                         • Port policy engine and device policy management, Alternate mode support  TCPM
                            (this may be integrated with EC or SMC)
                       The interface bus between PTN5110 and TCPM is I2C [4]. PTN5110 provides a
                       transparent set of commands and register interface to control the operation and ensure
                       robust system behavior. PTN5110 Application Programming guide [5] describes the
                       register set supported for the PD control, status updates and operational
                       control/sequences. PTN5110 provides a USB PD TCPC Interface compliant register map
                       as well as additional vendor defined features.
                                                                                      I2C-bus             TCPM (PD Policy controller

                       PTN5110 implements USB PD PHY layer function as follows.
                         •  CC Analog IO complying to TX/RX masks
                         •  Bit transmission and reception
                         •  Biphase mark coding
                         •  4B5B line coding
                         •  CRC computation and checking
                         •  FRS request detection (in initial PD sink role) and indication (in initial PD source role).
                            The FRS_EN pin is used to 'arm' the 5 V VBUS Source load switch during FRS
                            operation. PTN5110 can detect the FRS request signaling and autonomously switch
                            over to Source role (if previously, in Sink role)
                       It also handles PD Protocol layer functions (TX and RX protocol state machines) as per
                       [3].

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                              PTN5110
                                                                                                                        USB PD TCPC PHY IC
                       To minimize chances of collision, PTN5110 checks the CC line before start of
                       transmission. Once the data is transmitted or received, the I2C-bus interface status is
                       updated and TCPM is interrupted. It also provides support for a bus management scheme
                       as defined in [1].
                       BIST mode (Tx, Rx) is also supported.
                   7.3 VCONN switch and control
                       PTN5110 implements a very low RON switch that can deliver VCONN current; depending
                       on the pin over which CC communication is established, VCONN_IN power is delivered
                       into the other CC pin. With its patented architecture, the switch implements Soft Start
                       behavior to avoid heavy inrush current flow when it is enabled. The VCONN switch and
                       protection circuitry can be activated only when VCONN_IN is above VCONN present
                       threshold. When in disabled condition, PTN5110 presents Hi-Z condition on the
                       corresponding CCx pin.
                       The switch implements four important features relevant to application robustness
                         •   Reverse Voltage Protection (RVP)
                         •   Over Current Limiting (OCL)
                         •   Over Temperature Protection (OTP)
                         •   Short to GND protection
                       The fault conditions are mapped to VCONN fault status and interrupt bits in TCPC
                       registers. There is an extended set of VCONN registers for configuring the deglitch
                       duration, reattempt count re-assert delay, interrupt mask, fault status, etc. The TCPM can
                       program these registers during TCPC initialization to achieve desired behavior. [5]
                       provides more details on the registers and bit definitions.
                7.3.1 Reverse Voltage Protection (RVP)
                       PTN5110 implements RVP that monitors for a certain voltage difference (over the deglitch
                       duration) to disable the switch path and protect the system from reverse current flow. After
                       the ‘reassert delay’ is elapsed, PTN5110 enables the switch again. If the condition persists
                       for 'reattempt count', then RVP fault status is asserted and if the interrupt is not masked, it
                       would raise ALERT_N for the host TCPM to take corrective measures. The ‘reassert
                       delay’ and ‘reattempt count’ are defined in [5].
                       TCPM can program the deglitch duration, reassert delay, reattempt count via extended
                       registers [5] at TCPCi level. The reverse voltage protection circuit can only be triggered
                       when it is enabled.
                       PTN5110 also provides reverse leakage current blocking when the switch is not enabled.
                       Irrespective of VCONN_IN pin voltage, the reverse leakage current (IRLCL) on CC1/2 pin is
                       LOW.
                7.3.2 Over Current Limiting (OCL)
                       PTN5110 supports four OCL threshold programmable levels. The Over Current Limiting
                       (OCL) circuitry keeps monitoring for current flow above the pre configured level and
                       whenever the threshold is exceeded, the switch goes into current limiting mode. It is
                       possible for the switch to go into Over Temperature condition due to heating and go into
                       OTP temperature cycling.

                                                                                                                         USB PD TCPC PHY IC
                7.3.3 Over Temperature Protection (OTP)
                       If the switch has been enabled and if the device temperature exceeds a preset threshold,
                       the device goes into Over Temperature condition. The OTP circuit disables the switch and
                       triggers the fault status and raise interrupt (if enabled). Once the temperature reduces
                       down to 85°C and after OTP reassert delay duration [5], the switch is enabled
                       automatically. The TCPM can trigger disabling of the switch, if required.
                7.3.4 Short to GND protection
                       PTN5110 can protect the system from hard short to GND. Whenever the current delivered
                       goes beyond the highest threshold and up to Ishort, PTN5110 turns off the switch within a
                       few microseconds, enables the switch limiting the current flow up to the pre-programmed
                       OCL limit. PTN5110 records the fault status and generate interrupt (if enabled). The
                       TCPM can trigger disabling of the switch, if required.
                   7.4 VBUS power path control
                       Based on PD negotiation and contract, TCPM enables/disables specific power path
                       (source or sink load switches). PTN5110 provides two power path control IO pins. They
                       are:
                          • EN_SRC: This is meant for 5 V Source control
                            – ILIM_5V_VBUS is provided to control current limiting at default current (0.9 A)
                               versus 1.5/3 A
                          • EN_SNK1: This is meant for sinking current from VBUS (or, it can be configured to
                            source a second power rail in a two-rail source system)
                       Table 5.     Power path combination illustration
                        Configuration (not limited to)                       Load switch* Combination
                                                                             (e.g. NX5P3290, NX20P5090, Source side Load switch)
                        5 V Source, 5 V to 20 V Sink                         Source Load switch w/OCL = NX5P3290 (EN_SRC)
                                                                             Sink Load switch w/RCP = NX20P5090 (EN_SNK1)

                                                                             Back-to-back Sink FET control (EN_SNK1)
                        5 V Source >5 V Source                               Source Load switch w/OCL = NX5P3290 (EN_SRC)
                        (two separate rails)                                 Source Load switch w/OCL = high voltage source side Load
                                                                             switch (EN_SNK1)
                        5 V Sink                                             Sink Load switch w/RCP = NX20P5090 (EN_SNK1)
                       Remark: Platform integrators may use MOSFETs (with additional control circuitry) instead
                       of Load switches while using PTN5110 in their applications.
                       With the support of NXP (RCP capable) Type-C Load switches, PTN5110 supports
                          • FRS operation
                          • Positive and Negative voltage transitions (while in SRC mode with two power rails)
                          • In a multi-port platform with buck boost configuration and dead battery condition,
                            EN_SNK1 pin activates NX20P5090 allowing current flow into the system. It is
                            possible that this could potentially lead to multiple ports allowing sink current at 5 V
                            into the system. Once the system initializes, the TCPM can selectively charge from a
                            port only.

                       – Live/normal battery condition: PTN5110 need not enable EN_SNK1 output
                          autonomously since VDD > 0. TCPM can selectively enable a power path only
                     • Transition seamlessly from one Type-C port to another Type-C port without
                       interrupting the charging/power flow into the system
                       – This assumes using Load switches (e.g. NX20P5090) on all sink power paths. The
                          TCPM can perform make-before-break operation on the sink paths and PTN5110
                          with its OVP feature helps prevent steady reverse current flow back into the port if
                          the internal rail voltage is higher than the port voltage.
                   Remark: The FAULT_N input pin shall be used only along with EN_SRC/EN_SNK1 pin
                   control. In applications where EN_SRC or EN_SNK1 is used to control power switch, the
                   FAULT_N input can be connected to fault status indication output of the power switch(es).
                   If PTN5110 does not control VBUS power path, then this FAULT_N pin shall be pulled
                   HIGH.

                   7.5 Host interface and control
                       PTN5110 works along with TCPM to realize USB PD functionality and/or Alternate mode
                       support. The TCPM can control and interface with PTN5110 through the I2C-bus interface.
                       PTN5110 provides up to four I2C slave address combinations based on quaternary pin
                       (SLV_ADDR) setting as per Table 6 below.

                       PTN5110 implements slave I2C-bus interface, TCPC registers as per [3] and vendor
                       defined registers. Please refer to [3] for more information.
                       A detailed description of the I2C-bus specification, with applications, is given in user
                       manual UM10204, “I2C-bus specification and user manual” [4].
                       PTN5110 Application programming guide [5] describes the various registers with their bit
                       definitions, POR values and the various functions. Also, example 'C' programs
                       corresponding to various functions and operations are included therein. This guide can be
                       used by the platform system architects to implement the EC firmware to control the
                       operations of PTN5110.
                       Table 7 describes the TCPC identification registers and their Read only values.

                   7.6 Power management and power supplies
                       PTN5110 is designed to operate under a wide range of VDD and VBUS supply voltages. It
                       can seamlessly transition from VBUS to VDD and vice versa.
                       Under dead battery operation, PTN5110 applies voltage clamps to both CC pins so that
                       the system may receive power as a Sink. To support platforms with buck-boost
                       configuration, PTN5110 asserts EN_SNK1 pin based on validity of VBUS voltage
                       (facilitates 5 V VBUS sinking).
                       The following table highlights the power supplies and operating conditions for PTN5110.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         PTN5110
                                                                                                                   USB PD TCPC PHY IC
                      • Source VBUS 5 V (if not under dead battery)
                      • Charge from VBUS PD and AC barrel power, if applicable
                      • Source VCONN power
                   The EC communicates with PTN5110 via an I2C-bus interface and controls the
                   operations.
                   An important aspect to note here is that PTN5110 would indicate a 'Rd' pull-down (Sink)
                   under dead battery condition and this enables the port partner to provide VBUS @ 5 V
                   (provided the port partner is capable of acting as Source). However, after system starts
                   up, role swap may be performed to become Source and/or DFP. This is handled by
                   PTN5110 and TCPM together.
                   DBG_ACC, ILIM_5V_VBUS and FRS_EN pins can be used by the platform, as
                   necessary.
                   For this application context, it is recommended to use PTN5110HQ version of the IC.
                   There is a consideration for making this recommendation here - buck boost charger power
                   path is assumed to take longer time than that of PTN5110 VBUS debounce time of 15 ms.
                   If the VDD becomes available before VBUS debounce time of PTN5110, it is suggested to
                   use PTN5110DHQ version.

  Fig 6.   Illustrative diagram of Notebook/Ultrabook/Tablet application (Separate source and sink power path
           FETs): PD Provider/Consumer role (Source role under Normal power/battery; Sink role under dead
           battery condition); NVDC charger configuration relying on VBUS LDO for TCPM start up under dead
           battery
                              In this configuration, NVDC charger IC is used. To support operation on dead battery, a
                              separate VBUS LDO that provides initial current to start up TCPM and charger IC is
                              utilized.

                   Figure 5 illustrates the use case using load switches whereas Figure 6 illustrates the
                   same with FETs. It should be noted that in Figure 6, gate drivers are required to drive the
                   MOSFETs.
                   For this application context, it is recommended to use PTN5110DHQ version of the IC.
                   There is a consideration for making this recommendation here - VBUS LDO regulator
                   power path is assumed to start providing VDD earlier than PTN5110 VBUS debounce time
                   of 15 ms.
                   If the VDD becomes available later than VBUS debounce time of PTN5110, it is feasible to
                   to use PTN5110HQ version.

           under powered condition)
                        In this illustration also, PTN5110 and Policy controller & Alternate mode control MCU are
                        behind Type-C receptacle and they are configured to act as a PD Provider (Autonomous
                        mode) based on pre-configured Power profiles. The PC system uses the ATX or similar
                        power supply and it can deliver power to all USB ports. In this diagram, there is no EC to
                        interface with and so, the solution (TCPM MCU and PTN5110) is configured for
                        autonomous operation.

                                                                                                                    USB PD TCPC PHY IC
                     • sources VBUS 5 V
                     • sources USB PD power (specific wattage depends on the system application)
                     • Source VCONN power
                   PTN5110 controls the load switches to VBUS 5 V and PD power (up to a total of three
                   voltage rails). The handshake with power supply unit is handled at the system level. The
                   voltage transitions (both positive and negative) are also handled by PTN5110.
                   An important aspect to consider here is that a Desktop PC does not have dead battery
                   condition though it can be unpowered. If not powered, PTN5110 presents 'Rd' on CC pins.
                   After power up initialization, PTN5110 indicates 'Rp'. After PD negotiation, the Desktop
                   platform could deliver higher voltage/current.
                   DBG_ACC, ILIM_5V_VBUS and FRS_EN connections can be used based on platform
                   need.
                   For this application context, it is recommended to use PTN5110THQ version of the IC.

                                                                                                                    USB PD TCPC PHY IC
                   preference) and it performs cable/plug connect and disconnect detection, orientation
                   detection (Application Processor must determine orientation). However, on dead battery
                   condition, it defaults to 'Rd'/Sink role.
                   The power path control signals (EN_SNK1, EN_SRC) handle power flow in one direction
                   each:
                      • when operating as a Sink, this use case using EN_SNK1 supports charging of the
                        platform and
                      • when in Source, EN_SRC supports power path control of VBUS 5V to the Type-C
                        peripheral.
                   This application is expected to:
                      • Sourcing VCONN power is dependent on the Type-C data role taken
                   The Application processor implements PD and Alt mode functionality.
                   DBG_ACC, ILIM_5V_VBUS and FRS_EN connections can be used based on platform
                   need.
                   For this application context, it is recommended to use PTN5110HQ version of the IC.
                   There is a consideration for making this recommendation here - System PMIC power path
                   is assumed to take longer time than that of PTN5110 VBUS debounce time of 15 ms.
                   If the VDD becomes available before VBUS debounce time of PTN5110, it is suggested to
                   use PTN5110DHQ version.

  Fig 9.  Illustrative diagram of Cable adapter use case (e.g. Sink in a Type-C to legacy adapter)
                          In this illustration, PTN5110 is inside Type-C cable adapter operating in Sink role. Some
                          example use cases are Type-C to DP adapter, Type-C to VGA adapter, Type-C to
                          Thunderbolt adapter etc. PTN5110 serves as PD PHY layer device for a Cable adapter
                          management MCU or dedicated PD MCU wherein PD policy management, Alternate
                          mode and VDM support are handled. The USB Billboard device is assumed to be
                          implemented as part of adapter management MCU.
                          The cable adapter implementation operates on VCONN supply. Discrete depletion mode
                          FET can be used in the application for 'Ra' indication on CC pin.
                          For this application context, it is recommended to use PTN5110DHQ version of the IC.

  Fig 10. Illustrative diagram of Docking/Multi-Function Monitor/Printer application (2 power paths): PD
          Consumer/Provider (DRP w/Try.SRC)
                             The example applications are Multi- function monitor, Dock or Printer with local power.
                             PTN5110 is configured for DRP with preference for Try.SRC role. This would allow this
                             platform to become a power source wherever possible including when the host platform is
                             in dead battery condition. Once the host is powered, data role swap is performed and any
                             relevant PD power negotiation is carried out.
                             This application is expected to
                               • Receive VBUS 5 V (or provide power during Dead battery operation, VBUS 5 V)
                               • Provides VBUS PD power
                             DBG_ACC, ILIM_5V_VBUS and FRS_EN connections can be used based on platform

  Fig 11. Illustrative diagram of Portable Hard Drive application (sink power path): PD Consumer only
                                  In a USB PD based hard drive application, PTN5110 + Policy controller MCU operates
                                  autonomously. At POR, PTN5110 presents 'Rd'/Sink role and starts to receive VBUS 5 V.
                                  Then based on configured power profile, PD negotiation and contracting is performed.
                                  The MCU interfaces with Hard drive electronics and delivers power after handshake. The
                                  MCU’s GPIO pins can be reused to handshake with DCDC converter and the handshake
                                  mechanism is OEM platform dependent.
                                  This application is expected to

                   Two example scenarios are captured in the illustrations. This application can be a typical
                   notebook PC with two-port support. Depending on whether the PC uses Buck boost
                   charger or regular NVDC charger, the platform implementation would be different.
                   For this application context, it is recommended to use PTN5110HQ version of the IC.
                   There is a consideration for making this recommendation here - power subsystem is
                   assumed to take longer time than that of PTN5110 VBUS debounce time of 15 ms.
                   If the VDD becomes available before VBUS debounce time of PTN5110, it is suggested to
                   use PTN5110DHQ version.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 21 and 22

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 20.
