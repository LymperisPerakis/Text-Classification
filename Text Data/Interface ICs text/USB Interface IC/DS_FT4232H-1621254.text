1.1 Driver Support
The FT4232H requires USB drivers (listed below), available free from http://www.ftdichip.com, which are
used to make the FT4232H appear as a virtual COM port (VCP). This allows the user to communicate with
the USB interface via a standard PC serial emulation port (for example TTY). Another FTDI USB driver, the
D2XX driver, can also be used with application software to directly access the FT4232H through a DLL.

1.3 USB Compliant
The FT4232H is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 specification and has been given the USB-IF Test-ID (TID)
40720024.
The timing of the rise/fall time of the USB signals is not only dependant on the USB signal drivers, it is also
dependant system and is affected by factors such as PCB layout, external components and any transient
protection present on the USB signals. For USB compliance these may require a slight adjustment. This
timing can be modified through a programmable setting stored in the same external EEPROM that is used
for the USB descriptors. Timing can also be changed by adding appropriate passive components to the
USB signals.

3.1.2      Pin Descriptions
This section describes the operation of the FT4232H pins for 64-pin LQFP and 64-pin QFN. Both the 64-pin
QFN and LQFP packages have the same function on each pin. The function of many pins is determined by
the configuration of the FT4232H. The following table details the function of each pin dependent on the
configuration of the interface. Each of the functions is described in Table 3.1.
Note: The convention used throughout this document for active low signals is the signal name followed by

Notes
     1. When using remote wake-up, ensure the resistors are pulled-up in suspend. Also ensure
         peripheral designs do not allow any current sink paths that may partially power the peripheral.
     2. If remote wake-up is enabled, a peripheral is allowed to draw up to 2.5mA in suspend. If remote
         wake-up is disabled, the peripheral must draw no more than 500uA in suspend.
     3. If a Pull-down is enabled, the FT4232H will not wake up from suspend.

3.1.4.3          FT4232H pins used in an MPSSE
The FT4232H channel A and channel B, each have a Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine (MPSSE).
Each MPSSE can be independently configured to a number of industry standard serial interface protocols
such as JTAG, I2C or SPI, or it can be used to implement a proprietary bus protocol. For example, it is
possible to use one of the FT4232H’s channels (e.g. channel A) to connect to an SRAM configurable FPGA
such as supplied by Altera or Xilinx. The FPGA device would normally be un-configured (i.e. have no
defined function) at power-up. Application software on the PC could use the MPSSE to download
configuration data to the FPGA over USB. This data would define the hardware function on power up. The
other MPSSE channel (e.g. channel B) would be available for another serial interface function while channel
C and channel D can be configured as UART or bit-bang mode. Alternatively each MPSSE can be used to
control a number of GPIO pins. When configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the
signals are shown in Table 3.7

                Table 3.7 Channel A and Channel B MPSSE Configured Pin Descriptions
For a functional description of this mode, please refer to section 4.4.
When either Channel A or Channel B or both channels are used in MPSSE mode, Channel C and Channel D
can be configured as asynchronous serial interface (RS232/422/485) or Bit-Bang mode or a combination of
both.
3.2 56-pin VQFN Package
The 56-pin VQFN with lower pin count and small size package is also available for the FT4232H. The
differences exist on power/ground and pin number for each pin. The part number is FT4232H-56Q to
distinguish it from the 64-pin package type. All the functions are supported in the 56-pin VQFN package.
The pin numbering is illustrated in the schematic symbol shown in Figure 3.2.

 Notes
     1. When using remote wake-up, ensure the resistors are pulled-up in suspend. Also ensure
         peripheral designs do not allow any current sink paths that may partially power the peripheral.
     2. If remote wake-up is enabled, a peripheral is allowed to draw up to 2.5mA in suspend. If remote
         wake-up is disabled, the peripheral must draw no more than 500uA in suspend.
     3. If a Pull-down is enabled, the FT4232H will not wake up from suspend.

3.2.4.3         FT4232H-56Q pins used in an MPSSE
The FT4232H channel A and channel B, each have a Multi-Protocol Synchronous Serial Engine (MPSSE).
Each MPSSE can be independently configured to a number of industry standard serial interface protocols
such as JTAG, I2C or SPI, or it can be used to implement a proprietary bus protocol. For example, it is
possible to use one of the FT4232H’s channels (e.g. channel A) to connect to an SRAM configurable FPGA
such as supplied by Altera or Xilinx. The FPGA device would normally be un-configured (i.e. have no
defined function) at power-up. Application software on the PC could use the MPSSE to download
configuration data to the FPGA over USB. This data would define the hardware function on power up. The
other MPSSE channel (e.g. channel B) would be available for another serial interface function while channel
C and channel D can be configured as UART or bit-bang mode. Alternatively each MPSSE can be used to
control a number of GPIO pins. When configured in this mode, the pins used and the descriptions of the
signals are shown in Table 3.14

4 Function Description
The FT4232H is FTDI’s 5th generation of USB devices. The FT4232H is a USB 2.0 High Speed (480Mb/s) to
UART/MPSSE ICs. It has the capability of being configured in a variety of industry standard serial
interfaces.
The FT4232H has four independent configurable interfaces. Two of these interfaces can be configured as
UART, JTAG, SPI, I2C or bit-bang mode, using an MPSSE, with independent baud rate generators. The
remaining two interfaces can be configured as UART or bit-bang.
4.1 Key Features
USB High Speed to Quad Interface. The FT4232H is a USB 2.0 High Speed (480Mbits/s) to four
independent flexible/configurable serial interfaces.
Functional Integration. The FT4232H integrates a USB protocol engine which controls the physical
Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) and handles all aspects of the USB 2.0 High Speed
interface. The FT4232H includes an integrated +1.8V Low Drop-Out (LDO) regulator and 12MHz to 480MHz
PLL. It also includes 2kbytes Tx and Rx data buffers per channel. The FT4232H effectively integrates the
entire USB protocol on a chip.
MPSSE. Multi-Purpose Synchronous Serial Engines (MPSSE), capable of speeds up to 30 Mbits/s, provides
flexible synchronous interface configurations.
Data Transfer Rate. The FT4232H supports a data transfer rate up to 12 Mbit/s when configured as an
RS232/RS422/RS485 UART interface. Please note the FT4232H does not support the baud rates of 7
Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10 Mbaud and 11 Mbaud.
Latency Timer. This is really a feature of the driver and is used to as a timeout to flush short packets of
data back to the PC. The default is 16ms, but it can be altered between 0ms and 256ms. At 0ms latency
you get a packet transfer on every high speed micro frame.
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
Quad Multi-Purpose UART/MPSSE Controllers. The FT4232H has four independent UART/MPSSE
Controllers. These blocks control the UART data or control the Bit-Bang mode if selected by the SETUP
command. The blocks used on channel A and channel B also contain a MPSSE (Multi-Protocol Synchronous
Serial Engine) in each of them which can be used independently of each other and the remaining UART
channels. Using this it can be configured under software command to have 1 MPSSE + 3 UARTS (each
UART can be set to Bit Bang mode to gain extra I/O if required) or 2 MPSSE + 2 UARTS.
USB Protocol Engine and FIFO control. The USB Protocol Engine controls and manages the interface
between the UTMI PHY and the FIFOs of the chip. It also handles power management and the USB protocol
specification.
Dual Port FIFO TX Buffer (2Kbytes per channel). Data from the Host PC is stored in these buffers to
be used by the Multi-purpose UART/FIFO controllers. This is controlled by the USB Protocol Engine and
FIFO control block.
Dual Port FIFO RX Buffer (2Kbytes per channel). Data from the Multi-purpose UART/FIFO controllers
is stored in these blocks to be sent back to the Host PC when requested. This is controlled by the USB
Protocol Engine and FIFO control block.
RESET Generator - The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT4232H.
RESET# should be tied to VCCIO (+3.3v) if not being used.
Independent Baud Rate Generators - The Baud Rate Generators provides an x16 or an x10 clock input
to the UART’s from a 120MHz reference clock and consists of a 14 bit pre-scaler and 4 register bits which
provide fine tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction). This determines the Baud
Rate of the UART which is programmable from 183 baud to 12 million baud. The FT2232H does not support
the baud rates of 7 Mbaud 9 Mbaud, 10 Mbaud and 11 Mbaud.

See FTDI application note AN232B0-5 for more details.
+1.8V LDO Regulator. The +1.8V LDO regulator generates the +1.8 volts for the core and the USB
transceiver cell. Its input (VREGIN) must be connected to a +3.3V external power source. It is also
recommended to add an external filtering capacitor to the VREGIN. There is no direct connection from the
+1.8V output (VREGOUT) and the internal functions of the FT4232H. The PCB must be routed to connect
VREGOUT to the pins that require the +1.8V including VREGIN.
UTMI PHY. The Universal Transceiver Macrocell Interface (UTMI) physical interface cell. This block handles
the Full speed / High Speed SERDES (serialise – de-serialise) function for the USB TX/RX data. It also
provides the clocks for the rest of the chip. A 12 MHz crystal should be connected to the OSCI and OSCO
pins. A 12K Ohm resistor should be connected between REF and GND on the PCB.
The UTMI PHY functions include:
         Supports 480 Mbit/s "High Speed" (HS)/ 12 Mbit/s “Full Speed” (FS), FS Only and "Low Speed"
          (LS).
         SYNC/EOP generation and checking.
         Data and clock recovery from serial stream on the USB.
         Bit-stuffing/unstuffing; bit stuff error detection.
         Manages USB Resume, Wake Up and Suspend functions.
         Single parallel data clock output with on-chip PLL to generate higher speed serial data clocks.
EEPROM Interface. When used without an external EEPROM the FT4232H defaults to a quad USB to an
asynchronous serial port device. Adding an external 93C46 (93C56 or 93C66) EEPROM allows
customization of USB VID, PID, Serial Number, Product Description Strings and Power Descriptor value of
the FT4232H for OEM applications. Other parameters controlled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up,
Soft Pull Down on Power-Off and I/O pin drive strength.
The EEPROM must be a 16 bit wide configuration such as a Microchip 93LC46B or equivalent capable of a
1Mbit/s clock rate at VCC = +3.00V to 3.6V. The EEPROM is programmable in-circuit over USB using a
utility program called FT_PROG available from FTDI’s web site (www.ftdichip.com). This allows a blank
part to be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as part of the manufacturing and test process.
If no EEPROM is connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT4232H will default to serial ports. The device
uses its built-in default VID (0403), PID (6011) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value. In this
case, the device will not have a serial number as part of the USB descriptor.
4.3 FT232 UART Interface Mode Description
The FT4232H can be configured in similar UART modes as the FTDI FT232 devices (an asynchronous serial
interface). The following examples illustrate how to configure the FT4232H with an RS232, RS422 or
RS485 interfaces. The FT4232 can be configured as a mixture of these interfaces.
4.3.1         RS232 Configuration
Figure 4.1 illustrates how the FT4232H channel A can be configured with an RS232 UART interface. This
can be repeated for channels B, C and D to provide a quad RS232, but has been omitted for clarity.

In this case both channel A and channel C are configured as UART operating at TTL levels and a level
converter device (full duplex RS485 transceiver) is used to convert the TTL level signals from the FT4232H
to RS422 levels. The PWREN# signal is used to power down the level shifters such that they operate in a
low quiescent current when the USB interface is in suspend mode.

converter device (half duplex RS485 transceiver) is used to convert the TTL level signals from the FT232H
to RS485 levels. It has separate enables on both the transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the transmitter
is only enabled when a character is being transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN pins on the FT4232H are
provided for exactly that purpose, and so the transmitter enables are wired to the TXDEN‟s. The receiver
enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB suspend mode.
RS485 is a multi-drop network – i.e. many devices can communicate with each other over a single two
wire cable connection. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. Links are
provided to allow the cable to be terminated if the device is physically positioned at either end of the cable.
In this example the data transmitted by the FT4232H is also received by the device that is transmitting.
This is a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the transmitted data
from the received data stream. With the FT4232H it is possible to do this entirely in hardware – simply
modify the schematic so that RXD of the FT4232H is the logical OR of the level converter device receiver
output with TXDEN using an HC32 or similar logic gate.

4.4 MPSSE Interface Mode Description
MPSSE Mode is designed to allow the FT4232H to interface efficiently with synchronous serial protocols
such as JTAG, I2C and SPI Bus. It can also be used to program SRAM based FPGA’s over USB. The MPSSE
interface is designed to be flexible so that it can be configured to allow any synchronous serial protocol
(industry standard or proprietary) to be implemented using the FT4232H. MPSSE is only available on
channel A and channel B.
MPSSE is fully configurable, and is programmed by sending commands down the data stream. These can
be sent individually or more efficiently in packets. MPSSE is capable of a maximum sustained data rate of
30 Mbits/s.
When a channel is configured in MPSSE mode, the IO timing and signals used are shown in Figure 4.4 and
Table 4.1. These show timings for CLKOUT=30MHz. CLKOUT can be divided internally to be provide a
slower clock.

4.4.1       MPSSE Adaptive Clocking
Adaptive clocking is a new MPSSE feature added to the FT24232H MPSSE engine.
The mode is effectively handshaking the CLK signal with a return clock RTCK. This is a technique used by
ARM processors.
The FT4232H will assert the CLK line and wait for the RTCK to be returned from the target device to
GPIOL3 line before changing the TDO (data out line).

4.5 Synchronous & Asynchronous Bit-Bang Interface Mode Desc.
The FT4232H channel A, B, C or channel D can be configured as a bit-bang interface. There are two types
of bit-bang modes: synchronous and asynchronous.
4.5.1        Asynchronous Bit-Bang Mode
Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode is the same as BM-style Bit-Bang mode. On any channel configured in
asynchronous bit-bang mode, data written to the device in the normal manner will be self-clocked onto the
parallel I/O data pins (those which have been configured as outputs). Each I/O pin can be independently
set as an input or an output. The rate that the data is clocked out at is controlled by the baud rate
generator.
For the data to change there has to be new data written, and the baud rate clock has to tick. If no new
data is written to the channel, the pins will hold the last value written.
4.5.2        Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode
The synchronous Bit-Bang mode will only update the output parallel I/O port pins whenever data is sent
from the USB interface to the parallel interface. When this is done, data is read from the USB Rx FIFO
buffer and written out on the pins. Data can only be received from the parallel pins (to the USB Tx FIFO
interface) when the parallel interface has been written to.
With Synchronous Bit-Bang mode, data will only be sent out by the FT4232H if there is space in the
FT4232H USB TXFIFO for data to be read from the parallel interface pins. This Synchronous Bit-Bang mode
will read the data bus parallel I/O pins first, before it transmits data from the USB RxFIFO. It is therefore 1
byte behind the output, and so to read the inputs for the byte that you have just sent, another byte must
be sent.
For example:-
(1) Pins start at 0xFF
Send 0x55,0xAA
Pins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA
Data read = 0xFF,0x55
(2) Pins start at 0xFF
Send 0x55,0xAA,0xAA
(repeat the last byte sent)
Pins go to 0x55 and then to 0xAA
Data read = 0xFF,0x55,0xAA
Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode differs from Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode in that the device parallel output is
only read when the parallel output is written to by the USB interface. This makes it easier for the
controlling program to measure the response to a USB output stimulus as the data returned to the USB
interface is synchronous to the output data.
Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command. A hex value of 1 will
enable Asynchronous Bit-Bang mode.
Synchronous Bit-Bang mode is enabled using Set Bit Bang Mode driver command. A hex value of 4 will
enable Synchronous Bit-Bang mode.
See application note AN2232-02, “Bit Mode Functions for the FT2232” for more details and examples of
using the bit-bang modes.
An example of the synchronous bi-bang mode timing is shown in Figure 4.7 and Table 4.2.

It should be noted that the FT4232H does not output the WRSTB# or RDSTB# signals when configured in
bit-bang mode. Figure 4.7 and Table 4.2 show these signals for illustration purposes only.
 NAME      Description
 t1        Current pin state is read
 t2        RDSTB# is set inactive and data on the paralle I/O pins is read and sent to the USB host.
 t3        RDSTB# is set active again, and any pins that are output will change to their new data
 t4        1 clock cycle to allow for data setup
 t5        WRSTB# goes active. This indicates that the host PC has written new data to the I/O parallel data
 t6        pins
           WRSTB# goes inactive
              Table 4.2 Synchronous Bit-Bang Mode Timing Interface Example Timings
WRSTB# = this output indicates when new data has been written to the I/O pins from the Host PC (via the
USB interface).
RDSTB# = this output rising edge indicates when data has been read from the I/O pins and sent to the
Host PC (via the USB interface).
4.6 FT4232H Mode Selection
The 4 channels of the FT4232H reset to 4 asynchronous serial UART interfaces. Following a reset, the
required mode can be configured by sending the FT_SetBitMode command (refer to
D2XX_Programmers_Guide) to the USB driver software.
The EEPROM contents have no effect on the selected mode with the exception of selecting the TXDEN for
RS485 mode when asynchronous serial interface has been selected in software. If the device is reset, then
the 4 channels must be reconfigured into the required mode.
Note that the mode of each of the 4 channels is independent of the other channels.
The MPSSE can be configured directly using the D2XX commands. Refer to D2XX_Programmers_Guide for
more details.
Also the MPSSE command set is fully described in application note AN108 - Command Processor For MPSSE
and MCU Host Bus Emulation Modes

Figure 6.1 illustrates the FT4232H in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. In this application, the FT4232H requires that the VBUS (USB
+5V) is regulated down to +3.3V (using an LDO) to supply the VCCIO, VPLL, VPHY and VREGIN.
VREGIN is the +3.3V input to the on chip +1.8V regulator. The output of the on chip LDO regulator
(+1.8V) drives the FT4232H core supply (VCORE). This requires a minimum of a 3.3uF filter capacitor.

Figure 6.2 illustrate the FT4232H in a typical USB bus powered configuration similar to Figure 6.1. The
difference here is that the +1.8V for the FT4232H core (VCORE) has been regulated from the VBUS as well
as the +3.3V supply to the VPLL, VPHY, VCCIO and VREGIN.

Figure 6.3 illustrate the FT4232H in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply and does not draw current from the USB bus. In this example an
external power supply is used. This external supply is regulated to +3.3V.
Note that in this set-up, the EEPROM should be configured for self-powered operation.

Figure 6.4 illustrates the FT4232H in a typical USB self-powered configuration similar to Figure 6.3. The
difference here is that the +1.8V for the FT4232H core has been regulated from the external power supply.
Note that in this set-up, the EEPROM should be configured for self-powered operation.

Figure 6.5 Illustrates how to connect the FT4232H with a 12MHz ± 0.003% crystal. In this case loading
capacitors should to be added between OSCI, OSCO and GND as shown. A value of 27pF is shown as the
capacitor in the example – this will be good for many crystals but it is recommended to select the loading
capacitor value based on the manufacturer’s recommendations wherever possible. It is recommended to
use a parallel cut type crystal.
It is also possible to use a 12 MHz oscillator with the FT4232H. In this case the output of the oscillator
would drive OSCI, and OSCO should be left unconnected. The oscillator must have a CMOS output drive
capability.

6.4 4 Channel Transmit and Receiver LED Indication Example
The following example illustrates how a 74HCT595 can be used to decode the EEDATA data to indicate Tx
and Rx on each of the channels. The associated LED will light when the Channel is transmitting or receiving
data.

In this configuration, the LEDs will flash when the EEPROM is accessed e.g. during enumeration.
Under normal operation, the EECS is held low to disable access to the EEPROM. In this special case, the
EECLK (frequency = 1.56µS) will clock the EEDATA into the 74HC595 shift register (with EECS low,
therefore EEPROM ignores the EEDATA). Then EECS will pulse high. The rising edge of the EECS latches the
data into a storage register of the 74HC595 which drives the LEDs.
Please refer to the 74HC595 datasheet for further explanation.

7 EEPROM Configuration
If an external EEPROM is fitted (93LC46/56/66) it can be programmed over USB using FT_PROG. The
EEPROM must be 16 bits wide and capable or working at a VCC supply of +3.0 to +3.6 volts.
Adding an external EEPROM allows selecting the TXDEN for RS485 mode when asynchronous serial
interface has been selected.
                                       Figure 7.1 EEPROM Interface
The external EEPROM can also be used to customise the USB VID, PID, Serial Number, Product Description
Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT4232H for OEM applications. Other parameters controlled by
the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down on Power-Off and I/O pin drive strength.
If no EEPROM is connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT4232H uses its built-in default VID (0403), PID
(6011) Product Description and Power Descriptor Value. In this case, the device will not have a serial
number as part of the USB descriptor.
7.1 Default EEPROM Configuration
The external EEPROM (if it’s fitted) can be programmed over USB using FT_PROG. This allows a blank part
to be soldered onto the PCB and programmed as part of the manufacturing and test process. Users who
do not have their own USB Vendor ID but who would like to use a unique Product ID in their design can
apply to FTDI for a free block of unique PIDs.
See TN_100 USB Vendor ID/Product ID Guidelines for more information.
