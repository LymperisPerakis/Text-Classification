USB7056
2.0       INTRODUCTION
2.1       General Description
The Microchip USB7056 hub is low-power, OEM configurable, USB 3.1 Gen 1 hub controller with 6 downstream ports
and advanced features for embedded USB applications. The USB7056 is fully compliant with the Universal Serial Bus
Revision 3.1 Specification and USB 2.0 Link Power Management Addendum. The USB7056 supports 5 Gbps Super-
Speed (SS), 480 Mbps Hi-Speed (HS), 12 Mbps Full-Speed (FS), and 1.5 Mbps Low-Speed (LS) USB downstream
devices on four standard USB 3.1 Gen 1 downstream ports and only legacy speeds (HS/FS/LS) on two standard USB
2.0 downstream ports.
The USB7056 supports USB Power Delivery with up to 100W of power and Alternate Modes on the upstream port.
Downstream port one supports native basic Type-C with integrated CC logic. The downstream Type-C port includes an
internal USB 3.1 Gen 1 multiplexer; no external multiplexer is required for Type-C support.
The USB7056 supports the legacy USB speeds (HS/FS/LS) through a dedicated USB 2.0 hub controller that is the cul-
mination of six generations of Microchip hub feature controller design and experience with proven reliability, interoper-
ability, and device compatibility. The SuperSpeed hub controller operates in parallel with the USB 2.0 controller,
decoupling the 5 Gbps SS data transfers from bottlenecks due to the slower USB 2.0 traffic.
The USB7056 enables OEMs to configure their system using “Configuration Straps.” These straps simplify the config-
uration process assigning default values to USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports and GPIOs. OEMs can disable ports, enable battery
charging and define GPIO functions as default assignments on power up.
The USB7056 supports downstream battery charging. The USB7056 integrated battery charger detection circuitry sup-
ports the USB-IF Battery Charging (BC1.2) detection method and most Apple devices. The USB7056 provides the bat-
tery charging handshake and supports the following USB-IF BC1.2 charging profiles:
• DCP: Dedicated Charging Port (Power brick with no data)
• CDP: Charging Downstream Port (1.5A with data)
• SDP: Standard Downstream Port (0.5A with data)
• Custom profiles loaded via SPI EEPROM or OTP
Additionally, the USB7056 includes many powerful and unique features such as:
The Hub Feature Controller, an internal USB device dedicated for use as a USB to I2C/SPI/GPIO interface that allows
external circuits or devices to be monitored, controlled, or configured via the USB interface.
Multi-Host Endpoint Reflector, which provides unique USB functionality whereby USB data can be “mirrored” between
two USB hosts (Multi-Host) in order to perform a single USB transaction.This capability is fully covered by Microchip
intellectual property (U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,523,243 and 7,627,708) and is instrumental in enabling Apple CarPlay™, where
the Apple iPhone® becomes a USB Host.
FlexConnect, which provides flexible connectivity options. Any one of the USB7056’s downstream ports can be recon-
figured to become the upstream port, allowing master capable devices to control other devices on the hub.
PortSwap, which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows direct alignment
of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors to avoid uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differential signals on the
PCB.
PHYBoost, which provides programmable levels of Hi-Speed USB signal drive strength
in the downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore USB signal integrity
in a compromised system environment. The graphic on the right shows an example of
Hi-Speed USB eye diagrams before and after PHYBoost signal integrity restoration. in
a compromised system environment.
VariSense, which controls the Hi-Speed USB receiver sensitivity enabling programmable levels of USB signal receive
sensitivity. This capability allows operation in a sub-optimal system environment, such as when a captive USB cable is
used.
Port Split, which allows for the USB 3.1 Gen1 and USB 2.0 portions of downstream ports 2, 3, and 4 to operate inde-
pendently and enumerate two separate devices in parallel in special applications.
USB Power Delivery Billboard Device, which allows an internal device to enumerate as a Billboard class device when
a Power Delivery Alternate Mode negotiation has failed. The Billboard device will enumerate temporarily to the host PC
when a failure occurs, as indicated by a digital signal from an external Power Delivery controller.The USB7056 can be

configured for operation through internal default settings. Custom OEM configurations are supported through external
SPI ROM or internal OTP ROM. All port control signal pins are under firmware control in order to allow for maximum
operational flexibility and are available as GPIOs for customer specific use.
The USB7056 is available in commercial (0°C to +70°C) and industrial (-40°C to +85°C) temperature ranges. An internal
block diagram of the USB7056 in an upstream Type-C application is shown in Figure 2-1.

3.2       Pin Descriptions
This section contains descriptions of the various USB7056 pins. The “_N” symbol in the signal name indicates that the
active, or asserted, state occurs when the signal is at a low voltage level. For example, RESET_N indicates that the
reset signal is active low. When “_N” is not present after the signal name, the signal is asserted when at the high voltage
level.
The terms assertion and negation are used exclusively. This is done to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of
“active low” and “active high” signal. The term assert, or assertion, indicates that a signal is active, independent of
whether that level is represented by a high or low voltage. The term negate, or negation, indicates that a signal is inac-
tive.
Buffer type definitions are detailed in Section 1.2, Buffer Types.

  Note 3-1     Configuration strap values are latched on Power-On Reset (POR) and the rising edge of RESET_N
               (external chip reset). Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. Signals that
               function as configuration straps must be augmented with an external resistor when connected to a
               load. For additional information, refer to Section 3.3, Configuration Straps and Programmable
               Functions.

3.3       Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions
Configuration straps are multi-function pins that are used during Power-On Reset (POR) or external chip reset
(RESET_N) to determine the default configuration of a particular feature. The state of the signal is latched following
deassertion of the reset. Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. This section details the var-
ious device configuration straps and associated programmable pin functions.
   Note:     The system designer must ensure that configuration straps meet the timing requirements specified in
             Section 9.6.2, Power-On and Configuration Strap Timing and Section 9.6.3, Reset and Configuration Strap
             Timing. If configuration straps are not at the correct voltage level prior to being latched, the device may
             capture incorrect strap values.
3.3.1        PORT DISABLE CONFIGURATION (PRT_DIS_P[6:1] / PRT_DIS_M[6:1])
The PRT_DIS_P[6:1] / PRT_DIS_M[6:1] configuration straps are used in conjunction to disable the related port (6-1)
For PRT_DIS_Px (where x is the corresponding port 6-1):
     0 = Port x D+ Enabled
     1 = Port x D+ Disabled
For PRT_DIS_Mx (where x is the corresponding port 6-1):
     0 = Port x D- Enabled
     1 = Port x D- Disabled
   Note:     Both PRT_DIS_Px and PRT_DIS_Mx (where x is the corresponding port) must be tied to 3.3 V to disable
             the associated downstream port. Disabling the USB 2.0 port will also disable the corresponding USB 3.0
             port.
3.3.2        NON-REMOVABLE PORT CONFIGURATION (CFG_NON_REM)
The CFG_NON_REM configuration strap is used to configure the non-removable port settings of the device to one of
six settings. These modes are selected by the configuration of an external resistor on the CFG_NON_REM pin. The
resistor options are a 200 kΩ pull-down, 200 kΩ pull-up, 10 kΩ pull-down, 10 kΩ pull-up, 10 Ω pull-down, and 10 Ω pull-
up, as shown in Table 3-2.

3.3.3        BATTERY CHARGING CONFIGURATION (CFG_BC_EN)
The CFG_BC_EN configuration strap is used to configure the battery charging port settings of the device to one of
six settings. These modes are selected by the configuration of an external resistor on the CFG_BC_EN pin. The resistor
options are a 200 kΩ pull-down, 200 kΩ pull-up, 10 kΩ pull-down, 10 kΩ pull-up, 10 Ω pull-down, and 10 Ω pull-up, as

3.4       Physical and Logical Port Mapping
The USB70xx family of devices are based upon a common architecture, but all have different modifications and/or pin
bond outs to achieve the various device configurations. The base chip is composed of a total of 6 USB3 PHYs and 7
USB2 PHYs. These PHYs are physically arranged on the chip in a certain way, which is referred to as the PHYSICAL
port mapping.
The actual port numbering is remapped by default in different ways on each device in the family. This changes the way
that the ports are numbered from the USB host’s perspective. This is referred to as LOGICAL mapping.
The various configuration options available for these devices may, at times, be with respect to PHYSICAL mapping or
LOGICAL mapping. Each individual configuration option which has a PHYSICAL or LOGICAL dependency is declared
as such within the register description.
The PHYSICAL vs. LOGICAL mapping is described for all port related pins in Table 3-7. A system design in schematics
and layout is generally performed using the pinout in Section 3.1, Pin Assignments, which is assigned by the default
LOGICAL mapping. Hence, it may be necessary to cross reference the PHYSICAL vs. LOGICAL look up tables when
determining the hub configuration.
  Note:      The MPLAB Connect tool makes configuration simple; the settings can be selected by the user with respect
             to the LOGICAL port numbering. The tool handles the necessary linking to the PHYSICAL port settings.
             Refer to Section 6.0, Device Configuration for additional information.

5.0      MODES OF OPERATION
The device provides two main modes of operation: Standby Mode and Hub Mode. These modes are controlled via the
RESET_N pin, as shown in Table 5-1.

   RESET_N Input                                                     Summary
          0            Standby Mode: This is the lowest power mode of the device. No functions are active other
                       than monitoring the RESET_N input. All port interfaces are high impedance and the PLL is
                       halted. Refer to Section 8.11, Resets for additional information on RESET_N.
          1            Hub (Normal) Mode: The device operates as a configurable USB hub. This mode has vari-
                       ous sub-modes of operation, as detailed in Figure 5-1. Power consumption is based on the
                       number of active ports, their speed, and amount of data received.
The flowchart in Figure 5-1 details the modes of operation and details how the device traverses through the Hub Mode
stages (shown in bold). The remaining sub-sections provide more detail on each stage of operation.

5.1        Boot Sequence
5.1.1        STANDBY MODE
If the RESET_N pin is asserted, the hub will be in Standby Mode. This mode provides a very low power state for maxi-
mum power efficiency when no signaling is required. This is the lowest power state. In Standby Mode all downstream
ports are disabled, the USB data pins are held in a high-impedance state, all transactions immediately terminate (no
states saved), all internal registers return to their default state, the PLL is halted, and core logic is powered down in order
to minimize power consumption. Because core logic is powered off, no configuration settings are retained in this mode
and must be re-initialized after RESET_N is negated high.
5.1.2        SPI INITIALIZATION STAGE (SPI_INIT)
The first stage, the initialization stage, occurs on the deassertion of RESET_N. In this stage, the internal logic is reset,
the PLL locks if a valid clock is supplied, and the configuration registers are initialized to their default state. The internal
firmware then checks for an external SPI ROM. The firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid
signature of “2DFU” (device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0x3FFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the
external SPI ROM is enabled and the code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid
signature is not found, then execution continues from internal ROM (CFG_ROM stage).
The required SPI ROM must be a minimum of 1 Mbit, and 60 MHz or faster. Both 1, 2, and 4-bit SPI operation is sup-
ported. For optimum throughput, a 2-bit SPI ROM is recommended. Both mode 0 and mode 3 SPI ROMs are also sup-
ported.
If the system is not strapped for SPI Mode, code execution will continue from internal ROM (CFG_ROM stage).
5.1.3        CONFIGURATION FROM INTERNAL ROM STAGE (CFG_ROM)
In this stage, the internal firmware loads the default values from the internal ROM. Most of the hub configuration regis-
ters, USB descriptors, electrical settings, etc. will be initialized in this state.
5.1.4        CONFIGURATION STRAP READ STAGE (CFG_STRAP)
In this stage, the firmware reads the following configuration straps to override the default values:
•   CFG_STRAP[3:1]
•   PRT_DIS_P[6:1]
•   PRT_DIS_M[6:1]
•   CFG_NON_REM
•   CFG_BC_EN
If the CFG_STRAP[3:1] pins are set to Configuration 1, the device will move to the SMBUS_CHECK stage, otherwise
it will move to the CFG_OTP stage. Refer to Section 3.3, Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions for infor-
mation on usage of the various device configuration straps.
5.1.5        SMBUS CHECK STAGE (SMBUS_CHECK)
Based on the PF[31:3] configuration selected (refer to Section 3.3.4, PF[31:3] Configuration (CFG_STRAP[2:1])), the
firmware will check for the presence of external pull up resistors on the SMBus slave programmable function pins. If
pull-ups are detected on both pins, the device will be configured as an SMBus slave, and the next state will be CFG_SM-
BUS. If a pull-up is not detected in either of the pins, the next state is CFG_OTP.
5.1.6        SMBUS CONFIGURATION STAGE (CFG_SMBUS)
In this stage, the external SMBus master can modify any of the default configuration settings specified in the integrated
ROM, such as USB device descriptors, port electrical settings, and control features such as downstream battery
charging.
There is no time limit on this mode. In this stage the firmware will wait indefinitely for the SMBus/I2C configuration. The
external SMBus master writes to register 0xFF to end the configuration in legacy mode. In non-legacy mode, the SMBus
command USB_ATTACH (opcode 0xAA55) or USB_ATTACH_WITH_SMBUS (opcode 0xAA56) will finish the configu-
ration.

5.1.7        OTP CONFIGURATION STAGE (CFG_OTP)
Once the SOC has indicated that it is done with configuration, all configuration data is combined in this stage. The
default data, the SOC configuration data, and the OTP data are all combined in the firmware and the device is pro-
grammed.
5.1.8        HUB CONNECT STAGE (USB_ATTACH)
Once the hub registers are updated through default values, SMBus master, and OTP, the device firmware will enable
attaching the USB host by setting the USB_ATTACH bit in the HUB_CMD_STAT register (for USB 2.0) and the
USB3_HUB_ENABLE bit (for USB 3.1). The device will remain in the Hub Connect stage indefinitely.
5.1.9        NORMAL MODE (NORMAL_MODE)
Lastly, the hub enters Normal Mode of operation. In this stage full USB operation is supported under control of the USB
Host on the upstream port. The device will remain in the normal mode until the operating mode is changed by the sys-
tem.
If RESET_N is asserted low, then Standby Mode is entered. The device may then be placed into any of the designated
hub stages. Asserting a soft disconnect on the upstream port will cause the hub to return to the Hub Connect stage until
the soft disconnect is negated.

7.1       SPI/SQI Master Interface
The SPI/SQI controller has two basic modes of operation: execution of an external hub firmware image, or the USB to
SPI bridge. On power up, the firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid signature of 2DFU
(device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0x3FFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the external ROM mode is
enabled and the code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid signature is not found,
then execution continues from internal ROM and the SPI interface can be used as a USB to SPI bridge.
The second mode of operation is the USB to SPI bridge operation. Additional details on this feature can be found in
Section 8.9, USB to SPI Bridging.
Table 7-1 details how the associated pins are mapped in SPI vs. SQI mode.

   Note:    For SPI/SQI master timing information, refer to Section 9.6.8, SPI/SQI Master Timing.
7.2       SMBus/I2C Master/Slave Interfaces
The device provides three independent SMBus/I2C controllers (Slave, Master, and Power Delivery Master) which can
be used to access internal device run time registers or program the internal OTP memory. The device contains two 128
byte buffers to enable simultaneous master/slave operation and to minimize firmware overhead in processed I2C pack-
ets. The I2C interfaces support 100KHz Standard-mode (Sm) and 400KHz Fast Mode (Fm) operation. Additionally, the
Power Delivery I2C interface (PD_I2C_CLK/PD_I2C_DATA) also supports the 1MHz Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) mode of
operation.
The SMBus/I2C interfaces are assigned to programmable pins (PFx) and therefore the device must be programmed into
specific configurations to enable specific interfaces. Refer to Section 3.3.4, PF[31:3] Configuration (CFG_STRAP[2:1])
for additional information.

7.3       I2S Interface
The device provides an integrated I2S interface to facilitate the connection of digital audio devices. The I2S interface
conforms to the voltage, power, and timing characteristics/specifications as set forth in the I2S-Bus Specification, and
consists of the following signals:
•  I2S_SDI: Serial Data Input
•  I2S_SDO: Serial Data Output
•  I2S_SCK: Serial Clock
•  I2S_LRCK: Left/Right Clock (SS/FSYNC)
•  I2S_MCLK: Master Clock
•  MIC_DET: Microphone Plug Detect
Each audio connection is half-duplex, so I2S_SDO exists only on the transmit side and I2S_SDI exists only on the
receive side of the interface. Some codecs refer to the Serial Clock (I2S_SCK) as Baud/Bit Clock (BCLK). Also, the Left/
Right Clock is commonly referred to as LRC or LRCK. The I2S and other audio protocols refer to LRC as Word Select
(WS).
The following codec is supported by the default settings:
• Analog Devices ADAU1961 (24-bit 48kHz)
Additional codecs are also supported with modifications to the configuration register settings. Use the following table as
a guide for assessing I2S codec compatibility. For additional details on how to implement the necessary configuration
settings, refer to the application note, “USB7002/USB705x I2S Operation”.

7.3.1        MODES OF OPERATION
The USB audio class operates in three ways: Asynchronous, Synchronous and Adaptive. There are also multiple oper-
ating modes, such as hi-res, streaming, etc.. Typically for USB devices, inputs such as microphones are Asynchronous,
and output devices such as speakers are Adaptive. The hardware is set up to handle all three modes of operation. It is
recommended that the following configuration be used: Asynchronous IN; Adaptive OUT; 48Khz streaming mode; Two
channels: 16 bits per channel.
7.3.1.1        Asynchronous IN 48KHz Streaming
In this mode, the codec sampling clock is set to 48Khz based on the local oscillator. This clock is never changed. The
data from the codec is fed into the input FIFO. Since the sampling clock is asynchronous to the host clock, the amount
of data captured in every USB frame will vary. This issue is left for the host to handle. The input FIFO has two markers,
a low water mark (THRESHOLD_LOW_VAL), and a high water mark (THRESHOLD_HIGH_VAL). There are three reg-
isters to determine how much data to send back in each frame. If the amount of data in the FIFO exceeds the high water
mark, then HI_PKT_SIZE worth of data is sent. If the data is between the high and low water mark, the normal MID_P-
KT_SIZE amount of data is sent. If the data is below the low water mark, LO_PKT_SIZE worth of data is sent.
7.3.1.2        Adaptive OUT 48KHz Streaming
In this mode, the codec sampling clock is initially set to 48Khz based on the local oscillator. The host data is fed into the
OUT FIFO. The host will send the same amount of data on every frame, i.e. 48KHz of data based on the host clock. The
codec sampling clock is asynchronous to the host clock. This will cause the amount of data in the OUT FIFO to vary. If
the amount of data in the FIFO exceeds the high water mark, then the sampling clock is increased. If the data is between
the high and low water mark, the sampling clock does not change. If the data is below the low water mark, the sampling
clock is decreased.
7.3.1.3        Synchronous Operation
For synchronous operation, the internal clock must be synchronized with the host SOF. The Frame SOF is nominally
1mS. Since there is significant jitter in the SOFs, there is circuitry provided to measure the SOFs over a long period of
time to get a more accurate reading. The calculated host frequency is used to calculate the codec sampling clock.

8.0       FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
This section details various USB7056 functions, including:
•   Downstream Battery Charging
•   Port Power Control
•   Power Delivery
•   CC Pin Orientation and Detection
•   PortSplit
•   FlexConnect
•   USB to GPIO Bridging
•   USB to GPIO Bridging
•   USB to I2C Bridging
•   USB to SPI Bridging
•   Link Power Management (LPM)
•   Resets
    Note:     FlexConnect, Mini-host and MHB are not available in the USB7056. The firmware behavior for any of these
              commands is undefined.
8.1        Downstream Battery Charging
The device can be configured by an OEM to have any of the downstream ports support battery charging. The hub’s role
in battery charging is to provide acknowledgment to a device’s query as to whether the hub system supports USB battery
charging. The hub silicon does not provide any current or power FETs or any additional circuitry to actually charge the
device. Those components must be provided externally by the OEM.

If the OEM provides an external supply capable of supplying current per the battery charging specification, the hub can
be configured to indicate the presence of such a supply from the device. This indication, via the PRT_CTLx pins, is on
a per port basis. For example, the OEM can configure two ports to support battery charging through high current power
FETs and leave the other two ports as standard USB ports.
The port control signals are assigned to programmable pins (PFx) and therefore the device must be programmed into
specific configurations to enable the signals. Refer to Section 3.3.4, PF[31:3] Configuration (CFG_STRAP[2:1]) for addi-
tional information.

   Note:     This feature requires an external firmware to work on all the downstream ports. The default ROM will sup-
             port battery charging only on native Type-C/legacy ports.
8.2        Port Power Control
Port power and over-current sense share the same pin (PRT_CTLx) for each port. These functions can be controlled
directly from the USB hub, or via the processor.
   Note:     The PRT_CTLx function is assigned to programmable function pins (PFx) via configuration straps. Refer
             to Section 3.3.4, PF[31:3] Configuration (CFG_STRAP[2:1]) for additional information.
   Note:     The port power control for the USB 2.0 and USB 3.1 portions of a specific port can also be individually con-
             trolled via the PortSplit function. Refer to Section 8.5, PortSplit for additional information.
8.2.1        PORT POWER CONTROL USING USB POWER SWITCH
When operating in combined mode, the device will have one port power control and over-current sense pin for each
downstream port. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a '0'. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation,
the pull-up resistor will be disabled at that time. When port power is enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable
the pull-up resistor, making it an open drain output. If there is an over-current situation, the USB Power Switch will assert
the open drain OCS signal. The Schmidt trigger input will recognize that as a low. The open drain output does not inter-
fere. The over-current sense filter handles the transient conditions such as low voltage while the device is powering up.

8.2.1.1         Port Power Control Using Poly Fuse
When using the device with a poly fuse, there is no need for an output power control. A single port power control and
over-current sense for each downstream port is still used from the Hub's perspective. When disabling port power, the
driver will actively drive a '0'. This will have no effect as the external diode will isolate pin from the load. When port power
is enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable the pull-up resistor. This means that the pull-up resistor is providing
3.3 volts to the anode of the diode. If there is an over-current situation, the poly fuse will open. This will cause the cath-
ode of the diode to go to 0 volts. The anode of the diode will be at 0.7 volts, and the Schmidt trigger input will register
this as a low resulting in an over-current detection. The open drain output does not interfere.

8.3        Power Delivery
Power Delivery (PD) defines a mechanism for USB devices to negotiate for additional current and/or higher or lower
voltages from VBUS than are defined in the original USB 2.0, USB 3.0, or BC 1.2 specifications. The standard allows a
maximum supply of 100 W.
Devices obtain the power required to operate from VBUS and have the ability to negotiate power levels with external
power sources. A half-duplex protocol has been developed for power providers and consumers to negotiate power over
VBUS via a modulation scheme. This serial connection has a data rate of approximately 400 kbps.
USB Power Delivery Specification v3.0 defines a mechanism in which the hub shall support the capability to return the
PD specific capabilities of a device that is attached to any of its PD enabled downstream ports. Therefore, a mechanism
is provided in which the USB7056 is able to extract the capabilities of the device from the port power controller and sup-
ply this information to the hub.
The USB7056 supports USB Power Delivery with up to 100W of power and Alternate Modes on the upstream port.
Downstream port one supports native basic Type-C with integrated CC logic. The USB Power Delivery firmware stack
is executed within the hub and can control a Microchip UPD360/UPD350 (or equivalent) companion Type-C controller.
The downstream Type-C port includes an internal USB 3.1 Gen 1 multiplexer; no external multiplexer is required for
Type-C support.
All Power Delivery messages from the USB Host are handled in firmware. Each PD message is stored in a buffer for
the firmware to read. Responses are sent from a buffer populated by firmware. All PD class-specific requests are sup-
ported (GetBatteryStatus, SetPDFeature) as well as four USB device requests (WRITE_REG, READ_REG,
WRITE_MEM, READ_MEM).
For detailed information on utilizing the Power Delivery feature, refer to the application note “Power Delivery with Micro-
chip USB705x Hubs”, which can be found on the Microchip USB7056 product page at www.microchip.com/USB7056.

                                                                                               USB7056
   Note:     The USB7056 hub internally manages the protocol and policy for each USB Power Delivery port, and con-
             trols external power circuitry via a companion UPD350 controller.
   Note:     The USB7056 requires a serially-connected SPI Flash to contain the application-specific firmware, other-
             wise functions such as Power Delivery will have minimal functionality. Refer to the “Configuration of the
             USB7002/USB705x” application note for additional information.
8.4       CC Pin Orientation and Detection
The device provides CC1 and CC2 pins on all Type-C ports for cable plug orientation and detection of a USB Type-C
receptacle. The device also integrates a comparator and DAC circuit to implement Type-C attach and detach functions,
which supports up to eight programmable thresholds for attach detection between a UFP and DFP. When operating as
a UFP, the device supports detecting changes in the DFP’s advertised thresholds. Default nominal values for the thresh-
olds detected by the CC comparator are:
•  0.20 V
•  0.40 V
•  0.66 V
•  0.80 V
•  1.23 V
•  1.60 V
•  2.60 V
When operating as a DFP, the device implements current sources to advertise current charging capabilities on both CC
pins. When a UFP connection is established, the current driven across the CC pins creates a voltage across the UFP’s
Rd pull-down that can be detected by the integrated CC comparator. When connected to an active cable, an alternative
pull-down, Ra, appears on the CC pin.
When operating as a UFP, the device applies an Rd pull-down on both CC lines and waits for a DFP connection from
the assertion of VBUS. The CC comparator is used to determine the advertised current charger capabilities supported
by the DFP.
VCONN is a 5V supply used to power circuitry in the USB Type-C plug that is required to implement Electronically
Marked Cables. By default the DFP always sources VCONN when connected to an active cable. The USB7056 requires
the use of two external VCONN FETs. The device provides the enables for these FETs, and can detect an OCS by mon-
itoring the output voltage of the FET via the CC pins.
The device also implements a comparator for determining when a VBUS is within a programmed range, vSafe5V or
vSafe0V. VBUS is divided down externally to provide a nominal 3.3V at the VBUS_MON pin. For a DFP, the VBUS com-
parator is useful to detect when VBUS is within the desired range per power delivery negotiations. For a UFP, the VBUS
comparator is utilized to determine when a DFP is attached or detached. It may also use the comparator to determine
when VBUS is within a new voltage range per power delivery negotiations.
   Note:     The native USB Type-C functionality (including CC pin orientation and detection features) is managed
             autonomously by the USB7056.
8.5       PortSplit
The PortSplit feature allows the USB 2.0 and USB 3.1 PHYs associated with any downstream port to be operationally
separated. The intention of this feature is to allow a system designer to connect an embedded USB 3.x device to the
USB 3.1 PHY, while allowing the USB 2.0 PHY to be used as either a standard USB 2.0 port or with a separate embed-
ded USB 2.0 device. PortSplit can be configured via OTP/SMBus. By default, all ports are configured to non-split mode.
When PortSplit is disabled on a specific port, the corresponding PRT_CTLx pin controls both the USB 2.0 and USB 3.1
portions of the port (port power and overcurrent condition). When PortSplit is enabled on a specific port, the corre-
sponding PRT_CTLx pin controls the USB 2.0 portion of the port, and the corresponding PRT_CTLx_U3 pin controls
the USB 3.1 portion of the port.

8.6        FlexConnect
The device allows the upstream port to be swapped with any downstream port, enabling any USB port to assume the
role of USB host at any time during hub operation. This host role exchange feature is called FlexConnect. Additionally,
the USB 2.0 ports can be flexed independently of the USB 3.1 ports.
This functionality can be used in two primary ways:
1.   Host Swapping: This functionality can be achieved through a hub wherein a host and device can agree to swap
     the host/device relationship; The host becomes a device, and the device becomes a host.
2.   Host Sharing: A USB ecosystem can be shared between multiple hosts. Note that only 1 host may access to
     the USB tree at a time.
FlexConnect can be enabled through any of the following three methods:
• I2C Control: The embedded I2C slave can be used to control the state of the FlexConnect feature through basic
   write/read operations.
• USB Command: FlexConnect can be initiated via a special USB command directed to the hub’s internal Hub
   Feature Controller device.
• Direct Pin Control: Any available GPIO pin on the hub can be assigned the role of a FlexConnect control pin.
For detailed information on utilizing the FlexConnect feature, refer to the application note “USB7002/USB705x FlexCon-
nect Operation”, which can be found on the Microchip USB7056 product page at www.microchip.com/USB7056.
8.7        USB to GPIO Bridging
The USB to GPIO bridging feature provides system designers expanded system control and potential BOM reduction.
General Purpose Input/Outputs (GPIOs) may be used for any general 3.3V level digital control and input functions.
Commands may be sent from the USB Host to the internal Hub Feature Controller device in the Microchip hub to per-
form the following functions:
•  Set the direction of the GPIO (input or output)
•  Enable a pull-up resistor
•  Enable a pull-down resistor
•  Read the state
•  Set the state

8.8        USB to I2C Bridging
The USB to I2C bridging feature provides system designers expanded system control and potential BOM reduction. The
use of a separate USB to I2C device is no longer required and a downstream USB port is not lost, as occurs when a
standalone USB to I2C device is implemented.
Commands may be sent from the USB Host to the internal Hub Feature Controller device in the Microchip hub to per-
form the following functions:
•  Configure I2C Pass-Through Interface
•  I2C Write
•  I2C Read

8.11       Resets
The device includes the following chip-level reset sources:
• Power-On Reset (POR)
• External Chip Reset (RESET_N)
• USB Bus Reset
8.11.1        POWER-ON RESET (POR)
A power-on reset occurs whenever power is initially supplied to the device, or if power is removed and reapplied to the
device. A timer within the device will assert the internal reset per the specifications listed in Section 9.6.2, Power-On
and Configuration Strap Timing.
8.11.2        EXTERNAL CHIP RESET (RESET_N)
A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N, after all power supplies are within operating range, per the
specifications in Section 9.6.3, Reset and Configuration Strap Timing. While reset is asserted, the device (and its asso-
ciated external circuitry) enters Standby Mode and consumes minimal current.
Assertion of RESET_N causes the following:
1.   The PHY is disabled and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
2.   All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
3.   All internal registers return to the default state.
4.   The external crystal oscillator is halted.
5.   The PLL is halted.
   Note:      All power supplies must have reached the operating levels mandated in Section 9.2, Operating Condi-
              tions**, prior to (or coincident with) the assertion of RESET_N.
8.11.3        USB BUS RESET
In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the device, the device performs the following:
1.   Sets default address to 0.
2.   Sets configuration to Unconfigured.

9.7       Clock Specifications
The device can accept either a 25MHz crystal or a 25MHz single-ended clock oscillator input. If the single-ended clock
oscillator method is implemented, XTALO should be left unconnected and XTALI/CLK_IN should be driven with a
nominal 0-3.3V clock signal. The input clock duty cycle is 40% minimum, 50% typical and 60% maximum.
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XTALI/XTALO). The following circuit design (Figure 9-6) and specifications (Table 9-9) are required to ensure proper
operation.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO

OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of Micro-
chip devices in life support and/or safety applications is entirely at the buyer’s risk, and the buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
