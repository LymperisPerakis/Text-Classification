NB7NPQ7041M
3.3 V USB 3.1 Quad
Channel / Dual Port Linear
Redriver
Description
   The NB7NPQ7041M is a 3.3 V quad channel / dual port linear                              www.onsemi.com
redriver suitable for USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 applications
that supports both 5 Gbps and 10 Gbps data rates. Signal integrity
degrades from PCB traces, transmission cables, and inter−symbol                                               MARKING
interference (ISI). The NB7NPQ7041M compensates for these losses                                              DIAGRAM
by engaging varying levels of equalization at the input receiver, and flat
gain amplification on the output transmitter. The Flat Gain and                                                  7NPQ
Equalization are controlled by four level control pins. Each channel has                 1                        7041
a set of independent control pins to make signal optimization possible.            X2QFN34                      ALYWG
   After power up, the NB7NPQ7041M periodically checks both of the               CASE 722AL                         G
TX output pairs of each port for a receiver connection. When the receiver

   The NB7NPQ7041M comes in a small 3.1 x 4.3 mm X2QFN34
package and is specified to operate across the entire industrial
temperature range, –40°C to 85°C.                                                     ORDERING INFORMATION

Typical Layout Practices                                                    • RX and TX differential pairs should always be placed
• RX and TX pairs should maintain as close to a 90 W                           and routed on the same layer directly above a ground
   differential impedance as possible.                                         plane. This will help reduce EMI and noise on the data
•  Limit the number of vias used on each data line. It is                      lines.
   suggested that 2 or fewer are used.                                      •  Routing angles should be obtuse angles and kept to 135
•  Traces should be routed as straight and symmetric as                        degrees or larger.
