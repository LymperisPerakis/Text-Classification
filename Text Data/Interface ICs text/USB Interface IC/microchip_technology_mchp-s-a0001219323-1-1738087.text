1.0         INTRODUCTION
1.1         General Description
The USB Type-CTM Specification was introduced in August 2014 and substantially expands the capabilities of USB. The
key new features include:
• New Connector
   - Smaller Form Factor
   - 24 Pins
   - Reversible Insertion
• Simplified Current Capability Marking
   - Resistor-divider implementation instead of DP/DM “handshake”
The Microchip UTC2000 USB Type-C controller targets designers who wish to gain the benefits of the small, reversible
form factor and elevated charging current abilities of a USB Type-C solution while minimally impacting the overall cost
per port.
The UTC2000 USB Type-C controller is a cost-effective, simple solution that facilitates rapid migration of legacy USB
2.0/3.0 designs to the USB Type-C connector. The UTC2000 controller is designed for USB 2.0/3.0 Downstream Facing
Port (DFP) and Upstream Facing Port (UFP) applications and performs all of the necessary detection and control
required for implementing a basic USB Type-C connector. The UTC2000 features ADCs that monitor the CC1 and CC2
pins of the USB Type-C receptacle to detect various connection events.
In a DFP application, passive cables, powered cables, and USB audio adapters can all be detected. Controls for
enabling a USB +5V port power switch, VCONN 5V active cable supply, and audio adapter enable are all included. Addi-
tional features include host enable control and overcurrent detection.
In a UFP application, the UTC2000 detects a valid USB Type-C connection, the plug orientation, and the charging capa-
bility of the DFP. The UTC2000 also monitors VBUS to ensure a valid VBUS range and detected overcurrent.
The UTC2000 can operate from a single 4.5V-5.5V supply and is available in commercial, industrial and extended tem-
perature range options.
1.2         USB Type-CTM Downstream Facing Port (DFP) Implementation Overview
A UTC2000 Implementation of a DFP minimally requires 5 major components/circuitry blocks:
•  Microchip UTC2000
•  A USB 2.0 downstream port (USB 3.0/USB 3.1 may optionally be implemented based upon system requirements)
•  A USB Type-C Receptacle
•  A 5V Port Power Controller capable of supplying the advertised current capability
   (advertised with the value of Rp and the pull-up voltage)
• CC Pin Circuitry:
   - Rp Pull-Up Resistors
   - VCONN Control/Switching
   Note:      A High-Speed or Super Speed USB switch is also recommended but optional. For USB 2.0 applications,
              this component may be omitted. For USB 3.0/USB 3.1 applications, this component may only be omitted
              if two USB 3.0/USB 3.1 downstream ports are dedicated for use on the USB Type-C port.
A system diagram utilizing the UTC2000 in a DFP application is shown in Figure 1-1.

2.2      Pin Descriptions
TABLE 2-2:      PIN DESCRIPTIONS
                                 Buffer
     Name             Symbol                                         Description
                                 Type
                                       Digital Inputs
   Controller         ENABLE       IS    Active high enable signal. The UTC2000 will remain in its
     Enable                              default, inactive state unless this pin is asserted high.
                                         If unused, tie this pin to VDD through a 10kΩ pull-up resistor.
   Fault Input         OCS#        IS    This active low signal is asserted by the +5V VBUS power sup-
                                  (PU)   plying device to notify the UTC2000 when a system fault condi-
                                         tion has occurred. Typically, this signal is used for overcurrent
                                         or overvoltage conditions, but it can be used for any system
                                         related failure.
                                         All digital control outputs will revert to their default, deasserted
                                         state when this pin is asserted. Normal operation will resume
                                         after deassertion of this pin.
                                         After any OCS# assertion, a fault flag will be set and the
                                         FAULT_IND pin will assert. This flag is only cleared after a
                                         device reset or power cycle.
                                         If unused, this pin can be left floating.
                                       Analog Inputs
  Configuration      CFG_SEL      ADC    This analog to digital converter pin is sampled at power-on at
    Selection                            Vcfg_samp to place the UTC2000 in either DFP or UFP mode.
                                         Once in UFP mode, the UTC2000 will always remain in UFP
                                         mode and can only switch to DFP mode after a power-on reset.
                                         Once in DFP mode, the UTC2000 can actively switch between
                                         3.0A, 1.5A, or the default legacy (500mA USB 2.0, 900mA USB
                                         3.0/USB 3.1) DFP modes without power cycling. When switch-
                                         ing between DFP modes, the voltage thresholds and ranges for
                                         connection detection on the CC1/CC2 pins are modified
                                         accordingly.
                                         Refer to Table 3-1 for additional details.
 VBUS Voltage          VMON       ADC    This analog to digital converter pin monitors the input voltage
     Monitor                             on the VBUS pin of the USB receptacle.
                                         The UTC2000 will enter the fault state and deassert all outputs
                                         if the voltage exceeds 0.8V on the VMON pin (>6.4V as deter-
                                         mined by external voltage divider. This threshold can be
                                         changed by the system designer by adjusting the values of the
                                         external voltage divider.).
                                         A fault flag will be set and the FAULT_IND will assert after any
                                         overvoltage occurrence. This flag is only cleared after a device
                                         reset or power cycle.
                                         This pin is required for UFP Modes. If unused in DFP Modes,
                                         tie this pin to GND through a 10kΩ pull‐down resistor.

3.1       Configuration Selection
The CFG_SEL pin is sampled at power-on at Vcfg_samp and the UTC2000 is placed in either UFP or DFP modes of
operation.
If the CFG_SEL pin is within one of the DFP mode ranges upon power-on, it will operate in DFP mode. While in DFP
mode, the CFG_SEL pin is constantly monitored and can be placed in any of the DFP modes at any time by the system
controller. Switching from DFP to UFP modes cannot be achieved without a power-on reset. Table 3-1 displays the volt-
age ranges for the DFP profile.
If the CFG_SEL pin is within the UFP mode range upon power-on, it will operate in UFP mode. For UFP designs, it is
recommended to tie CFG_SEL to VDD through a pull-up resistor to ensure that UFP mode is entered when VDD
crosses the POR threshold. Switching from UFP to DFP modes cannot be achieved without a power-on reset. Table 3-
2 displays the voltage ranges for the UFP profile.

3.2.7        CONNECTED (USB AUDIO ADAPTER)
If ENABLE is asserted high, CFG_SEL is in a valid configuration range, and Ra pull-down resistors are sensed on both
CC1 and CC2 pins the UTC2000 will enter the “CONNECTED (UNFLIPPED ACTIVE CABLE)” state.
   Note:     A typical USB audio adapter device will simply short CC1 and CC2 to ground. This implementation is func-
             tionally equivalent to using two Ra resistors.

3.2.8        FAULT (OVERCURRENT OR OVERVOLTAGE)
If OCS# is asserted low while in any state, the UTC2000 will set all of its outputs to the default state and will transition
into the fault state. An internal overcurrent flag will be set and FAULT_IND will drive high. Normal operation will resume
after OCS# is deasserted. The FAULT_IND pin will continue to drive low until a power cycle occurs.
If VMON exceeds 0.8V at any state, the UTC2000 will set all of its outputs to the default state and will transition into the
fault state. An internal overvoltage flag will be set and FAULT_IND will drive high. Normal operation will resume after
VMON is deasserted. The FAULT_IND pin will continue to drive low until a power cycle occurs.

3.3.8         FAULT (OVERCURRENT OR OVERVOLTAGE)
If OCS# is asserted low while in any state, the UTC2000 will set all of its outputs to the default state and will transition
into the fault state. An internal overcurrent flag will be set and FAULT_IND will drive high. Normal operation will resume
after OCS# is deasserted. The FAULT_IND pin will continue to drive low until a reset or power cycle occurs.
If VMON exceeds 0.8V (6.4V on VBUS) at any state, the UTC2000 will set all of its outputs to the default state and will
transition into the fault state. An internal overvoltage flag will be set and FAULT_IND will drive high. Normal operation
will resume after VMON is deasserted. The FAULT_IND pin will continue to drive low until a reset or power cycle occurs.
3.4       VCONN Supply Control (DFP Modes Only)
VCONN1_OUT# and VCONN2_OUT# are open drain, active low output signals used to control a 5V voltage supply to
power a powered USB Type-C cable. Powered cable support is mandatory for all USB Type-C applications which imple-
ment USB 3.0/USB 3.1. For USB 2.0 systems, powered cable support is optional. The VCONN supply control signals
will assert low when one of the following conditions are met:
• VCONN1_OUT# will assert low if an Rd resistor is detected on CC2 and an Ra resistor is detected on CC1. The
   signal will remain asserted until the Rd resistor on CC2 is no longer sensed (USB cable is detached).
• VCONN2_OUT# will assert low if an Rd resistor is detected on CC1 and an Ra resistor is detected on CC2. The
   signal will remain to asserted until the Rd resistor on CC1 is no longer sensed (USB cable is detached).
3.5       USB Audio Adapter (DFP Modes Only)
   Note:      Additional details for implementing Audio Adapter mode are detailed in Appendix A of the USB Type-CTM
              Cable and Connector Specification.
AUDIO_ADAPTER is an active high output signal that is used to indicate when a USB audio adapter is detected.
AUDIO_ADAPTER will assert high when an Ra resistor is detected on both CC1 and CC2 pins. The signal will remain
asserted until either or both Ra resistors is no longer sensed. This signal is intended to control a high-speed switch that
toggles between USB differential data and an audio signal.The switch that is selected must be capable of supporting
USB 2.0 as well as audio signals ranging from -3.0V to +3.0V. Additional electrical details can be found in section A-3
of the USB Type-CTM Cable and Connector Specification.

UTC2000
Two additional signals are also used when operating in Audio Adapter mode. These signals are Mic/AGND and AGND/
Mic which should be connected to SBU1 and SBU2 respectively.
3.6       UFP Mode Connection and Charging Capability Detection Indicator
While operating in UFP mode, there are 4 outputs that indicate connection state.
CONNECTED# is an open drain output that asserts when any of the three valid USB Type-C connections are detected.
Legacy charging mode (500mA for USB 2.0 connections, 900mA for USB 3.0/USB 3.1 connections) is detected when
a DFP with a 56k Rp pull-up resistor is detected. 1.5A charging is detected when a DFP with a 22k Rp pull-up resistor
is detected. 3.0A charging is detected when a DFP with a 10k Rp pull-up resistor is detected.
The LEGACY_IND#, 1.5A_IND#, and 3.0A_IND# open drain outputs assert low to indicate which type of connection
was detected. These outputs can be fed to the battery charging management circuitry of the USB device to appropriately
regulate the amount of current draw.
The CONNECTED# signal may also be used to gate the VBUS voltage to system power if an added level of protection
from high voltage is desired.
3.7       Connection and Disconnection Detection Debounce
A debounce is implemented to eliminate unwanted connect/disconnect events due to cable jostling or USB Power Deliv-
ery messaging.
A transition from the ENABLED IDLE state to any connected state is debounced by 100ms-200ms.
A transition from any connected state to any other connected state or from any connected state to the ENABLED IDLE
state is debounced by 10ms-20ms.

5.1       5V VBUS Switch (DFP Modes Only)
A 5V USB port power switch with active high enable input and an overcurrent indicator output is required. The USB
Type-C receptacle must not supply 5V to the VBUS pins until a valid connection is detected. The UTC2000 controller
asserts the active high PPC_EN signal to control the 5V port power supply to VBUS upon detection of a valid USB Type-
C connection. The port power switch controlled by the UTC2000 shall also have built in overcurrent detection set to a
threshold that is appropriate for the current capability profile that is being selected per Table 5-1. An overcurrent thresh-
old of 125% (of the selected DFP profile current) is appropriate, as the threshold may not be tripped at any current less
than or equal to the selected current profile. The 5V VBUS port power controller should indicate that an overcurrent
event has occurred by pulling the OCS# signal to the UTC2000 controller low.
5.2       Rp Pull-Up Resistor (DFP Modes Only)
A Downstream Facing Port is required to supply voltage to both CC pins through a pull-up resistor. The pull-up voltage
may be either 5.0V volts or 3.3V. A UFP must implement a Rd pull-down resistor to ground. When a DFP to UFP con-
nection is made, a resistor divider is formed, and the voltage at the CC pin can be measured to interpret the type of
connection. Table 5-1 describes the possible values of the Rp pull-up resistor.
  Note:     A constant current source may also be implemented instead of a pull-up resistor.

The UTC2000 measures the voltages on both CC pins via it’s internal ADCs. The CC pin voltage ranges, as defined in
the USB Type-CTM Cable and Connector Specification, are shown in Table 3-1.
5.3       Rd Pull-Down Resistor (UFP Mode Only)
An Upstream Facing Port is required to implement a 5.1k +/- 10% Rd pull-down resistor to ground connected to both
CC1 and CC2 pins on the Type-C receptacle. When a DFP to UFP connection is made, a resistor divider is formed, and
the voltage at the CC pin can be measured to interpret the charging capability of the DFP.

5.4         VCONN Active Cable Supply (DFP Modes Only)
All USB Type-C receptacles must be able to supply power to an active cable if USB 3.0/USB 3.1 signaling is imple-
mented. Supplying VCONN is optional if only USB 2.0 is implemented. The simplest implementation is to add a FET (or
series of FETs) that switches in the VCONN voltage directly to the CC pin node. The VCONN supply must be capable
of supplying 1.0W of continuous power and may not supply more than 1.25A at the moment of plug contact. A bulk
capacitance of 10µF to 220µF must also be switched in with VCONN. The bulk capacitance may not need to be a dis-
crete capacitor if the supply’s output capacitance already meets this requirement. Overcurrent detection is recom-
mended, but not required per the USB Type-CTM Cable and Connector Specification. A simple implementation example
is shown in Figure 5-1 below.
   Note:       Rds_on must be carefully considered to ensure that the USB Type-CTM Cable and Connector Specification
               requirements for VCONN supply current and voltage range are met.

   Note:       It is also recommended to implement additional circuitry to make the CC1 and CC2 pins high impedance
               when the DFP is in an unpowered state. Refer to Figure 5-7 for an example.
5.5         CC Pin Isolation (DFP Only)
The CC pins on a DFP must be high-impedance when the DFP is powered off. This is to prevent VBUS backdrive in a
situation when a DFP connects to an unpowered DFP and detects the Rp pull-up resistors as an Rd pull-down. There-
fore, it is recommended that some isolation FETs are implemented that disconnect the CC pins from the Rp pull-up resis-
tors and VCONN supply circuitry when powered off.
5.6         CC Pin Current Limiting Resistors (UFP Only)
Because most UFP designs require operation even when unpowered, resistors placed directly in front of the CC1 and
CC2 pins are recommended to limit the amount of leakage current through the UTC2000 ADC inputs when unpowered.
10kΩ resistors are the recommended value.
Failure to place current limiting resistors could result in a failure to detect a USB attach due to a shift in CC voltage.

5.7       VBUS Monitoring
DFP Modes: An optional VBUS monitoring function may be implemented to protect the system from higher than
expected voltages on VBUS (from a malfunctioning connected USB device) by preventing the UTC2000 from enabling
the 5V port switch. Additional back-drive protection or isolation circuitry must be implemented for thorough protection.
This feature requires the VMON pin to be connected to VBUS through a resistor divider network that divides the VBUS
voltage by a factor of 8. A 35.7kΩ resistor over a 5.1kΩ resistor is recommended, as shown in the Figure 5-7, Figure 5-
8, and Figure 5-9 below.
UFP Mode: The VBUS monitoring function is required and used to verify a valid VBUS range before asserting the CON-
NECTED pin or any charge capability indicator outputs. A fault condition will also be flagged if higher than expected
voltage on VBUS (from a malfunctioning connected USB device) is detected. Additional back-drive protection or isola-
tion circuitry must be implemented for thorough protection. This features requires the VMON pin to be connected to
VBUS through a resistor divider network that divides the VBUS voltage by a factor of 8.
5.8       USB Signal Multiplexer
There are several options for connecting the USB signals to the USB Type-C receptacles. These options differ slightly
between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0/USB 3.1 applications, as detailed in the following sub-sections.
5.8.1         USB 2.0 OPTION 1: HIGH-SPEED MULTIPLEXER/SWITCH
The most robust solution for USB 2.0 applications is to use a USB High-Speed switch to control the routing of the USB
signals. The Microchip USB3740 is a cost-effective solution for this purpose and offers several benefits:
•  Extreme ESD: +- 15KV (IEC)
•  Low Power: 5uA(on), 1uA (off)
•  Off Isolation: less than -40dB
•  High bandwidth: up to 1 GHz
•  Preserves signal integrity
•  Small Package: 1.3 x 1.8 mm – 10pin DFN (.4mm pitch)

5.8.2        USB 2.0 OPTION 2: SHORT DP/DM PINS TOGETHER
The simplest solution is to short together the DP / DM pins at the receptacle. Only one DP / DM pair at the connector
will be active at once. Note that this implementation will negatively affect the integrity of the USB signals because of the
creation of stubs on the USB traces.

  Note:          The pass FET and current sense circuitry connected to VBUS are for high voltage protection and are
                 optional. If high voltage protection is required and the device is bus powered or battery powered (and may
                 have a dead battery), a high voltage tolerant regulator must also be implemented to power the UTC2000
                 while it qualifies the USB Type-C connection.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be super-
    seded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO REP-
