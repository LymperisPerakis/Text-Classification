USB DEVICE CONTROLLER
            The USB Device Controller is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 Specification, enabling the device to
            operate in Hi-Speed (480 Mbps) mode. An integrated USB 2.0 PHY is provided on the USB port.
            The controller implements three USB endpoints: Control, Bulk-Out, and Interrupt-In. The Bulk-Out
            endpoint allows for uncompressed or compressed graphics data reception from the USB port. The USB
            Bulk-Out Controller collects the graphics information and transfers it to the Graphics Engine.
            Implementation of vendor-specific commands allows for access to the device System Control and
            Status Registers (SCSRs).

USB 2.0 Hi-Speed Graphics Controller with VGA, HDMI/DVI, and Digital RGB Interfaces
USB GRAPHICS ADAPTER
                The USB Graphics Adapter consists of the following main blocks: the Graphics Engine, Display
                Controller, HDMI/DVI Controller/PHY, Video DAC, and the Digital RGB Interface. Together, these
                blocks support high definition resolutions of up to 2048x1152 (QWXGA) with 32-bit true color in both
                standard and wide screen aspect ratios. The HDMI/DVI interface is compliant with the HDMI v1.3 and
                DVI v1.0 specifications and supports 2-channel uncompressed PCM audio via a S/PDIF or I2S input.
                The Display Controller also supports 8-bit and 16-bit color, gamma correction, Color Look-Up Table
                (CLUT) and triple-buffered animation. The DDC2B/EDID VESA standard is supported, allowing the
                host OS and device drivers to query the monitor’s frequency, resolution, and other features for true
                plug-and-play and intelligent mode setting capabilities.
                Once the graphics data has been received via the USB Bulk-Out Controller, it is sent to the Graphics
                Engine. If the data is compressed, the Graphics Engine decompresses it via algorithms that have been
                optimized for speed and quality. The device’s decompression algorithms have been designed to work
                seamlessly with the compression algorithms utilized in the software device drivers.
                The graphics data is then transferred to the SDRAM via the DDR2 SDRAM Controller. The Display
                Controller generates all display and interface timing signals, retrieves the graphics data from the DDR2
                SDRAM, and sends it to the HDMI/DVI Controller/PHY, Video DAC, or Digital RGB Interface.
                The Digital RGB Interface may be used to connect external display interface IC’s (e.g., DisplayPort,
                etc.) via the provided RGB data channel busses and control signals. The Digital RGB Interface
                supports two modes of operation: 24-bit single data rate mode and 12/15-bit double data rate mode.
                24-bit mode is single edge triggered and utilizes the full 24-bit data bus width. The 12/15-bit mode is
                triggered on both clock edges and utilizes 12/15-bits of the data bus width.
DDR2 SDRAM INTERFACE
                The UFX6000 provides a full JEDEC compliant (JESD79-2E) DDR2 SDRAM Controller and PHY for
                interfacing to external DDR2 SDRAM. The DDR2 SDRAM interface is comprised of JEDEC standard
                1.8V I/O signals grouped into control signals, a 16-bit data bus, and a 13-bit address bus.
                The DDR2 SDRAM Controller transfers the graphics data in and out of external SDRAM through the
                DDR2 SDRAM PHY. External SDRAM is used as storage for the graphics and acts a a buffer between
                the Graphics Engine and Display Controller.
PERIPHERALS
                The UFX6000 also contains an EEPROM Controller, I2C Controller, and TAP Controller.
                The EEPROM Controller allows connection to an external EEPROM for automatic loading of static
                configuration data upon power-on, pin reset, or software reset. The EEPROM can be configured to
                load USB descriptors and USB device configuration.
                The integrated IEEE 1149.1 compliant TAP controller provides boundary scan via JTAG.

                Notes:
                1. All dimensions are in millimeters.
                2.   Dimension “b” is measured at the maximum ball diameter, parallel to primary datum “C”.
                3.   Primary datum “C” (seating plane) is defined by the spherical crowns of the contact balls.
                4.   The ball A1 identifier may vary, but is always located within the zone indicated.
                5.   Dimension “A” does not include attached external features, such as heat sink or chip capacitors.
                6.   The package ball solderable surface is Solder-Mask-Defined (SMD) type.
