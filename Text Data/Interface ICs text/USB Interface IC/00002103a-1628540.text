USB3500
1.0      GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The USB3500 is a stand-alone Hi-Speed USB Physical Layer Transceiver (PHY). The USB3500 uses a UTMI+ interface
to connect to an SOC or FPGA or custom ASIC. The USB3500 provides a flexible alternative to integrating the analog
PHY block for new designs.

The USB3500 provides a fully compliant USB 2.0 interface, and supports High-Speed (HS), Full-Speed (FS), and Low-
Speed (LS) USB. The USB3500 supports all levels of the UTMI+ specification as shown in Figure 1-2.
The USB3500 can also, as an option, fully support the On-the-Go (OTG) protocol defined in the On-The-Go Supplement
to the USB 2.0 Specification. On-the-Go allows the Link to dynamically configure the USB3500 as host or peripheral
configured dynamically by software. For example, a cell phone may connect to a computer as a peripheral to exchange
address information or connect to a printer as a host to print pictures. Finally the OTG enabled device can connect to
another OTG enabled device to exchange information. All this is supported using a single low profile Mini-AB USB con-
nector.
Designs not needing OTG can ignore the OTG feature set.

   Note:    Stresses above those listed could cause damage to the device. This is a stress rating only and functional
            operation of the device at any other condition above those indicated in the operation sections of this spec-
            ification is not implied. When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important
            that the Absolute Maximum Ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies
            exhibit voltage spikes on their outputs when the AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage tran-
            sients on the AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested that a
            clamp circuit be used.

USB3500
5.0      DETAILED FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
FIGURE 2-1: on page 5 shows the functional block diagram of the USB3500. Each of the functions is described in detail
below.
5.1      8bit Bi-Directional Data Bus Operation
The USB3500 supports an 8-bit bi-directional parallel interface.
• CLKOUT runs at 60MHz
• The 8-bit data bus (DATA[7:0]) is used for transmit when TXVALID = 1
• The 8-bit data bus (DATA[7:0]) is used for receive when TXVALID = 0
Figure 5-1 shows the relationship between CLKOUT and the transmit data transfer signals in FS mode. TXREADY is
only asserted for one CLKOUT per byte time to signal the Link that the data on the DATA lines has been read by the
PHY. The Link may hold the data on the DATA lines for the duration of the byte time. Transitions of TXVALID must meet
the defined setup and hold times relative to CLKOUT.
FIGURE 5-1:             FS CLK RELATIONSHIP TO TRANSMIT DATA AND CONTROL SIGNALS
Figure 5-2 shows the relationship between CLKOUT and the receive data control signals in FS mode. RXACTIVE
“frames” a packet, transitioning only at the beginning and end of a packet. However transitions of RXVALID may take
place any time 8 bits of data are available. Figure 5-2 also shows how RXVALID is only asserted for one CLKOUT cycle
per byte time even though the data may be presented for the full byte time. The XCVRSELECT signal determines
whether the HS or FS timing relationship is applied to the data and control signals.

                                                                                                USB3500
5.2        TX Logic
This block receives parallel data bytes placed on the DATA bus and performs the necessary transmit operations. These
operations include parallel to serial conversion, bit stuffing and NRZI encoding. Upon valid assertion of the proper TX
control lines by the Link and TX State Machine, the TX LOGIC block will synchronously shift, at either the FS or HS rate,
the data to the FS/HS TX block to be transmitted on the USB cable. Data transmit timing is shown in Figure 5-3.
FIGURE 5-3:             TRANSMIT TIMING FOR A DATA PACKET
The behavior of the Transmit State Machine is described below.
• The Link asserts TXVALID to begin a transmission.
• After the Link asserts TXVALID it can assume that the transmission has started when it detects TXREADY has
  been asserted.
• The Link must assume that the USB3500 has consumed a data byte if TXREADY and TXVALID are asserted on
  the rising edge of CLKOUT.
• The Link must have valid packet information (PID) asserted on the DATA bus coincident with the assertion of
  TXVALID.
• TXREADY is sampled by the Link on the rising edge of CLKOUT.
• The Link negates TXVALID to complete a packet. Once negated, the transmit logic will never reassert TXREADY
  until after the EOP has been generated. (TXREADY will not re-assert until TXVALD asserts again.)
• The USB3500 is ready to transmit another packet immediately. However, the Link must conform to the minimum
  inter-packet delays identified in the USB 2.0 specification.
• Supports high speed disconnect detect through the HOSTDISC pin. In Host mode the USB3500 will sample the
  disconnect comparator at the 32nd bit of the 40 bit long EOP during SOF packets.
• Supports FS pre-amble for FS hubs with a LS device.
• Supports LS keep alive by receiving the SOF PID.
• Supports Host mode resume K which ends with two low speed times of SE0 followed by 1 FS “J”.

USB3500
5.3        RX Logic
This block receives serial data from the clock recovery circuits and processes it to be transferred to the Link on the DATA
bus. The processing involved includes NRZI decoding, bit unstuffing, and serial to parallel conversion. Upon valid asser-
tion of the proper RX control lines, the RX Logic block will provide bytes to the DATA bus as shown in the figures below.
The behavior of the receiver is described below.
FIGURE 5-4:               RECEIVE TIMING FOR DATA WITH UNSTUFFED BITS
The assertion of RESET will cause the USB3500 to deasserts RXACTIVE and RXVALID. When the RESET signal is
deasserted the Receive State Machine starts looking for a SYNC pattern on the USB. When a SYNC pattern is detected,
the receiver will assert RXACTIVE. The length of the received Hi-Speed SYNC pattern varies and can be up to 32 bits
long or as short as 12 bits long when at the end of five hubs.
After valid serial data is received, the data is loaded into the RX Holding Register on the rising edge of CLKOUT, and
RXVALID is asserted. The Link must read the DATA bus on the next rising edge of CLKOUT. In normal mode (OPMODE
= 00), then stuffed bits are stripped from the data stream. Each time 8 stuffed bits are accumulated the USB3500 will
negate RXVALID for one clock cycle, thus skipping a byte time.
When the EOP is detected the USB3500 will negate RXACTIVE and RXVALID. After the EOP has been stripped, the
USB3500 will begin looking for the next packet.
The behavior of the USB3500 receiver is described below:
•  RXACTIVE and RXREADY are sampled on the rising edge of CLKOUT.
•  After a EOP is complete the receiver will begin looking for SYNC.
•  The USB3500 asserts RXACTIVE when SYNC is detected.
•  The USB3500 negates RXACTIVE when an EOP is detected and the elasticity buffer is empty.
•  When RXACTIVE is asserted, RXVALID will be asserted if the RX Holding Register is full.
•  RXVALID will be negated if the RX Holding Register was not loaded during the previous byte time. This will occur
   if 8 stuffed bits have been accumulated.
• The Link must be ready to consume a data byte if RXACTIVE and RXVALID are asserted (RX Data state).
• Figure 5-5 shows the timing relationship between the received data (DP/DM), RXVALID, RXACTIVE, RXERROR
   and DATA signals.
   Note:
• Figure 5-5, Figure 5-6 and Figure 5-7 are timing examples of a HS/FS PHY when it is in HS mode. When a
   HS/FS PHY is in FS Mode there are approximately 40 CLKOUT cycles every byte time. The Receive State
   Machine assumes that the Link captures the data on the DATA bus if RXACTIVE and RXVALID are asserted. In
   FS mode, RXVALID will only be asserted for one CLKOUT per byte time.
• In Figure 5-5, Figure 5-6 and Figure 5-7 the SYNC pattern on DP/DM is shown as one byte long. The SYNC pat-
   tern received by a device can vary in length. These figures assume that all but the last 12 bits have been con-
   sumed by the hubs between the device and the host controller.

5.4       USB 2.0 Transceiver
The Microchip Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceiver consists of four blocks in the lower left corner of FIGURE 2-1: on page 5.
These four blocks are labeled HS XCVR, FS/LS XCVR, Resistors, and Bias Gen.
5.4.1       HIGH SPEED AND FULL SPEED TRANSCEIVERS
The USB3500 transceiver meets all requirements in the USB 2.0 specification.
The receivers connect directly to the USB cable. This block contains a separate differential receiver for HS and FS
mode. Depending on the mode, the selected receiver provides the serial data stream through the multiplexer to the RX
Logic block. The FS mode section of the FS/HS RX block also consists of a single-ended receiver on each of the data
lines to determine the correct FS linestate. For HS mode support, the FS/HS RX block contains a squelch circuit to
insure that noise is never interpreted as data.
The transmitters connect directly to the USB cable. The block contains a separate differential FS and HS transmitter
which receive encoded, bit stuffed, serialized data from the TX Logic block and transmit it on the USB cable.
5.4.2       TERMINATION RESISTORS
The USB3500 transceiver fully integrates all of the USB termination resistors. The USB3500 includes two 1.5kΩ pull-
up resistors on DP and DM and a 15kΩ pull-down resistor on both DP and DM. In addition the 45Ω high speed termi-
nation resistors are also integrated. These integrated resistors require no tuning or trimming by the Link. The state of
the resistors is determined by the operating mode of the PHY. The possible valid resistor combinations are shown in
Table 5-1. The RESISTOR SETTINGS signals shown in the table are internal to the USB3500.

USB3500
5.5        Crystal Oscillator and PLL
The USB3500 uses an internal crystal driver and PLL sub-system to provide a clean 480MHz reference clock that is
used by the PHY during both transmit and receive. The USB3500 requires a clean 24MHz crystal or clock as a frequency
reference. If the 24MHz reference is noisy or off frequency the PHY may not operate correctly.
The USB3500 can use either a crystal or an external clock oscillator for the 24MHz reference. The crystal is connected
to the XI and XO pins as shown in the application diagram, Figure 6-10. If a clock oscillator is used, the clock should be
connected to the XI input and the XO pin left floating. When using an external clock, the clock source must be clean so
it does not degrade performance, and should be driven with a 0 to 3.3 volt signal.
After the 480MHz PLL has locked to the correct frequency, it will drive the CLKOUT pin with a 60MHz clock. The
USB3500 is ensured to start the clock within the time specified in Table 4-2.
5.6        Internal Regulators and POR
The USB3500 includes integrated power management functions to reduce the bill of materials and simplify product
design.
5.6.1        INTERNAL REGULATORS
The USB3500 has two internal regulators that create two 1.8V outputs (labeled VDD1.8 and VDDA1.8) from the 3.3 volt
power supply input (VDD3.3). Each regulator requires an external 4.7uF +/-20% low ESR bypass capacitor to ensure
stability. X5R or X7R ceramic capacitors are recommended since they exhibit an ESR lower that 0.1ohm at frequencies
greater than 10kHz.
The specific capacitor recommendations for each pin are detailed in Table 2.1, "USB3500 Pin Locations", and shown in
Figure 6-10, "USB3500 Application Diagram (Top View)".
   Note:     The USB3500 regulators are designed to generate a 1.8volt supply for the USB3500 only. Using the reg-
             ulators to provide current for other circuits is not recommended and Microchip does not ensure USB per-
             formance or regulator stability in this case.
5.6.2        POWER ON RESET (POR)
The USB3500 provides an internal POR circuit that generates a reset pulse once the PHY supplies are stable. The
UTMI+ Digital can be reset at any time with the RESET pin.
5.7        USB On-The-Go (OTG) Module
The USB3500 provides support for USB OTG. This mode allows the USB3500 to be dynamically configured as a host
or a device depending on the type of cable inserted into the Mini-AB connector. When the Mini-A plug of a cable is
inserted into the Mini-AB connector the USB device becomes the A-device. When a Mini-B plug is inserted the device
becomes the B-device. The OTG A-device behaves similar to a Host while the B-device behaves similar to a peripheral.
The differences are covered in the OTG supplement.
The OTG Module meets all the requirements in the “On-The-Go Supplement to the USB 2.0 Specification”. In applica-
tions where only Host or Device is required, the OTG Module is unused.

                                                  OTG Module
The OTG Module can be broken into 4 main blocks; ID Detection, VBUS Control, Driving External VBUS, and External
VBUS Detection. Each of these blocks is covered in the sections below.
5.7.1       ID DETECTION
The USB3500 provides an ID pin to determine the type of USB cable connected. When the Mini-A Plug of a USB cable
is inserted into the Mini-AB connector, the ID pin is shorted to ground. When the Mini-B Plug is inserted into the Mini-
AB connector, the ID pin is allowed to float.

The USB3500 provides an integrated pull-up resistor to pull the ID pin to VDD3.3 when a Mini-B plug is inserted and
the cable is floating. When a Mini-A plug is connected, the pull-up resistor will be overpowered and the ID pin will be
brought to ground. To save current when a Mini-A Plug is inserted, the ID pull-up resistor can be disabled by clearing
the IDPULLUP pin. To prevent the ID pin from floating to a random value, a weak pull-up resistor is provided at all times.
The circuits related to the ID comparator are shown in Figure 5-8 and their related parameters are shown in Table 4-7.

5.7.2         VBUS CONTROL
The USB3500 includes all of the Vbus comparators required for OTG. The VbusVld, SessVld, and SessEnd compara-
tors are fully integrated into the USB3500. These comparators are used to ensure the Vbus voltage is the correct value
for proper USB operation.
The VbusVld comparator is used by the Link, when configured as an A device, to ensure that the Vbus voltage on the
cable is valid. The SessVld comparator is used by the Link when configured as either an A or B device to indicate a
session is requested or valid. Finally the SessEnd comparator is used by the B-device to indicate a USB session has
ended.
Also included in the VBUS Control block are the resistors used for VBUS pulsing in SRP. The resistors used for VBUS
pulsing include a pull-down to ground and a pull-up to VDD3.3.
5.7.2.1         SessEnd Comparator
The SessEnd comparator is designed to trip when Vbus is less than 0.5 volts. When Vbus goes below 0.5 volts, the
session is considered to be ended and SessEnd will transition from 0 to 1. The SessEnd comparator is disabled when
the Suspendn = 0. When disabled, the SessEnd output is 0. The SessEnd comparator trip points are detailed in Table 4-
7.
5.7.2.2         SessVld Comparator
The SessVld comparator is used when the PHY is configured as either an A or B device. When configured as an A
device, the SessVld is used to detect Session Request protocol (SRP). When configured as a B device, SessVld is used
to detect the presence of Vbus. The SessVld comparator is not disabled with Suspendn and its output will always reflect
the state of VBUS. The SessVld comparator trip point is detailed in Table 4-7.
   Note:      The OTG Supplement specifies a voltage range for A-Device Session Valid and B-Device Session Valid
              comparator. The USB3500 PHY combines the two comparators into one and uses the narrower threshold
              range.
5.7.2.3         VbusVld Comparator
The final Vbus comparator is the VbusVld comparator. This comparator is only used when configured as an A-device.
In the OTG protocol the A-device is responsible to ensure that the VBUS voltage is within a certain range. The VbusVld
comparator is disabled when Suspendn = 0. When disabled the VbusVld will read 0. The VbusVld comparator trip points
are detailed in Table 4-7.
When the A-device is able to provide 8-100mA, it must ensure Vbus doesn’t go below 4.4 volts. If the A-device can pro-
vide 100-500mA on VBUS, it must ensure that Vbus does not go below 4.75 volts.
The internal Vbus comparator is designed to ensure that Vbus remains above 4.4 volts. If the design is required to sup-
ply over 100mA an external Vbus comparator or overcurrent fault detection should be used.
5.7.2.4         Vbus Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors
In addition to the internal Vbus comparators, the USB3500 also includes the integrated VBUS pull-up and pull-down
resistors used for VBUS Pulsing. To discharge the VBUS voltage, so that a Session Request can begin, the USB3500
provides a pull-down resistor from VBUS to Ground. This resistor is controlled by the DISCHRGVBUS pin. The pull-up
resistor is connected between VBUS and VDD3.3. This resistor is used to pull Vbus above 2.1 volts to indicate to the
A-Device that a USB session has been requested. The state of the pull-up resistor is controlled by the CHRGVBUS pin.
The Pull-Up and Pull-Down resistor values are detailed in Table 4-7.
5.7.2.5         Vbus Input Impedance
The OTG Supplement requires an A-Device that supports Session request protocol to have an input impedance less
than 100kohm and greater the 40kohm to ground. In addition, if configured as a B-Device, the PHY cannot draw more
then 150uA from Vbus. The USB3500 provides a 75kΩ nominal resistance to ground which meets the above require-
ments.

6.0        APPLICATION NOTES
The following sections consist of select functional explanations to aid in implementing the USB3500 into a system. For
complete description and specifications consult the USB 2.0 Transceiver Macrocell Interface Specification and Univer-
sal Serial Bus Specification Revision 2.0.
6.1        Linestate
The voltage thresholds that the LINESTATE[1:0] signals use to reflect the state of DP and DM depend on the state of
XCVRSELECT. LINESTATE[1:0] uses HS thresholds when the HS transceiver is enabled (XCVRSELECT = 0) and FS
thresholds when the FS transceiver is enabled (XCVRSELECT = 1). There is not a concept of variable single-ended
thresholds in the USB 2.0 specification for HS mode.
The HS receiver is used to detect Chirp J or K, where the output of the HS receiver is always qualified with the Squelch
signal. If squelched, the output of the HS receiver is ignored. In the USB3500, as an alternative to using variable thresh-
olds for the single-ended receivers, the following approach is used. In HS device mode, 3ms of no USB activity (IDLE
state) signals a reset. The Link monitors LINESTATE[1:0] for the IDLE state. To minimize transitions on LINESTATE[1:0]
while in HS mode, the presence of !Squelch is used to force LINESTATE[1:0] to a J state.

6.2        OPMODES
The OPMODE[1:0] pins allow control of the operating modes.

                                         the USB making it appear to an upstream port that the device has been

        11        Reserved               N/A
The OPMODE[1:0] signals are normally changed only when the transmitter and the receiver are quiescent, i.e. when
entering a test mode or for a device initiated resume.
When using OPMODE[1:0] = 10, the SYNC and EOP patterns are not transmitted.
The only exception to this is when OPMODE[1:0] is set to 10 while TXVALID has been asserted (the transceiver is trans-
mitting a packet), in order to flag a transmission error. In this case, the USB3500 has already transmitted the SYNC
pattern so upon negation of TXVALID the EOP must also be transmitted to properly terminate the packet. Changing the
OPMODE[1:0] signals under all other conditions (while the transceiver is transmitting or receiving data) will generate
undefined results.

6.4        SE0 Handling
For FS operation, IDLE is a J state on the bus. SE0 is used as part of the EOP or to indicate reset. When asserted in
an EOP, SE0 is never asserted for more than 2 bit times. The assertion of SE0 for more than 2.5us is interpreted as a
reset by the device operating in FS mode.
For HS operation, IDLE is a SE0 state on the bus. SE0 is also used to reset a HS device. A HS device cannot use the
2.5us assertion of SE0 (as defined for FS operation) to indicate reset since the bus is often in this state between packets.
If no bus activity (IDLE) is detected for more than 3ms, a HS device must determine whether the downstream facing
port is signaling a suspend or a reset. The following section details how this determination is made. If a reset is signaled,
the HS device will then initiate the HS Detection Handshake protocol.

6.5       Reset Detection
If a device in HS mode detects bus inactivity for more than 3ms (T1), it reverts to FS mode. This enables the FS pull-up
on the DP line in an attempt to assert a continuous FS J state on the bus. The Link must then check LINESTATE for the
SE0 condition. If SE0 is asserted at time T2, then the upstream port is forcing the reset state to the device (i.e., a Driven
SE0). The device will then initiate the HS detection handshake protocol.

                      state. The device now enters the HS Detection
                      Handshake protocol.

6.6         Suspend Detection
If a HS device detects SE0 asserted on the bus for more than 3ms (T1), it reverts to FS mode. This enables the FS pull-
up on the DP line in an attempt to assert a continuous FS J state on the bus. The Link must then check LINESTATE for
the J condition. If J is asserted at time T2, then the upstream port is asserting a soft SE0 and the USB is in a J state
indicating a suspend condition. By time T4 the device must be fully suspended.

                         then the initial SE0 on the bus (T0 - T1) had      T1 + 875µs
                         been due to a Suspend state and the Link
                         remains in HS mode.

                         suspended, drawing no more than the suspend
                         current from the bus.
6.7         HS Detection Handshake
The downstream facing port asserting an SE0 state on the bus initiates the HS Detection Handshake.
There are three ways in which a device may enter the HS Handshake Detection process:
1.    If the device is suspended and it detects an SE0 state on the bus it may immediately enter the HS handshake
      detection process.
2.    If the device is in FS mode and an SE0 state is detected for more than 2.5µs. it may enter the HS handshake
      detection process.
3.    If the device is in HS mode and an SE0 state is detected for more than 3.0ms. it may enter the HS handshake
      detection process. In HS mode, a device must first determine whether the SE0 state is signaling a suspend or a
      reset condition. To do this the device reverts to FS mode by placing XCVRSELECT and TERMSELECT into FS

      detected the device will enter a suspend state. If an SE0 state is detected, then the device will enter the HS Hand-
      shake detection process.
In each case, the assertion of the SE0 state on the bus initiates the reset. The minimum reset interval is 10ms. Depend-
ing on the previous mode that the bus was in, the delay between the initial assertion of the SE0 state and entering the
HS Handshake detection can be from 0 to 4ms.
This transceiver design pushes as much of the responsibility for timing events on to the Link as possible, and the Link
requires a stable CLKOUT signal to perform accurate timing. In case 2 and 3 above, CLKOUT has been running and is
stable, however in case 1 the USB3500 is reset from a suspend state, and the internal oscillator and clocks of the trans-
ceiver are assumed to be powered down. A device has up to 6ms after the release of SUSPENDN to assert a minimum
of a 1ms Chirp K.
6.8       HS Detection Handshake – FS Downstream Facing Port
Upon entering the HS Detection process (T0), XCVRSELECT and TERMSELECT are in FS mode. The DP pull-up is
asserted and the HS terminations are disabled. The Link then sets OPMODE to Disable Bit Stuffing and NRZI encoding,
XCVRSELECT to HS mode, and begins the transmission of all 0's data, which asserts a HS K (chirp) on the bus (T1).
The device chirp must last at least 1.0ms, and must end no later than 7.0ms after HS Reset T0. At time T1 the device
begins listening for a chirp sequence from the host port.
If the downstream facing port is not HS capable, then the HS K asserted by the device is ignored and the alternating
sequence of HS Chirp K’s and J’s is not generated. If no chirps are detected (T4) by the device, it will enter FS mode
by returning XCVRSELECT to FS mode.

6.9       HS Detection Handshake – HS Downstream Facing Port
Upon entering the HS Detection process (T0), XCVRSELECT and TERMSELECT are in FS mode. The DP pull-up is
asserted and the HS terminations are disabled. The Link then sets OPMODE to Disable Bit Stuffing and NRZI encoding,
XCVRSELECT to HS mode, and begins the transmission of all 0's data, which asserts a HS K (chirp) on the bus (T1).
The device chirp must last at least 1.0ms, and must end no later than 7.0ms after HS Reset T0. At time T1 the device
begins listening for a chirp sequence from the downstream facing port. If the downstream facing port is HS capable,
then it will begin generating an alternating sequence of Chirp K’s and Chirp J’s (T3) after the termination of the chirp
from the device (T2). After the device sees the valid chirp sequence Chirp K-J-K-J-K-J (T6), it will enter HS mode by
setting TERMSELECT to HS mode (T7).
Figure 6-4 provides a state diagram for Chirp K-J-K-J-K-J validation. Prior to the end of reset (T9) the device port must
terminate the sequence of Chirp K’s and Chirp J’s (T8) and assert SE0 (T8-T9). Note that the sequence of Chirp K’s
and Chirp J’s constitutes bus activity.

The Chirp K-J-K-J-K-J sequence occurs too slow to propagate through the serial data path, therefore LINESTATE signal
transitions must be used by the Link to step through the Chirp K-J-K-J-K-J state diagram, where “K State” is equivalent
to LINESTATE = K State and “J State” is equivalent to LINESTATE = J State. The Link must employ a counter (Chirp
Count) to count the number of Chirp K and Chirp J states. Note that LINESTATE does not filter the bus signals so the
requirement that a bus state must be “continuously asserted for 2.5µs” must be verified by the Link sampling the LIN-
ESTATE signals.

    Note:
• T0 may be up to 4ms after HS Reset T0.
• The Link must use LINESTATE to detect the downstream port chirp sequence.
• Due to the assertion of the HS termination on the host port and FS termination on the device port, between T1
    and T7 the signaling levels on the bus are higher than HS signaling levels and are less than FS signaling levels.
6.10       HS Detection Handshake – Suspend Timing
If reset is entered from a suspended state, the internal oscillator and clocks of the transceiver are assumed to be pow-
ered down. Figure 6-6 shows how CLKOUT is used to control the duration of the chirp generated by the device.
When reset is entered from a suspended state (J to SE0 transition reported by LINESTATE), SUSPENDN is combina-
torially negated at time T0 by the Link. It takes approximately 5 milliseconds for the transceiver's oscillator to stabilize.
The device does not generate any transitions of the CLKOUT signal until it is “usable” (where “usable” is defined as
stable to within ±10% of the nominal frequency and the duty cycle accuracy 50±5%).
The first transition of CLKOUT occurs at T1. The Link then sets OPMODE to Disable Bit Stuffing and NRZI encoding,
XCVRSELECT to HS mode, and must assert a Chirp K for 66000 CLKOUT cycles to ensure a 1ms minimum duration.
If CLKOUT is 10% fast (66MHz) then Chirp K will be 1.0ms. If CLKOUT is 10% slow (54 MHz) then Chirp K will be 1.2ms.
The 5.6ms requirement for the first CLKOUT transition after SUSPENDN, ensures enough time to assert a 1ms Chirp
K and still complete before T3. Once the Chirp K is completed (T3) the Link can begin looking for host chirps and use
CLKOUT to time the process. At this time, the device follows the same protocol as in Section 6.9, "HS Detection Hand-
shake – HS Downstream Facing Port" for completion of the High Speed Handshake.

6.11      Assertion of Resume
In this case, an event internal to the device initiates the resume process. A device with remote wake-up capability must
wait for at least 5ms after the bus is in the idle state before sending the remote wake-up resume signaling. This allows
the hubs to get into their suspend state and prepare for propagating resume signaling.
The device has 10ms where it can draw a non-suspend current before it must drive resume signaling. At the beginning
of this period the Link may negate SUSPENDN, allowing the transceiver (and its oscillator) to power up and stabilize.
Figure 6-7 illustrates the behavior of a device returning to HS mode after being suspended. At T4, a device that was
previously in FS mode would maintain TERMSELECT and XCVRSELECT high.

                          after bus activity stops.
6.12       Detection of Resume
Resume signaling always takes place in FS mode (TERMSELECT and XCVRSELECT = FS enabled), so the behavior
for a HS device is identical to that of a FS device. The Link uses the LINESTATE signals to determine when the USB
transitions from the 'J' to the 'K' state and finally to the terminating FS EOP (SE0 for 1.25us-1.5µs.).
The resume signaling (FS 'K') will be asserted for at least 20ms. At the beginning of this period the Link may negate
SUSPENDN, allowing the transceiver (and its oscillator) to power up and stabilize.
The FS EOP condition is relatively short. Links that simply look for an SE0 condition to exit suspend mode do not nec-
essarily give the transceiver’s clock generator enough time to stabilize. It is recommended that all Link implementations
key off the 'J' to 'K' transition for exiting suspend mode (SUSPENDN = 1). And within 1.25µs after the transition to the
SE0 state (low-speed EOP), the Link must enable normal operation, i.e. enter HS or FS mode depending on the mode
the device was in when it was suspended.
If the device was in FS mode: then the Link leaves the FS terminations enabled. After the SE0 expires, the downstream
port will assert a J state for one low-speed bit time, and the bus will enter a FS Idle state (maintained by the FS termi-
nations).
If the device was in HS mode: then the Link must switch to the FS terminations before the SE0 expires (< 1.25µs). After
the SE0 expires, the bus will then enter a HS IDLE state (maintained by the HS terminations).

attached to an upstream port, power is asserted to the device and the device sets XCVRSELECT and TERMSELECT
to FS mode (time T1).
VBUS is the +5V power available on the USB cable. Device Reset in Figure 6-8 indicates that VBUS is within normal oper-
ational range as defined in the USB 2.0 specification. The assertion of Device Reset (T0) by the upstream port will ini-
tialize the device. By monitoring LINESTATE, the Link state machine knows to set the XCVRSELECT and
TERMSELECT signals to FS mode (T1).
The standard FS technique of using a pull-up resistor on DP to signal the attach of a FS device is employed. The Link
must then check the LINESTATE signals for SE0. If LINESTATE = SE0 is asserted at time T2 then the upstream port is
forcing the reset state to the device (i.e. Driven SE0). The device will then reset itself before initiating the HS Detection
Handshake protocol.

6.14         USB Reset and Chirp
The USB 2.0 specification describes USB Reset as a means of attaching a FS or a HS Device to a Host. This discussion
will focus on a HS device connecting to a HS host.

Figure 6-9 shows the UTMI+ interface for both a Host (DPPD & DMPD = 1) and a Device (DPPD & DMPD = 0). The
following discussion applies to when the USB3500 is a configured as a Device and is connected to another USB3500
configured as a Host. Since the Host and Device negotiate this transition, both are discussed together and the user may
follow this discussion for either a host or device depending on the application of the USB3500. This sequence is also
referred to as a “high-speed chirp” due to the K-J pairs which the host sends to the downstream device.
Before the Host begins a session, it will set Xcvrselect to FS mode (10b) and Termselect to 1b to activate the HS termi-
nation. The Host will also asserted the 15Kohm pull-down resistors on DP and DM. The 15Kohm pull down resistors will
pull DP and DM to 0 volts so that the Host Linestate will return Single Ended Zero (SE0) when nothing is attached.
At time marker T0, the host link applies VBUS to the downstream port.
At T1, the Device has detected a valid voltage on VBUS and has asserted Termselect to enable the 1.5K ohm pull-up
resistor on DP. During T1 the Host sees the linestate go from SEO to a J due to the pull-up on DP.
   Note:         Note: Should a device attached to the host be a LS device, then the 1.5 K ohm pull-up is applied to DM.
                 The following discussion does not apply to a LS device attached.

At T2, the Host has detected the FS device attached to the USB bus. At this time the Host will reset the bus by driving
a SE0. The SE0 is created by switching to HS Mode and activating the HS termination by de-asserting Termselect. The
45 ohm high speed terminations pull the bus to SE0.
At T3, the Device will respond to the SE0 by driving a “Device Chirp K” onto the bus. The “Device Chirp K” is driven with
Opmode = 10b so that bitstuffing and NRZI encoding is disabled.
During T3 the HS host will see the “Device Chirp K” and prepare to respond to the device by setting Opmode = 10b to
disable the bitstuffing and NRZI encoding.
At T4, the Device will stop driving a the Chirp K, letting the bus return to SE0, and wait for the Host to respond. The
device removes the K by de-asserting Txvalid. The device will have driven the K for a minimum of 1mS. The Host sees
the linestate change from K to SE0.
At T5, the host begins transmitting K-J pairs to the device. Each K or J is 40-60uS long and the K-J pairs are repeated
for the remainder of the 10mS USB reset.
At T6, the device has detected 3 K-J pairs. The device switches the Termselect low and changes Opmode to 00b. The
device is now in high speed and waits for the first SOF packet from the upstream host. When Termselect is de-asserted,
the HS termination is activated which lowers the amplitude of the K-J pairs.
At T7, the host ends the K-J pairs and switches to normal HS mode by changing Opmode to 00b.
At T8, the Host sends the first SOF packet. This is done by putting the SOF PID 0xA5 on the data bus and asserting
Txvalid. The link transfers the SOF packet. After, the SOF packet a normal high speed USB session started.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be super-
    seded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO REP-
    RESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
