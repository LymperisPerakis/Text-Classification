Product Overview
NB7VPQ904M: 1.8V USB Type-C™ DisplayPort™ ALT Mode 10Gbps Linear
Redriver
For complete documentation, see the data sheet.
 The NB7VPQ904M is a 1.8 V USB Type-C™ DisplayPort™ Alternate Mode Linear redriver fully supporting DisplayPort 1.4 (8.1
 Gbps) and USB 3.1 Gen 1/Gen 2 (5/10 Gbps) protocols. Signal integrity degrades from PCB traces, transmission cables, and inter-
 symbol interference (ISI). The NB7VPQ904M compensates for these losses by engaging varying levels of user selectable flat gain &
 equalization to create the best eye opening for the outgoing data signals.
