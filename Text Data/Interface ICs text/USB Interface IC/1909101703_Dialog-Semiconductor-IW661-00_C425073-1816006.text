iW661
AC/DC Secondary-Side Synchronous Rectification and Rapid ChargeTM                                       NDA Confidential
Interface Controller for AFC with DLNK Technology
1 Description
The iW661 is an AC/DC secondary-side combo controller for Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging (AFC) which includes
USB interface, secondary-to-primary digital communication and synchronous rectification functions in a single IC.
The iW661 allows rapid charging of AFC enabled mobile devices (MDs). The iW661-11 also supports Qualcomm® Quick
ChargeTM 2.0 (QC 2.0) and automatically distingugishes between the AFC and QC 2.0 protocols. It resides on the secondary
side of an AC/DC power supply and allows the adapter to be configured for multi-level output voltage and current.
The iW661 uses Dialog’s proprietary secondary-to-primary digital link (DLNK) communication technology. When paired
with Dialog’s primary-side controller, the iW1791, the iW661 transmits all necessary information for rapid charge
through a single optocoupler, including output voltage requests, output current limits, output voltage undershoot, out-
put over-voltage, and fault and reset signals.
                                                             TIA
The iW661 is also an advanced synchronous rectifier (SR) controller with an integrated MOSFET driver, enabling
discontinuous mode flyback converters with high efficiency operation. The device works with an external power MOS-
FET to replace the main rectifying diode on the secondary side of a flyback converter, improving efficiency by reducing
                                                                L
secondary-side conduction losses. Dialog’s digital adaptive turn-off control technology minimizes turn-off deadtime,
eliminating the need for an additional Schottky diode that is typically needed in parallel with the synchronous MOSFET
in conventional synchronous rectifiers.
In addition, the iW661 implements Dialog’s proprietary D- impedance detection and D+/D- OVP to address soft short
                                           EN
issues in the output cables and connectors that can be caused by such things as a poor or loose connection between
the cable connector and the socket, contamination in the USB connector, or a worn-out cable, and provides protection
against the damages. The iW661 can be used in Dialog’s primary-side controlled AC/DC systems to achieve fast volt-
age transition, low no-load power consumption, and fast dynamic load response.

The iW661 is an AC/DC secondary-side combo controller for synchronous rectifier control, secondary-primary
communication and AFC protocol interfacing with MDs equipped with AFC technology to configure the travel adapter
CO
(TA) output voltage and current limit to different levels for rapid charging. It provides high-performance and cost-effective
rapid charge solutions by integrating all secondary-side control functions into one single controller.
The iW661 is also backward compatible with USB BC1.2 compliant MDs and other MDs to provide a 5V/2A output
by default setting. The iW661-11 also supports the QC 2.0 protocol. The iW661 can be detected as a DCP if an AFC-
equipped MD is connected. After the initial detection stage, the iW661 interprets D+/D- signal voltage to be AFC device
and reads its associated output voltage/current requests. A valid request is encoded to certain pulse patterns and sent
to the primary side. The constant current (CC) limit setting is also sent together with the voltage request. Besides the
voltage and current information, the iW661 also monitors the adapter output voltage and sends over-voltage or under-
voltage information to primary side. The iW661 also features a programmable fast/slow active discharging function to
discharge the output capacitor in a short time after a request for a lower voltage or unplug of AFC-equipped MDs.
With Dialog’s proprietary secondary-side to primary-side digital communication technology and protocol, the iW661
can send various information through the optocoupler, including voltage/current requests, under-voltage, over-voltage and
other requests. With this innovative technology and the primary feedback technology, any travel adapter using the

iW661 and iW1791 as secondary and primary controllers can use one of optocouplers to provide higher power density,
lowest cost solutions without sacrificing the system performance.
The iW661 should be paired with Dialog’s primary-side controller, iW1791, for dynamic multi-level voltage and
current configuration and control. The iW1791 has a built-in circuit to decode the different pulse patterns for voltage
configuration, current limit setting, VOUT under-voltage and over-voltage detection, and the iW1791 responds
accordingly based on the decoded information.
The iW661 builds in the synchronous rectifier (SR) control function with a MOSFET driver that uses a new, proprietary
digital adaptive turn-off control technology to minimize the turn-off deadtime. This results in a lower diode conduction
loss at the deadtime so that no parallel Schottky diode is required. It measures the voltage across the synchronous
MOSFET to achieve lossless current sensing for the driver timing control. The digital SR logic control block generates
the gate driver control signal based on the drain-to-source voltage of the synchronous MOSFET. The gate driver

control signal is fed into the integrated MOSFET driver to drive the synchronous MOSFET.
The iW661 SR control and driver is optimized for high efficiency operation of multi-level output systems up to 12V with
a minimum of external components. The DRAIN pin of the iW661 has a 100V rating to support high output voltage

without the need of an additional clamping circuit. The PLR circuit controlled by the adaptive VCC control block is built
in to provide sufficient SR MOSFET driving voltage for high efficiency SR operation at output voltages down to the
sub-3V level.

output voltage of the AC/DC adapter, which is also the VIN voltage for the iW661, is above VPR_ENABLE, and the VCC
voltage for the iW661 is above VCC_POR, the iW661 begins to work at 5V state and the D+/D- short switch is turned on.
The USB BC1.2 or AFC-enabled MD detects the D- voltage while applying a voltage on D+ and vice versa. The iW661
is designed such that the impedance between D+ and D- is low enough to meet the specifications of USB BC1.2 and
AFC during the initial detection when the D+/D- short switch is on. The iW661 ensures that D+ stays between VDAT_REF
                                           EN
and VSEL_REF for at least 1.25 second without any glitch before it turns off the D+/D- short switch and turns on the D-
pull-down switch. The handshaking between the iW661 and AFC-equipped MD finishes after D- is pulled down for
20ms and the iW661 starts to take voltage requests from the MD.
9.3 Output Cable Soft Short Detection and MD Fault Code Protection
               NF
The iW661 features proprietary D- impedance detection and D+/D- OVP, which address soft short issues in the
output cables and connectors and provides protection against damages. During IC initialization and handshaking with
MD, the iW661 checks for an output soft short by checking the equivalent resistance at D-. At power-up, the iW661
detects the equivalent resistance at D- immediately after VCC rises above VCC_POR and VIN rises above VPR_ENABLE. This
                 ID
detection happens when the TA is plugged to the wall outlet while the MD can be attached or detached to the TA. The
iW661 sends out a signal to the iW1791 if the equivalent resistance on D- is detected to be less than 410Ω. When the
D+ voltage is below VDAT-REF, D- impedance detection happens periodically every 2.2 seconds.
When the iW661 detects D+/D- OVP or receives a fault code from the MD, it sends out a signal to the iW1791 to shut
down the TA.
CO
9.4 Voltage and Current Request Interpretation and Encoding
After handshaking with the MD, the iW661 monitors the voltage changes of D+ and D-. If there is a valid signal pulse
qualified as a Master Ping of AFC protocol, the iW661 responds with a Slave Ping and receives the incoming signals
for voltage and current information. If the incoming signal is qualified as a valid AFC voltage/current request, the
iW661 enters AFC mode and repeats the same pattern to inform the MD that this voltage/current request can be
supported. Such a two-way request/response is repeated twice more (total of three rounds) before the iW661 sends
out voltage/current request to the iW1791. The iW1791 changes the voltage regulation and current limit accordingly.
If the MD requested a voltage/current setting which cannot be supported by iW661, the iW661 responds with all the
supported voltage/current combinations to the MD. The supported voltage/current configurations and V_I_BYTEs for
the iW661-01 option are listed in table 9.1. For availability of other product options to support more voltage/current
combinations, please contact Dialog.

The iW661 has a built-in encoder to generate different patterns and to drive the SR MOSFET so that the different
voltage information together with the associated current limit setting can be sent to the primary side through the power
transformer.
9.5 Programmable Active Discharge
Discharge of the output capacitor is necessary for quick voltage transition from a higher level to a lower level when
there is a lower voltage request. It is even more important to discharge the output capacitor quickly from a high level
to 5V after the MD is unplugged from the TA in order to ensure the safety of other non-AFC-enabled MDs. An internal
switch between the DIS pin and GND pin is turned on to provide a path from the output voltage through an external

resistor, the DIS pin, and the internal switch to ground. The discharging time is programmable with the external
resistor. A resistance of 47Ω or higher is recommended for the external resistor to prevent over-current or over-
heat inside the IC. If a certain application uses a larger output capacitor or requires faster discharging, an external
P-channel FET can be used and the iW661 DIS pin can be used to drive the FET. When the MD is unplugged, the
iW661 resets to its initial setting. The active fast discharge starts after a confirmed lower voltage request or after 40ms
de-glitch of D+ voltage drop; it stops when the active discharge threshold of target voltage is reached or a 200ms timer
(including de-glitch time) expires to avoid excess load current and high power dissipation inside the IC. After the active
fast discharge stops, a slow discharge path continues to discharge the output capacitor until the 200ms timer expires.
9.6 VBUS Monitoring
In addition to encoding and transmitting the output voltage and current request, the iW661 monitors the VBUS for both
under-voltage and over-voltage. The VBUS under-voltage or voltage undershoot is usually caused by a sudden load
voltage setting mismatch between the iW1791 and iW661.
                                                            TIA
current increase. The iW661 also monitors the VBUS over-voltage, especially the over-voltage caused by the output
When a load transient event from light load to heavy load happens, the output voltage drops. If the output voltage
                                                               L
drops to the voltage undershoot threshold, the iW661 turns on the LED of the optocoupler by controlling the DRV pin
sink current, and the DLNK pin of the iW1791 is pulled down by the transistor of the optocoupler. After the iW1791
receives this DLNK pin signal, it can intelligently confirm if this signal is caused by an undershoot event and distinguish
it from a voltage and current request, and then it promptly increases the switching frequency and the tON to delivery
more power to the secondary side in order to bring the output voltage back to regulation. The undershoot detection
signal of the iW661 is backward compatible with Dialog’s secondary-side voltage position monitor, the iW628.
                                           EN
While the iW1791 can protect against the VBUS over-voltage through the VSENSE signal in most condtions, it is difficult
for the iW1791 to protect the over-voltage caused by output voltage setting mismatch between the iW1791 and the
iW661. The iW1791/iW661 chipset adds one more layer of OVP. When the VBUS rises to above the over-voltage
threshold of the iW661’s present setting, the iW661 drives the DRV pin in a special switching pattern serving as a OVP
signal and turns on both the fast and slow discharge. After the iW1791 receives this OVP signal, it shuts down the
               NF
power supply promptly.
In this way, through the single optocoupler and proprietary digital communication the iW661 transmits to the iW1791
all the necessary information for a high-performance rapid-charge AC/DC system design including output voltage
                 ID
requests, output current limits, output voltage undershoot and output over-voltage.
VCC Powering in the iW661
Internal circuits of the controller require bias voltage from the capacitor at the VCC pin to operate. The internal linear
regulator (LDO) and the internal pulse linear regulator (PLR) are the two power sources available in the iW661 to
power VCC. The LDO utilizes the stable system output voltage to power VCC thus it is preferred when the output voltage
CO
is sufficiently high to achieve high efficiency driving of the SR MOSFET. However, when the system output voltage
drops low, it may not be able to provide sufficient voltage to drive the SR MOSFET efficiently. Thus the PLR circuit is
introduced to power VCC under such conditions. The PLR utilizes the pulsating voltage at the SR MOSFET DRAIN pin
to power VCC so it can maintain relatively high VCC when the system output voltage drops low.
When the system output voltage is above VLR_DISABLE, the PLR circuit is at the OFF state. The MOSFET (S1) will be at
the ON state to minimize the voltage drop between the VIN pin and VCC pin. The flyback system output provides the
operating current through the LDO at the VIN pin into the VCC pin. The LDO regulates the VCC voltage at 5V. When the
flyback output is close to 5V, the LDO cannot maintain VCC regulation and it operates at pass through mode. In this
mode the drop-out voltage from the VIN pin to VCC pin is smaller than 0.4V when the VIN pin current is 5mA.
When the system output voltage drops below the VLR_ENABLE, the adaptive VCC control chooses either the LDO or the
PLR to obtain high enough VCC based on the system operation condition. If the PLR is set to the ON state, the PLR will
provide power to VCC and the VCC voltage may go higher than the system output voltage at the VIN pin. The switch S1

will be at the OFF state to avoid current going from the VCC pin to the VIN pin. Although the switch S1 is turned off, the
LDO may still be able to charge the capacitor at VCC through the body diode of S1 if the VCC voltage is below VIN.
With this scheme, the iW661 always maintains sufficient VCC voltage to drive the SR MOSFET under all output voltage
and loading conditions. Thus it is optimized for multi-level output applications.

The synchronous rectifier (SR) control block monitors the synchronous MOSFET’s drain-to-source voltage (VDS) to
CO
determine the driver timing. When the VDS is below the VON_TH (-120mV), the control block turns on the synchronous
MOSFET with its built-in driver. The driver has a minimum on-time (TON_MIN) to avoid the noise from turning off the
driver immediately.
As the current ISD decreases, VDS increases and gets close to 0 mV. The SR driver is turned off when the VDS reaches
VOFF_TH. The iW661 builds in Dialog’s proprietary adaptive turn-off technology to minimize the turn-off deadtime.
After the SR driver turns off, the VDS rises. When the VDS reaches VMIN_OFF_TH, the SR control block initiates a minimum
off-time timer during which the SR remains off to avoid the ringing from turning on the synchronous MOSFET. The
drain-to-source voltage of the synchronous MOSFET has a ringing after the secondary current reaches zero, which
is caused by the magnetizing inductance of the transformer and the parasitic capacitances of the MOSFETs and the
transformer. Depending on the damping factor, this ringing may reach the turn-on threshold of iW661 in its first ringing
cycle. The initial TOFF_MIN is designed to be 2.5μs to prevent the ringing from turning on the synchronous MOSFET.
In typical 10W to 25W designs, the ringing frequency is between 500kHz and 1MHz. Thus the 2.5μs TOFF_MIN is long
enough to cover the first ringing cycle. The iW661 measures the ringing frequency and adaptively adjusts the TOFF_MIN

to effectively block the first ringing cycle.
If the TON_L in Figure 9.2 is smaller than 100ns, the following TOFF_MIN is doubled.
During the start-up, the system output voltage may be too low to reset the transformer so that the system may oper-
ate at the Continuous Current Mode (CCM). To avoid the SR operation at CCM, a comparator at VIN pin monitors the
system output. When VIN voltage is lower than 2.2V (typical), the whole SR control block is disabled.
9.8 Design Considerations
To increase D+/D- noise immunity, RC filters can be added to D+/D- traces or pins as shown in Figure 9.3. Since the
AFC specification requires the capacitance from D+ or D- to GND to be less than 500pF and iW661 D+/D- pins can
have up to 100pF internal capacitance, the maximum external capacitance on D+ or D- can be 400pF each. The USB
BC1.2 requires a maximum of 200Ω of D+ to D- resistance during DCP mode while the iW661 has internal resistance
or RDM can be up to 89Ω each.

9.9 Layout Considerations
Since the iW661 integrates the SR function and protocol function, layout is very critical to guarantee correct operation
of all functions. In order to minimize the SR sensing and driving noise, the trace between the MOSFET and the output
capacitor, and the trace between the iW661 GND pin and the output capacitor should both be as short as possible. If
both traces are very short, it is ok to directly connect the SOURCE and GND pins of iW661 together near the IC, as
shown in Figure 9.4.

                                 possible with minimum length trace connections.
If the traces have to be long due to the physical placement, the PCB layout connection shown in Figure 9.5 is
               NF
recommended. The trace between the MOSFET and the output capacitor should be still as short as possible. The
SOURCE and GND pins should be connected separately to the MOSFET source and output capacitor.
