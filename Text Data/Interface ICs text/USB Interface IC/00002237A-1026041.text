2.0       INTRODUCTION
2.1       General Description
The Microchip USB5807 hub is a low-power, OEM configurable, USB 3.1 Gen 1 hub controller with 7 downstream ports
and advanced features for embedded USB applications. The USB5807 is fully compliant with the Universal Serial Bus
Revision 3.1 Specification and USB 2.0 Link Power Management Addendum. The USB5807 supports 5 Gbps Super-
Speed (SS), 480 Mbps Hi-Speed (HS), 12 Mbps Full-Speed (FS), and 1.5 Mbps Low-Speed (LS) USB downstream
devices on all enabled downstream ports.
The USB5807 supports the legacy USB speeds (HS/FS/LS) through a dedicated USB 2.0 hub controller that is the cul-
mination of five generations of Microchip hub controller design and experience with proven reliability, interoperability,
and device compatibility. The SuperSpeed hub controller operates in parallel with the USB 2.0 hub controller, decoupling
the 5 Gbps SS data transfers from bottlenecks due to the slower USB 2.0 traffic.
The USB5807 enables OEMs to configure their system using “Configuration Straps.” These straps simplify the config-
uration process, assigning default values to USB 3.1 Gen 1 ports and GPIOs. OEMs can disable ports, enable battery
charging, and define GPIO functions as default assignments on power-up, removing the need for OTP or external SPI
ROM.
The USB5807 supports downstream battery charging via the integrated battery charger detection circuitry, which sup-
ports the USB-IF Battery Charging (BC1.2) detection method and most Apple devices. The USB5807 provides the bat-
tery charging handshake and supports the following USB-IF BC1.2 charging profiles:
•  DCP: Dedicated Charging Port (Power brick with no data)
•  CDP: Charging Downstream Port (1.5A with data)
•  SDP: Standard Downstream Port (0.5A with data)
•  Custom profiles loaded via SMBus or OTP
Additionally, the USB5807 includes many powerful and unique features such as:
FlexConnect, which provides flexible connectivity options. One of the USB5807’s downstream ports can be reconfig-
ured to become the upstream port, allowing master capable devices to control other devices on the hub.
PortSwap, which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows direct alignment
of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors to avoid uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differential signals on the
PCB.
PHYBoost, which provides programmable levels of Hi-Speed USB signal drive strength
in the downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore USB signal integrity
in a compromised system environment. The graphic on the right shows an example of
Hi-Speed USB eye diagrams before and after PHYBoost signal integrity restoration. in
a compromised system environment.
VariSense, which controls the USB receiver sensitivity enabling programmable levels of USB signal receive sensitivity.
This capability allows operation in a sub-optimal system environment, such as when a captive USB cable is used.
Port Split, which allows for the USB3.1 Gen1 and USB2.0 portions of downstream ports 5 and 6 to operate inde-
pendently and enumerate two separate devices in parallel in special applications.
The USB5807 can be configured for operation through internal default settings. Custom OEM configurations are sup-
ported through external SPI ROM or OTP ROM. All port control signal pins are under firmware control in order to allow
for maximum operational flexibility, and are available as GPIOs for customer specific use.
The USB5807 is available in commercial (0°C to +70°C) and industrial (-40°C to +85°C) temperature ranges. An internal
block diagram of the USB5807 is shown in Figure 2-1.

3.3       USB5807 Pin Descriptions
This section contains descriptions of the various USB5807 pins. The pin descriptions have been broken into functional
groups as follows:
•  USB 3.1 Gen 1 Pin Descriptions
•  USB 2.0 Pin Descriptions
•  Port Control Pin Descriptions
•  SPI Interface
•  USB Type-C Connector Controls
•  Miscellaneous Pin Descriptions
•  Configuration Strap Pin Descriptions
•  Power and Ground Pin Descriptions
The “_N” symbol in the signal name indicates that the active, or asserted, state occurs when the signal is at a low voltage
level. For example, RESET_N indicates that the reset signal is active low. When “_N” is not present after the signal
name, the signal is asserted when at the high voltage level.
The terms assertion and negation are used exclusively. This is done to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of
“active low” and “active high” signal. The term assert, or assertion, indicates that a signal is active, independent of
whether that level is represented by a high or low voltage. The term negate, or negation, indicates that a signal is inac-
tive.

                                             When designing a detachable hub, this pin must be con-
                                             nected to the VBUS power pin of the upstream USB port
                                             through a resistor divider (50 kΩ by 100 kΩ) to provide
                                             3.3 V.
                                             For self-powered applications with a permanently
                                             attached host, this pin must be connected to either 3.3 V
                                             or 5.0 V through a resistor divider to provide 3.3 V.
                                             In embedded applications, VBUS_DET may be controlled
                                             (toggled) when the host desires to renegotiate a connec-
                                             tion without requiring a full reset of the device.

3.5      Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions
Configuration straps are multi-function pins that are used during Power-On Reset (POR) or external chip reset
(RESET_N) to determine the default configuration of a particular feature. The state of the signal is latched following de-
assertion of the reset. Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. This section details the various
device configuration straps and associated programmable pin functions.
  Note:     The system designer must guarantee that configuration straps meet the timing requirements specified in
            Section 9.6.2, Power-On and Configuration Strap Timing and Section 9.6.3, Reset and Configuration Strap
            Timing. If configuration straps are not at the correct voltage level prior to being latched, the device may
            capture incorrect strap values.
3.5.1       CFG_STRAP CONFIGURATION
The CFG_STRAP pin is used to place the hub into preset modes of operation. The resistor options are a 200 kΩ pull-
down, 200 kΩ pull-up, 10 kΩ pull-down, 10 kΩ pull-up, 10 Ω pull-down, and 10 Ω pull-up as shown in Table 3-11.

      RESET_N Input                                                   Summary
             0            Standby Mode: This is the lowest power mode of the device. No functions are active
                          other than monitoring the RESET_N input. All port interfaces are high impedance and
                          the PLL is halted. Refer to Section 8.3.2, External Chip Reset (RESET_N) for additional
                          information on RESET_N.
             1            Hub (Normal) Mode: The device operates as a configurable USB hub with battery
                          charger detection. This mode has various sub-modes of operation, as detailed in
                          Figure 5-1. Power consumption is based on the number of active ports, their speed,
                          and amount of data transferred.
The flowchart in Figure 5-1 details the modes of operation and how the device traverses through the Hub Mode stages
(shown in bold). The remaining sub-sections provide more detail on each stage of operation.

USB5807
5.1        Standby Mode
If the RESET_N pin is asserted, the hub will be in Standby Mode. This mode provides a very low power state for maxi-
mum power efficiency when no signaling is required. This is the lowest power state. In Standby Mode all downstream
ports are disabled, the USB data pins are held in a high-impedance state, all transactions immediately terminate (no
states saved), all internal registers return to their default state, the PLL is halted, and core logic is powered down in order
to minimize power consumption. Because core logic is powered off, no configuration settings are retained in this mode
and must be re-initialized after RESET_N is negated high.
5.2        SPI Initialization Stage (SPI_INIT)
The first stage, the initialization stage, occurs on the deassertion of RESET_N. In this stage, the internal logic is reset,
the PLL locks if a valid clock is supplied, and the configuration registers are initialized to their default state. The internal
firmware then checks for an external SPI ROM. The firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid
signature of “2DFU” (device firmware upgrade) beginning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the
external ROM is enabled and the code execution begins at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid signa-
ture is not found, then execution continues from internal ROM (CFG_RD stage).
When using an external SPI ROM, a 1 Mbit, 60 MHz or faster ROM must be used. Both 1- and 2-bit SPI operation are
supported. For optimum throughput, a 2-bit SPI ROM is recommended. Both mode 0 and mode 3 SPI ROMs are also
supported.
If the system is not strapped for SPI Mode, code execution will continue from internal ROM (CFG_RD stage).
5.3        Configuration Read Stage (CFG_RD)
In this stage, the internal firmware loads the default values from the internal ROM and then uses the configuration strap-
ping options to override the default values. Refer to Section 3.5, Configuration Straps and Programmable Functions for
information on usage of the various device configuration straps.
5.4        Strap Read Stage (STRAP)
In this stage, the firmware registers the configuration strap settings and checks the state of CFG_STRAP. If
CFG_STRAP is set for CONFIG2, then the hub will check the state of the SMBDATA and SMBCLK pins. If 10k pull-up
resistors are detected on both pins, the device will enter the SOC_CFG stage. If 10k pull-up resistors are not detected
on both pins, the hub will transition to the OTP_CFG stage instead.
5.5        SOC Configuration Stage (SOC_CFG)
In this stage, the SOC can modify any of the default configuration settings specified in the integrated ROM, such as USB
device descriptors and port electrical settings.
There is no time limit on this mode. In this stage the firmware will wait indefinitely for the SMBus/I2C configuration. When
the SOC has completed configuring the device, it must write to register 0xFF to end the configuration.
5.6        OTP Configuration Stage (OTP_CFG)
Once the SOC has indicated that it is done with configuration, all configuration data is combined in this stage. The
default data, the SOC configuration data, and the OTP data are all combined in the firmware and the device is pro-
grammed.
After the device is fully configured, it will go idle and then into suspend if there is no VBUS or Hub.Connect present.
Once VBUS is present, and battery charging is enabled, the device will transition to the Battery Charger Detection
Stage. If VBUS is present, and battery charging is not enabled, the device will transition to the Connect stage.
5.7        Hub Connect Stage (Hub.Connect)
Once the CHGDET stage is completed, the device enters the Hub Connect stage. USB connect can be initiated by
asserting the VBUS pin function high. The device will remain in the Hub Connect stage indefinitely until the VBUS pin
function is deasserted.

5.8       Normal Mode
Lastly, the hub enters Normal Mode of operation. In this stage full USB operation is supported under control of the USB
Host on the upstream port. The device will remain in the normal mode until the operating mode is changed by the sys-
tem.

            Microchip USB5807 product page at www.microchip.com/USB5807.
7.1      SPI Master Interface
The device is capable of code execution from an external SPI ROM. When configured for SPI Mode, on power up the
firmware looks for an external SPI flash device that contains a valid signature of 2DFU (device firmware upgrade) begin-
ning at address 0xFFFA. If a valid signature is found, then the external ROM is enabled and the code execution begins
at address 0x0000 in the external SPI device. If a valid signature is not found, then execution continues from internal
ROM.
   Note:    For SPI timing information, refer to Section 9.6.7, SPI Timing.
7.2      SMBus Slave Interface
The device includes an integrated SMBus slave interface, which can be used to access internal device run time registers
or program the internal OTP memory. SMBus slave detection is accomplished by setting the CFG_STRAP in the correct
configuration followed by detection of pull-up resistors on both the SMDAT and SMCLK signals during the hub’s boot-
up sequence. Refer to Section 3.5.1, CFG_STRAP Configuration for additional information.
   Note:    All configuration is to be performed via the Pro-Touch2 programming tool. For additional information on the
            Pro-Touch2 programming tool, refer to Software Libraries within Microchip USB5807 product page at

•  USB Type-C Receptacle Support
•  Battery Charging
•  FlexConnect
•  Resets
•  Link Power Management (LPM)
•  Remote Wakeup Indicator
•  Port Control Interface
•  Port Split
8.1        USB Type-C Receptacle Support
The USB5807 has built-in support for the USB Type-C receptacle.
8.1.1         EXTERNAL USB 3.1 GEN 1 MULTIPLEXER
C_ATTACH[0:3] pins are used to signal to the hub when a valid USB Type-C connection has been detected. This func-
tionality requires an external USB Type-C controller such as a Microchip UTC2000 to monitor the USB Type-C recep-
tacle for a valid attach. This signal is used to enable and disable clocking to the USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHY in order to reduce
power consumption when there is no USB Type-C attach.
The C_ATTACH[0:3] pins are active high inputs. A high signal enables clocking to the PHY to enable a USB 3.1 Gen 1
connection. A low signal disables the PHY.

8.2       Battery Charging
The device can be configured by an OEM to have any of the downstream ports support battery charging. The hub’s role
in battery charging is to provide acknowledgment to a device’s query as to whether the hub system supports USB battery
charging. The hub silicon does not provide any current or power FETs or any additional circuitry to actually charge the
device. Those components must be provided externally by the OEM.

If the OEM provides an external supply capable of supplying current per the battery charging specification, the hub can
be configured to indicate the presence of such a supply from the device. This indication, via the PRT_CTL[7:1] pins, is
on a per port basis. For example, the OEM can configure two ports to support battery charging through high current
power FETs and leave the other two ports as standard USB ports.

8.3        FlexConnect
This feature allows the upstream port to be swapped with downstream physical port 1. Only downstream port 1 can be
swapped physically. The default state is when port 0 is the upstream port. The ‘flexed” state is when port 1 is the
upstream port.
FlexConnect can be enabled/disabled in any of the following ways:
• SMBus Configuration
• Direct Pin Control
8.3.1         SMBUS CONFIGURATION
FlexConnect can be controlled via runtime configuration registers through the SMBus Slave Interface during hub run-
time (after enumeration).
8.3.2         DIRECT PIN CONTROL
The FLEX_CMD control input can be used to control the FlexConnect state. When driven or pulled low, the hub will
operate in it’s default state. When driven or pull high, the hub will operate in it’s “flexed” state.
The FLEX_STATE output displays the current state of FlexConnect. It operates in the same manner regardless of how
FlexConnect is controlled (SMBus or Direct Pin Control). When low, the hub is currently in it’s default state. When high,
the hub is in its “flexed” state.
   Note:      For additional information, refer to the Microchip USB58xx/USB59xx FlexConnect application note on the
              Microchip.com USB5807 product page.
8.4        Resets
• Power-On Reset (POR)
• External Chip Reset (RESET_N)
• USB Bus Reset
8.4.1         POWER-ON RESET (POR)
A power-on reset occurs whenever power is initially supplied to the device, or if power is removed and reapplied to the
device. A timer within the device will assert the internal reset per the specifications listed in Section 9.6.2, Power-On
and Configuration Strap Timing.
8.4.2         EXTERNAL CHIP RESET (RESET_N)
A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N, after all power supplies are within operating range, per the
specifications in Section 9.6.3, Reset and Configuration Strap Timing. While reset is asserted, the device (and its asso-
ciated external circuitry) enters Standby Mode and consumes minimal current.
Assertion of RESET_N causes the following:
1.   The PHY is disabled and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
2.   All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
3.   All internal registers return to the default state.
4.   The external crystal oscillator is halted.
5.   The PLL is halted.
   Note:      All power supplies must have reached the operating levels mandated in Section 9.2, Operating Condi-
              tions**, prior to (or coincident with) the assertion of RESET_N.

USB5807
8.4.3         USB BUS RESET
In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the device, the device performs the following:
1.   Sets default address to 0.
2.   Sets configuration to Unconfigured.
3.   Moves device from suspended to active (if suspended).
4.   Complies with the USB Specification for behavior after completion of a reset sequence.
The host then configures the device in accordance with the USB Specification.
   Note:      The device does not propagate the upstream USB reset to downstream devices.
8.5        Link Power Management (LPM)
The device supports the L0 (On), L1 (Sleep), and L2 (Suspend) link power management states. These supported LPM
states offer low transitional latencies in the tens of microseconds versus the much longer latencies of the traditional USB
suspend/resume in the tens of milliseconds. The supported LPM states are detailed in Table 8-1.

8.6        Remote Wakeup Indicator
The remote wakeup indicator feature uses SUSP_IND as a side band signal to wake up the host when in USB 2.0 sus-
pend. This feature is enabled and disabled via the HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT configuration bit in the hub configuration
space register HUB_CFG_3. The only way to control the bit is by configuration EEPROM, SMBus or internal ROM
default setting. The state is only modified during a power on reset, or hardware reset. No dynamic reconfiguring of this
capability is possible.
When HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT = ‘0’, Normal Resume Behavior per the USB 2.0 specification
When HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT = ‘1’, Modified Resume Behavior is enabled
   Note:     The SUSP_IND signal only indicates the USB2.0 state.
8.7        Port Control Interface
Port power and over-current sense share the same pin (PRT_CTLx) for each port. These functions can be controlled
directly from the USB hub, or via the processor. Additionally, smart port controllers can be controlled via the I2C inter-
face.
The device can be configured into one of the two following port control modes:
• Ganged Mode - A single GANG_PWR pin controls power and detects over-current events for all downstream
   ports.
• Individual Mode - Each port has an individual PRT_CTLx pin for independent port power control and over-current
   detection.
Port connection in various modes are detailed in the following subsections.

8.7.1        PORT CONNECTION IN GANGED MODE
Ganged Mode is enabled via SMBus or OTP configuration. GANG_PWR becomes the port control (PRTCTL) pin for all
downstream ports when the hub is configured for ganged port power control mode. All port power controllers should be
controlled from this pin when the hub is configured for ganged port power mode. While in this mode of operation, an
over-current event on any single downstream port will cause all downstream ports to be flagged for over-current.
8.7.2        PORT CONNECTION IN INDIVIDUAL MODE
8.7.2.1        Port Power Control using USB Power Switch
Individual mode is the default mode of operation. When operating in individual mode, the device will have one port power
control and over-current sense pin for each downstream port. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a
'0'. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation, the pull-up resistor will be disabled at that time. When port power is
enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable the pull-up resistor, making it an open drain output. If there is an
over-current situation, the USB Power Switch will assert the open drain OCS signal. The Schmidt trigger input will rec-
ognize that as a low. The open drain output does not interfere. The over-current sense filter handles the transient con-
ditions such as low voltage while the device is powering up.

When the port is enabled, the PRT_CTLx pin input is constantly sampled. Overcurrent events can be detected in one
of two ways:
• Single, continuous low pulse (consecutive low samples over tocs_single), as shown in Figure 8-6.
• Two short low pulses within a rolling window (two groupings of 1 or more low samples over tocs_double), as shown
   in Figure 8-7.

To maximize compatibility with various port power control topologies, the parameters tocs_single and tocs_double are con-
figurable via the Overcurrent Minimum Pulse Width Register and Overcurrent Inactive Timer Register.
The pin also has a turn-on “lockout” feature where the state of the pin is ignored for a configured amount of time imme-
diately after port power is turned on. This prevents slow ramp times due to parasitic resistance/capacitance attached to
the pin from triggering false overcurrent detections. This parameter is configurable via the Overcurrent Lockout Timer
Register.

  7:0      START_LOCKOUT_TIMER_REG                 R/W      The “start lockout timer” blocks an overcurrent event from

8.7.2.2         Port Power Control using Poly Fuse
When using the device with a poly fuse, there is no need for an output power control. To maintain consistency, the same
circuit will be used. A single port power control and over-current sense for each downstream port is still used from the
Hub's perspective. When disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a '0'. This will have no effect as the external
diode will isolate pin from the load. When port power is enabled, it will disable the output driver and enable the pull-up
resistor. This means that the pull-up resistor is providing 3.3 volts to the anode of the diode. If there is an over-current
situation, the poly fuse will open. This will cause the cathode of the diode to go to 0 volts. The anode of the diode will
be at 0.7 volts, and the Schmidt trigger input will register this as a low resulting in an over-current detection. The open
drain output does not interfere.
   Note:      The USB 2.0 and USB 3.1 Gen 1 bPwrOn2PwrGood descriptors must be set to 0 when using poly-fuse
              mode. Refer to the “Configuration Options for the USB58xx and USB59xx” Microchip application note for
              details on how to change these values.

8.8       Port Split
8.8.1        FEATURE OVERVIEW
This feature allows the USB 2.0 and USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHYs associated with any downstream port to be operationally
separated. The intention of this feature is to allow a system designer to connect an embedded USB 3.x device to the
USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHY, while allowing the USB 2.0 PHY to be used as either a standard USB 2.0 port or with a separate
embedded USB 2.0 device.
This feature operates outside of the provisions of the USB specifications. Operation is intended for specialized applica-
tions only. Contact your local sales representative for additional information.
In order to maintain a positive end user experience, it is recommended that only permanently attached, embedded USB
3.x devices be connected to the USB 3.1 Gen 1 PHY when enabling the Port Split feature. This prevents end users from
attempting to connect USB High-Speed, Full-Speed, or Low-Speed devices to an exposed USB port which only has USB
3.1 Gen 1 connections.

8.8.2        PORT SPLITTING CONFIGURATION
Downstream ports 5 and 6 may be configured for Port Splitting. Port Splitting is configured via register configuration
through SMBus during the hub configuration stage (SOC_CFG) or via the hub’s internal OTP memory.
When Port Splitting is enabled, the existing PRT_CTLx pin associated with that port will continue to control the USB 2.0
portion of the port in an identical matter. A new pin function assigned to a GPIOx pin will be activated and configured to
control the USB 3.1 Gen 1 portion of the port. This new pin is named PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT where x indicates the
respective port. Note that overcurrent detection is not supported on the PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT pin. These new pins
are assigned as shown in Table 8-5.

8.8.2.2         Link Timeout Reset
Port Splitting is intended for use with embedded USB 3.x devices only. When Port Splitting is enabled, the hub constantly
monitors the USB 3.1 Gen 1 Link to see if a valid USB 3.1 Gen 1 Link is established. If there is no valid USB 3.1 Gen 1
Link for a configured amount of time (see below), then the hub will toggle assertion of the associated “PRTPWRx-
_USB3_SPLIT” pin in an attempt to reset the embedded USB 3.1 Gen 1 device and re-establish the USB 3.1 Gen 1 Link.
The timer is always reset and restarted whenever the timeout occurs.

A valid USB 3.1 Gen 1 link is qualified by the LTSSM_STATE register status for the port. A normal Link will actively
switch through many Link states.
If the hub detects that the Link is staying in one of the following Link states the entire duration of the timeout timer, then
the Link is stuck in an invalid state and PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT will be toggled in order to attempt to re-establish the
Link.
•   SIS.Disabled(0x4)
•   Rx.Detect(0x5)
•   SS.Inactive(0x6)
•   Polling(0x7)
•   Recovery(0x8)
•   HotReset (0x9)
The Link Timeout Reset value is configured via register 0x4171 and can be overridden by OTP. The default value is
0x05, which selects a Timeout value of 1 second. Setting the register to 0x00 will disable the Link Timeout Reset feature.
The duration of the Link reset (time which PRTPWRx_USB3_SPLIT signal stays low) can be configured in register
0x4176. The default duration is 400ms with a configurable range of 350ms to 2.9s.

  Note 1: When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the absolute max-
             imum ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage spikes on
             their outputs when AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the AC power line may
             appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested to use a clamp circuit.
  Note 2: This rating does not apply to the following pins: All USB DM/DP pins, XTAL1/CLKIN, and XTALO

9.4       Power Consumption
The values shown below represent typical power consumption as measured during various modes of operation. Power
dissipation is determined by temperature, supply voltage, and external source/sink requirements.
The following measurements were taken with VDD33 equal to 3.3V, VDD12 equal to 1.2V, at an ambient temperature
of 25°C.
   Note:     A USB 3.x hub operates both the USB 3.x and USB 2.0 interfaces in parallel on it’s upstream port connec-
             tion. A port operating under the SS/HS condition indicates that a USB 3.x hub was connected to it.

9.6.2         POWER-ON AND CONFIGURATION STRAP TIMING
Figure 9-3 illustrates the configuration strap valid timing requirements in relation to power-on, for applications where
RESET_N is not used at power-on. In order for valid configuration strap values to be read at power-on, the following
timing requirements must be met. The operational levels (Vopp) for the external power supplies are detailed in
Section 9.2, Operating Conditions**.

9.7         Clock Specifications
The device can accept either a 25MHz crystal or a 25MHz single-ended clock oscillator (±50ppm) input. If the single-
ended clock oscillator method is implemented, XTALO should be left unconnected and XTALI/CLKIN should be driven
with a nominal 0-3.3V clock signal. The input clock duty cycle is 40% minimum, 50% typical and 60% maximum.
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XTALI/XTALO). The following circuit design (Figure 9-6) and specifications (Table 9-10) are required to ensure proper
operation.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
•      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
