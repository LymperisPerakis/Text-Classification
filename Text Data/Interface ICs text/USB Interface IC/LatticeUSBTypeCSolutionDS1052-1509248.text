General Description
The USB Type-C receptacle, plug and cable provide a smaller, thinner and more robust alternative to existing USB
interconnects. The Lattice USB Type-C solution targets its use in a variety of platforms ranging from notebooks,
PCs, Monitors, down to tablets and smart phones. These solutions are also implemented in Docking Stations, USB
chargers and cables where cable detect (CD) electronic intelligence and power delivery (PD) protocols are imple-
mented.
The Lattice solution is designed to support USB Type-C cable and Connector and USB Power Delivery specifica-
tions with programmable flexibility to support the new and evolving specifications as well as the various levels of
complexities required by the end system in a cost effective manner.

 1. Like power supplies must be tied together if they are at the same supply voltage and they meet the power up sequence requirement. Please

Power-On Reset
All iCE40 Ultra devices have on-chip Power-On-Reset (POR) circuitry to ensure proper initialization of the device.
Only three supply rails are monitored by the POR circuitry as follows: (1) VCC, (2) SPI_VCCIO1 and (3) VPP_2V5. All
other supply pins have no effect on the power-on reset feature of the device. Note that all supply voltage pins must
be connected to power supplies for normal operation (including device configuration).
Power-Up Supply Sequencing
It is recommended to bring up the power supplies in the following order. Note that there is no specified timing delay
between the power supplies, however, there is a requirement for each supply to reach a level of 0.5V, or higher,
before any subsequent power supplies in the sequence are applied.
1. VCC and VCCPLL should be the first two supplies to be applied. Note that these two supplies can be tied
      together subject to the recommendation to include a RC-based noise filter on the VCCPLL (Please refer to
      TN1252, iCE40 Hardware Checklist.)
2. SPI_VCCIO1 should be the next supply, and can be applied any time after the previous supplies (VCC and
      VCCPLL) have reached as level of 0.5 V or higher.
3. VPP_2V5 should be the next supply, and can be applied any time after previous supplies (VCC, VCCPLL and
      SPI_VCCIO1) have reached a level of 0.5 V or higher.
4. Other Supplies (VCCIO0 and VCCIO2) do not affect device power-up functionality, and they can be applied any
      time after the initial power supplies (VCC and VCCPLL) have reached a level of 0.5 V or greater.
There is no power down sequence required. However, when partial power supplies are powered down, it is
required the above sequence to be followed when these supplies are repowered up again.
External Reset
When all power supplies have reached to their minimum operating voltage defined in Minimum Operation Condition
Table, it is required to either keep CRESET_B LOW, or toggle CRESET_B from HIGH to LOW, for a duration of
tCRESET_B, and release it to go HIGH, to start configuration download from either the internal NVCM or the external
Flash memory.
Figure 3-1 shows Power-Up sequence when SPI_VCCIO1 and VPP_2V5 are connected separately, and the
CRESET_B signal triggers configuration download. Figure 3-2 shows when SPI_VCCIO1 and VPP_2V5 connected
together.
All power supplies should be powered up during configuration. Before and during configuration, the I/Os are held in
tri-state. I/Os are released to user functionality once the device has finished configuration.

1. Input or I/O leakage current is measured with the pin configured as an input or as an I/O with the output driver tri-stated. It is not measured
    with the output driver active. Internal pull-up resistors are disabled.
2. TJ 25 °C, f = 1.0 MHz.
3. Please refer to VIL and VIH in the sysIO Single-Ended DC Electrical Characteristics table of this document.
4. Input pins are clamped to VCCIO and GND by a diode. When input is higher than VCCIO or lower than GND, the Input Leakage current will be
    higher than the IIL and IIH.

1. Assumes blank pattern with the following characteristics: all outputs are tri-stated, all inputs are configured as LVCMOS and held at VCCIO
    or GND, on-chip PLL is off. For more detail with your specific design, use the Power Calculator tool. Power specified with master SPI config-
    uration mode. Other modes may be up to 25% higher.
2. Frequency = 0 MHz.
3. TJ = 25 °C, power supplies at nominal voltage, on devices processed in nominal process conditions.
4. Does not include pull-up.
5. Startup Peak Currents are measured with decoupling capacitance of 0.1 uF, 10 nF, and 1 nF to the power supply. Higher decoupling capac-
    itance causes higher current.

    — tHOLDmaster   master Hold time (master mode)

    SCLK HIGH and LOW (tHI, tLO) time.
