1. OVERVIEW
The μPD720201 and μPD720202 are Renesas’ third generation Universal Serial Bus 3.0 host controllers,
which comply with Universal Serial Bus 3.0 Specification, and Intel’s eXtensible Host Controller Interface
(xHCI). These devices reduce power consumption and offer a smaller package foot-print making them ideal
for designers who wish to add the USB3.0 interface to mobile computing devices such as laptops and
notebook computers.
The μPD720201 supports up to four USB3.0 SuperSpeed ports and the μPD720202 supports up to two
USB3.0 SuperSpeed ports. The μPD720201 and μPD720202 use a PCI Express® Gen 2 system interface
bus allowing system designers to easily add up to four (μPD720201) or two (μPD720202) USB3.0
SuperSpeed ports to systems containing the PCI Express bus interface. When connected to USB 3.0-
compliant peripherals, the μPD720201 and μPD720202 can transfer information at clock speeds of up to 5
Gbps. The μPD720201 and μPD720202 and USB3.0 standard are fully compliant and backward compatible
with the previous USB2.0 standard. The new USB3.0 standard supports data transfer speeds of up to ten
times faster than those of the previous-generation USB2.0 standard, enabling quick and efficient transfers of
large amounts of information.

Caution    Product quality may suffer if the absolute maximum rating is exceeded even momentarily for any
           parameters.    That is, the absolute maximum ratings are rated values at which the product is on the
           verge of suffering physical damage, and therefore the product must be used under conditions that
           ensure that the absolute maximum ratings are not exceeded. The ratings and conditions indicated for
           DC characteristics and AC characteristics represent the quality assurance range during normal
           operation.

It is recommended that the time difference between the start of power-supply rise (3.3V or 1.05V) and the
point where both power supplies are stabilized should be within 100ms, regardless of the order of power
source. A voltage of 0.1VDD has to be raised to 0.9VDD while the time difference is measured.

Remarks 1. There is no order to power-on of VDD33, AVDD33, AVDD33 and VDD10.
          2. All power sources should be stable within 100 ms from the fastest rising edge of power sources.

Remark As a power saving feature, the μPD720201 / μPD720202 stops XT1/XT2 oscillation whenever PERSTB is
          asserted (low) while PONRSTB is inactive (high).      XT1/XT2 oscillation does not stop while PONRSTB is
          asserted (low).
