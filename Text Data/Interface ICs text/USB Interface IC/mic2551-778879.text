PCB Layout Recommendations
Although the USB standard and applications are not based in
an impedance controlled environment, a properly designed
PCB layout is recommended for optimal transceiver perfor-
mance. The suggested PCB layout hints are as follows:
    • Match signal line traces (VP/VM, D+, D–) to
      40ps, approximately 1/3 inch if possible. FR-4
      PCB material propagation is about 150ps/inch,
      so to minimize skew try to keep VP/VM, D+/D–
      traces as short as possible.
    • For every signal line trace width (w), separate
      the signal lines by 1.5–2 widths. Place all other
      traces at >2 widths from all signal line traces.
    • Maintain the same number of vias on each
      differential trace, keeping traces approximately
      at same separation distance along the line.
    • Control signal line impedances to ±10%.
    • Keep RS as close to the IC as possible, with
      equal distance between RS and the IC for both
      D+ and D–.
