1. General description
              PTN36001 is a small, low power SuperSpeed USB 3.0 redriver IC that enhances signal
              quality by performing receive equalization on the deteriorated input signal followed by
              transmit de-emphasis maximizing system link performance for mobile applications. With
              its superior differential signal conditioning and enhancement capability, the device delivers
              significant flexibility and performance scaling for various systems with different PCB trace
              and cable channel conditions.
              PTN36001 is a dual-channel device that supports data signaling rate of 5 Gbit/s through
              each channel. The data flow of one channel is facing the USB host, and another channel
              is facing the USB peripheral or device. Each channel consists of a high-speed Transmit
              (Tx) differential lane and a high-speed Receive (Rx) differential lane.
              PTN36001 is powered from a 1.8 V supply and is available in a small X2QFN12 package
              (1.25 mm  2.1 mm  0.35 mm) with 0.4 mm pitch.

8. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 2 “Block diagram of PTN36001”.
                       PTN36001 is a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 redriver meant to be used for signal integrity
                       enhancement on mobile platforms – laptops, tablets, notebooks, hub, A/V displays and
                       peripheral devices, for example. With its high fidelity differential signal conditioning
                       capability and wide configurability, this chip is flexible and versatile enough for use under
                       a variety of system environments. PTN36001 implements ternary control IO logic on C1
                       and C2 control pins to detect HIGH (connected to VDD), LOW (connected to GND) or left
                       unconnected condition (OPEN).
                       The following sections describe the individual block functions and capabilities of the
                       device in more detail.
                   8.1 C1 control pin
                       C1 controls signal traces on the left side (as shown in Figure 2) of the redriver. It controls
                       the transmit de-emphasis and output swing of AOUT/AOUT+ channel. It also controls
                       the receive equalization of BIN/BIN+ channel.
                       When C1 = HIGH, the left side of the redriver is optimized to drive long trace length of the
                       left Link.
                       When C1 = OPEN, the left side of the redriver is optimized to drive medium trace length of
                       the left Link.
                       When C1 = LOW, the left side of the redriver is optimized to drive short trace length of the
                       left Link.
                                                                                              C1               C2

                        8.3 Deep power-saving mode entry and exit using C1 and C2 pins
                                C1 and C2 pins can be controlled by GPIOs from the on-board processor. When C1 and
                                C2 pins are both pulled LOW, it will take up to 115 ms (tsHL)for internal logic to sample C1
                                and C2 pin states, and place the PTN36001 in Deep Power-saving mode. To exit from
                                Deep Power-saving mode, the processor GPIOs should pull up C1 and/or C2 pins to
                                HIGH, and PTN36001 will return back to normal active mode in 1 s. In order for C1/C2
                                settings to take effect 6 ms (tsLH) after PTN36001 returns back to Active mode, C1/C2
                                settings should be applied within the first 4 ms window. If settings are applied outside this
                                4 ms window, new C1 and C2 values will be latched and take effect every 115 ms (trcfg).
                                Refer to Figure 5 for Deep Power-saving entry and exit control timing.
                                                                                        After 1 µs (max), PTN36001 exits

                   8.6 Device states and power management
                       PTN36001 has implemented an advanced power management scheme that operates in
                       tune with USB 3.0 bus electrical condition. Although the device does not decode USB
                       power management commands (related to USB 3.0 U1/U2/U3 transitions) exchanged
                       between USB 3.0 host and peripheral/device, it relies on bus electrical conditions and
                       control pins/register settings to decide to be in one of the following states:
                         • Active state wherein device is fully operational, USB data is transported on
                           channels A and B. In this state, USB connection exists and the Receive Termination
                           indication remains active. But there is no need for Receive Termination detection.
                         • Power-saving state wherein the channels A and B are kept enabled. In this state,
                           squelching, detection and/or Receive termination detection circuitry are active. Based
                           on USB connection, there are two possibilities:
                           – No USB connection.
                           – When USB connection exists and when the link is in USB 3.0 U2/U3 mode.
                         • Deep power-saving state wherein both channels' TX and RX terminations are
                           placed in OPEN condition, and the device achieves the most power saving. To enter
                           deep power saving mode, an external GPIO controller can pull down C1 and C2 pins
                           to ground at any time. Please refer to Section 8.3 for Deep power-saving entry and
                           exit control timing information.
                           As an example of utilizing deep power saving mode to achieve maximum power
                           saving when USB3.0 interface is not active in a device such as a smart phone, the
                           system can use the following scheme as a design guideline to implement the deep
                           power saving mode.

                    • Off state: When PTN36001 is not being powered (i.e., VDD1V8 = 0 V), special steps
                       should be done to prevent back-current issues on C1/C2 pins when these pins' states
                       are not low. C1/C2 pins can be controlled through two different ways.
                       a. pull-up/pull-down resistors - make sure these pull-up resistors' VDD is the same
                          power source as to power PTN36001. When power to PTN36001 is off, power to
                          these pull-up resistors will be off as well.
                       b. external processor's GPIO - if PTN36001 is turned off when the external
                          processor's power stays on, processor should configure these GPIOs connected to
                          C1/C2 pins as output low (< 0.4 V) or tri-state mode (configure GPIOs as input
                          mode). This will make sure no current will be flowing into PTN36001 through
                          C1/C2 pins.
                   The Receive termination detection circuitry is implemented as part of a transmitter and
                   detects whether a load device with equivalent DC impedance ZRX_DC is present.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 18 and 19

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 19.
