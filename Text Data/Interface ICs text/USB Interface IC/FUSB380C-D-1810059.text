Autonomous USB Type-C
Passive Cable Marker
Description
   The FUSB380C provides a small footprint solution for passive                                       www.onsemi.com
cable applications. 28 V Tolerant VCONN and CC provides VBUS
shorting protection. One FUSB380C can be used in a VCONN
through Type−C cable application or two FUSB380Cs can be used in
each plug avoiding the high cost of routing VCONN through the
Type−C cable. The FUSB380C offers industry leading VCONN
operating range down to 2.4 V.                                                                             WLCSP12
