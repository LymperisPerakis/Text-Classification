USB2532
1.0        INTRODUCTION
The USB2532 is a low-power, OEM configurable, MTT (Multi-Transaction Translator) USB 2.0 hub controller with 2
downstream ports and advanced features for embedded USB applications. The USB2532 is fully compliant with the
USB 2.0 Specification, USB 2.0 Link Power Management Addendum and will attach to an upstream port as a Full-Speed
hub or as a Full-/Hi-Speed hub. The 2-port hub supports Low-Speed, Full-Speed, and Hi-Speed (if operating as a Hi-
Speed hub) downstream devices on all of the enabled downstream ports.
The USB2532 has been specifically optimized for embedded systems where high performance, and minimal BOM costs
are critical design requirements. Standby mode power has been minimized and reference clock inputs can be aligned
to the customer’s specific application. Additionally, all required resistors on the USB ports are integrated into the hub,
including all series termination and pull-up/pull-down resistors on the D+ and D– pins.
The USB2532 supports both upstream battery charger detection and downstream battery charging. The USB2532 inte-
grated battery charger detection circuitry supports the USB-IF Battery Charging (BC1.2) detection method and most
Apple devices. These circuits are used to detect the attachment and type of a USB charger and provide an interrupt
output to indicate charger information is available to be read from the device’s status registers via the serial interface.
The USB2532 provides the battery charging handshake and supports the following USB-IF BC1.2 charging profiles:
•  DCP: Dedicated Charging Port (Power brick with no data)
•  CDP: Charging Downstream Port (1.5A with data)
•  SDP: Standard Downstream Port (0.5A with data)
•  Custom profiles loaded via SMBus or OTP
The USB2532 provides an additional USB endpoint dedicated for use as a USB to I2C interface, allowing external cir-
cuits or devices to be monitored, controlled, or configured via the USB interface. Additionally, the USB2532 includes
many powerful and unique features such as:
FlexConnect, which provides flexible connectivity options. The USB2532’s downstream port 1 can be swapped with
the upstream port, allowing master capable devices to control other devices on the hub.
MultiTRAK™ Technology, which utilizes a dedicated Transaction Translator (TT) per port to maintain consistent full-
speed data throughput regardless of the number of active downstream connections. MultiTRAKTM outperforms conven-
tional USB 2.0 hubs with a single TT in USB full-speed data transfers.
PortMap, which provides flexible port mapping and disable sequences. The downstream ports of a USB2532 hub can
be reordered or disabled in any sequence to support multiple platform designs with minimum effort. For any port that is
disabled, the USB2532 hub controllers automatically reorder the remaining ports to match the USB host controller’s port
numbering scheme.
PortSwap, which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows direct alignment
of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors to avoid uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differential signals on the
PCB.
PHYBoost, which provides programmable levels of Hi-Speed USB signal drive
strength in the downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost attempts to restore USB sig-
nal integrity in a compromised system environment. The graphic on the right shows
an example of Hi-Speed USB eye diagrams before and after PHYBoost signal integ-
rity restoration.
VariSense, which controls the USB receiver sensitivity enabling programmable lev-
els of USB signal receive sensitivity. This capability allows operation in a sub-optimal
system environment, such as when a captive USB cable is used.
The USB2532 is available in commercial (0°C to +70°C) and industrial (-40°C to +85°C) temperature range versions.

3.1       Pin Descriptions
This section provides a detailed description of each pin. The signals are arranged in functional groups according to their
associated interface.
The “_N” symbol in the signal name indicates that the active, or asserted, state occurs when the signal is at a low voltage
level. For example, RESET_N indicates that the reset signal is active low. When “_N” is not present after the signal
name, the signal is asserted when at the high voltage level.
The terms assertion and negation are used exclusively. This is done to avoid confusion when working with a mixture of
“active low” and “active high” signals. The term assert, or assertion, indicates that a signal is active, independent of
whether that level is represented by a high or low voltage. The term negate, or negation, indicates that a signal is inac-
tive.
   Note:    The buffer type for each signal is indicated in the BUFFER TYPE column of Table 3-1. A description of the
            buffer types is provided in Section 3.3.
   Note:    Compatibility with the UCS100x family of USB port power controllers requires the UCS100x be connected
            on Port 1 of the USB2532. Additionally, both PRTPWR1 and OCS1_N must be pulled high at Power-On
            Reset (POR).

  Note 3-1      The LOCAL_PWR pin is sampled during the configuration state, immediately after negation of reset,
                to determine whether the device is bus-powered or self-powered. When configuration is complete,
                the latched value will not change until the next reset assertion. To enable dynamic local power
                switching, the DYNAMIC_POWER register at location 0x4134 must be programmed with 0x41. If
                dynamic power switching is not required, the DYNAMIC_POWER register should be left at the default
                value of 0xC1. Programming may be performed through the SMBus interface, or permanently via
                OTP. Refer to the Protouch MPT User Manual for additional information.
  Note 3-2      If using the local power detect function (LOCAL_PWR pin), the NON_REM[1:0] configuration straps
                cannot be used to configure the non-removable state of the USB ports. In this case, the non-
                removable state of the ports must be configured in internal device registers via the Protouch tool or
                SMBus.
  Note 3-3      Configuration strap values are latched on Power-On Reset (POR) and the rising edge of RESET_N
                (external chip reset). Configuration straps are identified by an underlined symbol name. Signals that
                function as configuration straps must be augmented with an external resistor when connected to a
                load. Refer to Section 6.3, "Device Configuration Straps," on page 22 for additional information.

4.0       POWER CONNECTIONS
4.1       Integrated Power Regulators
The integrated 3.3V and 1.2V power regulators allow the device to be supplied via a single 3.3V external power supply.
The regulators are controlled by RESET_N. When RESET_N is brought high, the 3.3V regulator will turn on. When
RESET_N is brought low the 3.3V regulator will turn off.

USB2532
5.1        Boot Sequence
5.1.1         STANDBY MODE
If the external hardware reset is asserted, the hub will be in Standby Mode. This mode provides a very low power state
for maximum power efficiency when no signaling is required. This is the lowest power state. In Standby Mode all internal
regulators are powered off, the PLL is not running, and core logic is powered down in order to minimize power consump-
tion. Because core logic is powered off, no configuration settings are retained in this mode and must be re-initialized
after RESET_N is negated high.
5.1.2         HARDWARE INITIALIZATION STAGE (HW_INIT)
The first stage is the initialization stage and occurs on the negation of RESET_N. In this stage the 1.2V regulator is
enabled and stabilizes, internal logic is reset, and the PLL locks if a valid REFCLK is supplied. Configuration registers
are initialized to their default state and strap input values are latched. The device will complete initialization and auto-
matically enter the next stage. Because the digital logic within the device is not yet stable, no communication with the
device using the SMBus is possible. Configuration registers are initialized to their default state.
If there is a REFCLK present, the next state is SW_INIT.
5.1.3         SOFTWARE INITIALIZATION STAGE (SW_INIT)
Once the hardware is initialized, the firmware can begin to execute from the internal ROM. The firmware checks the
CFG_SEL[1:0] configuration strap values to determine if it is configured for I2C Master loading. If so, the configuration
is loaded from an external I2C ROM in the device’s CONFIG state.
For all other configurations, the firmware checks for the presence of an external I2C/SMBus. It does this by asserting
two pull down resistors on the data and clock lines of the bus. The pull downs are typically 50Kohm. If there are 10Kohm
pull-ups present, the device becomes aware of the presence of an external SMBus/I2C bus. If a bus is detected, the
firmware transitions to the SOC_CFG state.
5.1.4         SOC CONFIGURATION STAGE (SOC_CFG)
In this stage, the SOC may modify any of the default configuration settings specified in the integrated ROM such as USB
device descriptors, or port electrical settings, and control features such as upstream battery charging detection.
There is no time limit. In this stage the firmware will wait indefinitely for the SMBus/I2C configuration. When the SOC
has completed configuring the device, it must write to register 0xFF to end the configuration.
5.1.5         CONFIGURATION STAGE (CONFIG)
Once the SOC has indicated that it is done with configuration, then all the configuration data is combined. The default
data, the SOC configuration data, the OTP data are all combined in the firmware and device is programmed.
After the device is fully configured, it will go idle and then into suspend if there is no VBUS or Hub.Connect present.
Once VBUS is present, and upstream battery charging is enabled, the device will transition to the Battery Charger
Detection Stage (CHGDET). If VBUS is present, and upstream battery charging is not enabled, the device will transitions
to the Connect (Hub.Connect) stage.
5.1.6         BATTERY CHARGER DETECTION STAGE (CHGDET)
After configuration, if enabled, the device enters the Battery Charger Detection Stage. If the battery charger detection
feature was disabled during the CONFIG stage, the device will immediately transition to the Hub Connect (Hub.Con-
nect) stage. If the battery charger detection feature remains enabled, the battery charger detection sequence is started
automatically.
If the charger detection remains enabled, the device will transition to the Hub.Connect stage if using the hardware detec-
tion mechanism.
5.1.7         HUB CONNECT STAGE (HUB.CONNECT)
Once the CHGDET stage is completed, the device enters the Hub.Connect stage.
5.1.8         NORMAL MODE
Lastly the SOC enters the Normal Mode of operation. In this stage, full USB operation is supported under control of the
USB Host on the upstream port. The device will remain in the normal mode until the operating mode is changed by the
system.

If RESET_N is asserted low, then Standby Mode is entered. The device may then be placed into any of the designated
Hub stages. Asserting the soft disconnect on the upstream port will cause the Hub to return to the Hub.Connect stage
until the soft disconnect is negated.
To save power, communication over the SMBus is not supported while in USB Suspend. The system can prevent the
device from going to sleep by asserting the ClkSusp control bit of the Configure Portable Hub Register anytime before
entering USB Suspend. While the device is kept awake during USB Suspend, it will provide the SMBus functionality at
the expense of not meeting USB requirements for average suspend current consumption.

6.0       DEVICE CONFIGURATION
The device supports a large number of features (some mutually exclusive), and must be configured in order to correctly
function when attached to a USB host controller. The hub can be configured either internally or externally depending on
the implemented interface.
Microchip provides a comprehensive software programming tool, Pro-Touch, for configuring the USB2532 functions,
registers and OTP memory. All configuration is to be performed via the Pro-Touch programming tool. For additional infor-
mation on the Pro-Touch programming tool, contact your local Microchip sales representative.
6.1       Configuration Method Selection
The CFG_SEL[1:0] configuration straps and the SDA pin are used to determine the hub configuration method, as shown
in Table 6-1. The software reads the SDA pin and the CFG_SEL[1:0] bits and configures the system appropriately.

6.3        Device Configuration Straps
Configuration straps are multi-function pins that are driven as outputs during normal operation. During a Power-On
Reset (POR) or an External Chip Reset (RESET_N), these outputs are tri-stated. The high or low state of the signal is
latched following de-assertion of the reset and is used to determine the default configuration of a particular feature. Con-
figuration straps are latched as a result of a Power-On Reset (POR) or a External Chip Reset (RESET_N). Configuration
strap signals are noted in Section 3.0, "Pin Descriptions," on page 7 and are identified by an underlined symbol name.
The following sub-sections detail the various configuration straps.
Configuration straps include internal resistors in order to prevent the signal from floating when unconnected. If a partic-
ular configuration strap is connected to a load, an external pull-up or pull-down should be used to augment the internal
resistor to ensure that it reaches the required voltage level prior to latching. The internal resistor can also be overridden
by the addition of an external resistor.
   Note:
• The system designer must ensure that configuration straps meet the timing requirements specified in Section
   9.6.2, "Reset and Configuration Strap Timing," on page 35 and Section 9.6.1, "Power-On Configuration Strap
   Valid Timing," on page 35. If configuration straps are not at the correct voltage level prior to being latched, the
   device may capture incorrect strap values.
• Configuration straps must never be driven as inputs. If required, configuration straps can be augmented, or over-
   ridden with external resistors.
6.3.1        NON-REMOVABLE DEVICE (NON_REM[1:0])
The NON_REM[1:0] configuration straps are sampled at RESET_N negation to determine if ports [2:1] contain perma-
nently attached (non-removable) devices as follows. Additionally, because the SUSP_IND indicator functionality is
shared with the NON_REM0 configuration strap, the active state of the LED connected to SUSP_IND will be determined
as follows:

            NON_REM[1:0]                                                      Definition
                    ‘00’                  All USB ports removable, SUSP_IND LED active high
                    ‘01’                  Port 1 is non-removable, SUSP_IND LED active low
                    ‘10’                  Ports 1 & 2 are non-removable, SUSP_IND LED active high
                    ‘11’                  Ports 1 & 2 are non-removable, SUSP_IND LED active low
   Note:     If using the local power detect function (LOCAL_PWR pin), the NON_REM[1:0] configuration straps cannot
             be used to configure the non-removable state of the USB ports. In this case, the non-removable state of
             the ports must be configured in internal device registers via the Protouch tool or SMBus.

port. For example, if BC_EN1 is driven high during the configuration strap latching time, downstream port 1 will indicate
support of battery charging. Refer to Section 8.1.2, "Downstream Battery Charging," on page 27 for additional informa-
tion on battery charging.

generates the serial clock SCL, controls the bus access (determines which device acts as the transmitter and which
device acts as the receiver), and generates the START and STOP conditions.
   Note:
• Extensions to the I2C Specification are not supported.
• All device configuration must be performed via the Pro-Touch Programming Tool. For additional information on

7.1.1         I2C MESSAGE FORMAT
7.1.1.1         Sequential Access Writes
The I2C interface supports sequential writing of the device’s register address space. This mode is useful for configuring
contiguous blocks of registers. Figure 7-1 shows the format of the sequential write operation. Where color is visible in
the figure, blue indicates signaling from the I2C master, and gray indicates signaling from the slave.
FIGURE 7-1:              I2C SEQUENTIAL ACCESS WRITE FORMAT
    S    7-Bit Slave Address    0    A     xxxxxxxx    A    nnnnnnnn      A              ...     nnnnnnnn       A      P

                                          (bits 7-0)
In this operation, following the 7-bit slave address, the 8-bit register address is written indicating the start address for
sequential write operation. Every subsequent access is a data write to a data register, where the register address incre-
ments after each access and an ACK from the slave occurs. Sequential write access is terminated by a Stop condition.
7.1.1.2         Sequential Access Reads
The  I2C  interface supports direct reading of the device registers. In order to read one or more register addresses, the
starting address must be set by using a write sequence followed by a read. The read register interface supports auto-
increment mode. The master must send a NACK instead of an ACK when the last byte has been transferred.
In this operation, following the 7-bit slave address, the 8-bit register address is written indicating the start address for
the subsequent sequential read operation. In the read sequence, every data access is a data read from a data register
where the register address increments after each access. The write sequence can end with optional Stop (P). If so, the
read sequence must begin with a Start (S). Otherwise, the read sequence must start with a Repeated Start (Sr).

7.1.2         PULL-UP RESISTORS FOR I2C
The circuit board designer is required to place external pull-up resistors (10 k recommended) on the SDA & SCL sig-
nals (per SMBus 1.0 Specification) to Vcc in order to assure proper operation.
7.2        SMBus Slave Interface
The USB2532 includes an integrated SMBus slave interface, which can be used to access internal device run time reg-
isters or program the internal OTP memory. SMBus detection is accomplished by detection of pull-up resistors (10 K
recommended) on both the SMBDATA and SMBCLK signals. To disable the SMBus, a pull-down resistor of 10 K must
be applied to SMBDATA. The SMBus interface can be used to configure the device as detailed in Section 6.1, "Config-
uration Method Selection," on page 20.
   Note:      All device configuration must be performed via the Pro-Touch Programming Tool. For additional information
              on the Pro-Touch programming tool, contact your local Microchip sales representative.

8.0       FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
This chapter provides additional functional descriptions of key device features.
8.1       Battery Charger Detection & Charging
The USB2532 supports both upstream battery charger detection and downstream battery charging. The integrated bat-
tery charger detection circuitry supports the USB-IF Battery Charging (BC1.2) detection method and most Apple
devices. These circuits are used to detect the attachment and type of a USB charger and provide an interrupt output to
indicate charger information is available to be read from the device’s status registers via the serial interface. The
USB2532 provides the battery charging handshake and supports the following USB-IF BC1.2 charging profiles:
•  DCP: Dedicated Charging Port (Power brick with no data)
•  CDP: Charging Downstream Port (1.5A with data)
•  SDP: Standard Downstream Port (0.5A with data)
•  Custom profiles loaded via SMBus or OTP
The following sub-sections detail the upstream battery charger detection and downstream battery charging features.
8.1.1        UPSTREAM BATTERY CHARGER DETECTION
Battery charger detection is available on the upstream facing port. The detection sequence is intended to identify char-
gers which conform to the Chinese battery charger specification, chargers which conform to the USB-IF Battery Charger
Specification 1.2, and most Apple devices.
In order to detect the charger, the device applies and monitors voltages on the upstream DP and DM pins. If a voltage
within the specified range is detected, the device will be updated to reflect the proper status.
The device includes the circuitry required to implement battery charging detection using the Battery Charging Specifi-
cation. When enabled, the device will automatically perform charger detection upon entering the Hub.ChgDet stage in
Hub Mode. The device includes a state machine to provide the detection of the USB chargers listed in the table below.

If a custom charger detection algorithm is desired, the SMBus registers can also be used to control the charger detection
block to implement a custom charger detection algorithm. In order to avoid negative interactions with automatic battery
charger detection or normal hub operation, the user should only attempt Custom battery charger detection during the
Hub.Config stage or Hub.Connect stage. No logic is implemented to disable custom detection at other times - it is up to
the user software to observe this restriction.
There is a possibility that the system is not running the reference clock when battery charger detection is required (for
example if the battery is dead or missing). During the Hub.WaitRefClk stage the battery charger detection sequence can
be configured to be followed regardless of the activity of REFCLK by relying on the operation of the internal oscillator.

8.1.2        DOWNSTREAM BATTERY CHARGING
The device can be configured by an OEM to have any of the downstream ports to support battery charging. The Hub's
role in battery charging is to provide an acknowledge to a device's query as to if the hub system supports USB battery
charging. The hub silicon does not provide any current or power FETs or any additional circuitry to actually charge the
device. Those components must be provided as externally by the OEM.

If the OEM provides an external supply capable of supplying current per the battery charging specification, the hub can
be configured to indicate the presence of such a supply to the device. This indication, via the PRTPWR[1:4] output pins,
is on a per/port basis. For example, the OEM can configure two ports to support battery charging through high current
power FET's and leave the other two ports as standard USB ports.
8.1.2.1        Downstream Battery Charging Modes
In the terminology of the USB Battery Charging Specification, if a port is configured to support battery charging, the
downstream port is a considered a CDP (Charging Downstream Port) if connected to a USB host, or a DCP (Dedicated
Charging Port) if not connected to a USB host. If the port is not configured to support battery charging, the port is con-
sidered an SDP (Standard Downstream Port). All charging ports have electrical characteristics different from standard
non-charging ports.
A downstream port will behave as a CDP, DCP, or SDP depending on the port’s configuration and mode of operation.
The port will not switch between a CDP/DCP or SDP at any time after initial power-up and configuration. A downstream
port can be in one of three modes shown in the table below.

8.1.2.2        Downstream Battery Charging Configuration
Configuration of ports to support battery charging is performed via the BC_EN configuration straps, USB configuration,
SMBus configuration, or OTP. The Battery Charging Enable Register provides per port battery charging configuration.
Starting from bit 1, this register enables battery charging for each down stream port when asserted. Bit 1 represents port
1 and so on. Each port with battery charging enabled asserts the corresponding PRTPWR register bit.

USB2532
8.1.2.3          Downstream Over-Current Management
It is the devices responsibility to manage over-current conditions. Over-Current Sense (OCS) is handled according to
the USB specification. For battery charging ports, PRTPWR is driven high (asserted) after hardware initialization. If an
OCS event occurs, the PRTPWR is negated. PRTPWR will be negated for all ports in a ganged configuration. Only the
respective PRTPWR will be negated in the individual configuration.
If there is an over-current event in DCP mode, the port is turned off for one second and is then re-enabled. If the OCS
event persists, the cycle is repeated for a total or three times. If after three attempts, the OCS still persists, the cycle is
still repeated, but with a retry interval of ten seconds. This retry persists for indefinitely. The indefinite retry prevents a
defective device from permanently disabling the port.
In CDP or SDP mode, the port power and over-current events are controlled by the USB host. The OCS event does not
have to be registered. When and if the hub is connected to a host, the host will initialize the hub and enable its port
power. If the over current still exists, it will be notified at that point.
8.2          Flex Connect
This feature allows the upstream port to be swapped with downstream physical port 1. Only downstream port 1 can be
swapped physically. Using port remapping, any logical port (number assignment) can be swapped with the upstream
port (non-physical).
Flex Connect is enabled/disabled via two control bits in the Connect Configuration Register. The FLEXCONNECT con-
figuration bit switches the port, and EN_FLEX_MODE enables the mode.
8.2.1          PORT CONTROL
Once EN_FLEX_MODE bit is set, the functions of certain pins change, as outlined below.
If EN_FLEX_MODE is set and FLEXCONNECT is not set:
1.     PRTPWR1 enters combined mode, becoming PRTPWR1/OCS1_N
2.     OCS1_N becomes a don’t care
3.     SUSPEND outputs ‘0’ to keep any upstream power controller off
If EN_FLEX_MODE is set and FLEXCONNECT is set:
1.     The normal upstream VBUS pin becomes a don’t care
2.     PRTPWR1 is forced to a ‘1’ in combined mode, keeping the port power on to the application processor.
3.     OCS1 becomes VBUS from the application processor through a GPIO
4.     SUSPEND becomes PRTPWR1/OCS1_N for the port power controller for the connector port
8.3          Resets
The device has the following chip level reset sources:
• Power-On Reset (POR)
• External Chip Reset (RESET_N)
• USB Bus Reset
8.3.1          POWER-ON RESET (POR)
A power-on reset occurs whenever power is initially supplied to the device, or if power is removed and reapplied to the
device. A timer within the device will assert the internal reset per the specifications listed in Section 9.6.1, "Power-On
Configuration Strap Valid Timing," on page 35.
8.3.2          EXTERNAL CHIP RESET (RESET_N)
A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N, after all power supplies are within operating range, per the
specifications in Section 9.6.2, "Reset and Configuration Strap Timing," on page 35. While reset is asserted, the device
(and its associated external circuitry) enters Standby Mode and consumes minimal current.
Assertion of RESET_N causes the following:
1.     The PHY is disabled and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
2.     All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.

3.   All internal registers return to the default state.
4.   The external crystal oscillator is halted.
5.   The PLL is halted.
   Note:      All power supplies must have reached the operating levels mandated in Section 9.2, "Operating Condi-
              tions**," on page 32, prior to (or coincident with) the assertion of RESET_N.
8.3.3         USB BUS RESET
In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the device, the device performs the following:
   Note:      The device does not propagate the upstream USB reset to downstream devices.
1.   Sets default address to 0.
2.   Sets configuration to: Unconfigured.
3.   Moves device from suspended to active (if suspended).
4.   Complies with Section 11.10 of the USB 2.0 Specification for behavior after completion of the reset sequence.
The host then configures the device in accordance with the USB Specification.
8.4        Link Power Management (LPM)
The device supports the L0 (On), L1 (Sleep), and L2 (Suspend) link power management states per the USB 2.0 Link
Power Management Addendum. These supported LPM states offer low transitional latencies in the tens of microsec-
onds versus the much longer latencies of the traditional USB suspend/resume in the tens of milliseconds. The supported
LPM states are detailed in Table 8-3. For additional information, refer to the USB 2.0 Link Power Management Adden-
dum.

   Note:
• State change timing is approximate and is measured by change in power consumption.
• System clocks are stopped only in suspend mode or when power is removed from the device.
8.5        Remote Wakeup Indicator (SUSP_IND)
The remote wakeup indicator feature uses the SUSP_IND as a side band signal to wake up the host when in suspend.
This feature is enabled and disabled via the HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT configuration bit in the hub configuration space
register CFG3. The only way to control the bit is by configuration EEPROM, SMBus or internal ROM default setting. The
state is only modified during a power on reset, or hardware reset. No dynamic reconfiguring of this capability is possible.
When HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT = ‘0’, Normal Resume Behavior per the USB 2.0 specification
When HUB_RESUME_INHIBIT = ‘1’, Modified Resume Behavior is enabled
Refer to the following subsections for additional details.
8.5.1         NORMAL RESUME BEHAVIOR
VBUS_DET is used to detect presence of the Host. If VBUS_DET = ‘1’, then D+ pull-up is asserted and normal USB
functionality is enabled. The SUSP_IND provides an indication of the active or suspended state of the hub.
The Hub will drive a ‘K’ on the upstream port if required to do so by USB protocol.

USB2532
If VBUS_DET = ‘0’, then the D+ pull-up is negated. If battery charging is not enabled, the internal hub logic will be reset,
thus negating all downstream ports and associated downstream VBUS enable signals. The hub will need to be re-enu-
merated to function, much like a new connect or after a complete system reset.
8.5.2        MODIFIED RESUME BEHAVIOR
When the modified resume feature is enabled, the hub functions as follows:
VBUS_DET is used to detect presence of the Host. If VBUS_DET = ‘1’, then D+ pull-up is asserted and normal USB
functionality is enabled. SUSP_IND provides an indication of the active or suspended state of the hub.
The device will drive a ‘K’ on the upstream port and downstream ports if required to do so by USB protocol. The device
will act as a controlling hub if required to do so by the USB protocol.
If VBUS_DET = ‘0’, then the D+ pull-up is negated, but the hub will not be internally reset. It will power-on the down-
stream ports. The hub is able to continue to detect downstream remote wake events.
SUSP_IND provides an indication of the active or suspended state of the hub.
If a USB 2.0 specification compliant resume or wake event is detected by the device, the device is remote wake enabled,
and a port status change event occurs, SUSP_IND will be driven for the time given in the GLOBAL_RESUME_TIME
register.
If a remote wake event is detected on a downstream port:
1.    Device disconnect
2.    Device connect
3.    A currently connected device requests remote wake-up.
   Note:     Downstream resume events are filtered for approximately 100uS by internal logic.
The device will not drive a ‘K’ on the upstream port. Instead, the SUSP_IND will be driven for approximately 14 ms. The
‘K’ is not driven upstream because this would potentially back drive a powered-down host. The device will drive
RESUME to only the downstream ports which transmitted the remote wake signal per the requirements of the USB 2.0
specification for controlling hub behavior.
   Note:     SUSP_IND is a one shot event. It will assert with each wake event detection. It will not repeatedly assert
             in proxy for downstream devices.
For the case where the Host responds and turns on VBUS and can drive a ‘K’ downstream within the 14 ms time frame
of a standard resume (measured from the SUSP_IND pin), then the hub detects the ‘K’. It will discontinue “Controlling
Hub” activities, drive resume signaling on any other ports, and function as expected per the USB 2.0 Specification with
respect to a resume event. It will permit the host to take over resume signaling.
For the case where the host is not able to drive a ‘K’ within the 14 ms time frame, the hub will stop sending a ‘K’ on the
upstream and downstream ports. It must follow through as a controlling hub and properly terminate the resume with
either an EOP or with HS terminations as is currently implemented in the selective resume case, per the USB specifi-
cation.
8.6       High Speed Indicator (HS_IND)
The HS_IND pin can be used to drive an LED. The active state of the LED will be determined as follows:
• If CFG_SEL1 = ‘0’, HS_IND is active high.
• If CFG_SEL1 = ‘1’, then HS_IND is active low.
Assertion of HS_IND indicates the device is connected at high speed. Negation of HS_IND indicates the device is con-
nected at full speed.
   Note:     This pin shares functionality with the CFG_SEL1 configuration strap. The logic state of this pin is internally
             latched on the rising edge of RESET_N (RESET_N negation), and is used to determine the hub configu-
             ration method. Refer to Section 6.3.2, "Configuration Select (CFG_SEL[1:0])," on page 23 for additional
             information.

  Note 9-1       When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the absolute
                 maximum ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage
                 spikes on their outputs when AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the
                 AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested to use a clamp
                 circuit.
  Note 9-2       This rating does not apply to the following signals: All USB DM/DP pins, XTAL1/REFCLK, XTAL2.
  Note 9-3       This rating applies only when VDD33 is powered.
*Stresses exceeding those listed in this section could cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress rating

   Note 9-4      The power supply rise time requirements vary dependent on the usage of the external reset
                 (RESET_N). If RESET_N is asserted at power-on, the power supply rise time must be 10mS or less
                 (tRT(max) = 10mS). If RESET_N is not used at power-on (tied high), the power supply rise time must
                 be 1mS or less (tRT(max) = 1mS). Figure 9-1 illustrates the supply rise time requirements.

The device can accept either a 24 MHz crystal or a 24 MHz single-ended clock oscillator input. If the single-ended clock
oscillator method is implemented, XTAL1 should be left unconnected and REFCLK should be driven with a clock that
adheres to the specifications outlined in Section 9.7.2, "External Reference Clock (REFCLK)".
9.7.1        OSCILLATOR/CRYSTAL
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XTAL1I/XTAL2). See Table 9-8 for the recommended crystal specifications.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be super-
    seded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO REP-
