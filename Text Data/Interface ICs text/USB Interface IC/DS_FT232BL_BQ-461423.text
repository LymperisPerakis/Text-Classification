4    Function Description
The FT232B is a lead free version of the 2nd generation of FTDI’s USB to serial UART interface device
which simplifies USB to serial designs. This device not only adds extra functionality to its FT8U232AM
predecessor and reduces external component count, but also maintains a high degree of pin compatibility
with the original, making it easy to upgrade or cost reduce existing designs as well as increasing the
potential for using the device in new application areas. This section summarises the enhancements of
the 2nd generation device compared to its FT8U232AM predecessor.
4.1 Key Features and Enhancements from FT8U232AM
Integrated Power-On-Reset (POR) Circuit. The device now incorporates an internal POR
function. The existing RESET# pin is maintained in order to allow external logic to reset the
device where required, however for many applications this pin can now simply be hard wired to
VCC. In addition, a new reset output pin (RSTOUT#) is provided in order to allow the new POR
circuit to provide a stable reset to external MCU and other devices. RSTOUT# was the TEST pin
on the previous generation of devices.
Integrated RCCLK Circuit. In the previous devices, an external RC circuit was required to ensure
that the oscillator and clock multiplier PLL frequency was stable prior to enabling the clock
internal to the device. This circuit is now embedded on-chip – the pin assigned to this function
is now designated as the TEST pin and should be tied to GND for normal operation
Integrated Level Converter on UART interface and control signals. The previous FTDI devices drive
the UART and control signals at 5V CMOS logic levels. The FT232B has a separate VCCIO pin allowing the
device to directly interface to 3.3V and other logic families without the need for external level converter
Ics
Improved Power Management control for USB Bus Powered, high current devices. The previous
devices had a USBEN pin, which became active when the device was enumerated by USB. To provide
power control, this signal had to be externally gated with SLEEP# and RESET#.
This gating is now done on-chip – USBEN has now been replaced with the new PWREN# signal which can
be used to directly drive a transistor or P-Channel MOSFET in applications where power switching of
external circuitry is required. A new EEPROM based option makes the device pull gently down its UART
interface lines when the power is shut off (PWREN# is High). In this mode, any residual voltage on
external circuitry is bled to GND when power is removed thus ensuring that external circuitry controlled
by PWREN# resets reliably when power is restored
Lower Suspend Current. Integration of RCCLK within the device and internal design improvements
reduce the suspend current of the FT232B to under 200uA (excluding the 1.5k pull-up on USBDP) in USB
suspend mode. This allows greater margin for peripherals to meet the USB Suspend current limit of
500uA.
Programmable Receive Buffer Timeout. In the previous device, the receive buffer timeout flushed
remaining data from the receive buffer at a fixed 16ms timeout. This timeout is now programmable over
USB in 1ms increments from 1ms to 255ms, thus allowing the device to be better 10ptimized for
protocols requiring faster response times from short data packets.
TXDEN Timing fix. TXDEN timing has now been fixed to remove the external delay that was previously
required for RS485 applications at high baud rates. TXDEN now works correctly during a transmit send-
break condition.
Relaxed VCC Decoupling. The FT232B devices now incorporate a level of on-chip VCC decoupling.
Though this does not eliminate the need for external decoupling capacitors, it significantly improves the
ease of PCB design requirements to meet FCC, CE and other EMI related specifications.
Improved PreScaler Granularity. The previous version of the Prescaler supported division by (n + 0),
(n+0.125), (n + 0.25) and (n + 0.5) where n is an integer between 2 and 16,384 (214). To this FTDI
have added (n + 0.375), (n + 0.625), (n + 0.75) and (n+ 0.875) which can be used to improve the
accuracy of some baud rates and generate new baud rates which were previously impossible (especially
with higher baud rates).
Bit Bang Mode. The 2nd generation device has a new option referred to as “Bit Bang” mode. In Bit Bang
mode, the eight UART interface control lines can be switched between UART interface mode and an 8-bit
Parallel IO port. Data packets can be sent to the device and they will be sequentially sent to the interface
at a rate controlled by the prescaler setting. As well as allowing the device to be used stand-alone as a
general purpose IO controller for example controlling lights, relays and switches, some other interesting

possibilities exist. For instance, it may be possible to connect the device to an SRAM configurable FPGA as
supplied by vendors such as Altera and Xilinx. The FPGA device would normally be un-configured (i.e.
have no defined function) at power-up. Application software on the PC could use Bit Bang Mode to
download configuration data to the FPGA which would define its hardware function, then after the FPGA
device is configured the FT232B can switch back into UART interface mode to allow the programmed
FPGA device to communicate with the PC over USB. This approach allows a customer to create a
“generic” USB peripheral whose hardware function can be defined under control of the application
software. The FPGA based hardware can be easily upgraded or totally changed simply by changing the
FPGA configuration data file. Application notes, software and development modules for this application
area will be available from FTDI and other 3rd parties.
PreScaler Divide By 1 Fix. The previous device had a problem when the integer part of the divisor was
set to 1. In the 2nd generation device setting the prescaler value to 1 gives a baud rate of 2 million baud
and setting it to zero gives a baud rate of 3 million baud. Non-integer division is not supported with
divisor values of 0 and 1.
Less External Support Components. As well as eliminating the RCCLK RC network, and for most
applications the need for an external reset circuit, we have also eliminated the requirement for a 100K
pull-up on EECS to select 6MHz operation. When the FT232B is being used without the configuration
EEPROM, EECS, EESK and EEDATA can now be left n/c. For circuits requiring a long reset time (where the
device is reset externally using a reset generator I.C., or reset is controlled by the IO port of a MCU,
FPGA or ASIC device) an external transistor circuit is no longer required as the 1.5k pull-up resistor on
USBDP can be wired to the RSTOUT# pin instead of to 3.3V. Note : RSTOUT# drives out at 3.3V level,
not at 5V VCC level. This is the preferred configuration for new designs.
Extended EEPROM Support. The previous generation of devices only supported EEPROM of type 93C46
(64 x 16 bit). The new devices will also work with EEPROM type 93C56 (128 x 16 bit) and 93C66 (256 x
16 bit). The extra space is not used by the device, however it is available for use by other external MCU /
logic whilst the FT232B is being held in reset.
USB 2.0 (full speed option). A new EEPROM based option allows the FT232B to return a USB 2.0
device descriptor as opposed to USB 1.1. Note : The device would be a USB 2.0 Full Speed device
(12Mb/s) as opposed to a USB 2.0 High Speed device (480Mb/s).
Multiple Device Support without EEPROM. When no EEPROM (or a blank or invalid EEPROM) is
attached to the device, the FT232B no longer gives a serial number as part of its USB descriptor. This
allows multiple devices to be simultaneously connected to the same PC. However, we still highly
recommend that EEPROM is used, as without serial numbers a device can only be identified by which hub
port in the USB tree it is connected to which can change if the end user re-plugs the device into a
different port

4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within the FT232B. Please refer to the block diagram shown
in Figure 2.1 .
The 3.3V LDO Regulator generates the 3.3 volt reference voltage for driving the USB transceiver cell
output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the 3V3OUT regulator
output pin. It also provides 3.3V power to the RSTOUT# pin. The main function of this block is to power
the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells rather than to power external logic. However,
external circuitry requiring 3.3V nominal at a current of not greater than 5mA could also draw its power
from the 3V3OUT pin if required.
USB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full-speed physical interface
to the USB cable. The output drivers provide 3.3 volt level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential
receiver and two single ended receivers provide USB data in, SEO and USB Reset condition detection.
USB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock
and data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.
6MHz Oscillator. The 6MHz Oscillator cell generates a 6MHz reference clock input to the x8 Clock
multiplier from an external 6MHz crystal or ceramic resonator
X8 Clock Multiplier. The x8 Clock Multiplier takes the 6MHz input from the Oscillator cell and generates
a 12MHz reference clock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and UART FIFO controller blocks. It also
generates a 48MHz reference clock for the USB DPPL and the Baud Rate Generator blocks.
Serial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it
performs bit stuffing/un-stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also checks the CRC on the USB data
stream.
USB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control
endpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol (Chapter 9) requests generated by the USB host
controller and the commands for controlling the functional parameters of the UART.
Dual Port TX Buffer (128 bytes). Data from the USB data out endpoint is stored in the Dual Port TX
buffer and removed from the buffer to the UART transmit register under control of the UART FIFO
controller.
Dual Port RX Buffer (384 bytes). Data from the UART receive register is stored in the Dual Port RX
buffer prior to being removed by the SIE on a USB request for data from the device data in endpoint.
UART FIFO Controller. The UART FIFO controller handles the transfer of data between the Dual FIFO RX
and TX buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers.
UART. The UART performs asynchronous 7/8 bit Parallel to Serial and Serial to Parallel conversion of the
data on the RS232 (RS422 and RS485) interface. Control signals supported by the UART include RTS,
CTS, DTR, DSR, DCD and RI. The UART provides a transmitter enable control signal (TXDEN) to assist
with interfacing to RS485 transceivers. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DTR/DSR and X-On/X-Off
handshaking options. Handshaking, where required, is handled in hardware to ensure fast response
times. The UART also supports the RS232 BREAK setting and detection conditions.
Baud Rate Generator. The Baud Rate Generator provides a x16 clock input to the UART from the
48MHz reference clock and consists of a 14 bit prescaler and 3 register bits which provide fine tuning of
the baud rate (used to divide by a whole number plus a fraction). This determines the Baud Rate of the
UART which is programmable from 183 baud to 3M baud.
RESET Generator. The Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device internal
circuitry on power up. RESET# input and RSTOUT# output are provided to allow other devices to reset
the FT232B to reset other devices respectively. During reset, RSTOUT# is driven low, otherwise it drives
out at the 3.3V provided by the onboard regulator. RSTOUT# can be used to control the 1.5k pull-up on
USBDP directly where delayed USB enumeration is required. It can also be used to reset other devices.
RSTOUT# will stay high-impedance for approximately 5ms after VCC has risen above 3.5V AND the
device oscillator is running AND RESET# is high. RESET# should be tied to VCC unless it is a requirement
to reset the device from external logic or an external reset generator IC.

EEPROM interface. Though the FT232B will work without the optional EEPROM, an external 93C46
(93C56 or 93C66) EEPROM can be used to customise the USB VID, PID, Serial Number, Product
Description Strings and Power Descriptor value of the FT232B for OEM applications. Other parameters
controlled by the EEPROM include Remote Wake Up, Soft Pull Down on Power-Off and USB 2.0 descriptor
modes. The EEPROM should be a 16 bit wide configuration such as a MicroChip 93LC46B or equivalent
capable of a 1Mb/s clock rate at VCC = 4.35V to 5.25V. The EEPROM is programmable-on board over
USB using a utility available from FTDI’s web site (http://www.ftdichip.com). This allows a blank part to be
soldered onto the PCB and programmed as part of the manufacturing and test process. If no EEPROM is
connected (or the EEPROM is blank), the FT232B will use its built-in default VID, PID Product Description
and Power Descriptor Value. In this case, the device will not have a serial number as part of the USB
descriptor.

6    USB Power Configurations
The following sections illustrate possible USB power configurations for the FT232B.
6.1 USB Bus Powered Configuration
Figure 6.1 Bus Powered Configuration
Figure 6.1 illustrates a typical USB bus powered configuration. A USB Bus Powered device gets its power
from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB Bus power devices are as follows:
    a) On plug-in, the device must draw no more than 100mA
    b) On USB Suspend the device must draw no more than 500uA (2.5mA for devices configured to
        support remote wake-up).
    c) A Bus Powered High Power Device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use the PWREN#
        pin to keep the current below 100mA on plug-in and 500uA(2.5mA) on USB suspend.
    d) A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB Bus Powered Hub
    e) No device can draw more that 500mA from the USB Bus.
The power descriptor in the EEPROM should be programmed to match the current draw of the device.
PWRCTL (pin 14) is pulled low to configure the device with a USB Bus Power descriptor. A Ferrite Bead is
connected in series with USB power to prevent noise from the device and associated circuitry (EMI) being
radiated down the USB cable to the Host. The value of the Ferrite Bead depends on the total current
required by the circuit – a suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from Steward (www.steward.com)
for example Steward Part # MI0805K400R-00, also available as DigiKey Part # 240-1035-1.

                                                                             Clearance No.: FTDI# 171
6.2 Self Powered Configuration
Figure 6.2 Self Powered Configuration
Figure 6.2 illustrates a typical USB self powered configuration. A USB Self Powered device gets its power
from its own POWER SUPPLY and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic rules for USB Self
power devices are as follows:
     a) A Self-Powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB Host or Hub
         Controller is powered down.
     b) A Self Powered Device can take as much current as it requires during normal operation and USB
         suspend as it has its own POWER SUPPLY.
     c) A Self Powered Device can be used with any USB Host and both Bus and Self Powered USB Hubs
PWRCTL (pin 14) is pulled high to configure the device with a USB Bus Power descriptor. The power
descriptor in the EEPROM should be programmed to a value of zero. The USB power descriptor option in
the EEPROM should be programmed to a value of zero (self powered).
To meet requirement, the 1.5 K pull-up resistors on USBDP is connected to RSTOUT# as per the bus-
power circuit. However, the USB Bus Power is used to control the RESET# Pin of the FT232B device.
When the USB Host or Hub is powered up RSTOUT# will pull the 1.5K resistor on USBDP to 3.3V, thus
identifying the device as a full speed device to USB. When the USB Host or Hub power is off, RESET# will
go low and the device will be held in reset. As RESET# is low, RSTOUT# will also be low, so no current
will be forced down USBDP via the 1.5K pull-up resistor when the host or hub is powered down. Failure to
do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.
Note: When the FT232B is in reset, the UART interface pins all go tri-state. These pins have internal 200K
pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external logic.

Figure 6.3 shows how to configure the FT232B to interface with a 3.3V logic device. In this example, a
discrete 3.3V regulator is used to supply the 3.3V logic from the USB supply. VCCIO is connected to the
output of the 3.3V regulator, which in turn will cause the UART interface IO pins to drive out at 3.3V
level. For USB bus powered circuits some considerations have to be taken into account when selecting
the regulator:
    a) The regulator must be capable of sustaining its output voltage with an input voltage of 4.35 volts.
         A Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator must be selected.
    b) The quiescent current of the regulator must be low in order to meet the USB suspend total
         current requirement of <= 500uA during USB suspend.
An example of a regulator family that meets these requirements is the MicroChip MCP1700 Series. These
devices can supply up to 250mA current and have a quiescent current of under 1uA.
In some cases, where only a small amount of current is required (< 5mA) , it may be possible to use the
in-built regulator of the FT232B to supply the 3.3v without any other components being required. In this
case, connect VCCIO to the 3v3OUT pin of the FT232B.
Note: It should be emphasized that the 3.3V supply for VCCIO in a bus powered design with a 3.3V logic
interface should come from an LDO which is supplied by the USB bus, or from the 3V3OUT pin of the
FT232B, and not from any other source.

6.3.2 Self Powered Circuit with 3.3V logic drive / supply
Figure 6.4 Self Powered Circuit with 3.3V logic drive / supply
Figure 6.4 is an example of a USB self powered design with 3.3V interface. In this case VCCIO is supplied
by an external 3.3V supply in order to make the device IO pins drive out at 3.3V logic level, thus allowing
it to be connected to a 3.3V MCU or other external logic. A USB self powered design uses its own power
supplies, and does not draw any of its power from the USB bus. In such cases, no special care need be
taken to meet the USB suspend current (0.5 mA) as the device does not get its power from the USB port.
As with bus powered 3.3V interface designs, in some cases, where only a small amount of current is
required (<5mA), it may be possible to use the in-built regulator of the FT232B to supply the 3.3V without
any other components being required. In this case, connect VCCIO to the 3v3OUT pin of the FT232B.
Note that in this case PWRCTL is pulled up to VCCIO, not VCC.

6.4 Bus Powered Circuit (<=100mA) with Power Control
Figure 6.5 Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration
USB Bus powered circuits need to be able to power down in USB suspend mode in order to meet the <=
500uA total suspend current requirement (including external logic). This limit is 2.5mA for devices that
support remote wake-up. Some external logic can power itself down into a low current state by
monitoring the PWREN# pin. For external logic that cannot power itself down in that way, the FT232B
provides a simple but effective way of turning off power to external circuitry during USB suspend.
Figure 8.3 shows how to use a discrete P-Channel Logic Level MOSFET to control the power to external
logic circuits. A suitable device could be a Fairchild NDT456P, or International Rectifier IRLML6402, or
equivalent. It is recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1K series resistor and a 0.1 uF
capacitor are used to limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit
there is a danger that the transient power surge of the MOSFET turning on will reset the FT232B, or the
USB host / hub controller. The values used here allow attached circuitry to power up with a slew rate of
~12.5 V per millisecond, in other words the output voltage will transition from GND to 5V in
approximately 400 microseconds.
Alternatively, a dedicated power switch i.c. with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used instead of a MOSFET. A
suitable power switch I.C. for such an application would be a Micrel (www.micrel.com) MIC2025-2BM or
equivalent.
Please note the following points in connection with power controlled designs –
    a) The logic to be controlled must have its own reset circuitry so that it will automatically reset itself
         when power is re-applied on coming out of suspend.
    b) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the FT232B’s EEPROM.
    c) For USB high-power bus powered device (one that consumes greater than 100 mA, and up to 500
         mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the device should be set in the max
         power field in the EEPROM. A high-power bus powered device must use this descriptor in the
         EEPROM to inform the system of its power requirements.
    d) For 3.3V power controlled circuits VCCIO must not be powered down with the external circuitry
         (PWREN# gets its VCC supply from VCCIO). Either connect the power switch between the output
         of the 3.3V regulator and the external 3.3V logic OR if appropriate power VCCIO from the
         3V3OUT pin of the FT232B.

7    Device Configuration Examples
The following sections illustrate device configurations for the FT245BM.
7.1 Oscillator Configurations
Figure 7.1 3 Pin Ceramic Resonator Configuration                             Figure 7.2 Crystal or 2 Pin
                                                                          Ceramic Resonator Configuration
Figure 7.1 illustrates how to use the FT232B with a 3-Pin Ceramic Resonator. A suitable part would be a
ceramic resonator from Murata’s CERALOCK range or equivalent. 3-Pin ceramic resonators have the load
capacitors built into the resonator so no external loading capacitors are required. This makes for an
economical configuration. The accuracy of this Murata ceramic resonator is +/- 0.1% and it is specifically
designed for USB full speed applications. A 1 MegaOhm loading resistor across XTIN and XTOUT is
recommended in order to guarantee this level of accuracy.
Figure 7.2 illustrates how to use the FT232B with a 6MHz Crystal or 2-Pin Ceramic Resonator. These
devices do not have in-built loading capacitors. They must be added between XTIN, XTOUT and GND as
shown. A value of 27pF is shown as the capacitor in the example – this will be good for many crystals and
some resonators but do select the value based on the manufacturer’s recommendations wherever
possible. If using a crystal, use a parallel cut type. If using a resonator, see the previous note on
frequency accuracy.

7.2 EEPROM Configuration
Figure 7.3 EEPROM Configuration
Figure 7.3 illustrates how to connect the FT232B to the 93C46 (93C56 or 93C66) EEPROM. EECS (pin 32)
is directly connected to the chip select (CS) pin of the EEPROM. EESK (pin 1) is directly connected to the
clock (SK) pin of the EEPROM. EEDATA (pin 2) is directly connected to the Data In (Din) pin of the
EEPROM. There is a potential condition whereby both the Data Output (Dout) of the EEPROM can drive out
at the same time as the EEDATA pin of the FT232B. To prevent potential data clash in this situation, the
Dout of the EEPROM is connected to EEDATA of the FT232B via a 2.2K resistor.
Following a power-on reset or a USB reset, the FT232B will scan the EEPROM to find out (a) if an EEPROM
is attached to the Device and (b) if the data in the device is valid. If both conditions are true, then the
FT232B will use the data in the EEPROM, otherwise it will use its built-in default values. When a valid
command is issued to the EEPROM from the FT232B, the EEPROM will acknowledge the command by
pulling its Dout pin low. In order to check for this condition, it is necessary to pull Dout high using a 10K
resistor. If the command acknowledge doesn’t happen then EEDATA will be pulled high by the 10K resistor
during this part of the cycle and the device will detect an invalid command or no EEPROM present.
There are two varieties of these EEPROM’s from many sources such as Microchip, STMicro, ISSI etc. – one
is configured as being 16 bits wide, the other is configured as being 8 bits wide. The FT232B requires
EEPROMs with a 16-bit wide configuration such as the Microchip 93LC46B device. The EEPROM must be
capable of reading data at a 1Mb clock rate at a supply voltage of 4.35V to 5.25V. Most
available parts are capable of this.
Check the manufacturers’ data sheet to find out how to connect pins 6 and 7 of the EEPROM. Some
devices specify these as no-connect, others use them for selecting 8 / 16 bit mode or for test functions.
Some other parts have their pin out rotated by 90˚ . It is recommended to select the required part and its
options carefully.
It is possible to “share” the EEPROM between the FT232B and another external device such as an MCU.
However, this can only be done when the FT232B is held in the reset condition as it tri-states its EEPROM
interface at that time. A typical configuration would use four bit’s of an MCU IO Port. One bit would be
used to hold the FT232B reset (using RESET#) on power-up, the other three would connect to the EECS,
EESK and EEDATA pins of the FT232B in order to read / write data to the EEPROM at this time. Once the
MCU has read / written the EEPROM, it would take RESET# high to allow the FT232B to configure itself and
enumerate over USB.

8     UART Interface Configurations
The following sections illustrate possible UART configurations for the FT232B.
8.1 USB  RS232 Converter Configuration
Figure 8.1 USB-RS232 Converter Configuration
Figure 7.1 illustrates how to connect the UART interface of the FT232B to a TTL – RS232 Level Converter
I.C. to make a USB  RS232 converter using the popular “213” series of TTL to RS232 level converters.
These devices have 4 transmitters and 5 receivers in a 28-pin SSOP package and feature an in-built
voltage converter to convert the 5v (nominal) VCC to the ±9 volts required by RS232. An important
feature of these devices is the SHDN# pin which can power down the device to a low quiescent current
during USB suspend mode.
The device used in the example is a Exar/Sipex SP213EHCA which is capable of RS232 communication at
up to 500K baud. If a lower baud rate is acceptable, then several pin compatible alternatives are
available such as Sipex SP213ECA , Maxim MAX213CAI and Analog Devices ADM213E which are good for
communication at up to 115,200 baud. If a higher baud rate is desired, use a Maxim MAX3245CAI part
which is capable of RS232 communication at rates of up to 1M baud. The MAX3245 is not pin compatible
with the 213 series devices, also its SHDN pin is active high so connect this to PWREN# instead of
SLEEP#.

                                                                           Clearance No.: FTDI# 171
8.2 USB  RS422 Converter Configuration
Figure 8.2 USB-RS422 Converter Configuration
Figure 8.2 illustrates how to connect the UART interface of the FT232B to a TTL – RS422 Level Converter
I.C. to make a USB  RS422 converter. There are many such level converter devices available – this
example uses Exar/Sipex SP491 devices which have enables on both the transmitter and receiver.
Because the transmitter enable is active high, it is connected to the SLEEP# pin. The receiver enable is
active low and is connected to the PWREN# pin. This ensures that both the transmitters and receivers are
enabled when the device is active, and disabled when the device is in USB suspend mode. If the design is
USB BUS powered, it may be necessary to use a P-Channel logic level MOSFET (controlled by PWREN#) in
the VCC line of the SP491 devices to ensure that the USB standby current of 500uA is met.
The SP491 is good for sending and receiving data at a rate of up to 5M Baud – in this case the maximum
rate is limited to 3M Baud by the FT232B

                                                                              Clearance No.: FTDI# 171
8.3 USB  RS485 Converter Configuration
Figure 8.3 USB-RS485 Converter Configuration
Figure 7.3 illustrates how to connect the UART interface of the FT232B to a TTL – RS485 Level Converter
I.C. to make a USB => RS485 converter. This example uses the Exar/Sipex SP481 device but there are
similar parts available from Maxim and Analog Devices amongst others. The SP481 is a RS485 device in a
compact 8 pin SOP package. It has separate enables on both the transmitter and receiver. With RS485,
the transmitter is only enabled when a character is being transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN pin on
the FT232B is provided for exactly that purpose and so the transmitter enable is wired to TXDEN. The
receiver enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB
suspend mode.
RS485 is a multi-drop network – i.e. many devices can communicate with each other over a single two
wire cable connection. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. A link is
provided to allow the cable to be terminated if the device is physically positioned at either end of the
cable.
In this example the data transmitted by the FT232B is also received by the device that is transmitting.
This is a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the transmitted data
from the received data stream. With the FT232B it is possible to do this entirely in hardware – simply
modify the schematic so that RXD of the FT232B is the logical OR of the SP481 receiver output with
TXDEN using an HC32 or similar logic gate.

Figure 9.1 Dual LED Configuration                                          Figure 9.2 Single LED
Configuration
The FT232B has two IO pins dedicated to controlling LED status indicators, one for transmitted data the
other for received data. When data is being transmitted / received the respective pins drive from tri-state
to low in order to provide indication on the LEDs of data transfer. A digital one-shot timer is used so that
even a small percentage of data transfer is visible to the end user.
Figure 9.1 shows a configuration using two individual LED’s – one for transmitted data the other for
received data.
In figure 9.2, transmit and receive LED indicators are wire-OR’ed together to give a single LED indicator
which indicates any transmit or receive data activity.
Another possibility (not shown here) is to use a 3 pin common anode tri-color LED based on the circuit in
Figure 9.2 to have a single LED that can display activity in a variety of colors depending on the ratio of
transmit activity compared to receive activity.
Note that the LED’s are connected to VCCIO.
