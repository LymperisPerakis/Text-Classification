               Rev. 3 — 28 September 2018                                        Product data sheet
1 General description
            PTN36502/PTN36502A is a Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 1/ DP1.2 combo redriver that is
            optimized for USB 3.1 Gen 1 and DisplayPort applications on either the Downstream
            Facing Port (DFP) or Upstream Facing Port (UFP) by following the four high-speed
            differential data flows to extend the signal reach.
            PTN36502/PTN36502A addresses high-speed signal quality enhancement requirements
            for implementation of a USB Type-C interface in a platform that supports the VESA
            DisplayPort Alt Mode Standard v1.0a, includes a DisplayPort Branch or Sink function.
            PTN36502/PTN36502A has three ternary (3-level) configuration pins (SCL/C1, SDA/
            C2 and EN), and depending on the state of EN pin during Power-On Reset (POR),
                                                  2
            the device gets into GPIO mode or I C mode. When EN is driven LOW during POR,
            PTN36502/PTN36502A operates under GPIO mode, and these three ternary pins are
            used to configure DFP/UFP configuration followed by mode setting (USB 3.1 Gen 1 and
            DisplayPort TX and RX function selection), as well as selecting receive equalization,
            transmit de-emphasis and output swing level. To support applications that require greater
                                                                             2
            level of configurability, PTN36502/PTN36502A can operate in I C mode when EN pin is
            left open (OPEN/NC) during POR.
            For DisplayPort (DP) operation, PTN36502/PTN36502A has a built-in internal crossbar
            function that can swap AUXP and AUXN signals for supporting plug orientation.
            PTN36502/PTN36502A monitors the AUX transactions and adjusts the DisplayPort
            transmitter’s output swing and emphasis setting during DP Link training accordingly.
            PTN36502/PTN36502A has built-in advanced power management capability that enables
            significant power saving under USB 3.1 Gen 1 Low power modes (U2/U3). It can detect
            LFPS signaling and link electrical conditions and can dynamically activate/deactivate
            internal circuitry and logic. The device performs these actions without host software
            intervention and conserves power. The host processor keeps PTN36502/PTN36502A in
            deep power saving or USB operation mode until DP Alt mode is entered.
            PTN36502/PTN36502A is powered from a 1.8 V supply and it is available in an extremely
            thin HX2QFN24 package with 2.4 mm x 3.2 mm x 0.35 mm and 0.4 mm pitch.

                                                              Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 1 and DisplayPort v1.2 combo redriver
7       Functional description
                   7.1 USB 3.1 Gen 1 operation
                       PTN36502/PTN36502A supports USB redriver operation at 5 Gbps. The receive
                       equalization, transmit output swing and de-emphasis settings are configured via GPIO or
                        2
                       I C register settings.
                       PTN36502/PTN36502A has implemented an advanced power management scheme
                       that operates in tune with USB 3.1 Gen 1 Bus electrical condition. Though the device
                       does not decode USB power management commands (related to USB 3.1 Gen 1 U1/
                       U2/U3 transitions) exchanged between USB Host and Peripheral/Device, it relies on
                       bus electrical conditions and control pins/register settings to decide to be in one of the
                       following states:
                       • Active state wherein device is fully operational. In this state, USB connection exists and
                          the Receive Termination remains active.
                       • Power-saving state wherein some portions of the TX and RX channels are kept
                          enabled. In this state, squelching, LFPS detection and/or Receive termination detection
                          circuitry are active. Based on USB connection, there are two possibilities:
                          – No USB connection (also called Rx-detect state)
                            – Receive Termination detection circuitry keeps polling periodically
                            – RX and TX signal paths (including squelch detector) are not enabled
                            – Receive Termination is not active
                            – DC Common mode voltage level is not maintained
                          – When USB connection exists and when the link is in USB U2/U3 mode,
                            – Receive Termination detection circuitry keeps polling periodically
                            – RX and TX signal paths are not enabled; squelch detector is enabled
                            – Receive Termination is active
                            – DC Common mode voltage level is maintained
                   7.2 DisplayPort v1.2 operation
                       PTN36502/PTN36502A supports DisplayPort redriver operation at 1.62 Gbps, 2.7 Gbps
                       and 5.4 Gbps, with 2-tap pre-emphasis, pre-emphasis levels 0 to 3 and output swing
                       levels 0 to 3.
                       The DisplayPort mode is selected only when DP Alternate mode has been entered by
                       the host controller. Until then, PTN36502/PTN36502A stays in deep power saving or
                       USB 3.1 Gen 1 only mode. The DisplayPort source can activate power down via AUX
                       command.
                       The DisplayPort link rate, lane count, transmit output swing and pre-emphasis settings
                       are configured autonomously during DisplayPort link training phase based on AUX
                       communication exchanges between Source and Sink. In addition, the host can configure
                                                 2
                       these settings via I C interface.
                       Table 4 illustrates the various combinations allowed and supported in DisplayPort modes.
                       The host AP shall configure the settings only based on valid combinations listed in this
                       table. Note PTN36502/PTN36502A does not check if combination is valid while being
                       configured.

                         It is possible that only a subset of lanes gets selected during DP Link training and
                         remaining lanes are not active. Depending on the number of lanes selected, PTN36502/
                         PTN36502A is configured to operate with the selected lane count thereby saving power
                         consumption on unused lanes.
                   7.2.1 AUX crossbar switch
                         PTN36502/PTN36502A implements AUX crossbar switch with low insertion loss and
                         RON. All AUX traffic is passively passed through from one side to another. The switch
                         can be configured for ‘pass through’ mode or ‘pass through with cross’ mode. The host
                                                                                                                2
                         processor can configure the switch via GPIO or I C-bus interface. By default, the switch
                         is in Hi-Z state at power-on reset.
                   7.2.2 AUX monitoring and configuration
                         PTN36502/PTN36502A monitors DP AUX communication exchanges that occur between
                         DP source and DP sink and passes the AUX data in either direction (Source to sink and
                         Sink to source). In particular, it detects for AUX communication involving DPCD register
                         controls – Lane count, Link rate, Transmit output swing, Transmit pre-emphasis level,
                         Sleep, Wake, etc. and configures its operation suitably. It also performs inversion as
                         required for plug orientation in DFP configurations. At DP AUX PHY level, the required
                         local biasing and AC coupling capacitance are implemented.
                         When PTN36502/PTN36502A is placed in DFP mode, the polarity of internal AUX
                         monitoring signal follows the orientation of the cable connector plugged in. For example,
                         if the orientation is reversed on the Type-C connector, signals presented on DAUXP and
                         DAUXN pins will be interpreted as AUXN and AUXP signals internally.
                         When PTN36502/PTN36502A is placed in UFP mode, the polarity of internal AUX
                         monitoring signal is fixed regardless of orientation of cable connector plugged in. Signals
                         presented on DAUXP and DAUXN pins are interpreted as AUXP and AUXN signals
                         internally.
                         The list of DPCD registers (with only the relevant bit fields) supported are as follows:
                         • LINK_BW_SET
                         • LANE_COUNT_SET
                         • TRAINING_LANEx_SET (x=0-3) (the DP source issues this command after sending
                            the specific training pattern and so, the redriver must target very small delay)
                         • SET POWER
                                                                         2
                         • Other DPCD registers and I C over AUX transactions are not decoded
                         The applied values are expected to be within the capabilities of PTN36502/PTN36502A.
                         In case GPU sends out LANE_COUNT_SET =0 during AUX training, it is necessary to
                                     2
                         program I C register 0x06 to value of 0x06 after entering DP modes (either mode 2 or 3).

                                    Refer to Figure 4 for using PTN36502/PTN36502A in USB Type-C UFP receptacle
                                    application. In this configuration, downstream (right) side of PTN36502/PTN36502A
                                    is connected to USB 3.1 Gen 1 and/or DisplayPort hubs with integrated or on-board
                                    crossbar switch function, and upstream (left) side is connected to Type-C receptacle.
                                    Each pin on the upstream side of PTN36502/PTN36502A connecting to the Type-C
                                    connector has specific input/output configuration, and must match the signal assignments
                                    on the downstream side accordingly. Table 7 shows the upstream pin connection to
                                    Type-C receptacle.

                           The downstream pins of PTN36502/PTN36502A are connected to the USB 3.1 Gen
                           1 and/or DisplayPort hubs, with specific functions assigned to each differential signal.
                           For each pin assignment configuration below, PTN36502/PTN36502A controls which
                           transmitters or receivers to turn on or turn off, and operating in USB 3.1 Gen 1 mode, or
                           DisplayPort mode according to the mode setting.
                           A typical dongle has a fixed orientation design, usually the normal orientation. Therefore,
                           only one CC line is connected on the USB Type-C plug, and the other CC line is being
                           used for VCONN purpose. PTN36502/PTN36502A offers both normal and reversed
                           orientation pin outs, and can be adapted to different layout requirements. However, in a
                           typical dongle use case, only one orientation is necessary.

                   7.6.1 Operating mode selection (I C mode or GPIO mode)
                         Upon POR, PTN36502/PTN36502A starts to detect the state of EN pin. If EN is
                         not driven (or left OPEN) during POR, PTN36502/PTN36502A defaults to operate
                             2                                                                                             2             2
                         in I C mode, and EN pin has no function after entering I C mode. In I C mode,
                         PTN36502/PTN36502A is highly programmable. For more information, please reference

                         Section 7.6.6 for I C register details.
                         If EN is driven LOW during POR (through a GPIO from host processor or external
                         pull down resistor), the PTN36502/PTN36502A will be placed in GPIO mode. At the
                         same time, PTN36502/PTN36502A is configured in DFP, UFP, or UFP_Dongle modes
                         depending on SCL/C1 and SDA/C2 pins’ status (refer to Table 11 below). By default, the
                         chip is disabled in deep power saving mode after DFP/UFP/UFP_Dongle configuration
                         is detected. In the deep power saving mode, all PTN36502/PTN36502A line drivers and
                         input receive paths are terminated to ground with hi-ohmic resistors and AUX switches
                         are tri-stated, and mode configuration remains undetermined.

                         to 1. When the mode needs to be reconfigured (for example, change from USB 3.1 Gen
                         1+DP2Lane mode to DP4Lane mode) after EN is 1, a GPIO controller can toggle EN
                         pin to Hi-Z first and back to high again with new mode presented on SCL/C1 and SDA/

[1]   In USB 3.1 Gen 1 only mode, unused line drivers (TX) and input receivers (RX) are terminated to common mode (<2V) with hi-ohmic resistors
                                The AUX switch path remains enabled irrespective of DP lane sleep status as long as
                                the mode is configured for DP support. The AUX switch path is disabled only during deep
                                power saving state (when EN=0) or when mode is configured to USB 3.1 Gen 1 only
                                mode (mode1).
                    7.6.3 Mode transitions
                                PTN36502/PTN36502A implements USB 3.1 Gen 1 (single port), and Combo (DP/USB)
                                modes as per DP Alt mode specification. The mode transitions follow USB Safe state
                                transition requirements of USB Type-C cable and Connection specification, USB Power
                                Delivery and DisplayPort Alternate Mode specifications. Figure 10 illustrates the various
                                functional modes and deep power saving state transitions.
                                By default/POR, PTN36502/PTN36502A enters deep power saving mode state. In deep
                                power saving mode, all high-speed pins are put in safe state by pulling these pins to
                                ground with internal hi-ohmic resistors. The AUX switch path is disabled and AUX/SBU
                                pins can be put in safe state by pulling these to ground by means of hi-ohmic resistors
                                in the application. When a valid Type-C cable is connected, the host PD controller can
                                first place PTN36502/PTN36502A in USB 3.1 Gen 1 mode (mode 1). If DP Alt mode is
                                negotiated, PTN36502/PTN36502A adheres to the USB safe state requirements before
                                making the mode transition. Except for transitions from Mode 1 to Mode 2, all other
                                transitions need to happen via deep power saving state in order to meet USB Safe state
                                requirements.
                                When transitioning from Mode 1 to Mode 2, the USB 3.1 Gen 1 connectivity is left
                                undisturbed and 2-lane DP + AUX functionality is included. It is advised not to transition
                                from Mode 2 back to Mode 1 directly; internal power management scheme automatically
                                places DisplayPort operation in low power state.

                                 After EN pin is in steady state HIGH, C1/SCL and C2/SDA pins are used for upstream
                                 and downstream channel condition settings. PTN36502/PTN36502A samples these two
                                 pins every few milliseconds, and the configuration settings can be updated at any time,
                                 as long as EN is set to HIGH.
                                 C1 controls signal traces on the upstream (left) side (as shown in Figure 3) of the
                                 redriver. It controls receive equalization, transmit de-emphasis and output swing
                                 interfacing pins with the host processor interface.

                                 • When C1 = OPEN, the upstream (left) side of the redriver is optimized to drive medium
                                     channel trace length

                         All lanes of DP redriver use the same setting in GPIO mode whereas they can be
                         configured separately on a per lane basis. The transmit line driver output swing and pre-
                         emphasis control settings are set based on AUX transactions during DP Link training and
                                                                                2
                         these can also be configured via I C-bus interface.
                             2
                         In I C mode, AUX monitor training can be disabled with full control of output swing, pre-
                                                                                             2
                         emphasis and RX equalization through I C registers. If AUX monitor bit (in Register
                         0xoD) is enabled, the default value of output swing, pre-emphasis and RX equalization
                                                                                                 2
                         values will be based on the values in the I C registers. After AUX monitor training, output
                         swing and pre-emphasis will be adjusted; the RX equalization value is not modified.
                          2
                   7.6.6 I C configurability
                                                                              2
                         PTN36502/PTN36502A has an I C register interface that enables system integrator to
                         program register settings suitable as per application needs. Table 18 describes possible
                         settings for different functions of the device. Though the device can be pin configured
                         through board-strapping or it also allows the system integrator to override those settings
                                                                                           2
                         by programming the registers through I C.
                         After power-on, the device samples EN pin and if it is OPEN, the device defaults to
                                     2
                         operate in I C mode. The system integrator must program the registers of the device
                                                                                                                                                        2
                         for proper operation. Further, it is expected that the system integrator performs I C
                         configuration after power-on and before data transport is initiated over the link. If such an
                         operation is attempted during normal operation, the device may not behave as specified.
                         Note that registers 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09 and 0x0A hold DP link settings can be
                         modified by AUX monitor; therefore, these registers do not necessarily hold the latest
                         settings that are applied to the DP channel training through AUX.

                               PTN36502/PTN36502A supports programming of the registers through the I C interface.
                               Reading/writing the registers must be done according to the following sequences.
                               The read sequence contains two phases:
                               • Command phase
                               • Data phase
                                                                               2
                               The command phase is an I C write to PTN36502/PTN36502A that contains a single
                               data byte. The LS bit indicates if the command that is being executed will read or write
                               data from/to the device. The other 7 bits are the device slave address. The single data
                               byte followed is the register offset that is used to indicate which register address is being
                                                                                                                                2
                               accessed (read or written). The data phase is a second I C transaction that starts with 7-
                               bit slave address, with LS bit set to 1 indicating a read operation, followed by a 8-bit data
                               read back from the device register address.
                                                                         R/W(1)

                               The write sequence starts with 7-bit slave address, with LS bit set to 0 indicating a write
                               access. The next byte is the register offset that is used to indicate which device register
                               address is being written to. The last byte is the 8-bit register data that will be written to
                               the device register address.
