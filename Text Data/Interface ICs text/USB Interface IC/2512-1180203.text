Chapter 3 Pin Descriptions
3.1            PIN Descriptions
              This section provides a detailed description of each signal. The signals are arranged in functional
              groups according to their associated interface.
              The “N” symbol in the signal name indicates that the active, or asserted, state occurs when the signal
              is at a low voltage level. When “N” is not present before the signal name, the signal is asserted when
              at the high voltage level.
              The terms assertion and negation are used exclusively. This is done to avoid confusion when working
              with a mixture of “active low” and “active high” signals. The term assert, or assertion, indicates that a
              signal is active, independent of whether that level is represented by a high or low voltage. The term
              negate, or negation, indicates that a signal is inactive.

                                                     These pins connect to the upstream USB bus data signals
                                                     (Host port, or upstream hub).

                                                     Detects state of Upstream VBUS power. The SMSC Hub
                                                     monitors VBUS_DET to determine when to assert the internal
                                                     D+ pull-up resistor (signaling a connect event).
                                                     When designing a detachable hub, this pin must be connected
                                                     to the VBUS power pin of the USB port that is upstream of the
                                                     hub.
                                                     For self-powered applications with a permanently attached
                                                     host, this pin must be connected to 3.3V (typically VDD33).

Datasheet
Chapter 4 Configuration Options
4.1            2-Port Hub
              SMSC’s USB 2.0 2-Port Hub is fully specification compliant to the Universal Serial Bus Specification
              Revision 2.0 April 27,2000 (12/7/2000 and 5/28/2002 Errata). Please reference Chapter 10 (Hub
              Specification) for general details regarding Hub operation and functionality.
              The 2-Port Hub provides 1 Transaction Translator (TT) that is shared by both downstream ports
              (defined as Single-TT configuration), The TT contains 4 non-periodic buffers.
4.1.1         Hub Configuration Options
              The SMSC Hub supports a large number of features (some are mutually exclusive), and must be
              configured in order to correctly function when attached to a USB host controller. There are three
              principal ways to configure the hub: SMBus, EEPROM, or by internal default settings (with or without
              pin strapping option over-rides). In all cases, the configuration method will be determined by the
              CFG_SEL1 and CFG_SEL0 pins immediately after RESET_N negation.
4.1.1.1       Power Switching Polarity
              The hub only supports “active high” port power controllers.
4.1.2         VBus Detect
              According to Section 7.2.1 of the USB 2.0 Specification, a downstream port can never provide power
              to its D+ or D- pull-up resistors unless the upstream port’s VBUS is in the asserted (powered) state.
              The VBUS_DET pin on the Hub monitors the state of the upstream VBUS signal and will not pull-up
              the D+ resistor if VBUS is not active. If VBUS goes from an active to an inactive state (Not Powered),
              Hub will remove power from the D+ pull-up resistor within 10 seconds.
4.2            EEPROM Interface
              The SMSC Hub can be configured via a 2-wire (I2C) EEPROM (256x8). (Please see Table 3.1 for
              specific details on how to enable configuration via an I2C EEPROM).
              The Internal state-machine will (when configured for EEPROM support) read the external EEPROM for
              configuration data. The hub will then “attach” to the upstream USB host.
              Note: The Hub does not have the capacity to write, or “Program,” an external EEPROM. The Hub only
              has the capability to read external EEPROMs. The external eeprom will be read (even if it is blank or
              non-populated), and the hub will be “configured” with the values that are read.
              Please see Internal Register Set (Common to EEPROM and SMBus) for a list of data fields available.

       7           SELF_BUS_PWR    Self or Bus Power: Selects between Self- and Bus-Powered operation.
                                   The Hub is either Self-Powered (draws less than 2mA of upstream bus
                                   power) or Bus-Powered (limited to a 100mA maximum of upstream power
                                   prior to being configured by the host controller).
                                   When configured as a Bus-Powered device, the SMSC Hub consumes less
                                   than 100mA of current prior to being configured. After configuration, the Bus-
                                   Powered SMSC Hub (along with all associated hub circuitry, any embedded
                                   devices if part of a compound device, and 100mA per externally available
                                   downstream port) must consume no more than 500mA of upstream VBUS
                                   current. The current consumption is system dependent, and the OEM must
                                   ensure that the USB 2.0 specifications are not violated.
                                   When configured as a Self-Powered device, <1mA of upstream VBUS
                                   current is consumed and all ports are available, with each port being capable
                                   of sourcing 500mA of current.
                                   This field is set by the OEM using either the SMBus or EEPROM interface
                                   options.
                                   Please see the description under Dynamic Power for the self/bus power
                                   functionality when dynamic power switching is enabled.

                                   Note: If Dynamic Power Switching is enabled, this bit is ignored and the
                                   LOCAL_PWR pin is used to determine if the hub is operating from self or

                                   During FS operation only, this permits the Hub to send EOP if no
                                   downstream traffic is detected at EOF1. See Section 11.3.1 of the USB 2.0
                                   Specification for additional details. Note: generation of an EOP at the EOF1
                                   point may prevent a Host controller (operating in FS mode) from placing the
                                   USB bus in suspend.
                                   0 = EOP generation is normal

                                   current sensing on a port or ganged basis is hardware implementation
                                   dependent.
                                   00 = Ganged sensing (all ports together)

      7              DYNAMIC             Dynamic Power Enable: Controls the ability of the Hub to automatically
                                         change from Self-Powered operation to Bus-Powered operation if the local
                                         power source is removed or is unavailable (and from Bus-Powered to Self-
                                         Powered if the local power source is restored). {Note: If the local power
                                         source is available, the Hub will always switch to Self-Powered operation.}
                                         When Dynamic Power switching is enabled, the Hub detects the availability
                                         of a local power source by monitoring the external LOCAL_PWR pin. If the
                                         Hub detects a change in power source availability, the Hub immediately
                                         disconnects and removes power from all downstream devices and
                                         disconnects the upstream port. The Hub will then re-attach to the upstream
                                         port as either a Bus-Powered Hub (if local-power is unavailable) or a Self-
                                         Powered Hub (if local power is available).
                                         0 = No Dynamic auto-switching

                                         Note: When configured via strapping options, declaring a port as
                                         non-removable automatically causes the hub controller to report that
                                         it is part of a compound device.

                                         When a hub is enumerated by a USB Host Controller, the hub is only
                                         permitted to report how many ports it has; the hub is not permitted to select
                                         a numerical range or assignment. The Host Controller will number the
                                         downstream ports of the hub starting with the number '1', up to the number
                                         of ports that the hub reported having.
                                         The host's port number is referred to as "Logical Port Number" and the
                                         physical port on the hub is the “Physical Port Number". When remapping
                                         mode is enabled (see PRTMAP_EN in Register 08h: Configuration Data
                                         Byte 3) the hub's downstream port numbers can be remapped to different
                                         logical port numbers (assigned by the host).
                                         Note:     The OEM must ensure that Contiguous Logical Port Numbers are
                                                   used, starting from #1 up to the maximum number of enabled ports;
                                                   this ensures that the hub's ports are numbered in accordance with
                                                   the way a Host will communicate with the ports.

                                          unintentional data corruption.
4.2.2           I2C EEPROM
                The I2C EEPROM interface implements a subset of the I2C Master Specification (Please refer to the
                Philips Semiconductor Standard I2C-Bus Specification for details on I2C bus protocols). The Hub’s I2C
                EEPROM interface is designed to attach to a single “dedicated” I2C EEPROM, and it conforms to the
                Standard-mode I2C Specification (100kbit/s transfer rate and 7-bit addressing) for protocol and
                electrical compatibility.
                Note: Extensions to the I2C Specification are not supported.
                The Hub acts as the master and generates the serial clock SCL, controls the bus access (determines
                which device acts as the transmitter and which device acts as the receiver), and generates the START
                and STOP conditions.
4.2.2.1         Implementation Characteristics
                The Hub will only access an EEPROM using the Sequential Read Protocol.
4.2.2.2         Pull-Up Resistor
                The Circuit board designer is required to place external pull-up resistors (10KΩ recommended) on the
                SDA/SMBDATA & SCL/SMBCLK/CFG_SELO lines (per SMBus 1.0 Specification, and EEPROM
                manufacturer guidelines) to Vcc in order to assure proper operation.
4.2.2.3         I2C EEPROM Slave Address
                Slave address is 1010000.
                Note: 10-bit addressing is NOT supported.

USB 2.0 High-Speed 2-Port Hub Controller
Datasheet
4.2.3         In-Circuit EEPROM Programming
              The EEPROM can be programmed via ATE by pulling RESET_N low (which tri-states the Hub’s
              EEPROM interface and allows an external source to program the EEPROM).
4.3            SMBus Slave Interface
              Instead of loading User-Defined Descriptor data from an external EEPROM, the SMSC Hub can be
              configured to receive a code load from an external processor via an SMBus interface. The SMBus
              interface shares the same pins as the EEPROM interface; if CFG_SEL1 & CFG_SEL0 activates the
              SMBus interface, external EEPROM support is no longer available (and the user-defined descriptor
              data must be downloaded via the SMBus). Due to system issues, the SMSC Hub waits indefinitely for
              the SMBus code load to complete and only “appears” as a newly connected device on USB after the
              code load is complete.
              The Hub’s SMBus implementation is a subset of the SMBus interface to the host. The device is a
              slave-only SMBus device. The implementation in the device is a subset of SMBus since it only supports
              two protocols.
              The Write Block and Read Block protocols are the only valid SMBus protocols for the Hub. The Hub
              responds to other protocols as described in Section 4.3.2, "Invalid Protocol Response Behavior," on
              page 26. Reference the System Management Bus Specification, Rev 1.0.
              The SMBus interface is used to read and write the registers in the device. The register set is shown
              in Section 4.2.1, "Internal Register Set (Common to EEPROM and SMBus)," on page 13.
4.3.1         Bus Protocols
              Typical Write Block and Read Block protocols are shown below. Register accesses are performed
              using 7-bit slave addressing, an 8-bit register address field, and an 8-bit data field. The shading
              indicates the Hub driving data on the SMBDATA line; otherwise, host data is on the SDA/SMBDATA
              line.
              The slave address is the unique SMBus Interface Address for the Hub that identifies it on SMBus. The
              register address field is the internal address of the register to be accessed. The register data field is
              the data that the host is attempting to write to the register or the contents of the register that the host
              is attempting to read.
              Note: Data bytes are transferred MSB first (msb first).
4.3.1.1       Block Read/Write
              The Block Write begins with a slave address and a write condition. After the command code, the host
              issues a byte count which describes how many more bytes will follow in the message. If a slave had
              20 bytes to send, the first byte would be the number 20 (14h), followed by the 20 bytes of data. The
              byte count may not be 0. A Block Read or Write is allowed to transfer a maximum of 32 data bytes.

4.3.2           Invalid Protocol Response Behavior
                Registers that are accessed with an invalid protocol are not updated. A register is only updated
                following a valid protocol. The only valid protocols are Write Block and Read Block, which are
                described above.
                The Hub only responds to the hardware selected Slave Address.
                Attempting to communicate with the Hub over SMBus with an invalid slave address or invalid protocol
                results in no response, and the SMBus Slave Interface returns to the idle state.
                The only valid registers that are accessible by the SMBus slave address are the registers defined in
                the Registers Section. See Section 4.3.3 for the response to undefined registers.
4.3.3           General Call Address Response
                The Hub does not respond to a general call address of 0000_000b.
4.3.4           Slave Device Time-Out
                According to the SMBus Specification, V1.0 devices in a transfer can abort the transfer in progress
                and release the bus when any single clock low interval exceeds 25ms (TTIMEOUT, MIN). Devices that
                have detected this condition must reset their communication and be able to receive a new START
                condition no later than 35ms (TTIMEOUT, MAX).
                Note: Some simple devices do not contain a clock low drive circuit; this simple kind of device typically
                         resets its communications port after a start or stop condition. The Slave Device Time-Out must
                         be implemented.

4.3.5         Stretching the SCLK Signal
              The Hub supports stretching of the SCLK by other devices on the SMBus. The Hub does not stretch
              the SCLK.
4.3.6         SMBus Timing
              The SMBus Slave Interface complies with the SMBus AC Timing Specification. See the SMBus timing
              in the “Timing Diagram” section.
4.3.7         Bus Reset Sequence
              The SMBus Slave Interface resets and returns to the idle state upon a START field followed
              immediately by a STOP field.
4.3.8         SMBus Alert Response Address
              The SMBALERT# signal is not supported by the Hub.
4.3.8.1       Undefined Registers
              The registers shown in Table 4.1 are the defined registers in the Hub. Reads to undefined registers
              return 00h. Writes to undefined registers have no effect and do not return an error.
4.3.8.2       Reserved Registers
              Unless otherwise instructed, only a ‘0’ may be written to all reserved registers or bits.
4.4            Default Configuration Option:
              The SMSC Hub can be configured via its internal default configuration. (please see Section 4.2.1,
              "Internal Register Set (Common to EEPROM and SMBus)" for specific details on how to enable default
              configuration.)
              Please refer to Table 4.1 for the internal default values that are loaded when this option is selected.
4.5            Default Strapping Options:
              The USB2512 can be configured via a combination of internal default values and pin strap options.
              Please see Table 3.1 and Table 3.2 for specific details on how to enable the default/pin-strap
              configuration option.
              The strapping option pins only cover a limited sub-set of the configuration options. The internal default
              values will be used for the bits & registers that are not controlled by a strapping option pin. Please
              refer to Table 4.1 for the internal default values that are loaded when this option is selected.
4.6            Reset
              There are two different resets that the Hub experiences. One is a hardware reset (either from the
              internal POR reset circuit or via the RESET_N pin) and the second is a USB Bus Reset.
4.6.1         Internal POR Hardware Reset
              All reset timing parameters are guaranteed by design.

4.6.2             External Hardware RESET_N
                  A valid hardware reset is defined as assertion of RESET_N for a minimum of 1us after all power
                  supplies are within operating range. While reset is asserted, the Hub (and its associated external
                  circuitry) consumes less than 500μA of current from the upstream USB power source.
                  Assertion of RESET_N (external pin) causes the following:
                  1. All downstream ports are disabled, and PRTPWR power to downstream devices is removed.
                  2. The PHYs are disabled, and the differential pairs will be in a high-impedance state.
                  3. All transactions immediately terminate; no states are saved.
                  4. All internal registers return to the default state (in most cases, 00(h)).
                  5. The external crystal oscillator is halted.

                  The Hub is “operational” 500μs after RESET_N is negated.
                  Once operational, the Hub immediately reads OEM-specific data from the external EEPROM (if the
                  SMBus option is not disabled).

4.6.3           USB Bus Reset
                In response to the upstream port signaling a reset to the Hub, the Hub does the following:
                Note: The Hub does not propagate the upstream USB reset to downstream devices.
                1. Sets default address to 0.
                2. Sets configuration to: Unconfigured.
                3. Negates PRTPWR[2:1] to all downstream ports.

              Note: Stresses above the specified parameters could cause permanent damage to the device. This
                      is a stress rating only and functional operation of the device at any condition above those
                      indicated in the operation sections of this specification is not implied. When powering this
                      device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the Absolute Maximum
                      Ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage
                      spikes on their outputs when the AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients
                      on the AC power line may appear on the DC output. When this possibility exists, it is suggested
                      that a clamp circuit be used.
