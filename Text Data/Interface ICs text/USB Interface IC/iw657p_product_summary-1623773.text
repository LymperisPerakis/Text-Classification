iW657P
USB Power Delivery 3.0 Controller with Integrated Current Sense
Supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 4+
1 Description
The iW657P is a USB Power Delivery (USB PD) interface controller which handles the communication between a
Power Adapter and Mobile Device (MD). The controller enables the mobile device to alter the VBUS voltage from the
default 5V and/or maximum current limitation (e.g. 3A) for higher power output or better efficiency. The iW657P
supports USB PD 3.0, including Programmable Power Supply (PPS) support, while being backwards compatible with
USB PD 2.0. The device also supports Qualcomm® Quick ChargeTM 4+ technology. The iW657P enables the use of
advanced USB Type-CTM connector technology with CC1/CC2 pins for MD attach/detach detection and VCONN support
for Electronically Marked Cable (EMC) rated current reading. The iW657P also integrates a high current charge-pump
circuit to drive an external NFET VBUS disconnect switch.
The iW657P resides on the secondary side of an AC/DC power supply and negotiates voltage and current settings with
the primary-side controller, depending on the requests from the MD. The iW657P uses Dialog’s proprietary secondary-to-
primary digital communication technology and when paired with one of Dialog’s primary-side RapidCharge™ controllers,
such as the iW1791 or iW1799, the iW657P eliminates the need for a discrete decoder on the primary side by using
one optocoupler to transmit all necessary information for rapid charging to the primary side. This includes output voltage
requests, output current limits, output voltage undershoot, output over-voltage, and fault and reset signals. The iW657P
incorporates Dialog’s proven and reliable DLNK technology to communicate from the secondary to the primary and also
has a built-in optocoupler LED driver to minimize the bill of material cost.
The power supply designed with the iW657P is fully protected. Using over-voltage protection on the D+/D-/CC1/CC2
pins, the iW657P helps to address soft short issues in cables and connectors caused by poor or loose connections
between the cable connector and the socket, contamination in the USB connector, or a worn out cable. Additionally,
proprietary short circuit protection on the VBUS NFET ensures safe operation in the event of a short on the output, while
the SD pin can be used with an external NTC resistor for protection from over-temeperature faults. The iW657P also
integrates a secondary-side current sensing circuit that provides additional over-current protection for the power adapter.
