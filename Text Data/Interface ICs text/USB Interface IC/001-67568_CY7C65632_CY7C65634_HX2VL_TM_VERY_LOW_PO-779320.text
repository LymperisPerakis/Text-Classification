  3. Pin Types: I = Input, O = Output, P = Power/Ground., Z = High Impedance, RDN = Pad internal Pull Down Resistor, RUP = Pad internal Pull Up Resistor.
  4. PWR#/I2C_SDA can be used as either PWR# or I2C_SDA but not as both. If EEPROM is connected then the pin will act as I2C_SDA, it will not switch to PWR#
     mode (as it does in 48-pin TQFP package).
  5. In Gang mode, only OVR#1 (pin 25) is enabled.

  3. Pin Types: I = Input, O = Output, P = Power/Ground., Z = High Impedance, RDN = Pad internal Pull Down Resistor, RUP = Pad internal Pull Up Resistor.
  4. PWR#/I2C_SDA can be used as either PWR# or I2C_SDA but not as both. If EEPROM is connected then the pin will act as I2C_SDA, it will not switch to PWR#
     mode (as it does in 48-pin TQFP package).
  5. In Gang mode, only OVR#1 (pin 25) is enabled.

AC Electrical Characteristics
USB Transceiver is USB 2.0 certified in low, full and high speed modes.
Both the upstream USB transceiver and all four downstream transceivers have passed the USB-IF USB 2.0 Electrical Certification
Testing.
The 48-pin TQFP package can support communication to EEPROM using either I2C or SPI. The 28-pin QFN package can support
only I2C communication to EEPROM.
AC Characteristics of these two interfaces to EEPROM are summarized in tables below:

1. USB device is not recognized properly if a disconnect followed by a connect event happen during hub suspend
   ■ Problem    Definition
      HX2VL sometimes does not recognize Downstream (DS) USB device after coming out of suspend if the connected DS device
      is disconnected and connected back to the same DS port during hub suspend state.
    ■Parameters     Affected
     N/A.
    ■Trigger   Condition(s)
     Disconnect followed by a Connect event of DS device from the hub during suspend state.
    ■Scope    of Impact
     The issue is not observed with standard Microsoft driver/class devices such as mouse, keyboard, mass storage, etc. as the
     standard class drivers recover the device using Port-Reset command when there is a STALL from the DS devices.
    ■Workaround
     Issue a Port-Reset from host USB application or driver to recover the DS device when it STALLS.
    ■Fix   Status
     No fix planned.
