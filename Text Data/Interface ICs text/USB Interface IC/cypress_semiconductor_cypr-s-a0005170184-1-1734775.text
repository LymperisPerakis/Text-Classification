a bus-powered design. VBUS is connected directly to the                       100 mA when operational) must use POWER# (configured
CY7C65215/CY7C65215A because it has an internal regulator.                    over GPIO) to keep the current consumption below 100 mA

USB to Dual Channel (I2C/SPI) Bridge
In Figure 13, CY7C65215/CY7C65215A is configured as a USB-to-Dual Channel (I2C/SPI) Bridge. GPIO1 and GPIO0 are configured
as RXLED# and TXLED# to drive two LEDs indicating data USB receive and transmit respectively.
