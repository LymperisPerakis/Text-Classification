Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
General Description
                    SMSC’s USB332x is a family of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceivers that provides a physical layer (PHY)
                    solution well-suited for portable electronic devices. Both commercial and industrial temperature
                    applications are supported.
                    Each model in the USB332x family may use a 60MHz reference clock, or the model-number specific
                    reference clock shown in ORDER NUMBER(S): on page 2.
                    Several advanced features make the USB332x the transceiver of choice by reducing both electrical
                    bill of material (eBOM) part count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness
                    eliminates the need for external ESD protection devices in typical applications. The internal Over-
                    Voltage Protection circuit (OVP) protects the USB332x from voltages up to 30V. By using a reference
                    clock from the Link, the USB332x removes the cost of a dedicated crystal reference from the design.
                    And the integrated USB switch enables unique product features with a single USB port of connection.
                    The USB332x meets all of the electrical requirements to be used as a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device, or
                    an On-the-Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition to the supporting USB signaling, the USB332x also
                    provides USB UART mode and USB Audio mode.
                    USB332x uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
                    Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers between the Link and PHY to
                    facilitate a USB session with only 12 pins.
                    The USB332x uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
                    less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
                    latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
                    adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.
                                                                                            REFCLK

                                                                      Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
                The USB332x includes an integrated 3.3V LDO regulator that may optionally be used to generate 3.3V
                from power applied at the VBAT pin. The voltage on the VBAT pin can range from 3.1 to 5.5V. The
                regulator dropout voltage is less than 100mV which allows the PHY to continue USB signaling when
                the voltage on VBAT drops to 3.1V. The USB transceiver will continue to operate at lower voltages,
                although some parameters may be outside the limits of the USB specifications. If the user would like
                to provide a 3.3V supply to the USB332x, the VBAT and VDD33 pins should be connected together.
                The USB332x also includes integrated pull-up resistors that can be used for detecting the attachment
                of a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to a USB Charger, a product using the USB332x can
                charge its battery at more than the 500mA allowed when charging from a USB Host.
                In USB UART mode, the USB332x DP and DM pins are redefined to enable pass-through of
                asynchronous serial data. The USB332x can only enter UART mode when the user programs the part
                into this mode.
                In USB audio mode, a switch connects the DP pin to the SPK_R pin, and another switch connects he
                DM pin to the SPK_L pin. The USB332x can be configured to enter USB audio mode. In addition,
                these switches are on when the RESETB pin of the USB332x is asserted. The USB audio mode
                enables audio signalling from a single USB port of connection, and the switches may also be used to
                connect Full Speed USB from another PHY onto the USB cable.
