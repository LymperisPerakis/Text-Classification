Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V-3.3V ULPI Interface - 26MHz Reference Clock
General Description
               The USB3317 is a highly integrated Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceiver (PHY) that supports systems
               architectures based on a 26MHz reference clock. It is designed to be used in both commercial and
               industrial temperature applications.
               The USB3317 meets all of the electrical requirements to be used as a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device,
               or an On-the-Go (OTG) device. In addition to the supporting USB signaling the USB3317 also provides
               USB UART mode.
               USB3317 uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
               Link. The industry standard ULPI interface uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers
               between the Link and PHY, to facilitate a USB session. By using in-band signaling and status byte
               transfers the ULPI interface requires only 12 pins.
               The USB3317 uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
               less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
               latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
               adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.

               The USB3317 is designed to run with a 26MHz reference clock. By using a reference clock from the
               Link the USB3317 is able to remove the cost of a crystal reference from the design.
               The USB3317 includes a integrated 3.3V LDO regulator to generate its own supply from power applied
               at the VBAT pin. The voltage on the VBAT pin can range from 3.1 to 5.5V. The regulator dropout
               voltage is less than 100mV which allows the PHY to continue USB signaling when the voltage on
               VBAT drops to 3.1V. The USB transceiver will continue to operate at lower voltages, although some
               parameters may be outside the limits of the USB specifications. If the user would like to provide a 3.3V
               supply to the USB3317, the VBAT and VDD33 pins should be connected together.
               The USB3317 also includes integrated pull-up resistors that can be used for detecting the attachment
               of a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to a USB Charger, a product using the USB3317 can
               charge its battery at more than the 500mA allowed when charging from a USB Host.
