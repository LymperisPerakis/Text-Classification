Notes
 3. Errata: When the device operates at4.75 V to 5.25 V and the 3.3-V regulator is enabled, a short low pulse may be created on the DP signal line during device wakeup.
    The 15- to 20-µs low pulse of the DP line may be interpreted by the host computer as a deattach or the beginning of a wakeup. For more details refer to Errata on
    page 40.
 4. Standby current includes all functions (POR, LVD, WDT, sleep time) needed for reliable system operation. This should be compared with devices that have similar
    functions enabled.

DC Analog Reference Specifications
The following tables list guaranteed maximum and minimum specifications for the voltage and temperature ranges: 4.75 V to 5.25 V
and –40 °C < TA < 85 °C, or 3.15 V to 3.5 V and –40 °C < TA < 85 °C, respectively. Typical parameters apply to 5 V and 3.3 V at 25 °C
and are for design guidance only.
The guaranteed specifications are measured through the analog continuous time PSoC blocks. The power levels for AGND refer to
the power of the Analog Continuous Time PSoC block. The power levels for RefHi and RefLo refer to the Analog Reference Control
register. The limits stated for AGND include the offset error of the AGND buffer local to the Analog Continuous Time PSoC block.
Reference control power is high.

 Notes
  8. The 50,000 cycle Flash endurance per block will only be guaranteed if the Flash is operating within one voltage range. Voltage ranges are 3.0V to 3.6V and 4.75V
      to 5.25V.
  9. A maximum of 36 x 50,000 block endurance cycles is allowed. This may be balanced between operations on 36x1 blocks of 50,000 maximum cycles each, 36x2
      blocks of 25,000 maximum cycles each, or 36x4 blocks of 12,500 maximum cycles each (to limit the total number of cycles to 36x50,000 and that no single block
      ever sees more than 50,000 cycles).
      For the full industrial range, the user must employ a temperature sensor user module (FlashTemp) and feed the result to the temperature argument before writing.
      Refer to the Flash APIs application note AN2015 for more information.
  10. All GPIOs meet the DC GPIO VIL and VIH specifications found in the DC GPIO Specifications sections. The I2C GPIO pins also meet the mentioned specifications.

Note
 17. A Fast-Mode I2C-bus device can be used in a Standard-Mode I2C-bus system, but the requirement TSUDATI2C  250 ns must then be met. This automatically is the
     case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit
     to the SDA line trmax + TSUDATI2C = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the Standard-Mode I2C-bus specification) before the SCL line is released.

                   Circuit. It is used to connect low-speed peripherals in an embedded system. The original system was created in
                   the early 1980s as a battery control interface, but it was later used as a simple internal bus system for building
                   control electronics. I2C uses only two bi-directional pins, clock and data, both running at +5V and pulled high with
                   resistors. The bus operates at 100 kbits/second in standard mode and 400 kbits/second in fast mode.
ICE                The in-circuit emulator that allows users to test the project in a hardware environment, while viewing the debugging

                   and an external interface. The controlled device is called the slave device.
microcontroller    An integrated circuit chip that is designed primarily for control systems and products. In addition to a CPU, a
                   microcontroller typically includes memory, timing circuits, and IO circuitry. The reason for this is to permit the
                   realization of a controller with a minimal quantity of chips, thus achieving maximal possible miniaturization. This
                   in turn, reduces the volume and the cost of the controller. The microcontroller is normally not used for
                   general-purpose computation as is a microprocessor.

                physical counterparts in the printed circuit board (PCB) package. Pinouts involve pin numbers as a link between
                schematic and PCB design (both being computer generated files) and may also involve pin names.

                exchanges between the cascaded devices and an external interface. The controlling device is called the master
                device.
SRAM            An acronym for static random access memory. A memory device allowing users to store and retrieve data at a
                high rate of speed. The term static is used because, after a value has been loaded into an SRAM cell, it remains

                value in the Z state and, in many respects, may be considered to be disconnected from the rest of the circuit,
                allowing another output to drive the same net.

 1. USB interface DP line pulses low when the enCoRe III device wakes from sleep
■  Problem Definition
When the device operates at 4.75 V to 5.25 V and the 3.3-V regulator is enabled, a short low pulse may be created on the DP signal
line during device wakeup. The 15- to 20-µs low pulse of the DP line may be interpreted by the host computer as a deattach or the
beginning of a wakeup.
■  Parameters Affected
The bandgap reference voltage used by the 3.3-V regulator decreases during sleep due to leakage. Upon device wakeup, the bandgap
is re-enabled and, after a delay for settling, the 3.3-V regulator is enabled. On some devices the 3.3-V regulator used to generate the
USB DP signal may be enabled before the bandgap is fully stabilized. This can cause a low pulse on the regulator output and DP
signal line until the bandgap stabilizes. In applications where VDD is 3.3 V, the regulator is not used and, therefore, the DP low pulse
is not generated.
■  Trigger Condition
N/A
■  Scope of Impact
N/A
■  Workaround
To prevent the DP signal from pulsing low, keep the bandgap enabled during sleep. The most efficient method is to set the No Buzz
bit in the OSC_CR0 register. The No Buzz bit keeps the bandgap powered and output stable during sleep. Setting the No Buzz bit
results in a nominal 100 µA increase in sleep current. Leaving the analog reference block enabled during sleep also resolves this
issue because it forces the bandgap to remain enabled. The following example shows how to disable the No Buzz bit:

■  Fix Status
There is no planned silicon fix; use workaround.
 2. Invalid flash reads may occur if VDD is pulled to –0.5 V just before power on
■  Problem Definition
When VDD of the device is pulled below ground just before power on, the first read from each 8-KB flash page may be corrupted. This
issue does not affect flash page 0 because it is the selected page upon reset.
■  Parameters Affected
When VDD is pulled below ground before power on, an internal flash reference may deviate from its nominal voltage. The reference
deviation tends to result in the first flash read from that page returning 0xFF. During the first read from each page, the reference is
reset resulting in all future reads returning the correct value. A short delay of 5 µs before the first real read provides time for the
reference voltage to stabilize.
■  Trigger Condition
N/A
■  Scope of Impact
N/A
■  Workaround
To prevent an invalid flash read, a dummy read from each flash page must occur before use of the pages. A delay of 5 µs must occur
after the dummy read and before a real read. The dummy reads occur as soon as possible and must be located in flash page 0 before
a read from any other flash page. An example for reading a byte of memory from each flash page is listed below. Place it in boot.tpl
and boot.asm immediately after the ‘start:’ label.
               // dummy read from each 8K Flash page
               // page 1
               movA, 0x20                // MSB
               movX, 0x00                // LSB
               romx
               // wait at least 5 µs
               movX, 14
               loop1:
               decX
               jnzloop1
■  Fix Status
There is no planned silicon fix; use workaround.
 3. PMA Index Register fails to auto-increment with CPU_Clock set to SysClk/1 (24 MHz)
■  Problem Definition
When the device operates at 4.75 V to 5.25 V and the CPU_Clock is set to SysClk/1 (24 MHz), the USB PMA Index Register may fail
to increment automatically when used in an OUT endpoint configuration at full-speed. When the application program attempts to use
the bReadOutEP() function, the first byte in the PMA buffer is always returned.
■  Parameters Affected
An internal flip-flop hold problem is associated with the index register increment function. All reads of the associated RAM originate
from the first byte. The hold problem has no impact on other circuits or functions within the device.

■ WORKAROUND
To make certain that the index register properly increments, set the CPU_Clock to SysClk/2 (12 MHz) during the read of the PMA
buffer. An example for the clock adjustment method follows:
