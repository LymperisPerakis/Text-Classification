1.1.1         OVERVIEW
The LAN9512/LAN9512i is a high performance Hi-Speed USB 2.0 hub with a 10/100 Ethernet controller. With applica-
tions ranging from embedded systems, desktop PCs, notebook PCs, printers, game consoles, and docking stations, the
LAN9512/LAN9512i is targeted as a high performance, low cost USB/Ethernet and USB/USB connectivity solution.
The LAN9512/LAN9512i contains an integrated USB 2.0 hub, two integrated downstream USB 2.0 PHYs, an integrated
upstream USB 2.0 PHY, a 10/100 Ethernet PHY, a 10/100 Ethernet Controller, a TAP controller, and a EEPROM con-
troller. A block diagram of the LAN9512/LAN9512i is provided in Figure 1-1.
The LAN9512/LAN9512i hub provides over 30 programmable features, including:
• PortMap (also referred to as port remap) which provides flexible port mapping and disabling sequences. The
   downstream ports of the LAN9512/LAN9512i hub can be reordered or disabled in any sequence to support multi-
   ple platform designs’ with minimum effort. For any port that is disabled, the LAN9512/LAN9512i automatically
   reorders the remaining ports to match the USB host controller’s port numbering scheme.
• PortSwap which adds per-port programmability to USB differential pair pin locations. PortSwap allows direct
   alignment of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors avoiding uneven trace length or crossing of the USB differential
   signals on the PCB.
• PHYBoost which enables four programmable levels of USB signal drive strength in USB port transceivers. PHY-
   Boost attempts to restore USB signal integrity that has been compromised by system level variables such as poor
   PCB layout, long cables, etc.
1.1.2         USB HUB
The integrated USB hub is fully compliant with the USB 2.0 Specification and will attach to a USB host as a Full-Speed
Hub or as a Full-/High-Speed Hub. The hub supports Low-Speed, Full-Speed, and High-Speed (if operating as a High-
Speed hub) downstream devices on all of the enabled downstream ports.
A dedicated Transaction Translator (TT) is available for each downstream facing port. This architecture ensures maxi-
mum USB throughput for each connected device when operating with mixed-speed peripherals.
The hub works with an external USB power distributed switch device to control VBUS switching to downstream ports,
and to limit current and sense over-current conditions.
DS00002304A-page 4                                                                   2009-2016 Microchip Technology Inc.


                                                                       LAN9512/LAN9512I
All required resistors on the USB ports are integrated into the hub. This includes all series termination resistors on D+
and D- pins and all required pull-down and pull-up resistors on D+ and D- pins. The over-current sense inputs for the
downstream facing ports have internal pull-up resistors.
Two external ports are available for general USB device connectivity.
1.1.3        ETHERNET CONTROLLER
The 10/100 Ethernet controller provides an integrated Ethernet MAC and PHY which are fully IEEE 802.3 10BASE-T
and 802.3u 100BASE-TX compliant. The 10/100 Ethernet controller also supports numerous power management
wakeup features, including “Magic Packet”, “Wake on LAN” and “Link Status Change”. These wakeup events can be
programmed to initiate a USB remote wakeup.
The 10/100 Ethernet PHY integrates an IEEE 802.3 physical layer for twisted pair Ethernet applications. The PHY block
includes support for auto-negotiation, full or half-duplex configuration, auto-polarity correction and Auto-MDIX. Minimal
external components are required for the utilization of the integrated PHY.
The Ethernet controller implements four USB endpoints: Control, Interrupt, Bulk-in, and Bulk-out. The Bulk-in and Bulk-
out Endpoints allow for Ethernet reception and transmission respectively. Implementation of vendor-specific commands
allows for efficient statistics gathering and access to the Ethernet controller’s system control and status registers.
1.1.4        EEPROM CONTROLLER
The LAN9512/LAN9512i contains an EEPROM controller for connection to an external EEPROM. This allows for the
automatic loading of static configuration data upon power-on reset, pin reset, or software reset. The EEPROM can be
configured to load USB descriptors, USB device configuration, and the MAC address.
1.1.5        PERIPHERALS
The LAN9512/LAN9512i also contains a TAP controller, and provides three PHY LED indicators, as well as eight general
purpose I/O pins. All GPIOs can serve as remote wakeup events when LAN9512/LAN9512i is in a suspended state.
The integrated IEEE 1149.1 compliant TAP controller provides boundary scan via JTAG.
1.1.6        POWER MANAGEMENT
The LAN9512/LAN9512i features three variations of USB suspend: SUSPEND0, SUSPEND1, and SUSPEND2. These
modes allow the application to select the ideal balance of remote wakeup functionality and power consumption.
• SUSPEND0: Supports GPIO, “Wake On LAN”, and “Magic Packet” remote wakeup events. This suspend state
   reduces power by stopping the clocks of the MAC and other internal modules.
• SUSPEND1: Supports GPIO and “Link Status Change” for remote wakeup events. This suspend state consumes
   less power than SUSPEND0.
• SUSPEND2: Supports only GPIO assertion for a remote wakeup event. This is the default suspend mode for the
   LAN9512/LAN9512i.

2.2.1        PORT POWER CONTROL USING A USB POWER SWITCH
The LAN9512/LAN9512i has a single port power control and over-current sense signal for each downstream port. When
disabling port power, the driver will actively drive a ‘0’. To avoid unnecessary power dissipation, the internal pull-up resis-
tor will be disabled at that time. When port power is enabled, the output driver is disabled and the pull-up resistor is

enabled, creating an open drain output. If there is an over-current situation, the USB Power Switch will assert the open
drain OCS signal. The Schmitt trigger input will recognize this situation as a low. The open drain output does not inter-
fere. The overcurrent sense filter handles the transient conditions, such as low voltage, while the device is powering up.

2.2.2       PORT POWER CONTROL USING A POLY FUSE
When using the LAN9512/LAN9512i with a poly fuse, an external diode must be used (See Figure 2-4). When disabling
port power, the driver will drive a ‘0’. This procedure will have no effect since the external diode will isolate the pin from
the load. When port power is enabled, the output driver is disabled and the pull-up resistor is enabled, which creates an
open drain output. This means that the pull-up resistor is providing 3.3 volts to the anode of the diode. If there is an over-

current situation, the poly fuse will open. This will cause the cathode of the diode to go to 0_volts. The anode of the
diode will be at 0.7_volts, and the Schmidt trigger input will register this as a low, resulting in an overcurrent detection.
The open drain output does not interfere.

LAN9512/LAN9512I
3.0        EEPROM CONTROLLER (EPC)
LAN9512/LAN9512i may use an external EEPROM to store the default values for the USB descriptors and the MAC
address. The EEPROM controller supports most “93C46” type EEPROMs. A total of nine address bits are used to sup-
port 256/512 byte EEPROMs.
A 3-wire style 2K/4K EEPROM that is organized for 256/512 x 8-bit operation must be used.
The MAC address is used as the default Ethernet MAC address and is loaded into the MAC’s ADDRH and ADDRL reg-
isters. If a properly configured EEPROM is not detected, it is the responsibility of the Host LAN Driver to set the IEEE
addresses.
After a system-level reset occurs, the device will load the default values from a properly configured EEPROM. The
device will not accept USB transactions from the Host until this process is completed.
The EEPROM controller also allows the Host system to read, write and erase the contents of the Serial EEPROM.
3.1        EEPROM Format
Table 3-1 illustrates the format in which data is stored inside of the EEPROM.
Note the EEPROM offsets are given in units of 16-bit word offsets. A length field with a value of zero indicates that the
field does not exist in the EEPROM. The device will use the field’s HW default value in this case.
   Note:      For Device Descriptors, the only valid values for the length are 0 and 18.
   Note:      For Configuration and Interface Descriptors, the only valid values for the length are 0 and 18.
   Note:      The EEPROM programmer must ensure that if a String Descriptor does not exist in the EEPROM, the ref-
              erencing descriptor must contain 00h for the respective string index field.
   Note:      If no Configuration Descriptor is present in the EEPROM, then the Configuration Flags affect the values of
              bmAttributes and bMaxPower in the Ethernet Controller Configuration Descriptor.
   Note:      If all String Descriptor lengths are zero, then a Language ID will not be supported.

            configured by the host controller).
            When configured as a Bus-Powered device, the SMSC Hub consumes less than
            100 mA of current prior to being configured. After configuration, the Bus-Powered
            SMSC Hub (along with all associated hub circuitry, any embedded devices if part of
            a compound device, and 100 mA per externally available downstream port) must
            consume no more than 500 mA of upstream VBUS current. The current consumption
            is system dependent, and the OEM must ensure that the USB 2.0 specifications are
            not violated.
            When configured as a Self-Powered device, <1mA of upstream VBUS current is

            Disables EOP generation of EOF1 when in Full-Speed mode. During FS operation
            only, this permits the Hub to send EOP if no downstream traffic is detected at EOF1.
            See Section 11.3.1 of the USB 2.0 Specification for additional details.
            Note:      Generation of an EOP at the EOF1 point may prevent a Host controller
                       (operating in FS mode) from placing the USB bus in suspend.
            0 = An EOP is generated at the EOF1 point if no traffic is detected.
            1 = EOP generation at EOF1 is disabled (note: this is normal USB operation).
            Note:      This is a rarely used feature in the PC environment, existing drivers may
                       not have been thoroughly debugged with this feature enabled. It is included
                       because it is a permitted feature in Chapter 11 of the USB specification.

3.2      EEPROM Defaults
The signature value of 0xA5 is stored at address 0. A different signature value indicates to the EEPROM controller that
no EEPROM or an un-programmed EEPROM is attached to the device. In this case, the hardware default values are
used, as shown in Table 3-10.

3.3        EEPROM Auto-Load
Certain system level resets (USB reset, POR, nRESET, and SRST) cause the EEPROM contents to be loaded into the
device. After a reset, the EEPROM controller attempts to read the first byte of data from the EEPROM. If the value 0xA5
is read from the first address, then the EEPROM controller will assume that the external Serial EEPROM is configured
for auto-loading. If a value other than 0xA5 is read from the first address, the EEPROM auto-load will not commence.
   Note:     The EEPROM contents are loaded for both the Hub and the Ethernet Controller as a result of a POR or
             nRESET. The USB reset results only in the loading of the MAC address from the EEPROM. A software reset
             (SRST) or a EEPROM Reload Command causes the EEPROM contents related solely to the Ethernet Con-
             troller to be loaded.
3.4        An Example of EEPROM Format Interpretation
Table 3-11 and Table 3-12 provide an example of how the contents of a EEPROM are formatted. Table 3-11 is a dump
of the EEPROM memory (256-byte EEPROM), while Table 3-12 illustrates, byte by byte, how the EEPROM is formatted.

   Note 4-1      When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the absolute
                 maximum ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage
                 spikes on their outputs when AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the
                 AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested that a clamp
                 circuit be used.
   Note 4-2      This rating does not apply to the following pins: XI, XO, EXRES, USBRBIAS.
   Note 4-3      This rating does not apply to the following pins: EXRES, USBRBIAS.
   Note 4-4      0°C to +70°C for commercial version, -40°C to +85°C for industrial version.
   Note 4-5      Performed by independent 3rd party test facility.

4.6          Clock Circuit
LAN9512/LAN9512i can accept either a 25MHz crystal (preferred) or a 25MHz single-ended clock oscillator (+/- 50ppm)
input. If the single-ended clock oscillator method is implemented, XO should be left unconnected and XI should be
driven with a nominal 0-3.3V clock signal. The input clock duty cycle is 40% minimum, 50% typical and 60% maximum.
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XI/XO). See Table 4-10 for the recommended crystal specifications.

  Note 4-13   The maximum allowable values for Frequency Tolerance and Frequency Stability are application
              dependent. Since any particular application must meet the IEEE +/-50 PPM Total PPM Budget, the
              combination of these two values must be approximately +/-45 PPM (allowing for aging).
  Note 4-14   Frequency Deviation Over Time is also referred to as Aging.
  Note 4-15   The total deviation for the Transmitter Clock Frequency is specified by IEEE 802.3u as
              +/- 50 PPM.
  Note 4-16   0°C for commercial version, -40°C for industrial version.
  Note 4-17   +70°C for commercial version, +85°C for industrial version.
  Note 4-18   This number includes the pad, the bond wire and the lead frame. PCB capacitance is not included
              in this value. The XO/XI pin and PCB capacitance values are required to accurately calculate the
              value of the two external load capacitors. These two external load capacitors determine the accuracy
              of the 25.000 MHz frequency.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
