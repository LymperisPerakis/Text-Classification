DA7210/11 USER MANUAL
1 Introduction
The DA7210/11 evaluation board has been produced to allow measurement, evaluation and
programming of the DA7210/11 ultra-low power audio codec evaluation board and control software.
The evaluation PCB is supplied together with a DVD ROM containing documentation and driver files.
The driver software uses a simple graphical user interface (GUI), allowing the DA7210/11 device to
be controlled via a USB port of a PC. An additional GUI is available to control the highly configurable
filter paths within the DA7210/11; including general purpose, five-band equaliser and high pass filters
The board has a number of jumper links to allow configuration of the board and to provide
measurement test points.
                                  Figure 1 DA7210/11 Block Diagram
The accompanying software requires a PC operating Windows 2000/XP with a USB1.1 or USB2
interface. The software will run under Vista if the default installation location is changed to ‘C:\Dialog
Semiconductor\’
The DA7210/11 device plus the USB Interface consume approximately 5mA in the standby state. The
evaluation board and software are not guaranteed to operate in a USB hub. See the section on Power
Supplies below.
The control software permits configuration of the device using either pre-prepared templates or
individual write and read operations to all control registers
2 Hardware
There are three options available when using the DA7210/11 evaluation mainboard, Figure 2:

The passive components needed for noise decoupling or charge pump operation have been placed
as close as possible to the DUT pins to ensure optimum operational performance.
Gerber data for the board is available on request.
2.1 Power Supplies
The board is intended to be supplied by power supplies in the range +1.8V dc to +2.5Vdc (nominal). The
power supplies are connected via 4mm sockets: AVDD, VDDCP, VDDDAC, VDDADC, VDDDIO,
DGND and AGND. LEDs D1 to D6 will illuminate when the power supplies are correctly connected.
Some devices on the board will be powered from the +5Vdc or +3.3Vdc supply produced by the USB
interface module.
For demonstration purposes the +5Vdc USB supply can be connected to regulator, U9, to produce
+1.8Vdc capable of supplying all of the DUT the power supply pins. This configuration allows complete
DUT operation using just USB and TOSLINK connections only, but maximum headphone power
output will be limited when using +1.8V VDDDCP power supply.

DA7210/11 USER MANUAL
The evaluation board can be set up to run solely from the +5V USB supply as the source for all board
supplies. It is necessary to remove all external power supplies and to add jumpers J56, J57, J59 and
J60 for this operation, which is the default configuration for the board.
The digital audio interface jumpers are set to receive a TOSLINK input and should be removed to
accept other external clocks at J52. Figure 9 shows the extra links required to enable the onboard
supplies.

3     Evaluation Board Features
3.1 USB Interface
The USB Interface is used here for the following purposes:
        As a source of I2C and SPI control signals.
        To provide a discrete signal to the power down pin PD (DA7210 only).
        To provide level shifting voltages.
        To allow standalone operation of the evaluation board using the +5Vdc USB power supply
         only.
The USB control signal device is powered by the USB bus cable via a fixed +3.3V dc regulator.
The USB interface control signals can be isolated from rest of the evaluation board by removing J51,
J53 and J55 described in Table 1. Removing these jumpers will allow external signal access to the
DA7210 control interface. The USB interface can also be used to supply the power supplies to the
DUT on the evaluation board.
The USB Interface implements multi-mastering on its I2C interface, permitting concurrent operation
with any other multi-mastering controller. This allows the software to control a DA7210/11 device
which is already part of the users system, and under control of the system processor.
4 Control Software
4.1 Installation
Insert the DVD-ROM containing the software into the controlling PC. If the installation does not start
automatically, run the program ‘setup.exe’ from the DVD-ROM containing the software. An automated
script will install the program to your PC. By default, the directory ‘C:\ProgramFiles\Dialog
Semiconductor\Audio\DA7210 Rev x.x’ will be used.
As Windows Vista imposes limitiations on the ‘C:\Program Files’ directory, change this default to
‘C:\Dialog Semiconductor\Audio\DA7210 Rev x.x’ when prompted.
Plug in the USB cable, and Windows will detect the USB device. It will prompt for the drivers, which
should be automatically located on the root directory of the DVD-ROM. The setup file is '’dlgezusb.inf’
and the following description explains how to install the driver.

If you are using Windows XP, you may get a message saying that a USB2 device is attached to a
USB1.1 port. This can safely be ignored.
To uninstall the software please use the Windows ‘Add/Remove Programs’ function that can be found
under ‘Start->Settings->Control Panel’.
4.2 Set-up Files
4.2.1    Text File
The DUT registers can written to by submitting a text file containing the register values; Figure 10
shows an example file. Only the data in the first three columns is required: register, data, R/W; other
comments, such as those shown in the example, will be ignored. Lines of text that do not follow
register write entries should be preceded by // in order that the line is ignored when reading the text
file.
The text file can be created by saving the first three columns of the template spreadsheet file above
as a text file or can be created from scratch; it is only necessary for the text file to contain the
registers required for set up all others can be omitted.
To add a delay in the file the register value is entered as Delay followed by the delay time require in
milliseconds. The example in Figure 10 shows a 100ms delay added as the third entry.

A selection of text files can be found on the DVD containing the register control software setup files.
4.2.2    Spreadsheet File
The register settings can be prepared using a spreadsheet file template provided, Figure 11, and
saved as a tab delimited text file like Figure 10. The only bits that can be altered on the spreadsheet
are the individual register bits in columns G to N and the R/W bit in column O. If any of these bits are
set to 1 the bit will be highlighted in green on the register map. If the bit default setting is 1 and the bit
value is changed to 0 then the register map bit will be highlighted in grey. This highlighting allows
easy visual reference to the register changes from the default settings.

5.2.1    Running the Interface and USB Initialisation
The RT Filters Rev x.x GUI can be used in conjunction with the DA7210_11 Register Control
Software Rev x.x to set up the DA7210/11 device registers. In order to allow both interfaces to access
the DA7210/11 simultaneously it is necessary to initialise the RT Filters GUI first before opening the
DA7210_11 Register Control Software.
The flowchart in Figure 20 details the start-up procedure when using the DA7210 Register Control
GUI and RT Filter GUI in conjunction with each other.
On starting-up the RT Filters application the interface will be running. Once the coefficients are
calculated the interface will stop and the registers writes will be submitted to the DA7210/11. To start
the interface running again, press the white arrow situated below the Operate drop down menu on the
top row; this will turn to black and the interface is running again ready for new selections.

enter the sample rate of the digital audio interface, so that the correct coefficient values are created;
failure to do so will result either in zero entries or incorrect coefficient values.
The Calculate Coefficients and Register Settings button will perform the same action as the button of
the same name on the Filter Setup panel.
The forward and reverse coefficients can be saved to file by selecting Output Coefficients button and
by selecting a valid output file path. The spreadsheet file must already exist for the register values to
be output.

It is also possible to input coefficients to the device from spreadsheet by selecting Input Coefficients
button and by selecting a valid input file path. Three forward and two reverse coefficients are required,
an example is found in Figure 23.

Another facility on the Generate Coefficients panel allows the register values to be output to
spreadsheet by selecting the Output Coefficient Registers button and by selecting a valid output file
path. The spreadsheet file must already exist for the register values to be output.
The I2C device address and access speed can also be entered here.
