USB 2.0 HSIC High-Speed Hub Controller Optimized for Portable Applications
General Description
              The SMSC USB3503 is a low-power, USB 2.0 hub controller with HSIC upstream connectivity and
              three USB 2.0 downtream ports. The USB3503 operates as a hi-speed hub and supports low-speed,
              full-speed, and hi-speed downstream devices on all of the enabled downstream ports.
              The USB3503 has been specifically optimized for mobile embedded applications. The pin-count has
              been reduced by optimizing the USB3503 for mobile battery-powered embedded systems where power
              consumption, small package size, and minimal BOM are critical design requirements. Standby mode
              power has been minimized. Instead of a dedicated crystal, reference clock inputs are aligned to mobile
              applications. Flexible integrated power regulators ease integration into battery powered devices. All
              required resistors on the USB ports are integrated into the hub. This includes all series termination
              resistors on D+ and D– pins and all required pull-down resistors on D+ and D– pins.
              The USB3503 includes programmable features such as:
              MultiTRAKTM Technology, which utilizes a dedicated Transaction Translator (TT) per port to maintain
              consistent full-speed data throughput regardless of the number of active downstream connections.
              MultiTRAKTM outperforms conventional USB 2.0 hubs with a single TT in USB full-speed data transfers.
              PortMap, which provides flexible port mapping and disable sequences. The downstream ports of a
              USB3503 hub can be reordered or disabled in any sequence to support multiple platform designs with
              minimum effort. For any port that is disabled, the USB3503 hub controllers automatically reorder the
              remaining ports to match the USB host controller’s port numbering scheme.
              PortSwap, which adds per-port programmability to USB differential-pair pin locations. PortSwap allows
              direct alignment of USB signals (D+/D-) to connectors to avoid uneven trace length or crossing of the
              USB differential signals on the PCB.
              PHYBoost, which provides programmable levels of Hi-Speed USB
              signal drive strength in the downstream port transceivers. PHYBoost
              attempts to restore USB signal integrity in a compromised system
              environment. The graphic on the right shows an example of Hi-
              Speed USB eye diagrams before and after PHYBoost signal integrity
              restoration.
              VariSense, which controls the USB receiver sensitivity enabling programmable levels of USB signal
              receive sensitivity. This capability allows operation in a sub-optimal system environment, such as when
              a captive USB cable is used.

Customer Selectable Features
                A default configuration is available in the USB3503 following a reset. This configuration may be
                sufficient for most applications. The USB3503 hub may also be configured by an external
                microcontroller. When using the microcontroller interface, the hub appears as an I2C slave device.
                The USB3503 hub supports customer selectable features including:
                   Optional customer configuration via I2C.
                   Supports compound devices on a port-by-port basis.
                   Customizable vendor ID, product ID, and device ID.
                   Configurable downstream port power-on time reported to the host.
                   Supports indication of the maximum current that the hub consumes from the USB upstream port.
                   Supports Indication of the maximum current required for the hub controller.
                   Configurable as a either a Self-Powered or Bus-Powered Hub
                   Supports custom string descriptors (up to 30 characters):
                    — Product string
                    — Manufacturer string
                    — Serial number string
                   When available, I2C configurable options for default configuration may include:
                    — Downstream ports as non-removable ports
                    — Downstream ports as disabled ports
                    — USB signal drive strength
                    — USB receiver sensitivity
