1. General description
              PTN36043 is a very small, low power 2 differential channel 2 to 1 active
              multiplex/demultiplexer switch with integrated SuperSpeed USB 3.1 Gen 1 (also known as
              USB 3.0) redriver IC that can switch two differential signals to one of two locations. The
              active switch has optimized performance with minimized crosstalk, as required by the
              high-speed serial interface for USB Type-C connector. PTN36043 allows expansion of
              existing high-speed ports for very low power consumption.
              With integrated USB 3.1 Gen 1 redriver, signal quality is enhanced by performing receive
              equalization on the deteriorated input signal followed by transmit de-emphasis maximizing
              system link performance. With its superior differential signal conditioning and
              enhancement capability, the device delivers significant flexibility and performance scaling
              for various systems with different PCB characteristics and cable channel conditions and
              still benefit from optimum power consumption.
              PTN36043 has built-in advanced power management capability that enables significant
              power savings under various different USB 3.1 Gen 1 Low-power modes (U2/U3). It can
              detect link electrical conditions and can dynamically activate/de-activate internal circuitry
              and logic. The device performs these actions without host software intervention and
              conserves power.
              PTN36043 is powered from a 1.8 V supply and is available in a small DHX2QFN18
              package (2.4 mm  2.0 mm  0.35 mm) with 0.4 mm pitch.

7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PTN36043”.
                       PTN36043 is a high speed 2 to 1 active switch with integrated SuperSpeed USB 3.1 Gen
                       1 redriver meant to be used for signal integrity enhancement on various platforms - smart
                       phone, tablet, notebook, hub, A/V display and peripheral devices, for example. With its
                       high fidelity differential signal conditioning capability and wide configurability, this device is
                       flexible and versatile enough for use under a variety of system environments.
                       The following sections describe the individual block functions and capabilities of the
                       device in more detail.
                   7.1 Receive equalization, transmitter de-emphasis and output swing level
                       controls
                       On the high-speed signal path, the device performs receive equalization (EQ) and
                       transmitter de-emphasis (DE) and output swing control (OS). In addition, the device
                       provides flat frequency gain by boosting output signal. Both flat and frequency selective
                       gains prepare the system to cover up to losses further down the link.
                       Table 4 lists DE/OS/EQ configuration options of the channel toward application processor
                       side.

                   7.2 Device states and power management
                       PTN36043 has implemented an advanced power management scheme that operates in
                       tune with USB 3.1 Gen 1 bus electrical condition. Although the device does not decode
                       USB power management commands (related to USB 3.1 Gen 1 U1/U2/U3 transitions)
                       exchanged between USB 3.1 Gen 1 host and peripheral/device, it relies on bus electrical
                       conditions and SEL pin setting to decide to be in one of the following states:
                         • Active state wherein device is fully operational, USB data is transported on either
                           port 1 or port 2 in Figure 1. In this state, USB connection exists and the Receive
                           Termination indication remains active. But there is no need for Receive Termination
                           detection.
                         • Power-saving state wherein either port 1 or port 2 is kept enabled. In this state,
                           squelching, detection and/or Receive termination detection circuitry are active. Based
                           on USB connection, there are two possibilities:
                           – No USB connection.
                           – A USB connection exists and the link is in USB 3.1 Gen 1 U2/U3 mode.
                         • Off state when PTN36043 is not being powered (i.e., VDD1V8 = 0 V), special steps
                           should be done to prevent back-current issues on control pins such SEL or
                           CH1/2_SET1/2 pins when these pins' states are not low. These pins can be controlled
                           through two different ways.
                           – pull-up/pull-down resistors - make sure these pull-up resistors' VDD is the same
                              power source as to power PTN36043. When power to PTN36043 is off, power to
                              these pull-up resistors will be off as well.
                           – external processor's GPIO - if PTN36043 is turned off when the external
                              processor's power stays on, processor should configure these GPIOs connected to
                              these control pins as output low (< 0.4 V) or tri-state mode (configure GPIOs as
                              input mode). This will make sure no current will be flowing into PTN36043 through
                              these control pins.

                   7.3 SEL input pin
                       PTN36043 is designed with 1:2 high speed de-multiplexer configuration. TX_AP_± and
                       RX_AP_± can be connected to either TX_CON_1± and RX_CON_1±, or TX_CON_2±
                       and RX_CON_2± by changing the SEL input state.

8. Application guideline for Control of CHx_SETx and SEL input pins
                       PTN36043 implements ternary control IO logic on CHx_SETx and SEL control pins to
                       detect HIGH (connected to VDD), LOW (connected to GND) or left unconnected condition
                       (OPEN).
                       For all control pins except SEL, all 3 pin conditions are applicable. If the SEL pin is left
                       unconnected (OPEN), the internal logic treats it as LOW.
                       To minimize the current consumption of IO circuitry on SEL pin, it is recommended this pin
                       be driven from 1.8 V capable push-pull IO. If 1.8 V push-pull IO is not available in the
                       application, the SEL pin can be driven from an open drain grounded NMOS GPIO with
                       external pull-up resistor to the 1.8 V supply of PTN36043. The recommended value of the
                       external pull-up resistor is 30 k.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 18 and 19

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 13.
