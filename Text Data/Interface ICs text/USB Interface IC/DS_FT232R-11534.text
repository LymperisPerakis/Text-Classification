                                                                      Document No.: FT_000053 Clearance No.: FTDI# 38
4        Function Description
The FT232R is a USB to serial   UART interface device which simplifies USB to serial designs and reduces
external component count by     fully integrating an external EEPROM, USB termination resistors and an
integrated clock circuit which  requires no external crystal, into the device. It has been designed to
operate efficiently with a USB   host controller by using as little as possible of the total USB bandwidth
available.
4.1 Key Features
Functional Integration. Fully integrated EEPROM, USB termination resistors, clock generation, AVCC
filtering, POR and LDO regulator.
Configurable CBUS I/O Pin Options. The fully integrated EEPROM allows configuration of the Control
Bus (CBUS) functionality, signal inversion and drive strength selection. There are 5 configurable CBUS
I/O pins. These configurable options are -
     1.  TXDEN - transmit enable for RS485 designs.
     2.  PWREN# - Power control for high power, bus powered designs.
     3.  TXLED# - for pulsing an LED upon transmission of data.
     4.  RXLED# - for pulsing an LED upon receiving data.
     5.  TX&RXLED# - which will pulse an LED upon transmission OR reception of data.
     6.  SLEEP# - indicates that the device going into USB suspend mode.
     7.  CLK48 / CLK24 / CLK12 / CLK6 - 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz, and 6MHz clock output signal
         options.
     8. BitBangWRn / BitBangRDn - Synchronous and asynchronous bit bang mode WR# / RD#
         strobe outputs
The CBUS pins can also be individually configured as GPIO pins, similar to asynchronous bit bang mode.
It is possible to use this mode while the UART interface is being used, thus providing up to 4 general
purpose I/O pins which are available during normal operation. An application note, AN232R-01, available
from FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
The CBUS lines can be configured with any one of these output options by setting bits in the internal
EEPROM. The device is supplied with the most commonly used pin definitions pre-programmed - see
Section 8 for details.
Asynchronous Bit Bang Mode with RD# and WR# Strobes. The FT232R supports FTDI’s previous
chip generation bit-bang mode. In bit-bang mode, the eight UART lines can be switched from the regular
interface mode to an 8-bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the device and they will
be sequentially sent to the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer (equivalent to the baud rate
pre-scaler). With the FT232R device this mode has been enhanced by outputting the internal RD# and
WR# strobes signals which can be used to allow external logic to be clocked by accesses to the bit-bang
I/O bus. This option will be described more fully in a separate application note available from FTDI
website (www.ftdichip.com).
Synchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT232R supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs from
asynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. This
makes it easier for the controlling program to measure the response to an output stimulus as the data
returned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R-01, available from FTDI website
(www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
FTDIChip-ID™. The FT232R also includes the new FTDIChip-ID™ security dongle feature. This
FTDIChip-ID™ feature allows a unique number to be burnt into each device during manufacture. This
number cannot be reprogrammed. This number is only readable over USB and forms a basis of a security
dongle which can be used to protect any customer application software being copied. This allows the
possibility of using the FT232R in a dongle for software licensing. Further to this, a renewable license
scheme can be implemented based on the FTDIChip-ID™ number when encrypted with other information.
This encrypted number can be stored in the user area of the FT232R internal EEPROM, and can be
decrypted, then compared with the protected FTDIChip-ID™ to verify that a license is valid. Web based

applications can be used to maintain product licensing this way. An application note, AN232R-02,
available from FTDI website (www.ftdichip.com) describes this feature.
The FT232R is capable of operating at a voltage supply between +3.3V and +5V with a nominal
operational mode current of 15mA and a nominal USB suspend mode current of 70µA. This allows greater
margin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode current limit of 2.5mA. An integrated level
converter within the UART interface allows the FT232R to interface to UART logic running at +1.8V, 2.5V,
+3.3V or +5V.
4.2 Functional Block Descriptions
The following paragraphs detail each function within the FT232R. Please refer to the block diagram shown
in Figure 2.1.
Internal EEPROM. The internal EEPROM in the FT232R is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID
(PID), device serial number, product description string and various other USB configuration descriptors.
The internal EEPROM is also used to configure the CBUS pin functions. The FT232R is supplied with the
internal EEPROM pre-programmed as described in Section 8. A user area of the internal EEPROM is
available to system designers to allow storing additional data. The internal EEPROM descriptors can be
programmed in circuit, over USB without any additional voltage requirement. It can be programmed
using the FTDI utility software called FT_PROG, which can be downloaded from FTDI Utilities on the FTDI
website (www.ftdichip.com).
+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the
USB transceiver cell output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be attached to the
3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on
USBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells
rather than to power external logic. However, it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a
+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.
USB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full-speed physical interface
to the USB cable. The output drivers provide +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential
input receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single-Ended-0 (SE0) and USB
reset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates the internal USB series termination
resistors on the USB data lines and a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP.
USB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock
and data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.
Internal 12MHz Oscillator - The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This
provides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference
clock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and UART FIFO controller blocks.
Clock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal
Oscillator function and generates the 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz and 6MHz reference clock signals. The 48Mz
clock reference is used by the USB DPLL and the Baud Rate Generator blocks.
Serial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it
performs bit stuffing/un-stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also checks the CRC on the USB data
stream.
USB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control
endpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the
commands for controlling the functional parameters of the UART in accordance with the USB 2.0
specification chapter 9.
FIFO RX Buffer (128 bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the UART via the USB data OUT
endpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer. Data is removed from the buffer to the UART transmit
register under control of the UART FIFO controller. (Rx relative to the USB interface).

                                                                                                  Version 2.15
                                                                     Document No.: FT_000053 Clearance No.: FTDI# 38
FIFO TX Buffer (256 bytes). Data from the UART receive register is stored in the TX buffer. The USB
host controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for data from the device
data IN endpoint. (Tx relative to the USB interface).
UART FIFO Controller. The UART FIFO controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and
TX buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers.
UART Controller with Programmable Signal Inversion and High Drive. Together with the UART
FIFO Controller the UART Controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and FIFO TX
buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers. It performs asynchronous 7 or 8 bit parallel to serial
and serial to parallel conversion of the data on the RS232 (or RS422 or RS485) interface.
Control signals supported by UART mode include RTS, CTS, DSR, DTR, DCD and RI. The UART Controller
also provides a transmitter enable control signal pin option (TXDEN) to assist with interfacing to RS485
transceivers. RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR and XON / XOFF handshaking options are also supported. Handshaking
is handled in hardware to ensure fast response times. The UART interface also supports the RS232
BREAK setting and detection conditions.
Additionally, the UART signals can each be individually inverted and have a configurable high drive
strength capability. Both these features are configurable in the EEPROM.
Baud Rate Generator - The Baud Rate Generator provides a 16x clock input to the UART Controller
from the 48MHz reference clock. It consists of a 14 bit pre-scaler and 3 register bits which provide fine
tuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction or “sub-integer”). This determines the
baud rate of the UART, which is programmable from 183 baud to 3 Mbaud.
The FT232R supports all standard baud rates and non-standard baud rates from 183 Baud up to 3
Mbaud. Achievable non-standard baud rates are calculated as follows -
Baud Rate = 3000000 / (n + x)
Where ‘n’ can be any integer between 2 and 16,384 ( = 2 14 ) and ‘x’ can be a sub-integer of the value 0,
0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, or 0.875. When n = 1, x = 0, i.e. baud rate divisors with values
between 1 and 2 are not possible.
This gives achievable baud rates in the range 183.1 baud to 3,000,000 baud. When a non-standard baud
rate is required simply pass the required baud rate value to the driver as normal, and the FTDI driver will
calculate the required divisor, and set the baud rate. See FTDI application note AN232B-05 on the FTDI
website (www.ftdichip.com) for more details.
RESET Generator - The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power-on reset to the device
internal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT232R.
RESET# can be tied to VCC or left unconnected if not being used.

6         USB Power Configurations
The following sections illustrate possible USB power configurations for the FT232R. The illustrations have
omitted pin numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT232RL and FT232RQ
package options.
All USB power configurations illustrated apply to both package options for the FT232R device. Please refer

                                   Figure 6.1 Bus Powered Configuration
Figure 6.1 Illustrates the FT232R in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered
device gets its power from the USB bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows –
     i)      On plug-in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.
     ii)     In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA.
     iii)    A bus powered high power USB device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use one of
             the CBUS pins configured as PWREN# and use it to keep the current below 100mA on plug-in
             and 2.5mA on USB suspend.
     iv)     A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugged into a USB bus powered hub.
     v)      No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.
The power descriptors in the internal EEPROM of the FT232R should be programmed to match the current
drawn by the device.
A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT232R and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application. A suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from
Steward (www.steward.com), for example Steward Part # MI0805K400R-10.
Note: If using PWREN# (available using the CBUS) the pin should be pulled to VCCIO using a 10kΩ
resistor.

6.2 Self Powered Configuration
                                  Figure 6.2 Self-Powered Configuration
Figure 6.2 illustrates the FT232R in a typical USB self-powered configuration. A USB self-powered device
gets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic
rules for USB self-powered devices are as follows –
     i)       A self-powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub
              controller is powered down.
     ii)      A self-powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB
              suspend as it has its own power supply.
     iii)     A self-powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-
              powered USB hub.
The power descriptor in the internal EEPROM of the FT232R should be programmed to a value of zero
(self-powered).
n order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus power (pin 1) is used to control the
RESET# pin of the FT232R device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ resistor on
USBDP is pulled up to +3.3V (generated using the 4K7 and 10k resistor network), thus identifying the
device as a full speed device to the USB host or hub. When the USB host or hub is powered off, RESET#
will be low and the FT232R is held in reset. Since RESET# is low, the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is not pulled
up to any power supply (hub or host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1.5kΩ
pull-up resistor. Failure to do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.
Figure 6.2 illustrates a self-powered design which has a +4V to +5.25V supply.
Note:
     1. When the FT232R is in reset, the UART interface I/O pins are tri-stated. Input pins have internal
          200kΩ pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external
          logic.
     2. When using internal FT232R oscillator the VCC supply voltage range must be +4.0V to 5.25V.

     3. When using external oscillator the VCC supply voltage range must be +3.3V to 5.25V
         Any design which interfaces to +3.3 V or +1.8V would be having a +3.3V or +1.8V supply to
         VCCIO.

A requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode, the application draws a
total current of less than 2.5mA. This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the
ability to power itself down into a low current state by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic
that cannot power itself down in this way, the FT232R provides a simple but effective method of turning
off power during the USB suspend mode.
Figure 6.3 shows an example of using a discrete P-Channel MOSFET to control the power to external
logic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier (www.irf.com) IRLML6402, or equivalent. It
is recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used
to limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the
transient power surge, caused when the MOSFET switches on, will reset the FT232R or the USB host/hub
controller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 6.3 powers up with a slew rate of
approximaely12.5V/ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in
approximately 400 microseconds.
As an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used. A
suitable power switch IC for such an application is the Micrel (www.micrel.com) MIC2025-2BM or
equivalent.
With power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:
     i)  The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to
         automatically reset the logic when power is re-applied when moving out of suspend mode.
     ii) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the internal FT232R EEPROM.

    iii) One of the CBUS Pins should be configured as PWREN# in the internal FT232R EEPROM, and used
          to switch the power supply to the external circuitry. This should be pulled high through a 10 kΩ
          resistor.
    iv) For USB high-power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up
          to 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in
          the Max Power field in the internal FT232R EEPROM. A high-power bus powered application uses
          the descriptor in the internal FT232R EEPROM to inform the system of its power requirements.
    v) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered
          down using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.

             Figure 6.4 USB Bus Powered with +3.3V or +5V External Logic Power Supply
Figure 6.4 illustrates a USB bus power application with selectable external logic supply. The external logic
can be selected between +3.3V and +5V using the jumper switch. This jumper is used to allow the
FT232R to be interfaced with a +3.3V or +5V logic devices. The VCCIO pin is either supplied with +5V
from the USB bus (jumper pins1 and 2 connected), or from the +3.3V output from the FT232R 3V3OUT
pin (jumper pins 2 and 3 connected). The supply to VCCIO is also used to supply external logic.
With bus powered applications, the following should be noted:
    i)        To comply with the 2.5mA current supply limit during USB suspend mode, PWREN# or
              SLEEP# signals should be used to power down external logic in this mode. If this is not
              possible, use the configuration shown in Section 6.3.
    ii)       The maximum current sourced from the USB bus during normal operation should not exceed
              100mA, otherwise a bus powered design with power switching (Section 6.3) should be used.
Another possible configuration could use a discrete low dropout (LDO) regulator which is supplied by the
5V on the USB bus to supply between +1.8V and +2.8V to the VCCIO pin and to the external logic. In
this case VCC would be supplied with the +5V from the USB bus and the VCCIO would be supplied from

the output of the LDO regulator. This results in the FT232R I/O pins driving out at between +1.8V and
+2.8V logic levels.
For a USB bus powered application, it is important to consider the following when selecting the regulator:
    i)      The regulator must be capable of sustaining its output voltage with an input voltage of
            +4.35V. A Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator should be selected.
    ii)     The quiescent current of the regulator must be low enough to meet the total current
            requirement of <= 2.5mA during USB suspend mode.
A suitable series of LDO regulators that meets these requirements is the MicroChip/Telecom
(www.microchip.com) TC55 series of devices. These devices can supply up to 250mA current and have a
quiescent current of under 1μA.

                            Figure 7.1 Application Example showing USB to RS232 Converter
An example of using the FT232R as a USB to RS232 converter is illustrated in Figure 7.1. In this
application, a TTL to RS232 Level Converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT232R to
convert the TTL levels of the FT232R to RS232 levels. This level shift can be done using the popular “213”
series of TTL to RS232 level converters. These “213” devices typically have 4 transmitters and 5 receivers
in a 28-LD SSOP package and feature an in-built voltage converter to convert the +5V (nominal) VCC to
the +/- 9 volts required by RS232. A useful feature of these devices is the SHDN# pin which can be used
to power down the device to a low quiescent current during USB suspend mode.
A suitable level shifting device is the Sipex SP213EHCA which is capable of RS232 communication at up
to 500k baud. If a lower baud rate is acceptable, then several pin compatible alternatives are available
such as the Sipex SP213ECA, the Maxim MAX213CAI and the Analogue Devices ADM213E, which are all
suitable for communication at up to 115.2k baud. If a higher baud rate is required, the Maxim
MAX3245CAI device is capable of RS232 communication rates up to 1Mbaud. Note that the MAX3245 is
not pin compatible with the 213 series devices and that the SHDN pin on the MAX device is active high
and should be connect to PWREN# pin instead of SLEEP# pin.
In example shown, the CBUS0 and CBUS1 have been configured as TXLED# and RXLED# and are being
used to drive two LEDs.

                   Figure 7.2 Application Example Showing USB to RS485 Converter
An example of using the FT232R as a USB to RS485 converter is shown in Figure 7.2. In this application,
a TTL to RS485 level converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT232R to convert the TTL
levels of the FT232R to RS485 levels.
This example uses the Sipex SP481 device. Equivalent devices are available from Maxim and Analogue
Devices. The SP481 is a RS485 device in a compact 8 pin SOP package. It has separate enables on both
the transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the transmitter is only enabled when a character is being
transmitted from the UART. The TXDEN signal CBUS pin option on the FT232R is provided for exactly this
purpose and so the transmitter enable is wired to CBUS2 which has been configured as TXDEN. Similarly,
CBUS3 has been configured as PWREN#. This signal is used to control the SP481’s receiver enable. The
receiver enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB
suspend mode. CBUS2 = TXDEN and CBUS3 = PWREN# are the default device configurations of the
FT232R pins.
RS485 is a multi-drop network; so many devices can communicate with each other over a two wire cable
interface. The RS485 cable requires to be terminated at each end of the cable. A link (which provides the
120Ω termination) allows the cable to be terminated if the SP481 is physically positioned at either end of
the cable.
In this example the data transmitted by the FT232R is also present on the receive path of the SP481.This
is a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the transmitted data from
the received data stream. With the FT232R it is possible to do this entirely in hardware by modifying the
example shown in Figure 7.2 by logically OR’ing the FT232R TXDEN and the SP481 receiver output and
connecting the output of the OR gate to the RXD of the FT232R.
Note that the TXDEN is activated 1 bit period before the start bit. TXDEN is deactivated at the same time
as the stop bit. This is not configurable.

                                            Figure 7.3 USB to RS422 Converter Configuration
An example of using the FT232R as a USB to RS422 converter is shown in Figure 7.3. In this application,
two TTL to RS422 Level Converter ICs are used on the serial UART interface of the FT232R to convert the
TTL levels of the FT232R to RS422 levels. There are many suitable level converter devices available. This
example uses Sipex SP491 devices which have enables on both the transmitter and receiver. Since the
SP491 transmitter enable is active high, it is connected to a CBUS pin in SLEEP# configuration. The
SP491 receiver enable is active low and is therefore connected to a CBUS pin PWREN# configuration. This
ensures that when both the SP491 transmitters and receivers are enabled then the device is active, and
when the device is in USB suspend mode, the SP491 transmitters and receivers are disabled. If a similar
application is used, but the design is USB BUS powered, it may be necessary to use a P-Channel logic
level MOSFET (controlled by PWREN#) in the VCC line of the SP491 devices to ensure that the USB
standby current of 2.5mA is met.
The SP491 is specified to transmit and receive data at a rate of up to 5 Mbaud. In this example the
maximum data rate is limited to 3 Mbaud by the FT232R.

                                      Figure 7.4 USB to MCU UART Interface
An example of using the FT232R as a USB to Microcontroller (MCU) UART interface is shown in Figure
7.4. In this application the FT232R uses TXD and RXD for transmission and reception of data, and RTS# /
CTS# signals for hardware handshaking. Also in this example CBUS0 has been configured as a 12MHz
output to clock the MCU.
Optionally, RI# could be connected to another I/O pin on the MCU and used to wake up the USB host
controller from suspend mode. If the MCU is handling power management functions, then a CBUS pin can
be configured as PWREN# and would also be connected to an I/O pin of the MCU.

7.5 LED Interface
Any of the CBUS I/O pins can be configured to drive an LED. The FT232R has 3 configuration options for
driving LEDs from the CBUS. These are TXLED#, RXLED#, and TX&RXLED#. Refer to Section 3.5 for
configuration options.
                                                                       VCCIO

An example of using the FT232R to drive LEDs is shown in Figure 7.5. In this application one of the CBUS
pins is used to indicate transmission of data (TXLED#) and another is used to indicate receiving data
(RXLED#). When data is being transmitted or received the respective pins will drive from tristate to low
in order to provide indication on the LEDs of data transfer. A digital one-shot is used so that even a small
percentage of data transfer is visible to the end user.
                                                                        VCCIO

Another example of using the FT232R to drive LEDs is shown in Figure 7.6. In this example one of the
CBUS pins is used to indicate when data is being transmitted or received by the device (TX&RXLED). In
this configuration the FT232R will drive only a single LED.

7.6 Using the External Oscillator
The FT232R defaults to operating using its own internal oscillator. This requires that the device is
powered with VCC(min)=+4.0V. This supply voltage can be taken from the USB VBUS. Applications which
require using an external oscillator, VCC= +3.3V, must do so in the following order:
    1. When device powered for the very first time, it must have VCC > +4.0V. This supply is available
        from the USB VBUS supply = +5.0V.
    2. The EEPROM must then be programmed to enable external oscillator. This EEPROM modification
        cannot be done using the FTDI programming utility, FT_PROG. The EEPROM can only be re-
        configured from a custom application. Please refer to the following applications note on how to do
        this:
        AN_100_Using_The_FT232_245R_With_External_Osc
    3. The FT232R can then be powered from VCC=+3.3V and an external oscillator. This can be done
        using a link to switch the VCC supply.
The FT232R will fail to operate when the internal oscillator has been disabled, but no external oscillator
has been connected.

8        Internal EEPROM Configuration
Following a power-on reset or a USB reset the FT232R will scan its internal EEPROM and read the USB
configuration descriptors stored there. The default factory programmed values of the internal EEPROM
are shown in Table 8.1.
