                                                input) using large resistance values to minimize power. It should also be decoupled by a 0.1uF

Functional Description
USB Interface
The XR22800 is a USB compound device with an embedded hub and 3 downstream USB functions. The downstream func-
tions of the XR22800 are 10/100 Ethernet, an I2C function, and an Enhanced Dedicated GPIO Entity (EDGE) function. The
upstream USB interface of the XR22800 is compliant with both USB 2.0 full and hi-speed specifications. All functions down-
stream of the hub are hi-speed functions.
The XR22800 will have a single vendor ID and vendor string. Each function in the XR22800 will have an individual product
string and serial string. The default serial number strings will be based upon the uniquely assigned Ethernet MAC address
for each XR22800 device. The serial strings for multiple functions within the same device will differ only by a single charac-
ter which will be assigned a value between 0 and 7. All string and ID values can be overridden via OTP.
The XR22800 can be placed into a low power or suspended state by the USB host. By default the XR22800 hub is config-
ured for bus powered mode with a maximum power of 250 mA. All other functions in the XR22800 are configured for self-
powered mode. In bus powered mode, the Ethernet Phy must be powered down during suspended state to meet USB sus-
pend power requirements. The Ethernet Phy may remain enabled to support Ethernet remote wakeup during suspend if the
device is self-powered and the usb OTP is modified to report the hub function as self-powered in the USB descriptors. See
Ethernet Remote Wakeup section on page 10.
Each function of the XR22800 supports one configuration and utilizes the following USB endpoints:
• USB hub
     • Control endpoint
     • Interrupt-in endpoint
• Ethernet function
     • Control endpoint
     • Interrupt-in endpoint
     • Bulk-in and bulk-out endpoints
• I2C function
     • Control endpoint
     • Interrupt-in and interrupt-out endpoints
• EDGE Controller function
     • Control endpoint
     • Interrupt-in and interrupt-out endpoints
USB Vendor ID
Exar’s USB vendor ID is 0x04E2. This is the default vendor ID that is used for the XR22800. Companies may obtain their
own vendor ID, by becoming members of USB.org. The XR22800 OTP can then be modified to report this vendor ID in the
USB descriptors.
USB Product ID
Each function in the XR22800 has an individual USB product ID. The default product IDs for each of the functions are
shown in Table 1. These values can be modified by programming the OTP. Companies using their own vendor ID may also
select their own product IDs. Additionally, upon request MaxLinear will provide a selection of different product IDs for use
with Exar’s vendor ID for companies that do not wish to become members of USB.org, but wish to use their own product ID.

USB Suspend
All USB peripheral devices must support the USB suspend mode. Per USB standard, the XR22800 device will begin to
enter the suspend state if it does not detect any activity, (including Start of Frame or SOF packets) on its USB data lines for
3 ms. The peripheral device must then reduce power consumption from VBUS power within the next 7 ms to the allowed
limit of 2.5 mA per function for the suspended state. Because the XR22800 is a compound device with 4 functions, the sus-
pend state power limit is 10 mA for the device. Note that in this context, the "device" is all circuitry (including the XR22800)
that draws power from the host VBUS.
USB Strings
USB specifies three character string descriptors that are provided to the USB host during enumeration in string descriptors:
the manufacturer, product and serial strings. In a compound device such as the XR22800, each function provides these
strings to the USB host. The default manufacturer string for the XR22800 device is "Exar Corp.". The default product strings
for the hub, Ethernet function, I2C function and EDGE function are shown in Table . The serial number string is a unique
alpha-numeric ASCII string programmed into the device at the factory.

The OTP may be used to override these strings. However, to ensure unique serial numbers for each device, it is recom-
mended that the factory pre-programmed serial number string be used and not be overwritten via OTP.
USB Device Drivers
Each of the functions in the XR22800 require a USB device driver for operation. Both the I2C and EDGE functions conform
to the HID device class and as such, utilize the embedded HID driver that is native to each Operating System. The embed-
ded hub also uses the native hub driver. The Ethernet function conforms to the CDC device class and as such can utilize an
embedded CDC-ECM driver. However, at the time of this writing, none of the Microsoft OS provide support for CDC-ECM
embedded drivers. Both Linux and Mac OS-X platforms do support CDC-ECM drivers.
The CDC-ECM driver is a class specific driver which provides functionality for USB Ethernet devices. It operates without
any ability to access device specific register sets. In some cases, this can limit the functionality and / or throughput capabil-
ity of the XR22800. MaxLinear provides a custom Ethernet device driver which has been optimized for the best possible
data through-put in Windows platforms. Refer to 10/100 Ethernet section on page 10 for more details.

                                                                                                                  XR22800
10/100 Ethernet
The Ethernet port is a 10/100 Ethernet MAC and Phy compliant with IEEE 802.3. The Ethernet port supports speed /
duplex auto-negotiation, auto-MDIX, 10 Mbps data auto-polarity, full and half duplex data rates at 10 and 100 Mbps, gener-
ates and validates the 32-bit FCS, and performs unicast and multicast filtering. The XR22800 also performs TCP, UDP and
ICMP checksum offload over IPV4 and IPV6 as well as header checksum offload in IPV4. On chip RAM provides all
required packet buffering.
In Windows OS, using the MaxLinear custom Ethernet driver, the properties dialog, advanced properties can be used to set
the pause frame flow control, speed and duplex, auto-negotiation, checksum offload, and Ethernet remote wakeup settings.
By default, the Ethernet MAC will honor incoming pause frames sent by a peer Ethernet device, but will not generate pause
frames. Auto-MDIX is always enabled.
Ethernet Remote Wakeup
If the XR22800 hub is configured as a self-powered device and has Ethernet remote wakeup enabled, the XR22800 will
request the USB host to resume in response to a magic packet or a link state change on the Ethernet port. When the USB
host is suspended, the Ethernet Phy remains active and the XR22800 is able to both meet USB suspend mode power
requirements as well as respond to magic packet and link state changes.
The magic packet is an Ethernet packet with specific content, i.e. 6 bytes of 0xFF, followed by 16 repetitions of the target
MAC address (MAC address of the XR22800 device). This content can occur anywhere in the incoming packet payload.
The link state change will wake the USB host if the link is down when the USB host is suspended and then the link goes up,
or if the link is up when the USB host is suspended and then the link goes down.
EDGE - Enhanced Dedicated GPIO Entity
The XR22800 has 8 EDGE IO pins The EDGE controller allows for GPIO signals to be individually set or cleared or to be
grouped, such that the all pins in the group can be simultaneously accessed for reads or writes. Note that on write
accesses, output pins will change in 4-bit subgroups on core clock (60 MHz) boundaries. For example, if an 8 bit data group
is defined and the data value is written from 0x00 to 0xFF, 4 bits would change from ’0’ to ’1’ followed by the next 4 bits one
clock cycle (~ 17 ns) later.
EDGE IOs can be configured as inputs or outputs. Outputs can be configured as push-pull or open drain and can be tri-
stated. Inputs can be configured to generate interrupts to the USB host on either negative or postive edge transitions.
Another feature of the EDGE controller is that up to 2 GPIO pins within the EDGE can be assigned to pulse width modu-
lated (PWM) outputs. Each of the PWM outputs can be used to generate an output clock or pulse of varying duty cycle.
Both low and high cycles can be configured in steps of 267 ns up to 1.092 ms. The output can be controlled to generate a
single "one-shot" pulse or to free run. Refer to the EDGE_PWM0_CTRL and EDGE_PWM1_CTRL registers on page 22
and page 24 for control of PWM outputs.
I2C
The XR22800 implements an I2C multi-master using the control endpoint of the full-speed USB function to transfer data to
and from the I2C interface. The I2C master supports both standard (100 kbps) and fast (400 kbps) modes and supports mul-
tiple master configurations to allow other devices to access slave devices on the I2C. The I2C function is an HID function
and uses the native HID driver. It supports both 7 and 10 bit addressing modes.
Regulated 3.3V Power Output
The XR22800 internal voltage regulator provides 3.3 VDC output power which can be utilized by other circuitry. Refer to
Electrical Characteristics” on page 3 for maximum power capability. For bus powered devices, significant utilization of the
3V3 output power may require increasing the maximum power request above the 250 mA default value from the USB host
by programming the OTP.

OTP
The OTP is an on-chip non-volatile memory, that is one-time programmable via the USB interface. Bit locations within the
memory may be programmed at various times allowing for customization of the XR22800. Some bits are pre-programmed
at the factory and caution must be taken not to program any locations except user defined addresses. Contact the factory
for information and assistance in programming the XR22800 OTP.

HID Reports
The I2C and EDGE functions in the XR22800 are HID functions. I2C data may be read or written to / from the slave device
using the interrupt in and interrupt out endpoints via HID input and output reports. Additionally, XR22800 device register
access using the control endpoint for both I2C and EDGE functions is performed via HID feature reports. Reading uses indi-
rect addressing such that for register reads, the register address must first be written and the register value may then be
read. Both types of reports are described below.
Input and Output Reports
Input and output reports using the interrupt in and interrupt out endpoints follow the following format.
I2C_SLAVE_OUT
Transfer Type: Interrupt Out
Transfer Size: 37 bytes
The I2C_SLAVE_OUT report writes and / or reads up to 32 bytes of data on the I2C interface. Note that all interrupt out
transfers will be automatically followed by an interrupt in transfer. For write only transfers, the interrupt in packet will contain
the status of the interrupt out transfer. For read only or write and read transfers, the interrupt in packet will contain the read
data, as well as the status of the interrupt out transfer. The format of the interrupt out packet is given below.

                                                                      only the number of bytes specified in WrSize will be written. Other bytes

* Note: To support 10-bit addressing the standard 7-bit address must be set to 1111 0xxB where xx are the most significant bits of the 10-
bit address. All 4 of these 7-bit addresses are reserved and will not be used by any slaves with 7-bit only addresses. The least significant
bit of the address byte still specifies the direction. For writes, the first data byte which was previously unformatted is now reserved for the
least significant 8 bits of the 10-bit address. Additional data bytes remain unformatted. For reads, the write-then-read combined transfer
format is always used. During the write portion of the combined transfer the master must send at least one data byte which contains the
least significant 8 bits of the 10-bit address. After all of the write data is sent the master then sends a restart bit. This is followed with an
address byte which has the same 7-bit address 1111 0xxB as in the write portion. However, the direction bit is now 1 for reading. The slave
then sends the read data as usual. The least significant 8 bits of the 10-bit address are not sent again after the restart bit.

HID Register Descriptions
Note that all register reset default values are ’0’ unless otherwise specified. All registers are 16 bits.
I2C_SCL_LOW (0x341) - Read/Write
     Bit     Default                                                        Description
  15:0      0x0144      Value
                        Specifies the number of periods that SCL will be asserted low by the XR22800 I2C master. Note that in clock
                        stretching, the I2C slave may extend the SCL low period to delay the next transaction. For 100 kbps transfer
                        rate this value must be at least 252 (0x00FC) and the sum of high and low periods must be at least 600
                        (0x0258). For 400kbps transfer rate this value must be at least 78 (0x004E) and the sum of the high and low
                        periods must be at least 150 (0x0096). Measured in 60 MHz core clock periods, i.e. approximately 16.7 ns.
I2C_SCL_HIGH (0x342) - Read/Write
     Bit     Default                                                        Description
  15:0      0x0114      Value
                        Specifies the number of periods that SCL will be asserted high by the XR22800 I2C master. Note that another
                        multi-master may assert SCL low before the XR22800 high period is completed. For 100 kbps transfer rate this
                        value must be at least 240 (0x00F0) and the sum of the high and low periods must be at least 600 (0x0258).
                        For 400 kbps transfer rate this value must be at least 36 (0x0024) and the sum of the high and low periods must
                        be at least 150 (0x0096). Measured in 60 MHz core clock periods, i.e. approximately 16.7 ns
EDGE_DIR (0x3C1) - Read/Write
Note that when setting direction of an EDGE IO to output, the EDGE_PULL_UP for that IO pin should also be disabled and
when setting an EDGE IO pin to input, the EDGE_PULL_UP for that IO pin should also be enabled.
     Bit     Default                                                        Description

 15:8   0xFF     Reserved
                 These bits are reserved and should be written as ‘1’.
 7:0    0x00     E[7:0]
                 Writing in this register sets or clears the EDGE IO pin(s) configured as an output. Writing to an EDGE pin con-
                 figured as an input has no effect. Reading this register returns the state of each IO pin configured as an EDGE
                 pin irrespective of whether it is configured as an input or output. Note that output transitions across multiple IO
                 pins may be slightly staggered. Refer to page 10.
                 0: Write clears the corresponding bit to a ‘0’. Read returns the current state.
                 1: Write sets the corresponding bit to a ‘1’. Read returns the current state.
EDGE_TRI_STATE (0x3C5) - Read/Write
    Bit  Default                                                      Description
 15:8   0x00     Reserved
                 These bits are reserved and should be written as ‘0’.
 7:0    0x00     E[7:0]
                 0: IO pin assigned to EDGE function and configured as an output is actively driven
                 1: IO pin assigned to EDGE function and configured as an output is tri-stated
EDGE_OPEN_DRAIN (0x3C6) - Read/Write
    Bit  Default                                                      Description
 15:8   0x00     Reserved
                 These bits are reserved and should be written as ‘0’.
 7:0    0x00     E[7:0]

                 an input to generate an interrupt if either EDGE_INTR_POS_EDGE and / or EDGE _INTR_NEG_EDGE regis-
                 ters has also been enabled. An EDGE pin configured as an output has no effect.
                 0: IO pin will not generate an interrupt
