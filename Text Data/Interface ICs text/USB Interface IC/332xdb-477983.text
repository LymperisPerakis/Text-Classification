                                                              Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
General Description
                SMSC’s USB332x is a family of Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Transceivers that provides a physical layer (PHY)
                solution well-suited for portable electronic devices. Both commercial and industrial temperature
                applications are supported.
                Each model in the USB332x family may use a 60MHz reference clock, or the model-number specific
                reference clock shown in Order Numbers on page 2.
                Several advanced features make the USB332x the transceiver of choice by reducing both electrical
                bill of material (eBOM) part count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness
                eliminates the need for external ESD protection devices in typical applications. The internal Over-
                Voltage Protection circuit (OVP) protects the USB332x from voltages up to 30V. By using a reference
                clock from the Link, the USB332x removes the cost of a dedicated crystal reference from the design.
                And the integrated USB switch enables unique product features with a single USB port of connection.
                The USB332x meets all of the electrical requirements to be used as a Hi-Speed USB Host, Device, or
                an On-the-Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition to the supporting USB signaling, the USB332x also
                provides USB UART mode and USB Audio mode.
                USB332x uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
                Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers between the Link and PHY to
                facilitate a USB session with only 12 pins.
                The USB332x uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
                less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
                latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
                adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.
                                                                            REFCLK

Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with 1.8V ULPI Interface
                The USB332x includes an integrated 3.3V Low Drop Out (LDO) linear voltage regulator that may
                optionally be used to generate 3.3V from power applied at the VBAT pin. The voltage on the VBAT
                pin can range from 3.1 to 5.5V. The regulator dropout voltage is less than 100mV which allows the
                PHY to continue USB signaling when the voltage on VBAT drops to 3.1V. The USB transceiver will
                continue to operate at lower voltages, although some parameters may be outside the limits of the USB
                specifications. If the user would like to provide a 3.3V supply to the USB332x, the VBAT and VDD33
                pins should be connected together.
                The USB332x also includes integrated pull-up resistors that can be used for detecting the attachment
                of a USB Charger. By sensing the attachment to a USB Charger, a product using the USB332x can
                charge its battery at more than the 500mA allowed when charging from a USB Host.
                In USB UART mode, the USB332x DP and DM pins are redefined to enable pass-through of
                asynchronous serial data. The USB332x can only enter UART mode when the user programs the part
                into this mode.
                In USB audio mode, a switch connects the DP pin to the SPK_R pin, and another switch connects he
                DM pin to the SPK_L pin. The USB332x can be configured to enter USB audio mode. In addition,
                these switches are on when the RESETB pin of the USB332x is asserted. The USB audio mode
                enables audio signalling from a single USB port of connection, and the switches may also be used to
                connect Full Speed USB from another PHY onto the USB cable.
