General Description
The CY7C65219-40LQXI Dock Management Controller (DMC) is a USB Billboard controller that is designed for managing USB dock
and monitor solutions. The DMC provides USB full-speed capability to support USB Billboard device class v1.21. It supports signed
and unsigned firmware download over USB to programmable dock components (such as USB PD Controller and Hub controller)
connected to the DMC. DMC uses Cypress’ proprietary M0S8 technology with a 32-bit, 48-MHz Arm® Cortex® -M0 processor with
128-KB flash, 8-KB SRAM, 20 GPIOs, full-speed USB device controller, and a Crypto engine for authentication. DMC provides
system-level ESD protection. DMC is available in a 40-QFN package.

Available Firmware and Software Tools
EZ-PD Dock DMC Configuration Generation Tool
The EZ-PD Dock DMC Configuration Generation Tool can be used to update DMC images with the modified configuration. It allows
configuring the dock topology to manage and do firmware update to programmable dock components connected to DMC.
EZ-PD Dock Image Creation Tool
The EZ-PD Dock Image Creation Tool is used to create a single combined firmware image file, referred to as the composite dock
image from firmware files of components present in the dock. This composite image is used for firmware update to be used by EZ-PD
Dock Firmware Update Tool.
EZ-PD Dock Firmware Update Tool
The EZ-PD Dock Firmware Update Tool is a WinUSB-based application that runs on Windows systems. This tool updates firmware
for devices in the dock and reports the final consolidated status. It takes the files generated using the EZ-PD Dock Image Creation
Tool as the input and initiates a firmware update.

Application Firmware Update over USB Interface
The application firmware provided by Cypress for all DMC applications have dual images. Application firmware can only be updated
using other copy of application firmware over the USB vendor interface that binds to the Microsoft WinUSB driver. This allows fail-safe
update of the alternate image while executing from the current image. For more information, refer to the EZ-PD Dock Reference
Design Guide.
In this application, the firmware update can be performed over the D+/D- lines (USB2.0) as shown in Figure 4.

 IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PROTECTED FIRMWARE DOWNLOAD: Cypress has implemented protections in the product to prevent unauthorized firmware updates from being applied to the
 product. However, no computing device or system can be absolutely secure. Therefore, the parties agree that Cypress shall not have any liability arising out of any failure of the product's security
 features, such as the inability to load firmware or a breach allowing the loading of unauthorized firmware.
Notice regarding compliance with Universal Serial Bus specification. Cypress offers firmware and hardware solutions that are certified to comply with the Universal Serial Bus specification, USB
Type-C™ Cable and Connector Specification, and other specifications of USB Implementers Forum, Inc (USB-IF). You may use Cypress or third party software tools, including sample code, to modify
the firmware for Cypress USB products. Modification of such firmware could cause the firmware/hardware combination to no longer comply with the relevant USB-IF specification. You are solely
responsible ensuring the compliance of any modifications you make, and you must follow the compliance requirements of USB-IF before using any USB-IF trademarks or logos in connection with any
modifications you make. In addition, if Cypress modifies firmware based on your specifications, then you are responsible for ensuring compliance with any desired standard or specifications as if you
had made the modification. CYPRESS IS NOT RESPONSIBLE IN THE EVENT THAT YOU MODIFY OR HAVE MODIFIED A CERTIFIED CYPRESS PRODUCT AND SUCH MODIFIED PRODUCT
NO LONGER COMPLIES WITH THE RELEVANT USB-IF SPECIFICATIONS.
