                 Rev. 1 — 9 December 2016                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
              PTN5150A is a small thin low power CC Logic chip supporting the USB Type-C connector
              application with Configuration Channel (CC) control logic detection and indication
              functions. The features of PTN5150A enable USB Type-C connector to be used in both
              host and device ends of the Type-C cable. It can support Type-C to USB legacy cables
              and adapters defined in USB Type-C Spec. PTN5150A can work autonomously, or can
              connect to a controller through I2C-bus interface.
              PTN5150A can be configured to dual role, host, or device mode through external
              configuration pin or through I2C interface. The CC control logic detection and indication
              block supports 3 current modes (default current 500 mA/900 mA, medium current 1.5 A
              and high current 3.0 A) in DFP advertisement's perspective. When in UFP
              advertisement's perspective, the control logic will detect if a DFP with different pull-up Rp
              current source is connected. In addition, it will detect if Ra is present on CC1/CC2 pins.
              Upon detection of plug orientation, pin ID will indicate if PTN5150A is working under either
              host role or device role, and other status will also be reflected in I2C registers.

                   7.1 CC detection and indication block
                        For USB Type-C solution, two pins on the connector, CC1 and CC2, are used to establish
                        and manage the DFP/UFP connection between a host port and a device port.
                        A hardware GPIO trinary pin, PORT, is provided to configure PTN5150A in either
                        DFP/DRP/UFP mode alternatively, the PORT input can be override later by override the
                        I2C registers. If the GPIO Trinary ADR input is mid-level or floating (non I2C), PORT input
                        pin can dynamically change at any time to reconfigure the DFP/DRP/UFP. The GPIO
                        trinary input pins should be powered by VDD.
                          • When PTN5150A is operating under host role, different current modes
                             (high/medium/default) can be configured through I2C register. During initial power up,
                             default current mode is being selected. In order to indicate different current modes,
                             three Rp current sources are being implemented.

                        Internal comparators are constantly monitoring the voltage levels of CC1 and CC2 pins.
                        PTN5150A reports if an UFP (device) or powered cable is connected externally on the CC
                        pins. When no external connection is detected, cable connected bit in the I2C register will
                        be cleared. Any changes in the attach/detach events or Rp current source changes will
                        trigger INTB pin to go LOW.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                               PTN5150A
                                                                                                              CC logic for USB Type-C applications
                         • When PTN5150A is operating under device role (UFP), it is able to detect different
                            current modes indicated by external host's pull-up resistors. Internally there is a
                            pull-down resistor (Rd) of 5.1 k on CC1 and CC2 pins. Status of current mode
                            detected is reported in the I2C register. If pin 6/7/8 is configured as OUT1/2/3,
                            OUT1/2 reports the detected Rp pull up current source value as well.
                       The configuration channel (CC1 or CC2) is used to serve the following purposes in this
                       block
                         • Detect connection of USB ports, e.g. a DFP (host) or a UFP (device), and establish
                            host or device roles between two connected ports. When there is no power supplied
                            to PTN5150A, device role (with internal pull-down resistor Rd active) will be the
                            default configuration.
                         • Resolve cable orientation and twist connections to establish USB data bus routing.
                         • Discover optional accessory modes such as audio adapter accessory and debug
                            accessory modes. Resistors (Ra, Rd, Rp, or Open) connected on CC1/CC2 will be
                            reported in the I2C registers, and host controller can configure the external interface
                            accordingly.
                   7.2 ADR/CON_DET output pin
                       Pin 5 is multiple purpose I/O pin. When device power up, pin 5 is input which latched the
                       input voltage level to configure I2C address. The I2C register offset 09H has default value
                       "1" to disable CON_DET output. After TINPUT_LATCH, pin 5 becomes CON_DET output.
                       When USB Type-C cable attached or detached in either DFP or UFP mode, CON_DET
                       will asserted a signal to notify the system the status. The same attached or detached
                       status also stored in the I2C interrupt register.
                       For ADR strapping resistor selection, 10 k pull up or pull down resistor is recommended.
                   7.3 VCONN1/VCONN2 power output control
                       When a USB Type-C system need to support VCONN power in DFP or UFP power
                       accessories mode, the system need to know the orientation to provide VCONN power.
                       PTN5150A provides two bits of VCONN status register 0AH and an interrupt signal to
                       notify system whether VCONN power is detected on VCONN1 or VCONN2 and then turn
                       on discrete PowerFET using via 2 x GPIO. Figure 3 shows the system level
                       implementation of VCONN power with PTN5150A.

                   7.4 Off state
                       When PTN5150A is not powered (i.e., VDD = 0 V), special steps should be done to
                       prevent back-current issues on control pins such PORT or ADR pins when these pins'
                       states are not low. These pins can be controlled through two different ways.
                        1. pull-up/pull-down resistors - make sure these pull-up resistors' VDD is the same
                            power source as to power PTN5150A. When power to PTN5150A is off, power to
                            these pull-up resistors will be off as well.
                        2. external processor's GPIO - if PTN5150A is turned off when the external processor's
                            power stays on, processor should configure these GPIOs connected to these control
                            pins as output low (< 0.4 V) or tri-state mode (configure GPIOs as input mode). This
                            will make sure no current will be flowing into PTN5150A through these control pins.
                   7.5 I2C-bus
                       PTN5150A can work with systems with or without I2C-bus. “I2C mode” is defined as ADR
                       pin has external 10 k pull-up or pull-down resistor during power up, and “non-I2C mode”
                       is defined as ADR pin is not connected to any external pull-up or pull-down resistor during
                       power up. When operating in I2C mode, all features of PTN5150A can be configured and
                       accessed through registers. OUT1, OUT2, OUT3 are not available in I2C mode. PORT
                       input will be a one-time latched during power up.
                       In non-I2C mode, a subset of features can be configured or accessed through these I/O
                       pins:
                         •  PORT input: In non I2C-bus mode, PORT input can be dynamically change.
                         •  CON_DET output: attached/detached notification
                         •  OUT1/OUT2 output: detected Rp current source value
                         •  OUT3: Analog Audio Detect

                   7.6 I2C-bus programmability
                          PTN5150A has I2C-bus interface that enables system integrator to program register
                          settings suitable for the application needs. Table 7 describes possible settings for different
                          functions of the device. Although some functions of the device can be configured through
                          external hardware pins (such as PORT), it also allows the system integrator to override
                          the settings by programming the internal registers through I2C.
                          After power-on, the device samples the hardware pin values (as I2C is not operational yet)
                          and reflects the status in the I2C status registers as default condition.

                          Reading/writing the internal registers must be done according to the following protocol.
                          The read protocol contains two phases:
                            • Command phase
                            • Data phase
                          The command phase is an I2C write to PTN5150A that contains a single data byte
                          indicating the internal register address to read out. The data phase is an I2C read
                          operation that contains one byte of data and STOP bit is asserted, starting from the least
                          significant byte.

                           The I2C write operation contains only the command phase, which contains 8-bit internal
                           register address, followed by one byte of data to be written to the register, starting from
                           the least significant byte.
                           It is recommended to use single-byte write/read commands to PTN5150A. Incremental
                           address read/write function is not supported. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate the protocol
                           used on the I2C-bus to write and read register inside the device.

                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                         • Through-hole components
                         • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board

                                                                                                             CC logic for USB Type-C applications
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 12) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 20 and 21

                   Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                   times.
                   Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                   soldering, see Figure 12.
