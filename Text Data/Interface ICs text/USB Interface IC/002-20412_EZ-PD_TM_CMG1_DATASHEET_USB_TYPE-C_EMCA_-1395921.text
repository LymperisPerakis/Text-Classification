General Description
EZ-PD™ CMG1 is a dedicated USB Type-C EMCA controller that complies with the USB Type-C and Power Delivery (PD) standards
for Electronically Marked Type-C Thunderbolt and non-Thunderbolt passive cable applications. EZ-PD CMG1 integrates a complete
Type-C transceiver including the RA termination resistors on the VCONN pins and VBUS short circuit protection on both VCONN and
CC pins. CMG1 also includes 40 bytes of storage for configuration of vendor-, device-, and cable-specific configuration data.
EZ-PD CMG1 is targeted for passive EMCA implementations with either one or two e-marker chips on the cable.

Notes
 1. Keep pin A3 floating for all passive EMCA applications. See Figure 4 and Figure 5 for more details.
 2. Any of the optional GND pins B3, C2, and C3 can be connected to system GND for better board layout routability. If connected to GND, ensure that the selected
    pin/s are shorted with the VSS pin (B2) of the CMG1 device in their board layout. If users are not planning to connect these optional GND pins to system GND, then
    it is mandatory to leave them unconnected in their board designs.

Power
Figure 2 shows an overview of the CMG1 power system requirement. CMG1 operates from two possible external supply sources,
VCONN1 and VCONN2. The VCONN supplies support operation over 2.7 V–5.5 V. CMG1 has two different power modes: Active and
Sleep, transitions between which are managed by the Power System. The VCCD pin, the output of the core regulator (1.8 V), is
brought out for connecting a 1-µF capacitor for regulator stability only. This pin is not supported as a power supply.

CMG1 Application Configuration Update Over CC Interface
The CMG1 Manufacturing Test Kit (MTK) Utility is used for updating the configuration parameters of the CMG1 devices over the CC
interface. The CMG1 MTK Utility is integrated as a part of the EZ-PD Configuration Utility and is supported by its version 1.1 Beta (or
later). Vendor-specific and cable-specific parameters can be set using the EZ-PD Configuration Utility. Once the parameters are set,
the CMG1 MTK Utility is used for configuration and testing of CMG1-based passive EMCA cables.
To use the CMG1 MTK Utility, you must use the CY4532 EZ-PD CCG3PA EVK as shown in a high-level block diagram in Figure 3.
The CMG1 MTK Utility is accompanied with a CMG1 MTK-specific firmware solution, which is intended for the CCG4 device present
on the CY4532 EZ-PD CCG3PA EVK’s Power Board. If customers are using the CY4532 EZ-PD CCG3PA EVK for the first time to
update the configuration parameters of CMG1 devices, then the CCG4 device’s firmware needs to be updated to this MTK-specific
firmware (detailed instructions are provided in Getting Started with EZ-PD CMG1 Application Note).
The EZ-PD Configuration Utility 1.1 Beta (or later), which integrates and supports the CMG1 MTK Utility, can be downloaded here.
For further details, follow the instructions provided in Getting Started with EZ-PD CMG1 Application Note for hardware setup and
step-by-step instructions. Also, see Chapter 4 of the EZ-PD Configuration Utility User Manual for more details on how to configure
and test CMG1-based passive EMCA cables.
