If Autovectoring is enabled (AV2EN = 1 in the INTSET-UP register), the FX2LP substitutes its INT2VEC byte. Therefore, if the high
byte (“page”) of a jump table address is preloaded at the location 0x0044, the automatically inserted INT2VEC byte at 0x0045 directs
the jump to the correct address out of the 27 addresses within the page.
FIFO/GPIF Interrupt (INT4)
Just as the USB Interrupt is shared among 27 individual USB interrupt sources, the FIFO/GPIF interrupt is shared among 14 individual
FIFO/GPIF sources. The FIFO/GPIF Interrupt, similar to the USB Interrupt, can employ autovectoring.
Table 4 on page 8 shows the priority and INT4VEC values for the 14 FIFO/GPIF interrupt sources.

If Autovectoring is enabled (AV4EN = 1 in the INTSET-UP
register), the FX 2LP substitutes its INT4VEC byte. Therefore, if
the high byte (“page”) of a jump-table address is preloaded at
location 0x0054, the automatically inserted INT4VEC byte at
0x0055 directs the jump to the correct address out of the 14
addresses within the page. When the ISR occurs, the FX2LP
pushes the program counter to its stack then jumps to address
0x0053, where it expects to find a “jump” instruction to the
interrupt service routine (ISR).

  3. Errata: In Slave FIFO Asynchronous Word Wide mode, if a single word data is transferred from the USB host to EP2, configured as OUT Endpoint (EP) in the first
     transaction, then the Empty flag behaves incorrectly. This does not happen if the data size is more than one word in the first transaction. For more information, see
     the “Errata” on page 64.

Notes
 11. Unused inputs must not be left floating. Tie either HIGH or LOW as appropriate. Outputs should only be pulled up or down to ensure signals at power up and in standby.
     Note also that no pins should be driven while the device is powered down.
 12. The Reset column indicates the state of signals during reset (RESET# asserted) or during Power on Reset (POR).

The junction temperature j, can be calculated using the following equation: j = P*Ja + a
Where,
P = Power
Ja = Junction to ambient temperature (Jc + Ca)
a = Ambient temperature (70 °C)
The case temperature c, can be calculated using the following equation: c = P*Ca + a
where,
P = Power
Ca = Case to ambient temperature
a = Ambient temperature (70 °C)
 Note
  17. Do not power I/O with the chip power OFF.

When using the AUTPOPTR1 or AUTOPTR2 to address external memory, the address of AUTOPTR1 is only active while either RD#
or WR# is active. The address of AUTOPTR2 is active throughout the cycle and meets the address valid time for which is based on
the stretch value.
Notes
 21. The stretch memory cycle feature enables EZ-USB firmware to adjust the speed of data memory accesses not the program memory accesses. Details including typical
     strobe width timings can be found in the section 12.1.2 of the Technical Reference Manual. The address cycle width can be interpreted from these.
 22. tACC2 and tACC3 are computed from these parameters as follows:
     tACC2(24 MHz) = 3*tCL – tAV –tDSU = 106 ns
     tACC2(48 MHz) = 3*tCL – tAV – tDSU = 43 ns
     tACC3(24 MHz) = 5*tCL – tAV –tDSU = 190 ns
     tACC3(48 MHz) = 5*tCL – tAV – tDSU = 86 ns

When using the AUTPOPTR1 or AUTOPTR2 to address external memory, the address of AUTOPTR1 is only active while either RD#
or WR# are active. The address of AUTOPTR2 is active throughout the cycle and meets the address valid time for which is based on
the stretch value.
Note
  23. The stretch memory cycle feature enables EZ-USB firmware to adjust the speed of data memory accesses not the program memory accesses. Details including
      typical strobe width timings can be found in the section 12.1.2 of the Technical Reference Manual. The address cycle width can be interpreted from these.

 [1.]. Empty Flag Assertion                   X                       B         No silicon fix planned currently. Use the workaround.
 1. Empty Flag Assertion
■  Problem Definition
    In Slave FIFO Asynchronous Word Wide mode, if a single word data is transferred from the USB host to EP2, configured as OUT
    Endpoint (EP) in the first transaction, then the Empty flag behaves incorrectly. This does not happen if the data size is more than
    one word in the first transaction.
■  Parameters Affected
    NA
■  Trigger Condition(S)
    In Slave FIFO Asynchronous Word Wide Mode, after firmware boot and initialization, EP2 OUT endpoint empty flag indicates the
    status as ‘Empty’. When data is received in EP2, the status changes to ‘Not-Empty’. However, if data transferred to EP2 is a single
    word, then asserting SLRD with FIFOADR pointing to any other endpoint changes ‘Not-Empty’ status to ‘Empty’ for EP2 even
    though there is a word data (or it is untouched). This is noticed only when the single word is sent as the first transaction and not if
    it follows a multi-word packet as the first transaction.
■  Scope of Impact
    External interface does not see data available in EP2 OUT endpoint and can end up waiting for data to be read.
■  Workaround
    One of the following workarounds can be used:
      • Send a pulse signal to the SLWR pin, with FIFOADR pins pointing to an endpoint other than EP2, after firmware initialization
        and before or after transferring the data to EP2 from the host
      • Set the length of the first data to EP2 to be more than a word
      • Prioritize EP2 read from the Master for multiple OUT EPs and single word write to EP2
      • Write to an IN EP, if any, from the Master before reading from other OUT EPs (other than EP2) from the Master.
