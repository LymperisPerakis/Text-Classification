 It is our intention to provide our valued customers with the best documentation possible to ensure successful use of your Microchip
 products. To this end, we will continue to improve our publications to better suit your needs. Our publications will be refined and
 enhanced as new volumes and updates are introduced.
 If you have any questions or comments regarding this publication, please contact the Marketing Communications Department via
 E-mail at docerrors@microchip.com. We welcome your feedback.
 Most Current Documentation
 To obtain the most up-to-date version of this documentation, please register at our Worldwide Web site at:
        http://www.microchip.com
 You can determine the version of a data sheet by examining its literature number found on the bottom outside corner of any page.
 The last character of the literature number is the version number, (e.g., DS30000000A is version A of document DS30000000).
 Errata
 An errata sheet, describing minor operational differences from the data sheet and recommended workarounds, may exist for cur-
 rent devices. As device/documentation issues become known to us, we will publish an errata sheet. The errata will specify the
 revision of silicon and revision of document to which it applies.
 To determine if an errata sheet exists for a particular device, please check with one of the following:
 • Microchip’s Worldwide Web site; http://www.microchip.com
 • Your local Microchip sales office (see last page)
 When contacting a sales office, please specify which device, revision of silicon and data sheet (include -literature number) you are
 using.

1.0        INTRODUCTION
1.1        General Description
The UPD1001 is a programmable USB Power Delivery (PD) controller designed to adhere to the USB Power Delivery
Specification. USB Power Delivery allows a host (or device) to provide or consume up to 5 Amps and/or up to 20 Volts
of power from a USB PD capable partner device on the other end of the USB cable. USB PD capable standard and
custom cables/connectors are supported, which in most cases are backward compatible with standard USB connec-
tions.
The UPD1001 provides a complete USB Power Delivery solution for all charger and adapter solutions. The functionality
of the UPD1001 is selected via two configuration selection pins, CFG_SEL0 and CFG_SEL1, which can be used to
select unique PD and system configurations. Designing the UPD1001 into a system can be as simple as selecting a
configuration, with no external EEPROM required. Advanced programmability options exist with an external EEPROM
installed.
The integrated USB Power Delivery MAC and PHY support provider and consumer operation via the PD communication
protocol, as specified in Revision 1.0 (Version 1.2) of the USB Power Delivery Specification. Monitoring of VBUS and
battery charging is accomplished via the integrated voltage and current ADC inputs. The PHY supports cable ID detec-
tion/identification and loopback modes. The PHY includes a 24MHz FSK modulator/demodulator and provides inte-
grated terminations. The USB PD MAC supports both USB PD insertion detection (cold socket) and dead battery cases.
The on-chip microcontroller manages the IOs and implements the power delivery local policy engine and device man-
ager. The SPI ROM controller is used by the microcontroller for optional external code execution from ROM. A One Time
Programmable (OTP) ROM is integrated in the UPD1001. Integrated 3.3 V and 1.8 V regulators allow device operation
from a single power supply. The UPD1001 is available in commercial (0°C to +70°C), industrial (-40°C to +85°C), and
automotive (-40°C to +105°C) temperature ranges. An internal block diagram of the UPD1001 is shown in Figure 1-1.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •      Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •      Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
           intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •      There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
           knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
           Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •      Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •      Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
           mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
