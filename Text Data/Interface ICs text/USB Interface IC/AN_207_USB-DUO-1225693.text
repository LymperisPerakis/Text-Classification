1 Introduction
FTDI is well known for developing silicon and drivers that allow engineers to convert a peripheral
device serial port to USB. The silicon available from FTDI typically interfaces at levels between 1V8
and 5V0, whereas designs for cables and external modules often require RS232, RS422 or RS485
voltage levels. To enable customers to benefit from an easy to implement design FTDI has created
an USB to RS232 kit called the USB Duo, which contains an FT231XS (USB to UART chip) and a
FT3243S (line driver integrated circuit).
1.1 Overview
A UART is an industry standard universal asynchronous receiver, transmitter interface for serial
data. The protocol is fixed within a set of basic parameters e.g. a start bit, a number of data bits
(7, 8, or 9), parity bit (optional) and 1, 1.5, or 2 stop bits. The voltage levels and whether these
signals are delivered on a single ended wire or a differential pair of wires does not affect the
protocol but does affect how a system is wired.
RS232 is a recognized industry standard interface for serial communication. It is a single ended
interface, with separate receive and transmit data lines which operate between +/-5V to +/-15V.
As the FT231XS provides a +3V3 IO interface, any design requiring RS232 interface voltage levels
requires an additional IC referred in order to establish the correct voltage signaling level. This
additional IC is commonly referred to as an RS232 transceiver (or line driver). Therefore, with
the USB-DUO a two chip solution is provided; the FT231XS, which bridges USB to UART +3V3
signals, and a FT3243S transceiver, to convert the 3V3 level UART signals to RS232 voltage levels.
For more information on UARTs refer to TN_111_What Is UART?
For datasheets on the IC’s in the kit see the Document References section of this application note.

The FT231XS provides the USB to UART conversion while the FT3243S provides the digital to
RS232 voltage level conversion.
Minimal additional components are required to complete the design. Primarily interface connectors
and decoupling capacitors for the IC supplies.
In addition to the basic hardware on the PCB, the FT231XS device contains an internal EEPROM to
allow for customising the device descriptors to match an OEMs preferred description.
The maximum speed of the USB to RS232 link with these devices is 250kbaud.
