Datasheet
Chapter 1 General Description
                SMSC’s USB333x is a family of High Speed USB 2.0 Transceivers that provides a physical layer (PHY)
                solution well-suited for portable electronic devices. Both commercial and industrial temperature
                applications are supported.
                Each model in the USB333x family may use a 60MHz reference clock or the model-number specific
                reference clock shown in Order Numbers: on page 2. The USB3330 and USB3333 can support several
                different frequencies driven on the REFCLK pin. The configuration of the frequency selection pins set
                the desired reference frequency.
                Several advanced features make the USB333x the transceiver of choice by reducing both eBOM part
                count and printed circuit board (PCB) area. Outstanding ESD robustness eliminates the need for
                external ESD protection devices in typical applications. The internal Over-Voltage Protection circuit
                (OVP) protects the USB333x from voltages up to 30V on the VBUS pin. By using a reference clock
                from the Link, the USB333x removes the cost of a dedicated crystal reference from the design. The
                USB333x includes integrated 3.3V and 1.8V regulators, making it possible to operate the device from
                a single power supply.
                The USB333x is optimized for use in portable applications where a low operating current and standby
                current is essential. The USB333x also supports the Link Power Management protocol (LPM) to further
                reduce USB operating currents.
                The USB333x also includes integrated battery charger detection circuitry. These circuits are used to
                detect the attachment of a USB Charger as described in Section 5.8. By sensing the attachment to a
                USB Charger, a product using the USB333x can draw more than 500mA from the USB connector.
                The USB333x meets all of the electrical requirements for a High Speed USB Host, Device, or an On-
                the-Go (OTG) transceiver. In addition to the supporting USB signaling, the USB333x also provides
                USB UART mode and, in versions with the integrated USB switch, USB Audio mode.
                USB333x uses the industry standard UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) to connect the USB PHY to the
                Link. ULPI uses a method of in-band signaling and status byte transfers between the Link and PHY to
                facilitate a USB session with only twelve pins.
                The USB333x uses SMSC’s “wrapper-less” technology to implement the ULPI interface. This “wrapper-
                less” technology allows the PHY to achieve a low latency transmit and receive time. SMSC’s low
                latency transceiver allows an existing UTMI Link to be reused by adding a UTMI to ULPI bridge. By
                adding a bridge to the ASIC the existing and proven UTMI Link IP can be reused.
                Versions of the USB333x with the integrated USB switch enable a single USB port of connection.

                In USB Audio mode, a switch connects the DP pin to the SPK_R pin, and another switch connects he
                DM pin to the SPK_L pin. These switches are shown in the lower left-hand corner of Figure 5.1.The
                USB333x can be configured to enter USB Audio mode as described in Section 6.7.2. In addition, these
                switches are on when the RESETB pin of the USB333x is asserted. The USB Audio mode enables
                audio signaling from a single USB port of connection, and the switches may also be used to connect
                Full Speed USB from another transceiver to the USB connector.

                                              Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
                                                                                                             Datasheet
            The USB333x includes an integrated 3.3V LDO regulator that is used to generate 3.3V from power
            applied to the VBAT pin. The voltage on the VBAT pin can range from 3.0 to 5.5V. The regulator
            dropout voltage is less than 100mV which allows the PHY to continue USB signaling when the voltage
            on VBAT drops to 3.0V. The USB transceiver will continue to operate at lower voltages, although some
            parameters may be outside the limits of the USB-IF specification for Full Speed USB operation. The
            VBAT and VDD33 pins should never be connected together.
            In USB UART mode, the USB333x DP and DM pins are redefined to enable pass-through of
            asynchronous serial data. The USB333x will enter UART mode when programmed, as described in
            Section 6.7.1.

5.2.1        USB Transceiver
             The USB333x transceiver includes a Universal Serial Bus Specification Rev 2.0 compliant receiver and
             transmitter. The DP/DM signals in the USB cable connect directly to the receivers and transmitters.
             The receiver consists of receivers for HS and FS/LS mode. Depending on the mode, the selected
             receiver provides the serial data stream through the multiplexer to the RX Logic block. For HS mode
             support, the HS RX block contains a squelch circuit to insure that noise is not interpreted as data. The
             RX block also includes a single-ended receiver on each of the data lines to determine the correct FS
             linestate.
             Data from the Link is encoded, bit stuffed, serialized and transmitted onto the USB cable by the
             transmitter. Separate differential FS/LS and HS transmitters are included to support all modes.
             The USB333x TX block meets the HS signalling level requirements in the USB 2.0 Specification when
             the PCB traces from the DP and DM pins to the USB connector are correctly designed. In some
SMSC USB333x                                                         33                                                          Revision 1.3 (11-20-12)

               systems the proper 90 ohm differential impedance can not be maintained and it may be desirable to
               compensate for loss by adjusting the HS transmitter amplitude and this HS squelch threshold. The
               PHYBoost bits in the HS Compensation Register may be configured to adjust the HS transmitter
               amplitude at the DP and DM pins. The VariSense bits in the HS Compensation Register can also be
               used to lower the squelch threshold to compensate for losses on the PCB.
               To ensure proper operation of the USB transceiver the settings of Table 5.1 must be followed.
5.2.2          Termination Resistors
               The USB333x transceiver fully integrates all of the USB termination resistors on both DP and DM. This
               includes 1.5kΩ pull-up resistors, 15kΩ pull-down resistors and the 45Ω High Speed termination
               resistors. These resistors require no tuning or trimming by the Link. The state of the resistors is
               determined by the operating mode of the transceiver when operating in synchronous mode.
               The XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect and OpMode[1:0] bits in the Function Control register, and the
               DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register control the configuration of the
               termination resistors. All possible valid resistor combinations are shown in Table 5.1, and operation is
               guaranteed in only the configurations shown. If a ULPI Register Setting is configured that does not
               match a setting in the table, the transceiver operation is not guaranteed and the settings in the last
               row of Table 5.1 will be used.

Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
Datasheet
                The USB333x uses the 27% resistor ECN resistor tolerances. The resistor values are shown in
                Table 4.6.
 5.3            Bias Generator
                This block consists of an internal bandgap reference circuit used for generating the driver current and
                the biasing of the analog circuits. This block requires an external 8.06KΩ, 1% tolerance, reference
                resistor connected from RBIAS to ground. This resistor should be placed as close as possible to the
                USB333x to minimize the trace length. The nominal voltage at RBIAS is 0.8V +/- 10% and therefore
                the resistor will dissipate approximately 80μW of power.
 5.4            Integrated Low Jitter PLL
                The USB333x uses an integrated low jitter phase locked loop (PLL) to provide a clean 480MHz clock
                required for HS USB signal quality. This clock is used by the PHY during both transmit and receive.
                The USB333x PLL requires an accurate frequency reference to be driven on the REFCLK pin.
 5.4.1          REFCLK Frequency Selection
                The USB333x PLL is designed to operate in one of two reference clock modes. In the first mode, the
                60MHz ULPI clock is driven on the REFCLK pin. In the second mode a reference clock is driven on
                the REFCLK pin. The Link is driving the ULPI clock, in the first mode, and this is referred to as ULPI
                Clock In Mode. In the second mode, the USB333x generates the ULPI clock, and this is referred to
                as ULPI Clock Out Mode.
                During start-up, the USB333x monitors the CLKOUT pin. If a connection to VDD18 (USB3330,
                USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338) or VDDIO (USB3333) is detected, the USB333x is configured for
                a 60MHz ULPI reference clock driven on the REFCLK pin. Section 5.4.1.2 and Section 5.4.1.1
                describe how to configure the USB333x for either ULPI Clock In Mode or ULPI Clock Out Mode.
                For the USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338, the reference clock frequency required is shown in Order
                Numbers: on page 2.
                For the USB3330 and USB3333, the reference clock frequency required is determined by the settings
                of the REF pins(s). The pins should either be connected to VDD33 or GND. The reference frequency
                selection options are shown in Table 5.2 and Table 5.3.

5.4.1.1    ULPI Clock Output Mode
           When using ULPI Clock Output Mode, the USB333x generates the 60MHz ULPI clock used by the
           Link. In this mode, the REFCLK pin must be driven with the model-specific frequency, and the
           CLKOUT pin sources the 60MHz ULPI clock to the Link. When using ULPI Clock Output Mode, the
           system must not drive the CLKOUT pin following POR or hardware reset with a voltage that exceeds
           the value of VIH_ED provided in Table 4.4. An example of ULPI Clock Out Mode is shown in Figure 8.1
           After the PLL has locked to the correct frequency, the USB333x generates the 60MHz ULPI clock on
           the CLKOUT pin, and de-asserts DIR to indicate that the PLL is locked. The USB333x is guaranteed
           to start the clock within the time specified in Table 4.3, and it will be accurate to within ±500ppm. For
           Host applications the ULPI AutoResume bit should be enabled. This is described in Section 6.4.1.4.
           When using ULPI Clock Output Mode, the edges of the reference clock do not need to be aligned in
           any way to the ULPI interface signals. There is no need to align the phase of the REFCLK and the
           CLKOUT.
                                                                       ~~

5.4.1.2    ULPI Clock Input Mode (60MHz REFCLK Mode)
           When using ULPI Clock Input Mode, the Link must supply the 60MHz ULPI clock to the USB333x. In
           this mode the 60MHz ULPI Clock is connected to the REFCLK pin, and the CLKOUT pin is tied high
           to VDD18 (USB3330, USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338) or VDDIO (USB3333). An example of ULPI
           Clock In Mode is shown in Figure 8.2.
            After the PLL has locked to the correct frequency, the USB333x will de-assert DIR and the Link can
           begin using the ULPI interface. The USB333x is guaranteed to start the clock within the time specified
           in Table 4.3. For Host applications, the ULPI AutoResume bit should be enabled. This is described in
           Section 6.4.1.4.

5.4.2           REFCLK Amplitude
                The reference clock should be connected to the REFCLK pin as shown in the application diagrams,
                Figure 8.1 and Figure 8.2. The REFCLK pin is designed to be driven with a square wave from 0V to
                VDD18, but can be driven with a square wave from 0V to as high as 3.6V. The USB333x uses only the
                positive edge of the REFCLK.
                If a digital reference is not available, the REFCLK pin can be driven by an analog sine wave that is
                AC coupled into the REFCLK pin. If using an analog clock the DC bias should be set at the mid-point
                of the VDDIO supply or the VDD18 regulator output. Use a bias circuit as shown in Figure 5.8. The
                amplitude must be greater than 300mV peak to peak. The component values provided in Figure 5.8
                are for example only. The actual values should be selected to satisfy system requirements.
                The REFCLK amplitude must comply with the signal amplitudes shown in Table 4.5 and the duty cycle
                in Table 4.3.

                                                 Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
                                                                                                                Datasheet
5.4.3       REFCLK Jitter
            The USB333x is tolerant to jitter on the reference clock. The REFCLK jitter should be limited to a peak
            to peak jitter of less than 1nS over a 10uS time interval. If this level of jitter is exceeded when
            configured for either ULPI Clock Input Mode or ULPI Clock Output Mode, the USB333x High Speed
            eye diagram may be degraded.
            The frequency accuracy of the REFCLK must meet the +/- 500ppm requirement as shown in Table 4.3.
5.4.4       REFCLK Enable/Disable
            The REFCLK should be enabled when the RESETB pin is brought high. The ULPI interface will start
            running after the time specified in Table 4.3. If the reference clock enable is delayed relative to the
            RESETB pin, the ULPI interface will start operation delayed by the same amount. The reference clock
            can be run at anytime the RESETB pin is low without causing the USB333x to start-up or draw current.
            When the USB333x is placed in Low Power Mode or Carkit Mode, the reference clock can be stopped
            after the final ULPI register write is complete. The STP pin is asserted to bring the USB333x out of
            Low Power Mode. The reference clock should be started at the same time STP is asserted to minimize
            the USB333x start-up time.
            If the reference clock is stopped while in ULPI Synchronous mode the PLL will come out of lock and
            the frequency of oscillation will decrease to the minimum allowed by the PLL design. If the reference
            clock is stopped during a USB session, the session may drop.
5.5         Internal Regulators and POR
            The USB333x includes integrated power management functions, including a Low-Dropout regulator
            that can be used to generate the 3.3V USB supply, an integrated 1.8V regulator, and a POR generator
            described in Section 5.5.2.
5.5.1       Integrated Low Dropout Regulators
            The USB333x includes two integrated linear regulators. Power sourced at the VBAT pin is regulated
            to 3.3V and 1.8V output on the VDD33 and VDD18 pins. To ensure stability, both regulators require
            an external bypass capacitor as specified in Table 4.12 placed as close to the pins as possible. VBAT
            and VDD33 should never be shorted together.
            The USB333x regulators are designed to generate the 3.3 Volt and 1.8 Volt supplies for the USB333x
            only. Using the regulators to provide current for other circuits is not recommended and SMSC does
            not guarantee USB performance or regulator stability.
            During USB UART mode the 3.3V regulator output voltage can be changed to allow the USB333x to
            work with UARTs operating at different operating voltages. The 3.3V regulator output is configured to
            the voltages shown in Table 4.12 with the UART RegOutput[1:0] bits in the USB IO & Power
            Management register.
            The regulators are enabled by the RESETB pin. When RESETB pin is low both regulators are disabled
            and the regulator outputs are pulled low by weak pull-down. The RESETB pin must be brought high
            to enable the regulators.
            For peripheral-only or host-only bus-powered applications, the VBAT supply shown below in Figure 5.9
            may be connected to the VBUS pin of the USB connector for bus powered applications. In this
            configuration, external overvoltage protection is required to protect the VBAT supply from any transient
            voltage present at the VBUS pin of the USB connector. Additionally, the VBAT input must never be
            exposed to a voltage that exceeds VVBAT. (See Table 3.2.)

               Also in this configuration, the VBUS line must never be connected to a system utilizing a +30V VBUS
               level (i.e. Some USB battery chargers). SMSC does not recommend connecting the VBAT pin directly
               to the VBUS terminal of the USB connector.

5.5.2          Power On Reset (POR)
               The USB333x provides a POR circuit that generates an internal reset pulse after the VDD18 supply is
               stable. After the internal POR goes high the USB333x will release from reset and begin normal ULPI
               operation as described in Section 5.10.
               The ULPI registers will power up in their default state summarized in Table 7.1 when the 1.8V supply
               comes up. Cycling the RESETB pin can also be used to reset the ULPI registers to their default state
               (and reset all internal state machines) by bringing the pin low for a minimum of 1 microsecond and
               then high. It is not necessary to wait for the VDD33 and VDD18 pins to discharge to 0 volts to reset
               the part.
               The RESETB pin must be pulled high to enable the 3.3V and 1.8V regulators. A pull-down resistor is
               not present on the RESETB pin and therefore the system should drive the RESETB pin to the desired
               state at all times. If the system does not need to place the USB333x into reset mode the RESETB pin
               should be connected to VDD18 (USB3330, USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338) or VDDIO (USB3333).
5.5.3          Recommended Power Supply Sequence
               For USB operation, the USB333x requires a valid voltage on the VBAT and VDDIO pins. The VDD33
               and VDD18 regulators are automatically enabled when the RESETB pin is brought high. For the
               USB3333, Table 5.4 presents the power supply configurations in more detail.

            The RESETB pin can be held low until the VBAT supply is stable. If the Link is not ready to interface
            the USB333x, the Link may choose to hold the RESETB pin low until it is ready to control the ULPI
            interface.

            Note 5.10 VDDIO must be present for ULPI pins to tri-state.
5.5.4       Start-Up
            The power on default state of the USB333x is ULPI Synchronous mode. The USB333x requires the
            following conditions to begin operation: the power supplies must be stable, the REFCLK must be
            present and the RESETB pin must be high. After these conditions are met, the USB333x will begin
            ULPI operation that is described in Chapter 6.
            Figure 5.11 below shows a timing diagram to illustrate the start-up of the USB333x. At T0, the supplies
            are stable and the USB333x is held in reset mode. At T1, the Link drives RESETB high after the
            REFCLK has started. The RESETB pin may be brought high asynchronously to REFCLK. Once, the
            3.3V and 1.8V internal supplies become stable the USB333x will apply the 15Kohm pull downs to the
            data bus and assert DIR until the internal PLL has locked. After the PLL has locked, the USB333x will
            check that the Link has de-asserted STP and at T2 it will de-assert DIR and begin ULPI operation.
            The ULPI bus will be available as shown in Figure 5.11 in the time defined as TSTART given in
            Table 4.3. If the REFCLK signal starts after the RESETB pin is brought high, then time T0 will begin
            when REFCLK starts. TSTART also assumes that the Link has de-asserted STP. If the Link has held
            STP high the USB333x will hold DIR high until STP is de-asserted. When the LINK de-asserts STP, it
            must be ready drive the ULPI data bus to idle (00h) for a minimum of one clock cycle after DIR de-
            asserts.

 5.6            USB On-The-Go (OTG)
                The USB333x provides support for the USB OTG protocol. OTG allows the USB333x to be dynamically
                configured as a host or peripheral depending on the type of cable inserted into the Micro-AB
                receptacle. When the Micro-A plug of a cable is inserted into the Micro-AB receptacle, the USB device
                becomes the A-device. When a Micro-B plug is inserted, the device becomes the B-device. The OTG
                A-device behaves similar to a Host while the B-device behaves similar to a peripheral. The differences
                are covered in the “On-The-Go Supplement to the USB 2.0 Specification”. In applications where only
                USB Host or USB Peripheral is required, the OTG Module is unused.
 5.6.1          ID Resistor Detection
                The ID pin of the USB connector is monitored by the ID pin of the USB333x to detect the attachment
                of different types of USB devices and cables. For device only applications that do not use the ID signal
                the ID pin should be connected to VDD33. The block diagram of the ID detection circuitry is shown in
                Figure 5.12 and the related parameters are given in Table 4.9.

5.6.1.1    USB OTG Operation
           The USB333x can detect ID grounded and ID floating to determine if an A or B cable has been
           inserted. The A plug will ground the ID pin while the B plug will float the ID pin. These are the only
           two valid states allowed in the OTG Protocol.
           To monitor the status of the ID pin, the Link activates the IdPullup bit in the OTG Control register, waits
           50mS and then reads the status of the IdGnd bit in the USB Interrupt Status register. If an A cable has
           been inserted the IdGnd bit will read 0. If a B cable is inserted, the ID pin is floating and the IdGnd bit
           will read 1.
           The USB333x provides an integrated weak pull-up resistor on the ID pin, RIDW. This resistor is present
           to keep the ID pin in a known state when the IdPullup bit is disabled and the ID pin is floated. In
           addition to keeping the ID pin in a known state, it enables the USB333x to generate an interrupt to
           inform the link when a cable with a resistor to ground has been attached to the ID pin. The weak pull-
           up is small enough that the largest valid RID resistor pulls the ID pin low and causes the IdGnd
           comparator to go low.
           After the link has detected an ID pin state change, the RID converter can be used to determine the
           resistor value as described in Section 5.6.1.2.
5.6.1.2    Measuring ID Resistance to Ground
           The Link can use the integrated resistance measurement capabilities of the USB333x to determine the
           value of an ID resistance to ground. Table 5.5 details the values of resistance to ground that the
           USB333x can detect.

                Note: IdPullUp = 0
                The ID resistance to ground can be read while the USB333x is in Synchronous Mode. When a resistor
                to ground is attached to the ID pin, the state of the IdGnd comparator will change. After the Link has
                detected ID transition to ground, it can use the methods described in Section 6.8 to operate the Rid
                converter.
 5.6.1.3        Using IdFloat Comparator (not recommended)
                Note: The ULPI specification details a method to detect a 102kΩ resistance to ground using the
                         IdFloat comparator. This method can only detect 0ohms, 102kΩ, and floating terminations of
                         the ID pin. Due to this limitation it is recommended to use the RID Converter as described in
                         Section 5.6.1.2.
                The ID pin can be either grounded, floated, or connected to ground with a 102kΩ external resistor. To

                the 100K internal pull-up connected between the ID pin and VDD33. Set the idFloatRise and idFloatFall
                bits in the Carkit Interrupt Enable register to enable the IdFloat comparator to generate an RXCMD to
                the Link when the state of the IdFloat changes. As described in Figure 6.3, the alt_int bit of the RXCMD
                will be set. The values of IdGnd and IdFloat are shown for the three types cables that can attach to
                the USB Connector in Table 5.6.

                Note: The ULPI register bits IdPullUp, IdFloatRise, and IdFloatFall should be enabled.
                To save current when an A Plug is inserted, the internal 102kΩ pull-up resistor can be disabled by
                clearing the IdPullUp bit in the OTG Control register and the IdFloatRise and IdFloatFall bits in both
                the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. If the cable is removed
                the weak RIDW will pull the ID pin high.
                The IdGnd value can be read using the ULPI USB Interrupt Status register, bit 4. In host mode, it can
                be set to generate an interrupt when IdGnd changes by setting the appropriate bits in the USB Interrupt
                Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. The IdFloat value can be read by reading
                the ULPI Carkit Interrupt Status register bit 0.

5.6.2      VBUS Monitoring and VBUS Pulsing
           The USB333x includes all of the VBUS comparators required for OTG. The VbusValid, SessVld, and
           SessEnd comparators shown in Figure 5.13 are fully integrated into the USB333x. These comparators
           are used to monitor changes in the VBUS voltage, and the state of each comparator can be read from
           the USB Interrupt Status register.
           The VbusValid comparator is used by the Link, when configured as an A device, to ensure that the
           VBUS voltage on the cable is valid. The SessVld comparator is used by the Link when configured as
           both an A or B device to indicate a session is requested or valid. Finally the SessEnd comparator is
           used by the B-device to indicate a USB session has ended.
           Also included in the VBUS Monitor and Pulsing block are the resistors used for VBUS pulsing in SRP.
           The resistors used for VBUS pulsing include a pull-down to ground and a pull-up to VDD33.
           In some applications, voltages much greater than 5.5V may be present at the VBUS pin of the USB
           connector. The USB333x includes an over voltage protection circuit that protects the VBUS pin of the
           USB333x from excessive voltages as shown in Figure 5.13.

5.6.2.1    SessEnd Comparator
           The SessEnd comparator is used during the Session Request Protocol (SRP). The comparator is used
           by the B-device to detect when a USB session has ended and it is safe to start Vbus Pulsing to request
           a USB session from the A-device. When VBUS goes below the threshold in Table 4.8, the USB session
           is considered to be ended, and SessEnd will transition from 0 to 1. The SessEnd comparator can be

                disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling
                registers. When disabled, the SessEnd bit in the USB Interrupt Status register will read 0.
                The SessEnd Comparator is only used when configured as an OTG device. If the USB333x is used
                as a Host or Device only the SessEnd Comparator should be disabled, using the method described
                above.
 5.6.2.2        SessVld Comparator
                The SessVld comparator is used when the PHY is configured as both an A and B device. When
                configured as an A device, the SessVld is used to detect Session Request protocol (SRP). When
                configured as a B device, SessVld is used to detect the presence of VBUS. The SessVld comparator
                output can also be read from the USB Interrupt Status register. The SessVld comparator will also
                generate an RX CMD, as detailed in Section 6.3.1, anytime the comparator changes state. The
                SessVld interrupts can be disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and
                USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. When the interrupts are disabled, the SessVld comparator is
                still operational and will generate RX CMD’s. The SessVld comparator trip point is detailed in Table 4.9.
                Note: The OTG Supplement specifies a voltage range for A-Device Session Valid and B-Device
                         Session Valid comparator. The USB333x PHY combines the two comparators into one and
                         uses the narrower threshold range.
 5.6.2.3        VbusValid Comparator
                The VbusValid comparator is only used when the USB333x is configured as a host that can supply
                less than 100mA VBUS current. In the USB protocol, the A-device supplies the VBUS voltage and is
                responsible to ensure it remains within a specified voltage range. The VbusValid comparator can be
                disabled by clearing this bit in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising and USB Interrupt Enable Falling
                registers. When disabled, bit 1 of the USB Interrupt Status register will return a 0. The VbusValid
                comparator threshold values are detailed in Table 4.9.
                If the USB333x is used as a Device only the VbusValid Comparator should be disabled, using the
                method described above.
                The USB333x includes the external VbusValid indicator logic as detailed in the ULPI Specification. The
                external VbusValid indicator is tied to a logic one. The decoding of this logic is shown in Table 5.7
                below. By default this logic is disabled.

              Note 5.14 A peripheral should not use VbusValid to detect a USB connection and begin operation.
                           The peripheral should use SessValid to detect the presence of VBUS on the USB
                           connector. VbusValid should only be used for USB Host and OTG A-device applications.
5.6.2.4       VBUS Pulsing with Pull-up and Pull-down Resistors
              In addition to the internal VBUS comparators, the USB333x also includes the integrated VBUS pull-up
              and pull-down resistors used for VBUS Pulsing during OTG Session Request Protocol. To discharge
              the VBUS voltage so that a Session Request can begin, the USB333x provides a pull-down resistor
              from VBUS to GND. This resistor is controlled by the DischargeVbus bit 3 of the OTG Control register.
              The pull-up resistor is connected between VBUS and VDD33. This resistor is used to pull VBUS above
              2.1 volts so that the A-Device knows that a USB session has been requested. The state of the pull-
              up resistor is controlled by the bit 4 ChargeVbus of the OTG Control register. The Pull-Up and Pull-
              Down resistor values are detailed in Table 4.9.
              The internal VBUS Pull-up and Pull-down resistors are designed to include the RVBUS external resistor
              in series. This external resistor is used by the VBUS Over voltage protection described below.
5.6.2.5       VBUS Input Impedance
              The OTG Supplement requires an A-Device that supports Session Request Protocol to have a VBUS
              input impedance less than 100kΩ and greater the 40kΩ to ground. The USB333x provides a 75kΩ
              resistance to ground, RVB. The RVB resistor tolerance is detailed in Table 4.9.
5.6.2.6       VBUS Over Voltage Protection (OVP)
              The USB333x provides an integrated over voltage protection circuit to protect the VBUS pin from
              excessive voltages that may be present at the USB connector. The over voltage protection circuit works
              with an external resistor (RVBUS) by drawing current across the resistor to reduce the voltage at the
              VBUS pin.
              When voltage at the VBUS pin exceeds 5.5V, the Over voltage Protection block will sink current to
              ground until VBUS is below 5.5V. The current drops the excess voltage across RVBUS and protects the
              USB333x VBUS pin. The required RVBUS value is dependent on the operating mode of the USB333x
              as shown in Table 5.8.

                The Over voltage Protection circuit is designed to protect the USB333x from continuous voltages up
                to 30V on the RVBUS resistor.
                The RVBUS resistor must be sized to handle the power dissipated across the resistor. The resistor
                power can be found using the equation below:
                                                                                                  2
                                                            ( Vprotect – 5.0 )
                                              P RVBUS = --------------------------------------------
                                                                     R VBUS
                                     Where:
                                        Vprotect is the VBUS protection required.
                                        RVBUS is the resistor value, 1kΩ or 20kΩ.
                                        PRVBUS is the required power rating of RVBUS.
                For example, protecting a peripheral or device only application to 15V would require a 20kΩ RVBUS
                resistor with a power rating of 0.01W. To protect an OTG product to 15V would require a 1kΩ RVBUS
                resistor with a power rating of 0.1W.
 5.6.3          Driving External VBUS
                The USB333x monitors VBUS as described in VBUS Monitoring and VBUS Pulsing. The USB333x
                does not provide an external output for the DrvVbusExternal ULPI register. For OTG and Host
                applications, the external VBUS supply or power switch must be controlled by the Link as shown in
                Figure 8.2.
 5.7            USB UART Support
                The USB333x provides support for the USB UART interface as detailed in the ULPI specification and
                the former CEA-936A specification. The USB333x can be placed in UART Mode using the method
                described in Section 6.7, and the regulator output will automatically switch to the value configured by
                the UART RegOutput bits in the USB IO & Power Management register. While in UART mode, the
                Linestate signals cannot be monitored on the DATA[0] and DATA[1] pins.
 5.8            USB Charger Detection Support
                The following blocks allow the USB333x to detect when a Battery Charger, Charging Host Port, or a
                USB Host is attached to the USB connector. The USB333x can also be configured to appear as a
                Charging Host Port. The charger detection circuitry should be disabled during USB operation.

                    The charger detection circuitry runs from the VDD33 supply and requires that the VDD33 supply to be
                    present to run the charger detection circuitry. The VDD33 supply is present anytime the RESETB pin
                    is pulled high and VBAT is present. The charger detection circuits are fully functional while in Low
                    Power Mode (Suspendm = 0). The status of the VdatDet can be relayed back to the Link through the
                    ULPI interrupts in both Synchronous mode and Low Power Mode.
5.8.1               Active Analog Charger Detection
                    The USB333x includes the active analog charger detection specified in the USB-IF Battery Charging
                    Specification. The additional analog circuitry will allow the USB333x to:
                    1. Detect a USB Charger that has shorted DP and DM together
                    2. Detect a USB Host/Charger
                    3. Behave as a USB Host/Charger
                    The charger detection circuitry is shown in Figure 5.15.

5.8.2          Resistive Charger Detection
               Note: The Resistive Charger Detection has been superseded by the Active Analog Charger Detection
                     detailed above. It is recommended that new designs use the Active Analog Charger Detection.
               To support the detection and identification of different types of USB chargers the USB333x provides
               integrated pull-up resistors, RCD, on both DP and DM. These pull-up resistors along with the single
               ended receivers can be used to determine the type of USB charger attached. Reference information
               on implementing charger detection is provided in Section 8.2, "USB Charger Detection".

5.9             USB Audio Support (USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338)
               Note: The USB333x supports “USB Digital Audio” through the USB protocol in ULPI and USB Serial
                     modes described in Section 6.
               The USB333x provides two low resistance analog switches that allow analog audio to be multiplexed
               over the DP and DM terminals of the USB connector. The audio switches are shown in Figure 5.1. The
               electrical characteristics of the USB Audio Switches are provided in Table 4.11.

            During normal USB operation the switches are off. When USB Audio is desired the switches can be
            turned “on” by enabling the SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn bits in the Carkit Control register as
            described in Section 6.7.2. These bits are disabled by default.
            The RESETB pin must be high when using the analog switches so that the VDD33 supply is present.
            If the VDD33 supply is applied externally and RESETB is held low the switches will be off.
            In addition to USB Audio support the switches could also be used to multiplex a second Full Speed
            USB PHY to the USB connector. The signal quality will be degraded slightly due to the “on” resistance
            of the switches. The USB333x single-ended receivers described in Section 5.2.1 are enabled while in
            synchronous mode and are disabled when Carkit Mode is entered.
            The USB333x does not provide the DC bias for the audio signals. The SPK_R and SPK_L pins should
            be biased to 1.65V when audio signals are routed through the USB333x. This DC bias is necessary
            to prevent the audio signal from swinging below ground and being clipped by ESD Diodes.
            When the system is not using the USB Audio switches, the SPK_R and SPK_L switches should be
            disabled.

Chapter 6 ULPI Operation
6.1              ULPI Introduction
                 The USB333x uses the industry standard ULPI digital interface for communication between the
                 transceiver and Link (device controller). The ULPI interface is designed to reduce the number of pins
                 required to connect a discrete USB transceiver to an ASIC or digital controller. For example, a full
                 UTMI+ Level 3 OTG interface requires 54 signals while a ULPI interface requires only 12 signals.
                 The ULPI interface is documented completely in the “UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) Specification
                 Revision 1.1”. The following sections describe the operating modes of the USB333x digital interface.
                 Figure 6.1 illustrates the block diagram of the ULPI digital functions. It should be noted that this
                 USB333x does not use a “ULPI wrapper” around a UTMI+ PHY core as the ULPI specification implies.

                                                                            DATASHEET


                                                    Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
                                                                                                                   Datasheet
            The advantage of a “wrapper-less” architecture is that the USB333x has a lower USB latency than a
            design which must first register signals into the PHY’s wrapper before the transfer to the transceiver
            core. A low latency PHY allows a wrapper around a UTMI Link to be used and still make the required
            USB turn-around timing required by the USB 2.0 specification.
            RxEndDelay maximum allowed by the UTMI+/ULPI for 8-bit data is 63 High Speed clocks. USB333x
            uses a low latency High Speed receiver path to lower the RxEndDelay to 43 High Speed clocks. This
            low latency design gives the Link more cycles to make decisions and reduces the Link complexity. This
            is the result of the “wrapper less” architecture of the USB333x. This low RxEndDelay should allow
            legacy UTMI Links to use a “wrapper” to convert the UTMI+ interface to a ULPI interface.
            In Figure 6.1, a single ULPI Protocol Block decodes the ULPI 8-bit bi-directional bus when the Link
            addresses the PHY. The Link must use the DIR output to determine direction of the ULPI data bus.
            The USB333x is the “bus arbitrator”. The ULPI Protocol Block will route data/commands to the
            transmitter or the ULPI register array.
6.1.1       ULPI Interface Signals
            The UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI) uses a 12-pin interface to connect a USB Transceiver to an
            external Link. The reduction of external pins, relative to UTMI+, is accomplished implementing the
            relatively static configuration pins (i.e. xcvrselect[1:0], termselect, opmode[1:0], and DpPullDown
            DmPulldown) as an internal register array.
            An 8-bit bi-directional data bus clocked at 60MHz allows the Link to access this internal register array
            and transfer USB packets to and from the PHY. The remaining 3 pins function to control the data flow
            and arbitrate the data bus.
            Direction of the 8-bit data bus is controlled by the DIR output from the PHY. Another output, NXT, is
            used to control data flow into and out of the device. Finally, STP, which is in input to the PHY,
            terminates transfers and is used to start up and resume from Low Power Mode.
            The ULPI Interface signals are described below in Table 6.1.

 CLK           I/O              60MHz ULPI clock. All ULPI signals are driven synchronous to the rising edge of
                                this clock. This clock can be either driven by the PHY or the Link as described in
                                Section 5.4.1
 DATA[7:0]     I/O              8-bit bi-directional data bus. Bus ownership is determined by DIR. The Link and
                                PHY initiate data transfers by driving a non-zero pattern onto the data bus. ULPI
                                defines interface timing for a single-edge data transfers with respect to rising edge
                                of the ULPI clock.
 DIR           OUT              Controls the direction of the data bus. When the PHY has data to transfer to the
                                Link, it drives DIR high to take ownership of the bus. When the PHY has no data
                                to transfer it drives DIR low and monitors the bus for commands from the Link. The
                                PHY will pull DIR high whenever the interface cannot accept data from the Link,
                                such as during PLL start-up.
 STP           IN               The Link asserts STP for one clock cycle to stop the data stream currently on the
                                bus. If the Link is sending data to the PHY, STP indicates the last byte of data was
                                on the bus in the previous cycle.
 NXT           OUT              The PHY asserts NXT to throttle the data. When the Link is sending data to the
                                PHY, NXT indicates when the current byte has been accepted by the PHY. The
                                Link places the next byte on the data bus in the following clock cycle.

                data bus is determined by the state of DIR. When DIR is high, the PHY is driving DATA[7:0]. When
                DIR is low, the Link is driving DATA[7:0].
                Each time DIR changes, a “turn-around” cycle occurs where neither the Link nor PHY drive the data
                bus for one clock cycle. During the “turn-around“cycle, the state of DATA[7:0] is unknown and the PHY
                will not read the data bus.
                Because USB uses a bit-stuffing encoding, some means of allowing the PHY to throttle the USB
                transmit data is needed. The ULPI signal NXT is used to request the next byte to be placed on the
                data bus by the Link.
                The ULPI interface supports the two basic modes of operation: Synchronous Mode and Asynchronous
                Mode. Asynchronous Mode includes Low Power Mode, the Serial Modes, and Carkit Mode. In
                Synchronous Mode, all signals change synchronously with the 60MHz ULPI clock. In asynchronous
                modes the clock is off and the ULPI bus is redefined to bring out the signals required for that particular
                mode of operations. The description of synchronous Mode is described in the following sections while
                the descriptions of the asynchronous modes are described in Section 6.5, Section 6.6, and Section 6.7.
 6.1.2           ULPI Interface Timing in Synchronous Mode
                The control and data timing relationships are given in Figure 6.2 and Table 4.4. All timing is relative to
                the rising clock edge of the 60MHz ULPI Clock.

                The following section details the steps required to access registers through the ULPI interface. At any
                time DIR is low the Link may access the ULPI registers set using the Transmit Command byte. The
                ULPI registers retain their contents when the PHY is in Low Power Mode, Full Speed/Low Speed Serial
                Mode, or Carkit Mode.

6.2.1        Transmit Command Byte (TX CMD)
             A command from the Link begins a ULPI transfer from the Link to the USB333x. Before reading a ULPI
             register, the Link must wait until DIR is low, and then send a Transmit Command Byte (TX CMD) byte.
             The TX CMD byte informs the USB333x of the type of data being sent. The TX CMD is followed by a
             data transfer to or from the USB333x. Table 6.2 gives the TX command byte (TX CMD) encoding for
             the USB333x. The upper two bits of the TX CMD instruct the PHY as to what type of packet the Link
             is transmitting.

                To write a register, the Link will wait until DIR is low, and at T0, drive the TX CMD on the data bus. At
                T2 the PHY will drive NXT high. On the next rising clock edge, T3, the Link will write the register data.
                At T4, the PHY will accept the register data and drive NXT low. The Link will drive an Idle on the bus
                and drive STP high to signal the end of the data packet. Finally, at T5, the PHY will latch the data into
                the register and the Link will pull STP low.
                NXT is used to throttle when the Link drives the register data on the bus. DIR is low throughout this
                transaction since the PHY is receiving data from the Link. STP is used to end the transaction and data
                is registered after the de-assertion of STP. After the write operation completes, the Link must drive a
                ULPI Idle (00h) on the data bus. If the databus is not driven to idle the USB333x may decode the non-
                zero bus value as an RX Command.
                A ULPI extended register write operation is shown in Figure 6.4. To write an extended register, the Link
                will wait until DIR is low, and at T0, drive the TX CMD on the data bus. At T2 the PHY will drive NXT
                high. On the next clock T3 the Link will drive the extended address. On the next rising clock edge, T4,
                the Link will write the register data. At T5, the PHY will accept the register data and drive NXT low.
                The Link will drive an Idle on the bus and drive STP high to signal the end of the data packet. At T5,
                the PHY will latch the data into the register. Finally, at T6, the Link will drive STP low.

                At T0, the Link will place the TX CMD on the data bus. At T2, the PHY will bring NXT high, signaling
                the Link it is ready to accept the data transfer. At T3, the PHY reads the TX CMD, determines it is a
                register read, and asserts DIR to gain control of the bus. The PHY will also de-assert NXT. At T4, the
                bus ownership has transferred back to the PHY and the PHY drives the requested register onto the
                data bus. At T5, the Link will read the data bus and the PHY will drop DIR low returning control of the
                bus back to the Link. After the turn around cycle, the Link must drive a ULPI Idle command at T6.
                A ULPI extended register read operation is shown in Figure 6.6.To read an extended register, the Link
                writes the TX CMD with the address set to 2Fh. At T2, the PHY will assert NXT, signaling the Link it
                is ready to accept the extended address. At T3, the Link places the extended register address on the
                bus. At T4, the PHY reads the extended address, and asserts DIR to gain control of the bus. The PHY
                will also de-assert NXT. At T5, the bus ownership has transferred back to the PHY and the PHY drives
                the requested register onto the data bus. At T6, the Link will read the data bus and the PHY will de-

 6.3            USB333x Receiver
                The following section describes how the USB333x uses the ULPI interface to receive USB signaling
                and transfer status information to the Link. This information is communicated to the Link using RX
                Commands to relay bus status and received USB packets.
 6.3.1          ULPI Receive Command (RX CMD)
                The ULPI Link needs information which was provided by the following pins in a UTMI implementation:
                linestate[1:0], rxactive, rxvalid, rxerror, and VbusValid. When implementing the OTG functions, the
                VBUS and ID pin states must also be transferred to the Link. ULPI defines a Receive Command Byte
                (RXCMD) that contains this information.
                An RXCMD can be sent a any time the bus is idle. The RXCMD is initiated when the USB333x asserts
                DIR to take control of the bus. The timing of RXCMD is shown in the figure below. The USB333x can

            Transfer of the RXCMD byte occurs in Synchronous Mode when the PHY has control of the bus. The
            ULPI Protocol Block shown in Figure 6.1 determines when to send an RXCMD. A RXCMD will occur:
               When a linestate change occurs.
               When VBUS or ID comparators change state.
               During a USB receive when NXT is low.
               After the USB333x deasserts DIR and STP is low during start-up.
               After the USB333x exits Low Power Mode, Serial Modes, or Carkit Mode after detecting that the
                Link has de-asserted STP, and DIR is low.
            When a USB Receive is occurring, RXCMD’s are sent whenever NXT = 0 and DIR = 1. During a USB
            Transmit, the RXCMD’s are returned to the Link after STP is asserted.
            If an RXCMD event occurs during a High Speed USB transmit, the RXCMD is blocked until STP de-
            asserts at the end of the transmit. The RXCMD contains the status that is current at the time the
            RXCMD is sent.

                                Interrupt Latch register to determine the source of the interrupt. Section 5.6.1
                                describes how a change on the ID pin can generate an interrupt. Section 6.8
                                describes how an interrupt can be generated when the RidConversionDone bit is set.

 6.3.1.1        Definition of Linestate
                The Linestate information is used to relay information back to the Link on the current status of the USB
                data lines, DP and DM. The definition of Linestate changes as the USB333x transitions between LS/FS
                mode, HS mode, and HS Chirp.
 6.3.1.1.1        LS/FS LINESTATE DEFINITIONS
                In LS and FS operating modes the Linestate is defined by the outputs of the LS/FS Single Ended
                Receivers (SE RX). The logic thresholds for single ended receivers, VILSE and VILSE are shown in
                Table 4.6.

              Low Speed uses the same Linestate decoding threshold as Full Speed. Low Speed re-defines the Idle
              state as an inversion of the Full Speed idle to account for the inversion which occurs in the hub
              repeater path. Linestates are decoded exactly as in Table 6.4 with the idle as a K state.
6.3.1.1.2        HS LINESTATE DEFINITION
               In HS mode the data transmission is too fast for Linestate to be transmitted with each transition in the
               data packet. In HS operation the Linestate is redefined to indicate activity on the USB interface. The
               Linestate will signal the assertion and de-assertion of squelch in HS mode.

               There is also a third use of Linestate in HS Chirp where when the Host and Peripheral negotiate the

 6.3.2          USB Receiver
                The USB333x ULPI receiver fully supports HS, FS, and LS transmit operations. In all three modes the
                receiver detects the start of packet and synchronizes to the incoming data packet. In the ULPI protocol,
                a received packet has the priority and will immediately follow register reads and RXCMD transfers.
                Figure 6.8 shows a basic USB packet received by the USB333x over the ULPI interface.

                In Figure 6.8 the PHY asserts DIR to take control of the data bus from the Link. The assertion of DIR
                and NXT in the same cycle contains additional information that Rxactive has been asserted. When
                NXT is de-asserted and DIR is asserted, the RXCMD data is transferred to the Link. After the last byte
                of the USB receive packet is transferred to the PHY, the linestate will return to idle.
                The ULPI Full Speed receiver operates according to the UTMI / ULPI specification. In the Full Speed
                case, the NXT signal will assert only when the Data bus has a valid received data byte. When NXT is
                low with DIR high, the RXCMD is driven on the data bus.
                In Full Speed, the USB333x will not issue a Rxactive de-assertion in the RXCMD until the DP/DM
                linestate transitions to idle. This prevents the Link from violating the two Full Speed bit times minimum
                turn around time.
 6.3.2.1        Disconnect Detection
                A High Speed host must detect a disconnect by sampling the transmitter outputs during the long EOP
                transmitted during a SOF packet. The USB333x only looks for a High Speed disconnect during the
                long EOP where the period is long enough for the disconnect reflection to return to the host PHY. When
                a High Speed disconnect occurs, the USB333x will return a RXCMD and set the host disconnect bit
                in the USB Interrupt Status register.
                When in FS or LS modes, the Link is expected to handle all disconnect detection.
 6.3.2.2        Link Power Management (LPM) Token Receive
                The USB333x is fully capable of receiving the Extended PID in the LPM token. When the LPM 0000b
                PID is received, this information is passed to the Link as a normal receive packet. If the Link chooses
                to enter LPM suspend, the procedure detailed in 6.5.3 can be followed.

            The USB333x ULPI transmitter fully supports HS, FS, and LS transmit operations. Figure 6.1 shows
            the High Speed, Full Speed, and Low Speed transmitter block controlled by ULPI Protocol Block.
            Encoding of the USB packet follows the bit-stuffing and NRZI outlined in the USB 2.0 specification.
            Many of these functions are reused between the HS and FS/LS transmitters. When using the
            USB333x, Table 5.1 should always be used as a guideline on how to configure for various modes of
            operation. The transmitter decodes the inputs of XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect, OpMode[1:0],
            DpPulldown, and DmPulldown to determine what operation is expected. Users must strictly adhere to
            the modes of operation given in Table 5.1.
            Several important functions for a device and host are designed into the transmitter blocks.
            The USB333x transmitter will transmit a 32-bit long High Speed sync before every High Speed packet.
            In Full and Low Speed modes a 8-bit sync is transmitted.
            When the device or host needs to chirp for High Speed port negotiation, the OpMode = 10 setting will
            turn off the bit-stuffing and NRZI encoding in the transmitter. At the end of a chirp, the USB333x
            OpMode register bits should be changed only after the RXCMD linestate encoding indicates that the
            transmitter has completed transmitting. Should the opmode be switched to normal bit-stuffing and NRZI
            encoding before the transmit pipeline is empty, the remaining data in the pipeline may be transmitted
            in an bit-stuff encoding format.
            Please refer to the ULPI specification for a detailed discussion of USB reset and HS chirp.
6.4.1       USB333x Host Features
            The USB333x can also support USB Host operation and includes the following features that are
            required for Host operation.
6.4.1.1     High Speed Long EOP
            When operating as a High Speed host, the USB333x will automatically generate a 40 bit long End of
            Packet (EOP) after a SOF PID (A5h). The USB333x determines when to send the 40-bit long EOP by
            decoding the ULPI TX CMD bits [3:0] for the SOF. The 40-bit long EOP is only transmitted when the
            DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register are asserted. The High Speed 40-bit
            long EOP is used to detect a disconnect in mode.
            In device mode, the USB333x will not send a long EOP after a SOF PID.
6.4.1.2     Low Speed Keep-Alive
            Low Speed keep alive is supported by the USB333x. When in Low Speed mode, the USB333x will
            send out two Low Speed bit times of SE0 when a SOF PID is received.
6.4.1.3     UTMI+ Level 3
            Pre-amble is supported for UTMI+ Level 3 compatibility. When XcvrSelect is set to (11b) in host mode,
            (DpPulldown and DmPulldown both asserted) the USB333x will pre-pend a Full Speed pre-amble
            before the Low Speed packet. Full Speed rise and fall times are used in this mode. The pre-amble
            consists of the following: Full Speed sync, the encoded pre-PID (C3h) and then Full Speed idle (DP=1
            and DM = 0). A Low Speed packet follows with a sync, data and a LS EOP.
            The USB333x will only support UTMI+ Level 3 as a host. The USB333x does not support UTMI+ Level
            3 as a peripheral. A UTMI+ Level 3 peripheral is an upstream hub port. The USB333x will not decode
            a pre-amble packet intended for a LS device when the USB333x is configured as the upstream port
            of a FS hub, XcvrSelect = 11b, DpPulldown = 0b, DmPulldown =0b.

 6.4.1.4          Host Resume K
                  Resume K generation is supported by the USB333x. At the end of a USB Suspend the PHY will drive
                  a K back to the downstream device. When the USB333x exits from Low Power Mode, when operating
                  as a host, it will automatically transmit a Resume K on DP/DM. The transmitters will end the K with
                  SE0 for two Low Speed bit times. If the USB333x was operating in High Speed mode before the
                  suspend, the host must change to High Speed mode before the SE0 ends. SE0 is two Low Speed bit
                  times which is about 1.2 us. For more details please see sections 7.1.77 and 7.9 of the USB
                  Specification.
                  In device mode, the resume K will not append an SE0, but release the bus to the correct idle state,
                  depending upon the operational mode as shown in Table 5.1.
                  The ULPI specification includes a detailed discussion of the resume sequence and the order of
                  operations required. To support Host start-up of less than 1mS the USB333x implements the ULPI
                  AutoResume bit in the Interface Control register. The default AutoResume state is 0 and this bit should
                  be enabled for Host applications.
 6.4.1.5          No SYNC and EOP Generation (OpMode = 11)
                  UTMI+ defines OpMode = 11 where no sync and EOP generation occurs in High Speed operation.
                  This is an option to the ULPI specification and not implemented in the USB333x.
 6.4.2            Typical USB Transmit with ULPI
                  Figure 6.9 shows a typical USB transmit sequence. A transmit sequence starts by the Link sending a
                  TX CMD where DATA[7:6] = 01b, DATA[5:4] = 00b, and Data[3:0] = PID. The TX CMD with the PID
                  is followed by transmit data.

                  During transmit the PHY will use NXT to control the rate of data flow into the PHY. If the USB333x
                  pipeline is full or bit-stuffing causes the data pipeline to overfill NXT is de-asserted and the Link will
                  hold the value on Data until NXT is asserted. The USB Transmit ends when the Link asserts STP while
                  NXT is asserted.
                  Note: The Link cannot assert STP with NXT de-asserted since the USB333x is expecting to fetch
                           another byte from the Link.
                  After the USB333x completes transmitting, the DP and DM lines return to idle and a RXCMD is
                  returned to the Link so the inter-packet timers may be updated by linestate.

                                                     Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
                                                                                                                     Datasheet
              While operating in Full Speed or Low Speed, an End-of-Packet (EOP) is defined as SE0 for
              approximately two bit times, followed by J for one bit time. The transceiver drives a J state for one bit
              time following the SE0 to complete the EOP. The Link must wait for one bit time following line state
              indication of the SE0 to J transition to allow the transceiver to complete the one bit time J state. All bit
              times are relative to the speed of transmission.
              In the case of Full Speed or Low Speed, after STP is asserted each FS/LS bit transition will generate
              a RXCMD since the bit times are relatively slow.
6.4.2.1       Link Power Management Token Transmit
              A Host Link can send a LPM command using the USB333x. When sending the LPM token the normal
              transmit method is not used. Sending a LPM token requires the USB333x to send a 0000b or ‘F0’ PID.
              When the ULPI specification was defined the ‘F0’ PID was not defined. The ULPI specification used
              the “Reserved” ‘F0’ PID to signal chirp and resume signaling while using OpMode 10b. While in
              OpMode 00b the USB333x is able to generate the ‘F0’ PID as shown below.

              To send the ‘F0’ PID, the link will be required to use the TX CMD with NOPID to initiate the transmit
              and then follow up the TX CMD with the ‘F0’ PID. The data bytes follow as in a normal transmit, in
              OpMode 00b. The key difference is in that the link will have to send the PID the same as it would send
              a data packet. The USB333x is able to recognize the LPM transmit and correctly send the PID
              information.
6.5            Low Power Mode
              Low Power Mode is a power down state to save current when the USB session is suspended. The
              Link controls when the PHY is placed into or out of Low Power Mode. In Low Power Mode all of the
              circuits are powered down except the interface pins, Full Speed receiver, VBUS comparators, and
              IdGnd comparator. The VBUS and ID comparators can optionally be powered down to save current as
              shown in Section 6.5.5.
              Before entering Low Power Mode, the USB333x must be configured to set the desired state of the
              USB transceiver. The XcvrSelect[1:0], TermSelect and OpMode[1:0] bits in the Function Control
              register, and the DpPulldown and DmPulldown bits in the OTG Control register control the
              configuration as shown in Table 5.1. The DP and DM pins are configured to a high impedance state
              by configuring OpMode[1:0] = 01 as shown in the programming example in Table 6.8. Pull-down
              resistors with a value of approximately 2MΩ are present on the DP and DM pins to avoid false linestate
              indications that could result if the pins were allowed to float.

 6.5.1           Entering Low Power/Suspend Mode
                 To enter Low Power Mode, the Link will write a 0 or clear the SuspendM bit in the Function Control
                 register. After this write is complete, the PHY will assert DIR high and after a minimum of five rising
                 edges of CLKOUT, drive the clock low. After the clock is stopped, the PHY will enter a low power state
                 to conserve current. Placing the PHY in Suspend Mode is not related to USB Suspend. To clarify this
                 point, USB Suspend is initiated when a USB host stops data transmissions and enters Full-Speed
                 mode with 15KΩ pull-down resistors on DP and DM. The suspended device goes to Full-Speed mode
                 with a pull-up on DP. Both the host and device remain in this state until one of them drives DM high
                 (this is called a resume).

                 While in Low Power Mode, the Data interface is redefined so that the Link can monitor Linestate and
                 the VBUS voltage. In Low Power Mode DATA[3:0] are redefined as shown in Table 6.7. Linestate[1:0]
                 is the combinational output of the Single-Ended Receivers. The “int” or interrupt signal indicates an
                 unmasked interrupt has occurred. When an unmasked interrupt or linestate change has occurred, the

            An unmasked interrupt can be caused by the following comparators changing state: VbusVld, SessVld,
            SessEnd, and IdGnd. If any of these signals change state during Low Power Mode and the bits are
            enabled in either the USB Interrupt Enable Rising or USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers, DATA[3]
            will assert. During Low Power Mode, the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators can have their interrupts
            masked to lower the suspend current as described in Section 6.5.5.
            While in Low Power Mode, the Data bus is driven asynchronously because all of the PHY clocks are
            stopped during Low Power Mode.
6.5.2       Exiting Low Power Mode
            To exit Low Power Mode, the Link will assert STP. Upon the assertion of STP, the USB333x will begin
            its start-up procedure. After the PHY start-up is complete, the PHY will start the clock on CLKOUT and
            de-assert DIR. After DIR has been de-asserted, the Link can de-assert STP when ready and start
            operating in Synchronous Mode. The PHY will automatically set the SuspendM bit to a 1 in the
            Function Control register.

            Should the Link de-assert STP before DIR is de-asserted, the USB333x will detect this as a false
            resume request and return to Low Power Mode. This is detailed in Section 3.9.4 of the UTMI+ Low
            Pin Interface (ULPI) Specification Revision 1.1.
6.5.3       Link Power Management (LPM)
            When the USB333x is operating with a Link capable of Link Power Management, the Link will place
            the USB333x in and out of suspend rapidly to conserve power. The USB333x provides a fast suspend
            recovery that allows the USB333x to meet the suspend recovery time detailed in the Link Power
            Management ECN to the USB 2.0 specification.

Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
Datasheet
                When the Link places the USB333x into suspend during Link Power Management, the LPM Enable bit
                of the HS Compensation Register must be set to 1. This allows the USB333x to start-up in the time
                specified in Table 4.3.
 6.5.4          Interface Protection
                ULPI protocol assumes that both the Link and PHY will keep the ULPI data bus driven by either the
                Link when DIR is low or the PHY when DIR is high. The only exception is when DIR has changed
                state and a turn around cycle occurs for 1 clock period.
                In the design of a USB system, there can be cases where the Link may not be driving the ULPI bus
                to a known state while DIR is low. Two examples where this can happen is because of a slow Link
                start-up or a hardware reset.
 6.5.4.1        Start up Protection
                Upon start-up, when the PHY de-asserts DIR, the Link must be ready to receive commands and drive
                Idle on the data bus. If the Link is not ready to receive commands or drive Idle, it must assert STP
                before DIR is de-asserted. The Link can then de-assert STP when it has completed its start-up. If the
                Link doesn’t assert STP before it can receive commands, the PHY may interpret the data bus state as
                a TX CMD and transmit invalid data onto the USB bus, or make invalid register writes.
                When the USB333x sends a RXCMD the Link is required to drive the data bus back to idle at the end
                of the turn around cycle. If the Link does not drive the databus to idle the USB333x may take the
                information on the data bus as a TXCMD and transmit data on DP and DM until the Link asserts stop.
                If the ID pin is floated the last RXCMD from the USB333x will remain on the bus after DIR is de-
                asserted and the USB333x will take this in as a TXCMD.
                A Link should be designed to have the default POR state of the STP output high and the data bus tri-
                stated. The USB333x has weak pull-downs on the data bus to prevent these inputs from floating when
                not driven. These resistors are only used to prevent the ULPI interface from floating during events
                when the link ULPI pins may be tri-stated. The strength of the pull down resistors can be found in
                Table 4.5. The pull downs are not strong enough to pull the data bus low after a ULPI RXCMD, the
                Link must drive the data bus to idle after DIR is de-asserted.
                In some cases, a Link may be software configured and not have control of its STP pin until after the
                PHY has started. In this case, the USB333x has in internal pull-up on the STP input pad which will
                pull STP high while the Link’s STP output is tri-stated. The STP pull-up resistor is enabled on POR
                and can be disabled by setting the InterfaceProtectDisable bit 7 of the Interface Control register.
                The STP pull-up resistor will pull-up the Link’s STP input high until the Link configures and drives STP
                high. After the Link completes its start-up, STP can be synchronously driven low.
                A Link design which drives STP high during POR can disable the pull-up resistor on STP by setting
                InterfaceProtectDisable bit to 1. A motivation for this is to reduce the suspend current. In Low Power
                Mode, STP is held low, which would draw current through the pull-up resistor on STP.
 6.5.4.2        Warm Reset
                Designers should also consider the case of a warm restart of a Link with a PHY in Low Power Mode.
                After the PHY enters Low Power Mode, DIR is asserted and the clock is stopped. The USB333x looks
                for STP to be asserted to re-start the clock and then resume normal synchronous operation.
                Should the USB333x be suspended in Low Power Mode, and the Link receives a hardware reset, the
                PHY must be able to recover from Low Power Mode and start its clock. If the Link asserts STP on
                reset, the PHY will exit Low Power Mode and start its clock.
                If the Link does not assert STP on reset, the interface protection pull-up can be used. When the Link
                is reset, its STP output will tri-state and the pull-up resistor will pull STP high, signaling the PHY to
                restart its clock.

6.5.5       Minimizing Current in Low Power Mode
            In order to minimize the suspend current in Low Power Mode, the VBUS and ID comparators can be
            disabled to reduce suspend current. In Low Power Mode, the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators are
            not needed and can be disabled by clearing the associated bits in both the USB Interrupt Enable Rising
            and USB Interrupt Enable Falling registers. By disabling the interrupt in BOTH the rise and fall
            registers, the SessEnd and VbusVld comparators are turned off. The IdFloatRise and IdFloatFall bits
            in Carkit Interrupt Enable register should also be disabled if they were set. When exiting Low Power
            Mode, the Link should immediately re-enable the VbusVld and SessEnd comparators if host or OTG
            functionality is required.
            In addition to disabling the OTG comparators in Low Power Mode, the Link may choose to disable the
            Interface Protect Circuit. By setting the InterfaceProtectDisable bit high in the Interface Control register,
            the Link can disable the pull-up resistor on STP. When RESETB is low the Interface Protect Circuit
            will be disabled.
6.6         Full Speed/Low Speed Serial Modes
            The USB333x includes two serial modes to support legacy Links which use either the 3pin or 6pin
            serial format. To enter either serial mode, the Link will need to write a 1 to the 6-pin FsLsSerialMode
            or the 3-pin FsLsSerialMode bits in the Interface control register. Serial Mode may be used to conserve
            power when attached to a device that is not capable of operating in High Speed.
            The serial modes are entered in the same manner as the entry into Low Power Mode. The Link writes
            the Interface Control register bit for the specific serial mode. The USB333x will assert DIR and shut
            off the clock after at least five clock cycles. Then the data bus goes to the format of the serial mode
            selected. Before entering Serial Mode the Link must set the ULPI transceiver to the appropriate mode
            as defined in Table 5.1.
            In ULPI Clock Out Mode, the PHY will shut off the 60MHz clock to conserve power. Should the Link
            need the 60MHz clock to continue during the serial mode of operation, the ClockSuspendM bit[3] of
            the Interface Control Register should be set before entering a serial mode. If set, the 60 MHz clock
            will be present during serial modes.
            In serial mode, interrupts are possible from unmasked sources. The state of each interrupt source is
            sampled prior to the assertion of DIR and this is compared against the asynchronous level from
            interrupt source.
            Exiting the serial modes is the same as exiting Low Power Mode. The Link must assert STP to signal
            the PHY to exit serial mode. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR is de-asserted and the PHY
            will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI operation. The RESETB pin can
            also be pulsed low to reset the USB333x and return it to Synchronous Mode.
6.6.1       3-Pin FS/LS Serial Mode
            Three pin serial mode utilizes the data bus pins for the serial functions shown in Table 6.8.

 6.7            Carkit Mode
                The USB333x includes Carkit Mode to support a USB UART and USB Audio Mode.
                By entering Carkit Mode, the USB333x current drain is minimized. The internal PLL is disabled and
                the 60MHz ULPI CLKOUT will be stopped to conserve power by default. The Link may configure the
                60MHz clock to continue by setting the ClockSuspendM bit of the Interface Control register before
                entering Carkit Mode. If set, the 60 MHz clock will continue during the Carkit Mode of operation.
                In Carkit Mode, interrupts are possible if they have been enabled in the Carkit Interrupt Enable register.
                The state of each interrupt source is sampled prior to the assertion of DIR and this is compared against
                the asynchronous level from interrupt source. In Carkit Mode, the Linestate signals are not available
                per the ULPI specification.
                The ULPI interface is redefined to the following when Carkit Mode is entered.

             Exiting Carkit Mode is the same as exiting Low Power Mode as described in Section 6.5.2. The Link
             must assert STP to signal the PHY to exit serial mode. When the PHY can accept a command, DIR
             is de-asserted and the PHY will wait until the Link de-asserts STP to resume synchronous ULPI
             operation. The RESETB pin can also be pulsed low to reset the USB333x and return it to Synchronous
             Mode.
6.7.1        Entering USB UART Mode
             The USB333x can be placed into UART Mode by first setting the TxdEn and RxdEn bits in the Carkit
             Control register. Then the Link can set the CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control register. The TxdEn
             and RxdEn bits must be written before the CarkitMode bit.

             After the CarkitMode bit is set, the ULPI interface will become redefined as described in Table 6.10,
             and the USB333x will transmit data through the DATA[0] to DM of the USB connector and receive
             data on DP and pass the information the Link on DATA[1].
             When entering UART mode, the regulator output will automatically switch to the value configured by
             the UART RegOutput bits in the USB IO & Power Management register and the RCD pull-up resistors
             will be applied internally to DP and DM. This will hold the UART in its default operating state.
             While in UART mode, the transmit edge rates can be set to either the Full Speed USB or Low Speed
             USB edge rates by using the XcvrSelect[1:0] bits in the Function Control register.

 6.7.2          USB Audio Mode (USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338)
                When the USB333x is powered in Synchronous Mode, the Audio switches can be enabled by asserting
                the SpkLeftEn, or SpkRightEn bits in the Carkit Control register. After the register write is complete,
                the USB333x will immediately enable or disable the audio switch. Then the Link can set the
                CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control register. The SpkLeftEn, or SpkRightEn bits must be written
                before the CarkitMode bit.

                After the CarkitMode bit is set, the ULPI interface will become redefined as described in Table 6.10.
 6.8            RID Converter Operation
                The RID converter is designed to read the value of the ID resistance to ground and report back its
                value through the ULPI interface.
                When a resistor to ground is applied to the ID pin the state of the IdGnd comparator will change from
                a 1 to a 0 as described in Section 5.6.1. If the USB333x is in ULPI mode, an RXCMD will be generated
                with bit 6 low. If the USB333x is in Low Power Mode (or one of the other non-ULPI modes), the
                DATA[3] interrupt signal will go high.
                After the USB333x has detected the change of state on the ID pin, the RID converter can be used to
                determine the value of ID resistance. To start a ID resistance measurement, the RidConversionStart
                bit is set in the Vendor Rid Conversion register.
                The Link can use one of two methods to determine when the RID Conversion is complete. One method
                is polling the RidConversionStart bit as described in Section 7.1.3.4. The preferred method is to set
                the RidIntEn bit in the Vendor Rid Conversion register. When RidIntEn is set, an RXCMD will be
                generated after the RID conversion is complete. As described in Table 6.3, the alt_int bit of the RXCMD
                will be set.
                After the RID Conversion is complete, the Link can read RidValue from the Vendor Rid Conversion
                register.
 6.9            Headset Audio Mode
                This mode is designed to allow a user to view the status of several signals while using an analog Audio
                headset with a USB connector. This mode is provided as an alternate mode to the CarKit Mode defined
                in Chapter 6.7. In the CarKit mode the Link is unable to view the source of the interrupt on ID. For the
                Link to view the interrupt on ID the PHY must be returned to synchronous mode so the interrupt can
                be read. This will force the audio switches to be deactivated during the PHY start-up which may glitch
                the audio signals. In addition the Link can not change the resistance on the ID pin without starting up
                the PHY to access the ULPI registers.
                The Headset Audio Mode is entered by writing to the Headset Audio Mode register, and allows the
                Link access to the state of the VBUS and ID pins during audio without having to break the audio

 7.1            ULPI Register Array
                The USB333x PHY implements all of the ULPI registers detailed in the ULPI revision 1.1 specification.
                The complete USB333x ULPI register set is shown in Table 7.1. All registers are 8 bits. This table also
                includes the default state of each register upon POR or de-assertion of RESETB, as described in
                Section 5.5.2. The RESET bit in the Function Control Register does not reset the bits of the ULPI
                register array. The Link should not read or write to any registers not listed in this table.
                The USB333x supports extended register access. The immediate register set (00-3Fh) can be
                accessed through either a immediate address or an extended register address.

7.1.2       Carkit Control Registers
            The following registers are used to set-up and enable the USB UART and USB Audio functions.
7.1.2.1     Carkit Control
            Address = 19-1Bh (read), 19h (write), 1Ah (set), 1Bh (clear)
            This register is used to program the USB333x into and out of the Carkit Mode. When entering the
            UART mode the Link must first set the desired TxdEn and the RxdEn bits and then transition to Carkit
            Mode by setting the CarkitMode bit in the Interface Control Register. When RxdEn is not set then the
            DATA[1] pin is held to a logic high.
 FIELD NAME                BIT    ACCESS      DEFAULT       DESCRIPTION
 CarkitPwr                  0        rd           0b        Read only, 0.
 IdGndDrv                   1     rd/w/s/c        0b        Drives ID pin to ground
 TxdEn                      2     rd/w/s/c        0b        Connects UART TXD (DATA[0]) to DM
 RxdEn                      3     rd/w/s/c        0b        Connects UART RXD (DATA[1]) to DP
 SpkLeftEn                  4     rd/w/s/c        0b        Connects DM pin to SPK_L pin
 SpkRightEn                 5     rd/w/s/c        0b        Connects DP pin to SPK_R pin. See Note below.
 MicEn                      6     rd/w/s/c        0b        Connects DP pin to SPK_R pin. See Note below.
 CarkitDataMC               7     rd/w/s/c        0b        When set the UPLI DATA[2] pin is changed from a
                                                            driven 0 to tri-state, when carkit mode is entered.
            Note: USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338 Only: If SpkRightEn or MicEn are asserted the DP pin will
                    be connected to SPK_R. To disconnect the DP pin from the SPK_R pin both SpkrRightEn and
                    MicEn must be set to de-asserted.
            If using USB UART mode, the UART data will appear at the SPK_L and SPK_R pins if the
            corresponding SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn switches are enabled.
            If using USB Audio ((USB3331, USB3336, and USB3338 only), the TxdEn and RxdEn bits should not
            be set when the SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn switches are enabled. The USB single-ended
            receivers described in Section 5.2.1 are disabled when either SpkLeftEn, SpkRightEn, or MicEn are
            set.

 7.1.3          Vendor Register Access
                The vendor specific registers include the range from 30h to 3Fh. These can be accessed by the ULPI
                immediate register read / write.
 7.1.3.1        HS Compensation Register
                Address = 31h (read / write)
                The USB333x is designed to meet the USB specifications and requirements when the DP and DM
                signals are properly designed on the PCB. The DP and DM trace impedance should be 45ohm single
                ended and 90ohm differential. In cases where the DP and DM traces are not able to meet these
                requirements the HS Compensation register can be used to compensate for the losses in signal
                amplitude.

Chapter 8 Application Notes
 8.1            Application Diagram
                The USB333x requires few external components as shown in the application diagrams. The USB 2.0
                Specification restricts the voltage at the VBUS pin to a maximum value of 5.25V. In some applications,
                the voltage will exceed this limit, so the USB333x provides an integrated over voltage protection circuit.
                The over voltage protection circuit works with an external resistor (RVBUS) to lower the voltage at the
                VBUS pin.

8.2               USB Charger Detection
                  The USB333x provides the hardware described in the USB Battery Charging Specification. SMSC
                  provides an Application Note which describes how to use the USB333x in a battery charging
                  application.
8.3               Reference Designs
                  SMSC has generated reference designs for connecting the USB333x to SOCs/ASICs with a ULPI port.
                  Please contact the SMSC sales office for more details.
8.4               ESD Performance
                  The USB333x is protected from ESD strikes. By eliminating the requirement for external ESD
                  protection devices, board space is conserved, and the board manufacturer is enabled to reduce cost.

Industry’s Smallest Hi-Speed USB Transceiver with Single Supply Operation
Datasheet
                The advanced ESD structures integrated into the USB333x protect the device whether or not it is
                powered up.
 8.4.1          Human Body Model (HBM) Performance
                HBM testing verifies the ability to withstand the ESD strikes like those that occur during handling and
                manufacturing, and is done without power applied to the IC. To pass the test, the device must have
                no change in operation or performance due to the event. The USB333x HBM performance is detailed
                in Table 4.13.
 8.4.2          EN/IEC 61000-4-2 Performance
                The EN/IEC 61000-4-2 ESD specification is an international standard that addresses system-level
                immunity to ESD strikes while the end equipment is operational. In contrast, the HBM ESD tests are
                performed at the device level with the device powered down.
                SMSC contracts with Independent laboratories to test the USB333x to EN/IEC 61000-4-2 in a working
                system. Reports are available upon request. Please contact your SMSC representative, and request
                information on 3rd party ESD test results. The reports show that systems designed with the USB333x
                can safely provide the ESD performance shown in Table 4.13 without additional board level protection.
                In addition to defining the ESD tests, EN/IEC 61000-4-2 also categorizes the impact to equipment
                operation when the strike occurs (ESD Result Classification). The USB333x maintains an ESD Result
                Classification 1 or 2 when subjected to an EN/IEC 61000-4-2 (level 4) ESD strike.
                Both air discharge and contact discharge test techniques for applying stress conditions are defined by
                the EN/IEC 61000-4-2 ESD document.
 8.4.2.1        Air Discharge
                To perform this test, a charged electrode is moved close to the system being tested until a spark is
                generated. This test is difficult to reproduce because the discharge is influenced by such factors as
                humidity, the speed of approach of the electrode, and construction of the test equipment.
 8.4.2.2        Contact Discharge
                The uncharged electrode first contacts the USB connector to prepare this test, and then the probe tip
                is energized. This yields more repeatable results, and is the preferred test method. The independent
                test laboratories contracted by SMSC provide test results for both types of discharge methods.
