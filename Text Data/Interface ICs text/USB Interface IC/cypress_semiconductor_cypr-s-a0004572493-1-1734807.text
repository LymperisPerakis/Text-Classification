Notes
 5. Any GPIO, configured as “Input” should either be pulled high or low. A floating input pin (Tristate) has an indeterminate voltage level that can cause excess internal
    current consumption. A 10 kΩ pull-up or pull-down resistor is recommended on each of the input pin.
 6. When VBUS = VCCIO, connect VBUS to BUSDETECTION with a 10-K series resistor
    When VBUS > VCCIO, connect VBUS to BUSDETECTION via the resistor divider network. Select R1 and R2 values as follows:
    R1 ≥ 10 k
    R2 / (R1 + R2) = VCCIO/VBUS

absence of over-voltage protection (OVP) on the VBUS line, the VBUS should be connected to BUSDETECT (GPIO configured) using
the resistive network and the output of the battery charger to the VCC pin of CY7C65213, as shown in the following figure.
