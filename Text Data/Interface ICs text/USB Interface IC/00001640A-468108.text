 USB2611 Sideload Accelerator
 Fully-Integrated Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Sideload Accelerator
 Featuring MTP Boost Technology and Multimedia Synchronization Capabilities
Summary
Microchip’s USB2611 Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Sideload
Accelerator provides ultra-fast card reader download
speeds for mobile phones and portable consumer
electronics devices.
Synchronizing media between PCs and mobile devices
can be very time consuming, especially with large file
sizes driven by higher megapixel cameras and HD video
content. The USB2611 provides a key differentiator for
any mobile product by enabling enhanced data transfer
speeds. Without the USB2611, current mobile platform
architectures transfer data very slowly at approximately
1 MB/s. This translates to over 30 minutes for a
single movie file. With Microchip’s USB2611 Sideload
Accelerator, the transfer time can be cut to less than one
minute for the same movie file. The USB2611 provides        Highlights
an enhanced user experience via a USB 2.0 connection
