FUSB301
Autonomous USB Type-C
Controller with Super Speed
Switch Control
Description
  The FUSB301 is a fully autonomous Type-C controller optimized                                 www.onsemi.com
for <15 W applications. The FUSB301 offers CC logic detection for
Source Mode, Sink Mode, Dual Role Port Mode, accessory detection
support, and dead battery support. The FUSB301 features an external
switch pin (SS_SW) to enable an external USB Super Speed Switch
without interrupting the processor. The FUSB301 features an
extremely low power disable mode as well as low power during                                        Bottom View

2. A fast−mode I2C bus device can be used in a standard−mode I2C bus system, but the requirement tSU;DAT ≥ 250 ns must be met. This is
   automatically the case of the device does not stretch the LOW period of the I2C_SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period
   I2C_SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the I2C_SDA line tr_max + tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the standard−mode
   I2C bus specification) before the I2C_SCL line is released.
3. Cb equals the total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with high−speed devices, faster fall times are allowed according to the I2C
   specification.

   The FUSB301 includes a full I2C slave controller. The I2C                    Examples of an I2C write and read sequence are shown
slave fully complies with the I2C specification version 6                       Figure 5 and Figure 6 respectively.
    NOTE:     Single Byte read is initiated by Master with P immediately following first data byte.

   NOTE:    If Register is not specified Master will begin read from current register. In this case only sequence showing in Red bracket
            is needed.
