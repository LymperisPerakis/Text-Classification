EZ-USB® HX2LP™ Reference Design Kit (RDK)
EZ-USB® HX2LP™ Reference Design Kit (RDK) board is a tool to demonstrate the features of EZ-USB HX2LP devices
(CY7C65620/CY7C65630). Both CY7C65620 and CY7C65630 are identical in every aspect except for the number of ports they
support. The HX2LP RDK is based on the 56-pin QFN for CY7C65620/CY7C65630. Both are single transaction translator (1TT) hubs.
In the initial phase of the design, this board helps developers to understand the chip features and limitations before proceeding with
a complete design. The RDK includes support documents related to board hardware, PC application software, and EEPROM
configuration data (.iic) files.

The LED control lines can also be modulated with a square wave
for power conservation. The polarity of these pins is
programmable, see Configuration Options on page 14.
In manual mode, the indicators are under the control of the host,
which can turn on the LEDs, or leave them off. This is done by a
USB Hub class request. Blinking of the LEDs is supported in
manual mode. The port indicators enable the user to intervene
in any error detection. For example, when babble is detected
while plugging in a defective device, or when an overcurrent
condition occurs, the port indicators corresponding to the
downstream port blink green or only light the amber LED,
respectively.

 Note
  3. Unused port DD+/DD– lines can be left floating. Leave the port power, amber, and green LED pins unconnected, and deassert the overcurrent pin. Do not leave the
     overcurrent pin floating; it is an input. SPI data line should be connected to GND with 15 k resistor (Even if no EEPROM is used).

Default Descriptors
This section presents the different descriptors that are available. The following tables list the functionality of each descriptor.
Device Descriptor
The standard device descriptor for CY7C65620/CY7C65630 is based on the information found in the SPI EEPROM. The information
in the EEPROM overrides the default descriptor values. If no EEPROM is used, the CY7C65620/CY7C65630 enumerates with the
default descriptor values as shown in the following table. If a blank EEPROM is connected, the hub enumerates as vendor defined
class instead of a hub class. This is for the purpose of programming the EEPROM with the Cypress driver.

Configuration Options

that are either double byte addressed or single byte with the ninth

The 25LC080 EEPROM uses the double byte address format.                 Most significant byte of vendor ID
Therefore, the CY7C65620/CY7C65630 can communicate with             Byte 3: PID (LSB)
these parts. The '010s and '020s use the same command format
that is used to interface with the ‘040 and hence these can also        Least significant byte of product ID
be used to interface with the CY7C65620/CY7C65630.                  Byte 4: PID (MSB)]
If the attached EEPROM is blank (0xFF) the hub enumerates as            Most significant byte of product ID
a vendor class device. In this configuration, the hub connects to
the Cypress driver to allow programming of the EEPROM. When         Byte 5: Reserved
the EEPROM is programmed, a power cycle configures the chip             Reserved

This request results in reading length bytes of data from the external memory device and returned to the host. Data is read beginning
with address 0. This request fails if there is no external memory device present. This request is only valid if the hub is in the configured
state; the request fails otherwise.

This request results in writing length bytes of data to the external memory device. Data is written beginning with address 0. This
request fails if there is no external memory device present. This request is only valid if the hub is in the configured state or if the
external memory device write protect byte is set; the request fails otherwise.

HX2LP Errata Summary
1. Non-periodic and Isochronous OUT transfers in the same microframe
  ■Description
   With the operating in High-Speed mode with a Full-Speed device connected to a downstream port, Sometimes, an Isochronous
   OUT packet gets corrupted on the downstream port.
  ■Implication
   The main cause of this phenomenon is in the way the hub's Transaction Translator downstream handler state machine schedules
   transactions if non-periodic (Control or Bulk) transactions are found in the non-periodic buffer while an Isochronous OUT transac-
   tion is active on the port. If the downstream handler state machine sees an Isochronous OUT packet in the Transaction translation
   buffer and if it is scheduled in the same micro-frame by the host then it will skip the Isochronous OUT transaction and resume a
   non-periodic transaction.
  ■Workaround
   The workaround for this issue is for the host controller to avoid scheduling non-periodic traffic such that it will run while an
   Isochronous OUT transaction is active. Non-periodic traffic can be scheduled to run in the micro-frame before the Isochronous
   OUT transaction begins, or after the Isochronous OUT transaction completes.
  ■Status
   No plan to fix currently - recommend using workaround.
2. Last data not received in multi-microframe Isochronous IN transfers
  ■Description
   With the hub operating in High-Speed mode with a Full-Speed device connected to a downstream port, Sometimes a multi-micro-
   frame Isochronous IN transaction resulted in the last two Complete Split transactions that should have returned data but instead
   returned NYET handshakes.
  ■Implication
   The main cause of this phenomenon is in the hub's Transaction Translator logic which tracks data stored in the periodic transaction
   buffer. If the Full-Speed transaction completes before the Complete-Split token is received from the host, there is a chance that
   buffer will be over-written if the requested Isochronous IN payload is greater than 440 bytes (USB 2.0 specification on buffer size).
  ■Workaround
   The workaround for this issue is for the host controller to avoid scheduling the Complete Split token for the microframe where the
   Full-Speed packet ends too late in the frame. The TT is guaranteed to work correctly if the Complete Split is received in the first
   quarter of the microframe.
  ■Status
   No plan to fix currently - recommend using workaround.
