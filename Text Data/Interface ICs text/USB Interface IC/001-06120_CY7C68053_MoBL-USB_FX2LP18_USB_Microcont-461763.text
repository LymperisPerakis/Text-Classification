MoBL-USB FX2LP18 Development Kit
The CY3687 MoBL-USB™ FX2LP18 Development Kit is a complete development resource for FX2LP18. It provides a platform to
develop and test custom projects using FX2LP18. The development kit contains collateral materials for the firmware, hardware, and
software aspects of a design using FX2LP18.
GPIF™ II Designer
FX2LP™ General Programmable Interface (GPIF) provides an independent hardware unit, which creates the data and control signals
required by an external interface. FX2LP GPIF Designer allows users to create and modify GPIF waveform descriptors for EZ-USB
FX2/ FX2LP family of chips using a graphical user interface. Extensive discussion of general GPIF discussion and programming using
GPIF Designer is included in FX2LP18 Technical Reference Manual and GPIF Designer User Guide, distributed with GPIF Designer.
AN66806 - Getting Started with EZ-USB® FX2LP™ GPIF can be a good starting point.

 3. ‘0’ means ‘not implemented.’
 4. ‘2×’ means ‘double buffered.’
 5. Even though these buffers are 64 bytes, they are reported as 512 for USB 2.0 compliance. Nnever transfer packets larger than 64 bytes to EP1.

 Notes
  6. To use the ECC logic, the GPIF or Slave FIFO interface must be configured for byte-wide operation.
  7. After the data is downloaded from the host, a ‘loader’ can execute from internal RAM in order to transfer downloaded data to external memory.
  8. This EEPROM does not have address pins.

PCB Layout Recommendations                                        ■ Connections between the USB connector shell and signal
                                                                    ground must be done near the USB connector.
The following recommendations must be followed to ensure
                                                                  ■ Bypass or flyback caps on VBus, near connector, are
reliable high performance operation.
                                                                    recommended.
■ At least a four-layer impedance controlled board is required to
                                                                  ■ DPLUS and DMINUS trace lengths must be kept within 2 mm
  maintain signal quality.
                                                                    of each other in length, with preferred length of 20 to 30 mm.
■ Specify impedance targets (ask your board vendor what they
                                                                  ■ Maintain a solid ground plane under the DPLUS and DMINUS
  can achieve).
                                                                    traces. Do not allow the plane to be split under these traces.
■ To control impedance, maintain trace widths and trace spacing
                                                                  ■ It is preferable to have no vias placed on the DPLUS or
  to within specifications.
                                                                    DMINUS trace routing.
■ Minimize stubs to minimize reflected signals.
                                                                  ■ Isolate the DPLUS and DMINUS traces from all other signal
                                                                    traces by no less than 10 mm.

                                             In Section 3.3, stated that SCL and SDA pins can be connected to VCC or
                                             VCC_IO
                                             Chnged sections 3.5, 3.18.1 and pin descriptions of SCL, SDA to indicate that
                                             since DISCON=1 after reset, an EEPROM or EEPROM emulation is required
                                             on the I2C interface
   *A       434754      OSG        03/24/06  In pin description table, renamed pin 2H (Reserved) to Ground
                                             In Section 6, added statement “The GPIO’s are not over voltage tolerant,
                                             except the SCL and SDA pins, which are 3.3 V tolerant“
                                             In Section 8,added a footnote to the DC char table stating that AVcc can be
                                             floated in low power mode
                                             In Section 8, changed VIHmax in DC char table from 3.6 V to VCC_IO + 10%
                                             Changed the recommendation for the pull up resistors on I2C
                                             Split Icc into 4 different values, corresponding to the different voltage supplies
   *B       465471      OSG        See ECN
                                             Changed Isus typical to 20uA and 220uA
                                             Added section 3.9.3 on suspend current considerations
                                             Removed all references the part number CY7C68055. Corrected the bullet in
                                             Features to state that 24 GPIO’s are available. Added the Test ID (TID#) to
                                             the Features on the front page. Made changes to the block diagram on the

                                             Corrected the Ambient Temperature with Power Supplied. Moved figure titles
                                             to meet the new template. Checked grammar. Took out 9-bit address bus from
                                             the block diagram on the first page. Corrected Figure 4.1
   *D       492009      OSG        See ECN   Added Icc data in DC Characteristics and Maximum Power dissipation
   *E       500408      OSG        See ECN   Changed ESD spec to 1500 V
                                             Changed ESD spec to 2000 V and 1500 V only for SCL and SDA pins.
    *F      502115      OSG        See ECN   Added min spec for tOEoff
                                             Changed Icc and power dissipation numbers
                                             Removed SLCS from figure in Section 9.6 Slave FIFO Asynchronous Write
                                             Changed SLWR Pulse HIGH parameter to 50ns
                                             Section 9.13.1 9 V Removed the indication that SLCS and SLRD can be
   *G      1128404    OSG / ARI    See ECN   asserted together
                                             Section 9.13.3 - Removed the indication that SLCS and SLRD can be
                                             asserted together
                                             Implemented the latest template.
   *H     1349903       AESA       See ECN   Section 7 - Changed -0°C to -40°C
    *I    2728476       ODC        07/02/09  Deleted Note on AVcc parameter in DC Characteristics table
