MAX25410                                            Automotive USB Power Delivery Port Protector
Detailed Description
The MAX25410 combines USB Type-C CC1/CC2 and D+/D-protection switches with an industry-leading integrated ESD
and overvoltage protection. The IC is capable of delivering VCONN power to the HVCC1 or HVCC2 outputs with minimal
voltage drop, supports charge emulation, and supports USB LS/FS/HS communication on the D+/D- switches.
The device features automotive-grade ±15kV IEC 61000-4-2 ESD protection on all protected outputs, as well as
24V overvoltage protection on the CC and data switches. The integrated Type-C discharge switch features high-ESD
protection and integrated overvoltage-detection logic.
The MAX25410 is designed for installation in USB Type-C head units/hubs/dedicated charging ports where automotive-
grade ESD and overvoltage protection is required for sensitive upstream hosts.
Protection and Control
CC1/CC2 Pins
The CC1 and CC2 pins are the protected side of the CC switches and connect directly to the USB-PD controller. A 390pF
capacitance to ground is recommended on both CC1 and CC2 pins, which can be the USB-PD Controller's cReceiver
capacitance.
HVCC1/HVCC2 Pins
The HVCC1 and HVCC2 pins connect directly to the downstream USB Type-C port connector or captive cable. No
external circuitry is needed on either HVCC pin. HVCC1 and HVCC2 are tolerant to automotive high ESD, up to 24V
DC, and up to 40V voltage transients. HVCC1 and HVCC2 are automatically discharged for 30ms at power-up or after
specific fault conditions (see Table 1), and for 10ms every time VCONN is disabled.
D+/D- Pins
The D+ and D- pins are the protected side of the USB data switches and connect directly to the low-voltage upstream
USB PHY or captive cable. No external circuitry is used on either data pin.
HVD+/HVD- Pins
The HVD+ and HVD- pins should be routed to the downstream Type-C connector or captive cable. No external circuitry
is required on either pin. The HVD+ pin and HVD- pin are tolerant to automotive high ESD, up to 24V DC, and up to 40V
voltage transients.
VCONN_EN1/VCONN_EN2 Pins (MAX25410, MAX25410A)
The VCONN switch allows pins to enable only one of the two VCONN switches: VCC-to-HVCC1 pins or VCC-to-HVCC2
pins, active-high or active-low, depending on the variant. See VCONN Switch/CC Pass Through Switch Enable Table
and the Ordering Information section.
FAULT Pin
The FAULT pin is an open-drain fault-indication pin that asserts upon fault detection. For faults unrelated to VCONN, such
as an overvoltage on HVCC or HVD pins, the FAULT pin will remain asserted continuously until the fault is no longer
present.
During a VCONN short-to-ground fault, the FAULT pin asserts and remains asserted until the fault is no longer present or
the PD controller disables VCONN.
For a non-compliant VCONN load fault, the IC will attempt to retry and provide VCONN automatically until the fault is no
longer present or the PD controller disables VCONN.
Refer to Table 1 and the VCONN Auto-Retry section for additional information.
VCONN Switches (MAX25410, MAX25410A)
The advantage of MAX25410 is the ability to switch power from a low-power system supply to a wide range of E-marked
cables (that is, using the same supply that powers the USB-PD Controller). This essentially reduces the current budget
needed for supplying VCONN and therefore reduces solution cost and size.

MAX25410                                             Automotive USB Power Delivery Port Protector
Certain E-marked cables, however, draw currents that exceed the Type-C specification of 1W maximum shortly after
VCONN is sourced, which causes unwanted inrush currents and droops on the system supply, ultimately causing a
module reset.
To overcome this limitation while providing the 1W VCONN required by Type-C, MAX25410 implements a Fast UV
comparator on VCC and dual-threshold overcurrent protection with specific debounce timers. The first overcurrent
threshold (OCP Low) is set at 250 mA with a debounce of 400µs, which permits exceeding the 1W limit momentarily to
start up the E-marked cable circuitry. The second OCP threshold (OCP High) is set to 600 mA and has a debounce of 5
µs, which protects the system supply from non-compliant VCONN loads and/or short circuits.
VCONN Auto-Retry (MAX25410, MAX25410A)
Due to the VCC supply being a shared supply, asynchronous system loads can occur while sourcing VCONN. For this
reason, a VCONN Auto-Retry feature is implemented to minimize the software interaction of sourcing VCONN with a
shared supply.
If a VCONN load (E-marked cable or VPD) tries to draw an excessive amount of current for more than the debounce time,
the VCONN switch will automatically open to avoid drooping the upstream power supply, then automatically retry. The
USB-PD Controller can take action when the FAULT pin asserts. If FAULT de-asserts upon disabling VCONN, the PD
Controller can proceed without powering the non-compliant E-marked cable until a new cable is detected.
The VCONN auto-retry feature is active for the following VCONN-related faults:
●   VCONN OCP LOW
●   VCONN OCP HIGH
●   VCC FAST UV
●   VCONN SHORT TO GROUND
For the other faults, such as HVD and HVCC OV, VCC UVLO, BIAS OV/UV, FAULT remains asserted as long as the
fault exists.
After VCONN is enabled on a CC channel, the IC monitors for additional faults related to VCONN operation. On the first
VCONN fault and after the debounce time, the VCONN switch is immediately turned off, the diagnostic current is enabled
on the corresponding channel, and the short-to-ground comparator is active and monitoring HVCC.
Note that during the VCONN fault conditions (except VCONN OV), the CC pass-through switches are always on, which
allows the PD Controller to monitor VCONN for further diagnostics.
Automatic Discharge (MAX25410, MAX25410A) To comply with the Type-C specification, the HVCC pins will be
discharged for 10ms every time VCONN is disabled (i.e., VCONN_EN1 goes from high to low for active-high variants, or
goes from low to high for active-low variants).

USB On-the-Go and Dual-Role Applications
The MAX25410 is fully compatible with USB on-the-go (OTG) and dual-role applications. A negotiated role swap (HNP
or Apple CarPlay) requires no software interaction with the IC. When there is no negotiation before the SoC enters
peripheral mode, the MAX25410 must be in Hi-Speed pass-through (SDP mode) before and during the role swap. The
MAX25410GTEA/V+, MAX25410AGTEA/V+ and MAX25410BGTEA/V+ default to SDP mode on startup if the CDP/DCP
pin is logic-low. This configuration allows a role swap immediately on startup without microcontroller interaction

Applications Information
VCC Bypass Capacitor
VCC is the main IC supply, and the VCONN switch input. VCC requires a minimum 1µF ceramic capacitor (X5R or better)
for input supply current and VCONN switch usage. The capacitor must be as close as possible to the VCC pin and
have a short connection to the IC exposed pad. Using vias to connect to the ground layer is recommended. For best
performance, use a low-impedance path to connect the 5V system power supply to the VCC pin.
BIAS Bypass Capacitor
BIAS is the output of the internal LDO and clamp rail for the USB data switches. BIAS requires a minimum 1µF ceramic
capacitor (X5R or better) for decoupling and to provide an AC return path on transient events (overvoltage, ESD). The
capacitor must be as close as possible to the BIAS pin and have a short connection to the IC exposed pad. Ground flood
over GND1 (pin 4) is recommended.
Layout of USB Data-Line Traces
USB Hi-Speed mode requires careful PCB layout with 90Ω controlled differential impedance-matched traces of equal
length. Insert tuning peaking inductors and capacitors on the D+, D-, HVD+, and HVD- pins to tune out parasitic
capacitance. The values are layout dependent. Contact Maxim Applications for assistance.
Tuning of USB Data Lines
USB Hi-Speed mode requires careful PCB layout with 90Ω controlled differential impedance, with matched traces of
equal length and with no stubs or test points. MAX25410 includes high-bandwidth USB data switches (1GHz). This
means data-line tuning is generally not required.
However, all designs are recommended to include pads that would allow LC components to be mounted on the data lines
so that tuning can easily be performed later, if necessary. Tuning components should be placed as close as possible to
the IC data pins, on the same layer of the PCB as the IC. The proper configuration of the tuning components is shown in
Figure 2. Tuning inductors should be high-Q wire-wound inductors. Contact Maxim’s application team for assistance with
the tuning process for your specific application.

±15kV ESD Protection
Maxim devices incorporate ESD-protection structures to protect against electrostatic discharges encountered during
handling and assembly. The devices provide additional protection against static electricity. Maxim’s state-of-the-art
structures protect against ESD of ±15kV on HVD+, HVD-, HVCC1, and HVCC2. The ESD structures withstand high ESD
in all states: normal operation, shutdown, and powered down. While other solutions can latch up and require the power
to be cycled after an ESD event, MAX25410 devices continue to work without latchup. The devices are characterized for
protection to the following limits:
1.  ±2kV using the Human Body Model
2.  ±15kV using the IEC 61000-4-2 Air Gap method
3.  ±8kV using the IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge method
4.  ±15kV using the ISO 10605 Air Gap method
5.  ±8kV using the ISO 10605 Contact Discharge method
ESD Test Conditions
ESD performance depends on a variety of conditions. Contact Maxim for a reliability report that documents test setup,
test methodology, and test results.
Human Body Model
Figure 3 shows the Human Body Model, and Figure 4 shows the current waveform it generates when discharged into
a low impedance. This model consists of a 100pF capacitor charged to the ESD voltage of interest, which is then
discharged into the device through a 1.5kΩ resistor.

IEC 61000-4-2
The IEC 61000-4-2 standard covers ESD testing and performance of finished equipment. The devices help users design
equipment that meet Level 4 of IEC 61000-4-2. The Human Body Model testing is performed on unpowered devices,
while IEC 61000-4-2 is performed while the device is powered. The main difference between tests done using the Human
Body Model and IEC 61000-4-2 is higher peak current in IEC 61000-4-2. Because series resistance is lower in the IEC
61000-4-2 ESD test model (Figure 5), the ESD-withstand voltage measured to this standard is generally lower than that
measured using the Human Body Model. Figure 6 shows the current waveform for the ±8kV, IEC 61000-4-2 Level 4, ESD
Contact Discharge test. The Air Gap Discharge test involves approaching the device with a charged probe. The Contact
Discharge method connects the probe to the device before the probe is energized.
