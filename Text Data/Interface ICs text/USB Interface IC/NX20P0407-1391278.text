                USB Type-C CC and SBU Protection IC
                Rev. 1.3 — 22 August 2019                                        Product data sheet
1 General description
             The NX20P0407 is a single-chip USB Type-C port protection device that provides 28V
             short-to-VBUS overvoltage protection to CC1/CC2 and SBU1/SBU2 pins.
             USB Type-C allows VBUS voltage to increase up to 20V through Power delivery protocol.
             CC1/2 and SBU1/2 pins can be shorted to VBUS due to mechanical twisting and sliding
             of the connector since Type-C connector contact pins are 25% closer to each other than
             a micro USB connector. Moisture or fine dust may also cause the 20V VBUS pin to be
             shorted to adjacent pins.
             NX20P0407 enables CC and SBU pins to be more robust in even abnormal conditions.
             NX20P0407 is 28V DC tolerant on CON_CC1, CON_CC2, CON_SBU1 and CON_SBU2
             pins in connector side and quickly disconnects switches if the voltage is above
             overvoltage threshold, protecting CC1, CC2, SBU1 and SBU2 in system side from high
             voltage.
             NX20P0407 integrates IEC 61000-4-2 ESD protection on CON_CC1 and CON_CC2,
             +15KV air discharge and +8KV contact discharge, which helps to reduce external BOM
             cost. NX20P0407 CON_CC1/2 pins are designed to be protected from surges up to +/-
             35V.

7       Functional description
                          NX20P0407 is placed in front of Type-C connector and protects CC and SBU pins in
                          System side from 20V VBUS short, ESD and surge.
                          NX20P0407 has Rd clamp circuit on both CON_CC1 and CON_CC2 when VSYS is
                          below UVLO threshold, i.e., dead battery condition. It allows Type-C adapter to detect
                          sink through CC and start providing 5V VBUS. Main charger regulates system voltage
                          from the VBUS. Once VSYS comes up, NX20P0407 enables switches and disconnects
                          the Rd clamp circuit from CON_CC1 and CON_CC2.

                   7.1 Power status
                          When VSYS is below VSYSUVLO, NX20P0407 stays in shutdown mode. Bias circuit,
                          switches and all comparators are disabled, but Rd clamp circuits on CON_CC1 and
                          CON_CC2 are enabled. It allows the Type-C adapter to detect Rd and to supply 5V
                          through VBUS pin in dead battery condition.
                          NX20P0407 enters standby mode when VSYS exceeds VSYSUVLO. CC switch turns on
                          automatically and SBU switch is controlled by SBUEN. After CC switch is fully turned ON,
                          the Rd clamp circuit is disabled.
                          5V VCONN power supply on CC1 or CC2 should be supplied after VSYS is valid.

                                                                                                           USB Type-C CC and SBU Protection IC
                   7.2 Overvoltage protection
                       NX20P0407 has short circuit protection of CON_CC1/2 and CON_SBU1/2 up to 28V.
                       CC switch overvoltage threshold is VOVPCC to guarantee VCONN power supply passes
                       to VCONN load, which is maximum 5.5V by USB Type-C spec. SBU switch overvoltage
                       threshold is VOVPSBU to securely turn the switch off and prevent high voltage to SBU in
                       system side.
                       Once overvoltage on any channel is detected, the switch is quickly turned off within
                       tOVP_RES, to prevent overvoltage to system side. FLAG pin goes low in tFLAG_RES to
                       inform system of the fault condition. If the voltage of the channel triggered OVP comes
                       down below overvoltage threshold for tOVP_DEB, the switch is turned back on and FLAG
                       pin gets Hi-Z.
                       Each of the four switches for CC1/2 and SBU1/2 has its own OVP comparator and is
                       controlled by its comparator independently. If CC1 voltage exceeds OVP threshold, the
                       CC1 switch is turned off, but the other switches stay ON.
                                                                             CON_CCx

                   7.3 Post-stage clamp circuit
                       NX20P0407 has a post-stage clamp circuit to clamp extra voltage on CC1, CC2, SBU1
                       and SBU2 in system side. When shorting with VBUS, the voltage on CON_CCx and
                       SBU_CCx is rapidly increased. Even though NX20P0407 features super fast response
                       time for overvoltage condition, the overvoltage may pass through to CCx / SBUx for
                       the response time, tOVP_RES. NX20P0407 post-stage clamp circuit provides secondary
                       protection to clamp the voltage on CCx/ SBUx in system side, to prevent exceeding 7V
                       Clamping voltage.

                         condition is cleared.

                         NX20P0407 has two pairs of switches: CC switches and SBU switches. CC switches are
                         always ON when SYS power is valid and there is no fault condition. The switches are
                         capable of +/- 1.2A current with RON_CC switch resistance. SBU switches are controlled
                         by SBUEN when SYS power is valid. The switch bandwidth is 1.5GHz so that it can be
                         used to protect USB D+/D- from overvoltage if SBU is not used.

 Rth(j-a)                  thermal resistance from junction to ambient                                                                              110                    °C/W
[1]   The overall Rth(j-a) can vary depending on the board layout. To minimize the effective Rth(j-a), all pins must have a solid connection to larger Cu layer areas
      e.g. to the power and ground layer. In multi-layer PCB applications, the second layer should be used to create a large heat spreader area right below the
      device. If this layer is either ground or power, it should be connected with several vias to the top layer connecting to the device ground or supply. Try not
      to use any solder-stop varnish under the chip.
[2]   This Rth(j-a) is calculated based on JEDEX2S2P board. The actual Rth(j-a) value may vary in applications using different layer stacks and layouts.
