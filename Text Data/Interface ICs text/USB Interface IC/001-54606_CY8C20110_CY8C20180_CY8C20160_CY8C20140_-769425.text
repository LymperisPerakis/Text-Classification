 5. 8/6/4 available configurable IOs can be configured to any of the 10 IOs of the package. After any of the 8/6/4 IOs are chosen, the remaining 2/4/6 IOs of the package
    are not available for any functionality.
 6. Avoid using GP1[1] and GP1[2] for driving LEDs. These two pins have special functions during power-up which is used at factory. LEDs connected to these two pins
    blink during the power-up of the device.

Notes
 8. 1.8 V  VDD_I2C  VDD_CE and 2.4 V  VDD_CE  5.25 V.
 9. The I2C drive mode of the CapSense device should be configured properly before using in an I2C environment with external pull-ups. Please refer to I2C_ADDR_DM
     register and its factory setting.
 10. For low power requirements, if VDD is to be turned off, this concept can be used. The requirement is that the VDDs of CapSense Express, I2C pull-ups, and LEDs
     should be from the same source such that turning off the VDD ensures that no signal is applied to the device while it is unpowered. The I2C signals should not be
     driven high by the master in this situation. If a port pin or group of port pins of the master can cater to the power supply requirements of the circuit, the LDO can be
     avoided.

I2C Interface
The CapSense Express devices support the industry-standard I2C protocol, which can be used for:
■  Configuring the device
■  Reading the status and data registers of the device
■  Controlling device operation
■  Executing commands
The I2C address can be modified during configuration.
I2C Device Addressing
The device uses a seven-bit addressing protocol. The I2C data transfer is always initiated by the master sending a one-byte address:
the first seven bits contain the address and the LSB indicates the data transfer direction. Zero in the LSB bit indicates the write
transaction from master and one indicates the read transfer by the master. The following table shows examples for different I2C
addresses.

Notes
 20. Errata: Added two on-chip filtering algorithms for improved CapSense performance and better noise immunity.
 21. Errata: If a finger is on the sensor, during power-up the sensor triggers and the baseline gets stuck. Baseline is stuck only when Averaging Filter is enabled. For more
     information, see “Errata” on page 40.
 22. The register 0x75–0x78, 0x7,D and 0x8A–0x8D are reserved.
 23. The Device ID for different devices are tabulated in Device IDs on page 17.

Notes
 26. The ‘W’ indicates the write transfer. The next byte of data represents the 7-bit I2C address.
 27. The "not accessible" timing values are the maximum values for 5-V and 3.3-V operation. The timing values for 2.7-V operation will be 4x the values provided in this
     table. Refer to Operating Voltages on page 21.
 28. Errata: Save to flash command fails when the sleep interval is set to 512 or 64 Hz. For more information, see “Errata” on page 40.
 29. Loop time can be measured by probing any sensor using an oscilloscope and measuring the time between two consecutive scans.

DC Flash Write Specifications
This table lists guaranteed maximum and minimum specifications for the voltage and temperature ranges: 4.75 V to 5.25 V and –
40 °C < TA < 85 °C, 3.10 V to 3.6 V and –40 °C < TA < 85 °C or 2.4 V to 2.90 V and –40 °C < TA < 85 °C, respectively. Typical parameters
apply to 5 V, 3.3 V, or 2.7 V at 25 °C. These are for design guidance only. Flash Endurance and Retention specifications are valid only
within the range: 25 °C ± 20 °C during the flash write operation. It is at the user’s own risk to operate out of this temperature range.
If flash writing is done out of this temperature range, the endurance and data retention reduces.

                  realization of a controller with a minimal quantity of chips, thus achieving maximal possible miniaturization. This
                  in turn, reduces the volume and the cost of the controller. The microcontroller is normally not used for
                  general-purpose computation as is a microprocessor.

loop (PLL)        signal.
pinouts           The pin number assignment: the relation between the logical inputs and outputs of the PSoC device and their
                  physical counterparts in the printed circuit board (PCB) package. Pinouts involve pin numbers as a link between
                  schematic and PCB design (both being computer generated files) and may also involve pin names.
port              A group of pins, usually eight.
Power on reset    A circuit that forces the PSoC device to reset when the voltage is lower than a pre-set level. This is a type of
(POR)             hardware reset.

                rate of speed. The term static is used because, after a value is loaded into an SRAM cell, it remains unchanged
                until it is explicitly altered or until power is removed from the device.
SROM            An acronym for supervisory read only memory. The SROM holds code that is used to boot the device, calibrate
                circuitry, and perform Flash operations. The functions of the SROM may be accessed in normal user code,
                operating from Flash.
stop bit        A signal following a character or block that prepares the receiving device to receive the next character or block.
synchronous      1. A signal whose data is not acknowledged or acted upon until the next active edge of a clock signal.
                 2. A system whose operation is synchronized by a clock signal.
tri-state       A function whose output can adopt three states: 0, 1, and Z (high-impedance). The function does not drive any
                value in the Z state and, in many respects, may be considered to be disconnected from the rest of the circuit,
                allowing another output to drive the same net.
UART            A UART or universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter translates between parallel bits of data and serial bits.
user modules    Pre-build, pre-tested hardware/firmware peripheral functions that take care of managing and configuring the lower
                level Analog and Digital PSoC Blocks. User Modules also provide high level API (Application Programming
                Interface) for the peripheral function.
user space      The bank 0 space of the register map. The registers in this bank are more likely to be modified during normal
                program execution and not just during initialization. Registers in bank 1 are most likely to be modified only during
                the initialization phase of the program.

Glossary (continued)
VDD             A name for a power net meaning "voltage drain." The most positive power supply signal. Usually 5 V or 3.3 V.
VSS             A name for a power net meaning "voltage source." The most negative power supply signal.
watchdog timer  A timer that must be serviced periodically. If it is not serviced, the CPU resets after a specified period of time.
