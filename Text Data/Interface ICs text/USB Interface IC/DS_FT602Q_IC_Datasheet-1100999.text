4 Function Description
The FT602 is a high performance USB 3.1 UVC bridge with a FIFO interface. It is designed to transfer
uncompressed YUV422 video data from the 32bit FIFO interface to the USB 3.1 bus. It supports resolutions
and frame rates up to 1920x1080@60 frames per second. In FT600 multi-channel mode, up to 4 UVC
channels of video may be transported. It can be used in those applications which require high resolution
imaging devices.
The FIFO interface supports multi-voltage I/O of 1.8V, 2.5V or 3.3V and operating frequencies of 66MHz or
100MHz. At 100MHz operation only 2.5V or 3.3V I/O voltages are supported.
There are 2 different proprietary synchronous bus protocols supported; one FIFO bus protocol is called the
“Multi-Channel FIFO” bus protocol, also known as the FT600 FIFO protocol and the other is the “245
Synchronous FIFO” bus protocol. The latter being an extension of the interface introduced in the
FT232H/FT2232H devices.
*FIFO bus data lines are driven by the FIFO master, the FT602 only reads data from the FIFO master.
4.1 Key Features and Function Description
Functional Integration
The following features are integral to the IC design: FIFO protocol management, USB 3.1 (Gen 1) controller,
USB3.0 and USB2.0 PHYs, power management, clock generation, power-on-reset (POR) and LDO regulator.
USB 3.1 Protocol Controller
The USB 3.1 Protocol Controller manages the data stream from the device USB control endpoint. It handles
the USB protocol requests generated by the USB host controller and the commands for controlling the
functional parameters of the endpoint in accordance with the USB 3.1 specification. 32KB of burst buffers are
available in the protocol controller. These buffers are allocated to the UVC channels according to the required
video bandwidth. The factory programmed default is for a single UVC channel and all burst buffers are
allocated to the single channel. The default configuration may be customised by using the FT602 Chip
Configuration utility.
FIFO Management
This unit is used to manage all PIPE data or buffers in the FIFO memory; the data is sent or received through
the FIFO protocol layer. Through this block the FIFO memory can be allocated to each PIPE with any size of
memory as long as the total memory allocated to all PIPEs does not exceed the maximum FIFO memory size
which is 16KB. Additionally, the FIFO signals have a configurable high drive strength capability and can be set
to 18Ω, 25Ω, 35Ω and 50Ω.
Multi-Channel FIFO Bus protocol
The multi-Channel FIFO bus is a slave bus and is designed to handle Multi-Channel FIFO connectivity. The bus
protocol supports a total of 4 IN channels. CLK is the clock output to the FIFO bus master.
245 Synchronous FIFO Bus protocol
The 245 Synchronous FIFO bus is a slave bus with one IN FIFO channel supported by this bus protocol. CLK is
the clock output to the FIFO bus master.
FIFO Bus Clock Option
The device provides the following FIFO bus clock frequency option: 66MHz, 100MHz.

                                                                                               Version 1.4

FIFO Buffer (16K bytes)
Data written into the FIFO is stored in the FIFO buffer and transferred to the USB endpoint buffers and
prepared for transmission to the USB host. The data is transferred to the host whenever the IN endpoint is
ready to receive data.
The FIFO and EPC burst buffers in the FT602 may be configured to correspond to the required throughput of
the UVC channel. The factory programmed default configuration is for a single UVC channel with the entire
16KB FIFO buffer allocated to the single IN channel. The default configuration may be customised by using the
FT602 Chip Configuration utility.
Internal LDO Regulator
The LDO regulator generates the +1.0V power supply for driving the internal core of the device. This supply is
not to be used for external devices and is meant for decoupling.
Reset Generator
The integrated Reset Generator module provides a reliable power-on reset to the device internal circuitry at
power up. The RESET_N input pin allows an external device to reset the FT602. This pin is an active low input.
Interrupt
One interrupt pin is provided; this pin can be used for I2C interrupt request or to wake up the FT602 device
from sleep mode.
I2C bus
The FT602 provides an I2C bus which operates as master, the transmission speed defaults to 800 Kb/s.
USB Video Class Device
The UVC device has configurations for SuperSpeed, Hi-speed, and full speed devices. The device is compliant
to UVC Version 1.1 and supports the following features.
        Up to 14 customisable resolutions each in FS, HS, SS modes, up to UHD.
        Up to 4 UVC sources simultaneously.
        Up to 60fps of F-HD input.
4.2 Multi-Channel FIFO mode Protocols
The FIFO interface is a slave bus and is designed to handle multi-channel connectivity. The bus protocol
supports a total of 4 IN channels; each has a corresponding USB IN endpoint. CLK is the clock output from the
bus slave to the bus master.
The channel numbers denoted in this document as channels 1 to 4 are mapped to USB endpoint numbers 1 to
4. The USB IN endpoint in Channel 1 is denoted as USB IN channel 1.
Correspondingly, the FIFO IN is for data transmitted from the USB device to the host.
WR_N is the bus master to bus slave data transaction request signal, and it is active low.
RXF_N is the bus slave to bus master data receive acknowledge signal, and it is active low.
TXE_N (optional signal, the master can ignore this signal) is the bus slave to bus master FIFO idle status valid
signal, and it is active low.
DATA[31:0] is used as the 32-bit data bus during the data transfer phase. When the bus is in the idle state
DATA[31:16], DATA[7:0] and BE[3:0] are driven to logic”1” by the bus master, and DATA[15:8] is driven by
the bus slave to provide the FIFO status to the bus master. The lower nibble (DATA[11:8]) provides the 4 IN
channels FIFO status. They are all active low.

                                                                                                    Version 1.4

For example, at idle, DATA[8] is logic”0”, which indicates USB IN channel 1 FIFO space is empty and able to
receive data . The external bus master will start a transfer cycle by asserting WR_N based on the channel
FIFO status. The first cycle after WR_N is asserted is the command phase, followed by the data phase when
RXF_N is asserted. At the command phase, the bus master will send the channel number which it intends to
transfer data with on DATA[7:0] and the Write command on BE[3:0]. BE[3:0] = ‘h1 indicates a master write.
There may also be a required turn-a-round for DATA[31:0] and BE[3:0] after the command phase and at the
end of data transaction.
Table 4.1 shows Multi-Channel FIFO mode command phase master write and channel address setting.

The waveform below shows a FT602 master write transaction for 14 bytes at channel 1 with the bus master
terminating the transaction. There are turn-a-round cycles for DATA[15:8] after the command phase and at
the end of the data transaction. The BE[3:0] shows that the lower 2 bytes in D3 are valid at the last word
strobe in this transaction.

NOTE: There is no turnaround phase for BE pins as these remain inputs when the FIFO is being written to by
the master.
The waveform below shows a FT602 master write transaction where the FIFO at channel 1 uses all data space
first, the RXF_N reasserts when the FIFO data space is not available after D3. There are turn-a-round cycles
for DATA[15:8] after the command phase and at the end of the data transaction. The BE[3:0] shows that the
transaction is all word aligned, all 4 bytes in D3 are valid at the last word strobe in this transaction.

4.3 245 Synchronous FIFO mode Protocols
This FT602 slave FIFO bus uses one IN FIFO channel while in this mode.
CLK is the clock output to the bus master; it can be configured as 66 MHz or 100 MHz
TXE_N is an output signal, Transmit FIFO Empty. It is active low and when active it indicates the Transmit
FIFO has space and it is ready to receive data from the FIFO master.
WR_N is an input signal, Write Enable. It is active low and when it is driven low by the bus master, the master
has write cycle access.
BE[3:0] is the byte enable signal. In bus master write operation, the bus master asserts the signal for the
valid bytes in a word strobe. Normally, all 4 bytes should be valid in a bus transaction except in the last word
strobe when the data transaction length is not aligned at a word boundary.
The waveform below shows 245 synchronous FIFO bus master write cycles.
                      Figure 4.3 245 Synchronous FIFO mode bus master write cycle
*In 245 Synchronous FIFO mode master write operation, if the bus master expects the data to be transferred
on the USB bus in a maximum possible packet length, it should write the data to the FIFO in a single bus
transaction.
4.4 FIFO Bus AC Timing
  The FT602 device FIFO bus is a synchronous parallel bus. The CLK signal is generated by the device, with the
   typical FIFO clock duty cycle of 50%. Both Multi-Channel and 245 synchronous FIFO modes’ worst case AC
                                                 timing are shown in
Figure 4.4 and Table 4.2.
In this figure, ‘Input Data’ includes all control signals and data lines driven by the FIFO master. ‘Output Data’
includes all control signals driven by the FIFO slave - FT602.

4.5 Crystal Requirements
The FT602 device requires an external clock source to control the internal circuitry.
The recommended parameters for the crystal are: 30MHz ±20ppm Crystal 18pF 50 Ohm -40°C ~ 85°C.
The crystal should be connected across the XI and XO pins.
Note: Replacing the crystal with an oscillator or other clock source by tying XO to GND is not supported
4.6 I2C Interface
The I2C master supports 3 operating frequencies, 800 kHz, 400 kHz and 100 kHz. The frequency may be set
through the FT602 configuration utility. The I2C master issues repeated start for read operations and it does
not support arbitration and clock stretching.
I2C commands are issued by FT602 under the following conditions:
    1. FT602 defined commands to convey video resolution selection and start of streaming
    2. UVC command (camera and processing unit) pass through to I2C slave device
    3. Side-band pass through (opaque data) by user supplied host application via configuration interface.
        Slave device initiated communication can be retrieved
AN_434_FT602_UVC_Bus_Master_Sample describes the I2C slave register map.

6 USB Power Configurations
The following sections illustrate possible USB power configurations for the FT602. The illustrations have
omitted pin numbers for ease of understanding.
6.1 USB Bus-Powered Configuration
Note: The reference designs here are for USB 3.1 Standard B or Micro-B connectors.
                           Figure 6.1 Bus-Powered Configuration-1.8V/2.5V I/O
Figure 6.1 illustrate the FT602 in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. The FT602 device gets its
power(VCC33) from the USB bus via an external LDO(LDO_3V3) stepping the voltage down to +3.3V. Another
external LDO stepping the voltage down to +2.5V for supplying the VCCIO power, connect VCCIO pins to
same LDO(LDO_3V3) if VCCIO is configured to 3.3V.
A ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT602 and
associated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host. The value of the Ferrite Bead
depends on the total current drawn by the application.

                                                                                              Version 1.4

6.2 Self-Powered Configuration
                                   Figure 6.2 Self-Powered Configuration
Figure 6.2 illustrates the FT602 in a typical USB self-powered configuration. The FT602 device gets its power
from its own power supply, VCC33 and VCCIO, and does not draw current from the USB bus.
The basic rules for USB self-powered devices are as follows –
    i)   A self-powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub controller
             is powered down.
    ii) A self-powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation and USB suspend
             as it has its own power supply.
    iii) A self-powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self-powered USB
             hub.
