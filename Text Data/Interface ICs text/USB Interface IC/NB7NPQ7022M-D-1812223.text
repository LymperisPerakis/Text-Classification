NB7NPQ7022M
3.3 V USB 3.1 Dual Channel
High Gain Linear Redriver
Description
   The NB7NPQ7022M is a 3.3 V dual channel, high gain, redriver for
USB 3.1 Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 applications that supports both
5 Gbps and 10 Gbps data rates. Signal integrity degrades from PCB                         www.onsemi.com
traces, transmission cables, and inter−symbol interference (ISI). The
NB7NPQ7022M compensates for these losses by engaging varying
levels of equalization at the input receiver, and flat gain amplification
on the output transmitter. The Flat Gain and Equalization are
controlled by four level control pins. Each channel has a set of
independent control pins to make signal optimization possible.                                     1
   After power up, periodic check of TX output is made for the receiver                          UQFN16
connection. When the receiver is detected, the RX termination                                 CASE 523AF
becomes enabled and the device is set to perform the redriver function.
Note that both channels are independent of each other.
   The NB7NPQ7022M comes in a small 3 x 3 mm UQFN16 package
                                                                                        MARKING DIAGRAM
and is specified to operate across the entire industrial temperature
range of –40°C to 85°C.                                                                           NB7N

NOTE:     EQ and FG can be set by adjusting the voltage to the control pins. There are 4 specific levels – HIGH “H” where pin is connected
          to VCC, LOW “L” where pin is connected to Ground, FLOAT “F” where the pin is left floating (open) and Rext “R” where an external
          resistor 68 kW connected from pin to Ground. Please refer Table 7 for voltage levels.
