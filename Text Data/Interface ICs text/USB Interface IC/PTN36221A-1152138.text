                 Rev. 2.1 — 25 August 2015                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PTN36221A is a small, low power, high performance SuperSpeed USB 3.0 redriver
              that enhances signal quality by performing receive equalization on the deteriorated input
              signal followed by transmit de-emphasis maximizing system link performance. With its
              superior differential signal conditioning and enhancement capability, the device delivers
              significant flexibility and performance scaling for various systems with different PCB trace
              and cable channel conditions and still benefit from optimum power consumption.
              PTN36221A is a single-channel device that supports data signaling rate of 5 Gbit/s.
              The PTN36221A has built-in advanced power management capability that enables
              significant power saving under various different USB 3.0 Low-power modes (U2/U3). The
              device performs these actions without host software intervention and conserves power.
              The PTN36221A is powered by a 1.8 V supply. It is available in X2QFN12
              1.6 mm  1.6 mm  0.35 mm package with 0.4 mm pitch.

8. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 2 “Block diagram of PTN36221A”.
                       PTN36221A is a single-channel SuperSpeed USB 3.0 redriver meant to be used for signal
                       integrity enhancement on various platforms — smart phone, tablet, active cable,
                       notebooks, docking station, desktop, AIO, peripheral devices, etc. With its high fidelity
                       differential signal conditioning capability and wide configurability, this chip is flexible
                       enough for use under a variety of system environments.
                       The following sections describe the individual block functions and capabilities of the
                       device in more detail.
                   8.1 Receive equalization
                       On the high-speed signal path, the device performs receive equalization providing
                       frequency selective gain to configuration pin EQ setting. Table 4 lists the configuration
                       options available in this device.

                   8.2 Transmit de-emphasis
                       The PTN36221A device enhances High Frequency (HF) signal content further by
                       performing de-emphasis on the high-speed signals. In addition, the device provides flat
                       frequency gain by boosting output signal. Both flat and frequency selective gains prepare
                       the system to cover up for losses further down the link. Table 5 lists de-emphasis
                       configuration options of PTN36221A.

                       PTN36221A has implemented an advanced power management scheme that operates in
                       tune with USB 3.0 bus electrical condition. Though the device does not decode USB
                       power management commands (related to USB 3.0 U1/U2/U3 transitions) exchanged
                       between USB 3.0 host and peripheral/device, it relies on bus electrical conditions to
                       decide to be in one of the following states:
                         • Active state wherein device is fully operational, USB data is transported. In this state,
                            USB connection exists, but there is no need for Receive Termination detection.
                         • Power-saving states:
                            – U2/U3 state
                            – No connection state
                         • Deep power-saving state: When EN is LOW, this chip is in shut-down state.
                       The Receive Termination Detection circuitry is implemented as part of a transmitter and
                       detect whether a load device with equivalent DC impedance ZRX_DC is present.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 16) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 14 and 15

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 16.
