The EZ-PD CCG4M device has a flash module with a flash
accelerator, tightly coupled to the CPU to improve average
access times from the flash block. The flash block is designed to
deliver two wait-states (WS) access time at 48 MHz and with
0-WS access time at 16 MHz. The flash accelerator delivers 85%
of single-cycle SRAM access performance on average. Part of
the flash module can be used to emulate EEPROM operation if
required.

The chip’s internal operating power supply is derived from
VDDD. In UFP mode, CCG4M operates in 2.7 – 5.5V. In DFP
and DRP modes, it operates at 3.0 – 5.5V range.
A separate I/O supply pin, VDDIO, allows the GPIOs to operate
at levels from 1.71 to 5.5 V. The VDDIO pin can be equal to or
less than the voltages connected to the V5V_P1 or V5V_P2 and
VDDD pins.

Note
  4. Usage above the absolute maximum conditions listed in Table 7 may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to absolute maximum conditions for extended
     periods of time may affect device reliability. The maximum storage temperature is 150 °C in compliance with JEDEC Standard JESD22-A103, High Temperature
     Storage Life. When used below absolute maximum conditions but above normal operating conditions, the device may not operate to specification.

Note
 6. It can take as much as 20 milliseconds to write to Flash. During this time the device should not be Reset, or Flash operations will be interrupted and cannot be relied
    on to have completed. Reset sources include the XRES pin, software resets, CPU lockup states and privilege violations, improper power supply levels, and watchdogs.
    Make certain that these are not inadvertently activated.
