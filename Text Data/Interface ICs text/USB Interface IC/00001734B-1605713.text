           LAN7500/LAN7500i
1.1.1        OVERVIEW
The LAN7500/LAN7500i is a high performance Hi-Speed USB 2.0 to 10/100/1000 Ethernet controller. With applications
ranging from embedded systems, set-top boxes, and PVRs, to USB port replicators, USB to Ethernet dongles, and test
instrumentation, the device is a high performance and cost competitive USB to Ethernet connectivity solution.
The LAN7500/LAN7500i contains an integrated 10/100/1000 Ethernet MAC and PHY, Filtering Engine, USB PHY, Hi-
Speed USB 2.0 device controller, TAP controller, EEPROM controller, and a FIFO controller with a total of 32 KB of inter-
nal packet buffering.
The internal USB 2.0 device controller and USB PHY are compliant with the USB 2.0 Hi-Speed standard. The device
implements Control, Interrupt, Bulk-in, and Bulk-out USB Endpoints.
The Ethernet controller supports auto-negotiation, auto-polarity correction, HP Auto-MDIX, and is compliant with the
IEEE 802.3, IEEE 802.3u, IEEE 802.3ab standards. ARP and NS offload is also supported.
Multiple power management features are provided, including various low power modes and “Magic Packet”, “Wake On
LAN”, and “Link Status Change” wake events. These wake events can be programmed to initiate a USB remote wakeup.
An internal EEPROM controller exists to load various USB configuration information and the device MAC address. The
integrated IEEE 1149.1 compliant TAP controller provides boundary scan via JTAG.
1.1.2        USB
The USB portion of the LAN7500/LAN7500i integrates a Hi-Speed USB 2.0 device controller and USB PHY.
The USB device controller contains a USB low-level protocol interpreter which implements the USB bus protocol, packet
generation/extraction, PID/Device ID parsing, and CRC coding/decoding, with autonomous error handling. The USB
device controller is capable of operating in USB 2.0 Hi-Speed and Full-Speed compliant modes and contains autono-
mous protocol handling functions such as handling of suspend/resume/reset conditions, remote wakeup, and stall con-
dition clearing on Setup packets. The USB device controller also autonomously handles error conditions such as retry
for CRC and data toggle errors, and generates NYET, STALL, ACK and NACK handshake responses, depending on
the endpoint buffer status.
The LAN7500/LAN7500i implements four USB endpoints: Control, Interrupt, Bulk-in, and Bulk-out. The Bulk-in and
Bulk-out Endpoints allow for Ethernet reception and transmission respectively. Implementation of vendor-specific com-
mands allows for efficient statistics gathering and access to the device’s system control and status registers.

                                                                        LAN7500/LAN7500I
1.1.3         FIFO CONTROLLER
The FIFO controller uses two internal SRAMs to buffer RX and TX traffic. Bulk-Out packets from the USB controller are
directly stored into the TX buffer. The FIFO Controller is responsible for extracting Ethernet frames from the USB packet
data and passing the frames to the MAC. Received Ethernet Frames are filtered by the Receive Filtering Engine and
frames meeting the filtering constraints are stored into the RX buffer and become the basis for bulk-in packets.
1.1.4         ETHERNET
The LAN7500/LAN7500i integrates an IEEE 802.3/802.3u/802.3ab compliant PHY for twisted pair Ethernet applications
and a 10/100/1000 Ethernet Media Access Controller (MAC).
The PHY can be configured for 1000 Mbps (1000BASE-T), 100 Mbps (100BASE-TX) or 10 Mbps (10BASE-T) operation
in Full-Duplex mode. It can be configured for 100 Mbps or 10 Mbps operation in Half Duplex mode. The PHY block
includes auto-negotiation, auto-polarity correction, and Auto-MDIX. Minimal external components are required for the
utilization of the Integrated PHY.
The Ethernet MAC/PHY supports numerous power management wakeup features, including “Magic Packet”, “Wake on
LAN”, and “Link Status Change”. Microsoft NDIS 6.2 and Windows 7 compliant ARP and NS offload support is also pro-
vided.The device will respond to an NS or ARP request by generating and transmitting a response. When received in a
SUSPEND state, an NS or ARP request will not result in the generation of a wake event. Additionally, five status LEDs
are supported.
1.1.5         FRAME FILTERING
The LAN7500/LAN7500i Receive Filtering Engine performs frame filtering. It supports 33 perfect address filters. These
can be used to filter either the Ethernet source address or destination address. Additional address filtering is available
via a 512-bit hash filter. The hash filter can perform unicast or multicast filtering.
VLAN tagged frames can be filtered via the VLAN ID. A 4096-bit table exists to support all possible VLAN IDs. The VLAN
type can be programmed. Double tagging is supported.
1.1.6         HOST OFFLOADING
The LAN7500/LAN7500i supports a variety of TCP/UDP/IP checksum offloads to reduce the burden on the host pro-
cessor. For Ethernet receive frames, the device can be configured to validate the IP checksum and UDP/TCP check-
sum. Both IPv4 and IPv6 packets are supported. A raw checksum across the layer 3 packet can also be provided.
For Ethernet transmitted frames, the device can be configured to calculate the IP checksum and UDP/TCP checksum.
Additionally, Large Send Offload (LSO) is supported to further reduce host CPU loading.
1.1.7         POWER MANAGEMENT
The LAN7500/LAN7500i features four variations of USB suspend: SUSPEND0, SUSPEND1, SUSPEND2, and SUS-
PEND3. These modes allow the application to select the ideal balance of remote wakeup functionality and power con-
sumption.
• SUSPEND0: Supports GPIO, “Wake On LAN”, “Magic Packet”, and “PHY Link Up” remote wakeup events. It,
   however, consumes the most power.
• SUSPEND1: Supports GPIO and “Link Status Change” for remote wakeup events. This suspend state consumes
   less power than SUSPEND0.
• SUSPEND2: Supports only GPIO assertion for a remote wakeup event. This is the default suspend mode for the
   device.
• SUSPEND3: Supports GPIO, “Good Packet”, and “PHY Link Up” remote wakeup events. A “Good Packet” is a
   received frame that is free of errors and passes certain filtering constraints independent of those imposed on
   “Wake On LAN” and “Magic Packet” frames. This suspend state consumes power at a level similar to the NOR-
   MAL state, however, it allows for power savings in the Host CPU, which greatly exceeds that of the
   LAN7500/LAN7500i. The driver may place the device in this state after prolonged periods of not receiving any
   Ethernet traffic.
1.1.8         EEPROM CONTROLLER
The LAN7500/LAN7500i contains an EEPROM controller for connection to an external EEPROM. This allows for the
automatic loading of static configuration data upon pin reset, or software reset. The EEPROM can be configured to load
USB descriptors, USB device configuration, and MAC address.
Custom operation without EEPROM is also provided.

1.1.9        GENERAL PURPOSE I/O
Twelve GPIOs are supported. All GPIOs can serve as remote wakeup events when the LAN7500/LAN7500i is in a sus-
pended state.
1.1.10       TAP CONTROLLER
IEEE 1149.1 compliant TAP Controller supports boundary scan and various test modes.
The device includes an integrated JTAG boundary-scan test port for board-level testing. The interface consists of four
pins (TDO, TDI, TCK and TMS) and includes a state machine, data register array, and an instruction register. The JTAG
pins are described in Table 2-3, “JTAG Pins,” on page 10. The JTAG interface conforms to the IEEE Standard 1149.1 -
1990 Standard Test Access Port (TAP) and Boundary-Scan Architecture.
All input and output data is synchronous to the TCK test clock input. TAP input signals TMS and TDI are clocked into
the test logic on the rising edge of TCK, while the output signal TDO is clocked on the falling edge.
The JTAG logic is reset when the TMS and TDI pins are high for five TCK periods.
The implemented IEEE 1149.1 instructions and their op codes are shown in Table 1-1.

                                                                          LAN7500/LAN7500I
3.0      EEPROM CONTROLLER (EPC)
LAN7500/LAN7500i may use an external EEPROM to store the default values for the USB descriptors and the MAC
address. The EEPROM controller supports most “93C56 or 93C66” type 256/512 byte EEPROMs. A total of nine
address bits are used for connection to the device.
A 3-wire style 2K/4K EEPROM that is organized for 256/512 x 8-bit operation must be used.
The MAC address is used as the default Ethernet MAC address and is loaded into the device’s MAC address registers.
If a properly configured EEPROM is not detected, it is the responsibility of the Host LAN Driver to set the IEEE
addresses.
After a system-level reset occurs, the device will load the default values from a properly configured EEPROM. The
device will not accept USB transactions from the Host until this process is completed.
The device’s EEPROM controller also allows the Host system to read, write and erase the contents of the Serial
EEPROM.
3.1      EEPROM Format
Table 3-1 illustrates the format in which data is stored inside of the EEPROM.
Note the EEPROM offsets are given in units of 16-bit word offsets. A length field with a value of zero indicates that the
field does not exist in the EEPROM. The device will use the field’s HW default value in this case.
   Note:     For the device descriptor, the only valid values for the length are 0 and 18.
   Note:     For the configuration and interface descriptor, the only valid values for the length are 0 and 18.
   Note:     The EEPROM programmer must ensure that if a string descriptor does not exist in the EEPROM, the refer-
             encing descriptor must contain 00h for the respective string index field.
   Note:     If all string descriptor lengths are zero, then a Language ID will not be supported.

          This bit specifies the functionality of speed LEDs (LED0 and LED1). The Speed LEDs’ behavior is deter-
          mined by line speed and the setting of this bit, as indicated in following table:
             SPD_LED_FUNCTION                 SPEED (Mbps)             LED0         LED1

                         1                        No Link               Off          Off

                         1                          100                 Off         Blink
                         1                         1000                Blink        Blink
          When SPD_LED_FUNCTION = 0, the LEDs function solely as Link and Speed LEDs. When
          SPD_LED_FUNCTION = 1, the LEDs function as Link and Speed and Activity LEDs. In those cases, the
          table entry “Blink” indicates the LED will remain on when no transmit or receive activity is detected and
          will blink at an 80 mS rate whenever TX or RX activity is detected.
             Note:      GPIOEN[1:0] in Configuration Flags 1 must be set in order to properly control speed LED
                        operation. If only one of the bits is set, then untoward operation and unexpected results may
                        occur. If both bits are clear, then SPD_LED_FUNCTION is ignored.
    1     Remote Wakeup Support
          0 = Device does not support remote wakeup.
          1 = Device supports remote wakeup.
    0     Power Method
          0 = Device is bus powered.
          1 = Device is self powered.

     7      GPIO PME Enable
            Setting this bit enables the assertion of the GPIO5 pin, as a result of a Wakeup (GPIO) pin, Magic
            Packet, or PHY Link Up. The host processor may use the GPIO5 pin to asynchronously wake up, in a
            manner analogous to a PCI PME pin.
            0 = The device does not support GPIO PME signaling.
            1 = The device supports GPIO PME signaling.
               Note:     When this bit is 0, the remaining GPIO PME parameters in this flag byte are ignored.
     6      GPIO PME Configuration
            This bit selects whether the GPIO PME is signaled on the GPIO5 pin as a level or a pulse. If pulse is
            selected, the duration of the pulse is determined by the setting of the GPIO PME Length bit of this flag
            byte. The level of the signal or the polarity of the pulse is determined by the GPIO PME Polarity bit of this
            flag byte.
            0 = GPIO PME is signaled via a level.
            1 = GPIO PME is signaled via a pulse.
               Note:     If GPIO PME Enable is 0, this bit is ignored.

    5     GPIO PME Length
          When the GPIO PME Configuration bit of this flag byte indicates that the GPIO PME is signaled by a
          pulse on the GPIO5 pin, this bit determines the duration of the pulse.
          0 = GPIO PME pulse length is 1.5 mS.
          1 = GPIO PME pulse length is 150 mS.
             Note:     If GPIO PME Enable is 0, this bit is ignored.
    4     GPIO PME Polarity
          Specifies the level of the signal or the polarity of the pulse used for GPIO PME signaling.
          0 = GPIO PME signaling polarity is low.
          1 = GPIO PME signaling polarity is high.
             Note:     If GPIO PME Enable is 0, this bit is ignored.
    3     GPIO PME Buffer Type
          This bit selects the output buffer type for GPIO5.
          0 = Open drain driver / open source
          1 = Push-Pull driver
             Note:     Buffer Type = 0, Polarity = 0 implies Open Drain
                       Buffer Type = 0, Polarity = 1 implies Open Source
             Note:     If GPIO PME Enable is 0, this bit is ignored.
    2     GPIO PME WOL Select
          Four types of wakeup events are supported; Magic Packet, Perfect DA, PHY Link Up, and Wakeup Pin(s)
          assertion. Wakeup Pin(s) are selected via the GPIO Wakeup Enables specified in bytes 1Eh and 1Fh of
          the EEPROM. This bit selects whether WOL events or Link Up wakeup events are supported.
          0 = WOL event wakeup supported.
          1 = PHY linkup wakeup supported.
             Note:     If WOL is selected, the PME Magic Packet Enable and PME Perfect DA Enable bits determine
                       the WOL event(s) that will cause a wakeup.
             Note:     If GPIO PME Enable is 0, this bit is ignored.
    1     PME Magic Packet Enable
          When GPIO PME WOL Select indicates WOL is selected, this bit enables/disables Magic Packet detec-
          tion and wakeup.
          0 = Magic Packet event wakeup disabled.
          1 = Magic Packet event wakeup enabled.
             Note:     This bit is ignored if GPIO PME WOL Select indicates WOL event wakeup not supported.
    0     PME Perfect DA Enable
          When GPIO PME WOL Select indicates WOL is selected, this bit enables/disables Perfect DA detection
          and wakeup.
          0 = Perfect DA event wakeup disabled.
          1 = Perfect DA event wakeup enabled.
             Note:     This bit is ignored if GPIO PME WOL Select indicates WOL event wakeup not supported.

3.2       EEPROM Defaults
The signature value of 0xA5 is stored at address 0. A different signature value indicates to the EEPROM controller that
no EEPROM or an un-programmed EEPROM is attached to the device. In this case, the hardware default values are
used, as shown in Table 3-5.

             fields.
3.3       EEPROM Auto-Load
Certain system level resets (USB reset, nRESET, and SRST) cause the EEPROM contents to be loaded into the device.
After a reset, the EEPROM controller attempts to read the first byte of data from the EEPROM. If the value A5h is read
from the first address, then the EEPROM controller will assume that a programmed external Serial EEPROM is present.
   Note:     The USB reset only loads the MAC address.
3.4       An Example of EEPROM Format Interpretation
Table 3-6 and Table 3-7 provide an example of how the contents of a EEPROM are formatted. Table 3-6 is a dump of
the EEPROM memory (256-byte EEPROM), while Table 3-7 illustrates, byte by byte, how the EEPROM is formatted.
The industrial version of the device is used in the example.

4.0      PME OPERATION
LAN7500/LAN7500i provides a mechanism for waking up a host system via PME mode of operation. PME signaling is
only available while the device is operating in the self powered mode and a properly configured EEPROM is attached.
Figure 4-1 illustrates a typical application.

LAN7500/LAN7500I
The Host Processor is connected to a Chipset containing the Host USB Controller (HC). The USB Host Controller inter-
faces to LAN7500/LAN7500i via the DP/DM USB signals. An Embedded Controller (EC) signals the Chipset and the
Host processor to power up via an Enable signal. The EC interfaces to LAN7500/LAN7500i via four signals. The PME
signal is an input to the EC from the device that indicates the occurrence of a wakeup event. The VBUS_DET output of
the EC is used to indicate bus power availability. The PME_CLEAR (nRESET) signal is used to clear the PME. The
PME_MODE_SEL signal is sampled by the device when PME_CLEAR (nRESET) is asserted and is used by the device
to determine whether it should remain in PME mode or resume normal operation.
GPIO pins are used for PME handling. GPIO5 is reserved for use as an output to signal the PME. GPIO6 is reserved
for use as the PME_MODE_SEL input.
The application scenario in Figure 4-1 assumes that the Host Processor and the Chipset are powered off, the EC is
operational, and the device is in PME mode, waiting for a wake event to occur. A wake event will result in the device
signaling a PME event to the EC, which will then wake up the Host Processor and Chipset via the Enable signal. The
EC asserts VBUS_DET after the USB bus is powered, sets PME_MODE_SEL to determine whether the device is to
begin normal operation or continue in PME mode, and asserts PME_CLEAR (nRESET) to clear the PME.
The following wake events are supported:
• Wakeup Pin(s)
      The GPIO pins not reserved for PME handling have the capability to wake up the device when operating in PME
      mode. In order for a GPIO to generate a wake event, it’s enable bit must be set
      in the GPI0[11:8] Wakeup Enables or GPIO[7:0] Wakeup Enables bytes of the EEPROM, as appropriate. During
      PME mode of operation, the GPIOs used for signaling (GPIO5 and GPIO6) are not affected by the values set in
      the corresponding bits of GPIO[7:0] Wakeup Enables.
      GPIOs 0 - 4 and 7 - 10 are available as wakeup pins in PME mode of operation and are active low by default.
• Magic Packet
      Reception of a Magic Packet when in PME mode will result in a PME being asserted.
• Perfect DA match of Physical address
      Reception of an Ethernet frame whose Destination address matches the device’s MAC address will result in a
      PME being asserted.
• PHY Link Up
      Detection of a PHY link partner when in PME mode will result in a PME being asserted.
In order to facilitate PME mode of operation, the GPIO PME Enable bit in the GPIO PME Flags field, must be set and
all remaining GPIO PME Flags field bits must be appropriately configured for pulse or level signaling, buffer type, and
GPIO PME WOL selection. The PME event is signaled on GPIO5.
The PME_MODE_SEL pin (GPIO6) must be driven to the value that determines whether or not the device remains in
PME mode of operation (1) or resumes normal operation (0) when the PME is recognized and cleared by the EC via
PME_CLEAR (nRESET) assertion.
   Note:      When in PME mode or nRESET will always cause the contents of the EEPROM to be reloaded.
Figure 4-2 flowcharts PME operation while in Internal PHY mode. The following conditions hold:
EEPROM Configuration:
•  GPIO PME Enable = 1 (enabled)
•  GPIO PME Configuration = 0 (PME signaled via level on GPIO5 pin)
•  GPIO PME Length = 0 (NA)
•  GPIO PME Polarity = 1 (high level signals event)
•  GPIO PME Buffer Type = 1 (Push-Pull)
•  GPIO PME WOL Select = 0 (Magic Packet wakeup)
•  Power Method = 1 (self powered)
•  MAC address for Magic Packet
PME signaling configuration:
• GPIO5 signals PME
• GPIO6 is PME_MODE_SEL

5.0       NETDETACH OPERATION
5.1       NetDetach
NetDetach is a mode of operation where the device detaches from the USB bus after the Ethernet cable is disconnected.
This is advantageous for mobile devices, as an attached USB device may prevent the Host CPU from entering the ACPI
C3 state. Allowing the CPU to enter the C3 state maximizes battery life, as the C3 state is the lowest of the four APCI
power states.
When detached, the device is in a low power state. After the Ethernet cable is reconnected, or a programmed GPIO pin
asserts, the device automatically attaches to the USB bus.

  Note 7-1       When powering this device from laboratory or system power supplies, it is important that the absolute
                 maximum ratings not be exceeded or device failure can result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage
                 spikes on their outputs when AC power is switched on or off. In addition, voltage transients on the
                 AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility exists, it is suggested that a clamp
                 circuit be used.
  Note 7-2       This rating does not apply to the following pins: XI, XO, ETHRBIAS, USBRBIAS.
  Note 7-3       This rating does not apply to the following pins: ETHRBIAS, USBRBIAS.
  Note 7-4       0ºC to +70ºC for commercial version, -40ºC to +85ºC for industrial version.
*Stresses exceeding those listed in this section could cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress rating
only. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability. Functional
operation of the device at any condition exceeding those indicated in Section 7.2, "Operating Conditions**", Section 7.4,
"DC Specifications", or any other applicable section of this specification is not implied. Note, device signals are NOT 5

**Proper operation of the device is guaranteed only within the ranges specified in this section. After the device has com-
pleted power-up, VDDVARIO and the magnetics power supply must maintain their voltage level with ±10%. Varying the
voltage greater than ±10% after the device has completed power-up can cause errors in device operation.

7.3       Power Consumption
This section details the power consumption of the device as measured during various modes of operation. For each
mode of operation, two tables are provided: one for operation of VDDVARIO (and magnetics) at 2.5V, and the other for
operation of VDDVARIO (and magnetics) at 3.3V. Power consumption values are provided for both the device-only, and
for the device plus Ethernet components. Power dissipation is determined by temperature, supply voltage, and external
source/sink requirements.

7.5       AC Specifications
This section details the various AC timing specifications of the device.
  Note:      The USBDP and USBDM pin timing adheres to the USB 2.0 specification. Refer to the Universal Serial Bus
             Revision 2.0 specification for detailed USB timing information.
  Note:      The Ethernet TX/RX pin timing adheres to the IEEE 802.3 specification. Refer to the IEEE 802.3 specifica-
             tion for detailed Ethernet timing information.
7.5.1        EQUIVALENT TEST LOAD
Output timing specifications assume the 25pF equivalent test load illustrated in Figure 7-1 below, unless otherwise
specified.

7.5.2        POWER SEQUENCE TIMING
Power supplies must adhere to the following rules:
• All power supplies of the same voltage must be powered up/down together.
• There is no power-up sequencing requirement, however all power supplies must reach operational levels within
  the time periods specified in Table 7-15.
• There is no power-down sequencing or timing requirement, however the device must not be powered for an
  extended period of time without all supplies at operational levels.
• Following initial power-on, or if a power supply brownout occurs (i.e., one or more supplies drops below opera-
  tional limits), a power-on reset must be executed once all power supplies reach operational levels. Refer to Sec-
  tion 7.5.3, "Power-On Reset Timing," on page 43 for power-on reset requirements.
• With the exception of VBUS_DET, do not drive input signals without power supplied to the device.
  Note:      Violation of these specifications may damage the device.

7.5.3        POWER-ON RESET TIMING
Figure 7-3 illustrates the nRESET timing requirements in relation to power-on. A hardware reset (nRESET assertion) is
required following power-on. For proper operation, nRESET must be asserted for no less than trstia. The nRESET pin
can be asserted at any time, but must not be deasserted before tpurstd after all external power supplies have reached
operational levels.

7.6       Clock Circuit
The device can accept either a 25 MHz crystal (preferred) or a 25 MHz single-ended clock oscillator (±50 ppm) input. If
the single-ended clock oscillator method is implemented, XO should be left unconnected and XI should be driven with
a nominal 0-3.3V clock signal. The input clock duty cycle is 40% minimum, 50% typical and 60% maximum.
It is recommended that a crystal utilizing matching parallel load capacitors be used for the crystal input/output signals
(XI/XO). Either a 300uW or 100uW 25 MHz crystal may be utilized. The 300uW 25 MHz crystal specifications are
detailed in Section 7.6.1, "300uW 25 MHz Crystal Specification," on page 47. The 100uW 25 MHz crystal specifications
are detailed in Section 7.6.2, "100uW 25 MHz Crystal Specification," on page 48.

   Note 7-15     The maximum allowable values for Frequency Tolerance and Frequency Stability are application
                 dependent. Since any particular application must meet the IEEE ±50 PPM Total PPM Budget, the
                 combination of these two values must be approximately ±45 PPM (allowing for aging).
   Note 7-16     Frequency Deviation Over Time is also referred to as Aging.
   Note 7-17     The total deviation for the Transmitter Clock Frequency is specified by IEEE 802.3u as 
                 ±50 PPM.

Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
