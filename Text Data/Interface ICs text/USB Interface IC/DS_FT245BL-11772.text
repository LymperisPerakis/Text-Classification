The FT245BL is the lead free version of the 2nd generation of FTDI’s popular USB FIFO I.C. This device not only
adds extra functionality to its FT8U245AM predecessor and reduces external component count, but also maintains a
high degree of pin compatibility with the original, making it easy to upgrade or cost reduce existing designs as well as
increasing the potential for using the device in new application areas.

                                                                       FT245BL USB FIFO ( USB - Parallel ) I.C.
1.1 General Description
The FT245BL provides an easy cost-effective method of transferring data to / from a peripheral and a host P.C. at up
to 8 Million bits (1 Megabyte) per second. Its simple, FIFO-like design makes it easy to interface to any microcontroller
or microprocessor via IO ports.
To send data from the peripheral to the host computer, simply write the byte-wide data into the module when TXE# is
low. If the (384-byte) transmit buffer ﬁlls up or is busy storing the previously written byte, the device keeps TXE# high
in order to stop further data from being written until some of the FIFO data has been transferred over USB to the host.
TXE# goes high after every byte written.
When the host sends data to the peripheral over USB, the device will take RXF# low to let the peripheral know that at
least one byte of data is available. The peripheral can read a data byte every time RXF# goes low. RXF# goes high
after every byte read.
By using FTDI’s virtual COM port drivers, the peripheral looks like a standard COM port to the application software.
Commands to set the baud rate are ignored - the device always transfers data at its fastest rate regardless of the
application’s baud-rate setting. Alternatively, FTDI’s D2XX drivers allow application software to access the device
“directly” through a published DLL based API. Details of the current VCP and D2XX driver can be found on FTDI’s web
site ( http://www.ftdichip.com )

POWER CONTROL GROUP
 Pin#   Signal      Type  Description
 10     PWREN#      OUT   Goes Low after the device is conﬁgured via USB, then high during USB suspend.
                          Can be used to control power to external logic using a P-Channel Logic Level
                          MOSFET switch. Enable the Interface Pull-Down Option in EEPROM when using
                          the PWREN# pin in this way.
 11     SI / WU     IN    The Send Immediate / WakeUp signal combines two functions on a single pin. If
                          USB is in suspend mode (PWREN# = 1) and remote wakeup is enabled in the
                          EEPROM , strobing this pin low will cause the device to request a resume on the
                          USB Bus. Normally, this can be used to wake up the Host PC.
                          During normal operation (PWREN# = 0), if this pin is strobed low any data in the
                          device TX buffer will be sent out over USB on the next Bulk-IN request from the
                          drivers regardless of the pending packet size. This can be used to optimise USB
                          transfer speed for some applications. Tie this pin to VCCIO if not used.
MISCELLANEOUS SIGNAL GROUP
 Pin#   Signal      Type  Description
 4      RESET#      IN    Can be used by an external device to reset the FT245BL. If not required, tie to
                          VCC.
 5      RSTOUT#     OUT   Output of the internal Reset Generator. Stays high impedance for ~ 5ms after
                          VCC > 3.5V and the internal clock starts up, then clamps its output to the 3.3V
                          output of the internal regulator. Taking RESET# low will also force RSTOUT# to
                          drive low. RSTOUT# is NOT affected by a USB Bus Reset.
 27     XTIN        IN    Input to 6MHz Crystal Oscillator Cell. This pin can also be driven by an external
                          6MHz clock if required. Note : Switching threshold of this pin is VCC/2, so if
                          driving from an external source, the source must be driving at 5V CMOS level or
                          a.c. coupled to centre around VCC/2.
 28     XTOUT       OUT   Output from 6MHz Crystal Oscillator Cell. XTOUT stops oscillating during USB
                          suspend, so take care if using this signal to clock external logic.
 31     TEST        IN    Puts device in I.C. test mode – must be tied to GND for normal operation.

 Pin#      Signal        Type       Description
 6         3V3OUT        OUT        3.3 volt Output from the integrated L.D.O. regulator This pin should be decoupled
                                    to GND using a 33nF ceramic capacitor in close proximity to the device pin. Its
                                    prime purpose is to provide the internal 3.3V supply to the USB transceiver cell
                                    and the RSTOUT# pin. A small amount of current (<= 5mA) can be drawn from
                                    this pin to power external 3.3V logic if required.

 13        VCCIO         PWR        +3.0 volt to +5.25 volt VCC to the FIFO interface pins 10..12, 14..16 and 18..25.
                                    When interfacing with 3.3V external logic in a bus powered design connect
                                    VCCIO to a 3.3V supply generated from the USB bus. When interfacing with
                                    3.3V external logic in a self powered design connect VCCIO to the 3.3V supply
                                    of the external logic. Otherwise connect to VCC to drive out at 5V CMOS level.

Note 1 : In Input Mode, these pins are pulled to VCCIO via internal 200K resistors. These can be programmed to
gently pull low during USB suspend ( PWREN# = “1” ) by setting this option in the EEPROM.
Note 2: During device reset, these pins are tri-state but pulled up to VCCIO via internal 200K resistors.
Note 3: During device reset, these pins are tri-state but pulled up to VCC via internal 200K resistors.

The FT245BL is supplied in a 32 pin lead free LQFP package as standard. This package has a 7mm x 7mm body
( 9mm x 9mm including leads ) with leads on a 0.8mm pitch. The above drawing shows the LQFP-32 package – all
dimensions are in millimetres. Note that there are two date code formats used - XXYY = Date Code where XX = 1 or 2
digit year number, YY = 2 digit week number); or XYY-1 where X = 1 digit year number, YY = 2 digit week number.
The FT245BL is fully compliant with the European Union RoHS directive.
An alternative 5mm x 5mm leadless QFN is also available for projects where package area is critical. Part number
for this version is FT245BQ. The FT245BQ is also a lead free package. See the seperate datasheet for package
dimensions.

Figure 4 illustrates how to use the FT245BL with a 3-Pin Ceramic Resonator. A suitable part would be a ceramic
resonator from Murata’s CERALOCK range. (Murata Part Number CSTCR6M00G15), or equivalent. 3-Pin ceramic
resonators have the load capacitors built into the resonator so no external loading capacitors are required. This
makes for an economical conﬁguration. The accuracy of this Murata ceramic resonator is +/- 0.1% and it is speciﬁcally
designed for USB full speed applications. A 1 MOhm loading resistor across XTIN and XTOUT is recommended in
order to guarantee this level of accuracy.
Other ceramic resonators with a lesser degree of accuracy ( typically +/- 0.5% ) are technically outwith the USB
speciﬁcation, but it has been calculated that using such a device will work satisfactorily in practice with a FT245BL
design.
Figure 5 illustrates how to use the FT245BL with a 6MHz Crystal or 2-Pin Ceramic Resonator. In this case, these
devices do not have in-built loading capacitors so these have to be added between XTIN, XTOUT and GND as
shown. A value of 27pF is shown as the capacitor in the example – this will be good for many crystals and some
resonators but do select the value based on the manufacturers recommendations wherever possible. If using a crystal,
use a parallel cut type. If using a resonator, see the previous note on frequency accuracy.

                                                           and the device will detect an invalid command or no EEPROM

There are two varieties of these EEPROM’s on the market – one is conﬁgured as being 16 bits wide, the other is
conﬁgured as being 8 bits wide. These are available from many sources such as Microchip, ST Micro, ISSI etc. The
FT245BL requires EEPROM’s with a 16-bit wide conﬁguration such as the Microchip 93LC46B device. The EEPROM
must be capable of reading data at a 1Mb clock rate at a supply voltage of 4.35V to 5.25V. Most available parts are
capable of this.
Check the manufacturers data sheet to ﬁnd out how to connect pins 6 and 7 of the EEPROM. Some devices specify
these as no-connect, others use them for selecting 8 / 16 bit mode or for test functions. Some other parts have their
pinout rotated by 90o so please select the required part and its options carefully.
It is possible to “share” the EEPROM between the FT245BL and another external device such as an MCU. However,
this can only be done when the FT245BL is in its reset condition as it tri-states its EEPROM interface at that time. A
typical conﬁguration would use four bits of an MCU IO Port. One bit would be used to hold the FT245BL reset (using
RESET#) on power-up, the other three would connect to the EECS, EESK and EEDATA pins of the FT245BL in
order to read / write data to the EEPROM at this time. Once the MCU has read / written the EEPROM, it would take
RESET# high to allow the FT245BL to conﬁgure itself and enumerate over USB.

Figure 7 illustrates a typical USB bus powered conﬁguration. A USB Bus Powered device gets its power from the USB
bus. Basic rules for USB Bus power devices are as follows –
a) On plug-in, the device must draw no more than 100mA
b) On USB Suspend the device must draw no more than 500uA.
c) A Bus Powered High Power Device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use the PWREN# pin to keep the
    current below 100mA on plug-in and 500uA on USB suspend.
d) A device that consumes more than 100mA can not be plugged into a USB Bus Powered Hub
e) No device can draw more that 500mA from the USB Bus.
The power descriptor in the EEPROM should be programmed to match the current draw of the device.
A Ferrite Bead is connected in series with USB power to prevent noise from the device and associated circuitry (EMI)
being radiated down the USB cable to the Host. The value of the Ferrite Bead depends on the total current required by
the circuit – a suitable range of Ferrite Beads is available from Steward (www.steward.com) for example Steward Part
# MI0805K400R-00 also available as DigiKey Part # 240-1035-1.

Figure 8 illustrates a typical USB self powered conﬁguration. A USB Self Powered device gets its power from its own
POWER SUPPLY and does not draw current from the USB bus. The basic rules for USB Self power devices are as
follows –
a) A Self-Powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB Host or Hub Controller is
     powered down.
b) A Self Powered Device can take as much current as it likes during normal operation and USB suspend as it has its
     own POWER SUPPLY.
c) A Self Powered Device can be used with any USB Host and both Bus and Self Powered USB Hubs
The USB power descriptor option in the EEPROM should be programmed to a value of zero (self powered).
To meet requirement a) the 1.5K pull-up resistor on USBDP is connected to RSTOUT# as per the bus-power circuit.
However, the USB Bus Power is used to control the RESET# Pin of the FT245BL device. When the USB Host or Hub
is powered up RSTOUT# will pull the 1.5K resistor on USB DP to 3.3V, thus identifying the device as a full speed
device to USB. When the USB Host or Hub power is off, RESET# will go low and the device will be held in reset. As
RESET# is low, RSTOUT# will also be low, so no current will be forced down USBDP via the 1.5K pull-up resistor
when the host or hub is powered down. Failure to do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up
erratically.
Note : When the FT245BL is in reset, the FIFO interface pins all go tri-state. These pins have internal 200K pull-up
resistors to VCCIO so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external logic.

Figure 9 shows how to conﬁgure the FT245BL to interface with a 3.3V logic device. In this example, a discrete
3.3V regulator is used to supply the 3.3V logic from the USB supply. VCCIO is connected to the output of the 3.3V
regulator, which in turn will cause the FIFO interface IO pins to drive out at 3.3V level. For USB bus powered circuits
some considerations have to be taken into account when selecting the regulator –
a) The regulator must be capable of sustaining its output voltage with an input voltage of 4.35 volts. A Low Drop Out
    (LDO) regulator must be selected.
b) The quiescent current of the regulator must be low in order to meet the USB suspend total current requirement of
    <= 500uA during USB suspend.
An example of a regulator family that meets these requirements is the MicroChip (Telcom) TC55 Series. These
devices can supply up to 250mA current and have a quiescent current of under 1uA.
In some cases, where only a small amount of current is required (< 5mA) , it may be possible to use the in-built
regulator of the FT245BL to supply the 3.3V without any other components being required. In this case, connect
VCCIO to the 3V3OUT pin of the FT245BL.
Note : It should be emphasised that the 3.3V supply for VCCIO in a bus powered design with a 3.3V logic interface
should come from an LDO which is supplied by USB bus, or from the 3V3OUT pin of the FT245BL, and not from any
other source.

Figure 10 is an example of a USB self powered design with 3.3V interface. In this case VCCIO is supplied by an
external 3.3V supply in order to make the device IO pins drive out at 3.3V logic level, thus allowing it to be connected
to a 3.3V MCU or other external logic. A USB self powered design uses its own power supplies, and does not draw
any of its power from the USB bus. In such cases, no special care need be taken to meet the USB suspend current
(0.5 mA) as the device does not get its power from the USB port.
As with bus powered 3.3V interface designs, in some cases, where only a small amount of current is required (<5mA),
it may be possible to use the in-built regulator of the FT245BL to supply the 3.3V without any other components being
required. In this case, connect VCCIO to the 3v3OUT pin of the FT245BL.
Note that if SI/WU is not being used it should be pulled up to VCCIO.

USB Bus powered circuits need to be able to power down in USB suspend mode in order to meet the <= 500uA total
suspend current requirement (including external logic). Some external logic can power itself down into a low current
state by monitoring the PWREN# pin. For external logic that cannot power itself down in that way, the FT245BL
provides a simple but effective way of turning off power to external circuitry during USB suspend.
Figure 11 shows how to use a discrete P-Channel Logic Level MOSFET to control the power to external logic
circuits. A suitable device could be a Fairchild NDT456P, or International Rectiﬁer IRLML6402, or equivalent. It is
recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1K series resistor and a 0.1 uF capacitor are used to limit the
current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit there is a danger that the transient power
surge of the MOSFET turning on will reset the FT245BL, or the USB host / hub controller. The values used here
allow attached circuitry to power up with a slew rate of ~12.5 V per millisecond, in other words the output voltage will
transition from GND to 5 V in approximately 400 microseconds.
Alternatively, a dedicated power switch I.C. with inbuilt “soft-start” can be used instead of a MOSFET. A suitable
power switch i.c. for such an application would be a Micrel (www.micrel.com) MIC2025-2BL or equivalent.
Please note the following points in connection with power controlled designs –
a) The logic to be controlled must have its own reset circuitry so that it will automatically reset itself when power is re-
    applied on coming out of suspend.
b) Set the Pull-down on Suspend option in the FT245BL’s EEPROM.
c) For USB high-power bus powered device (one that consumes greater than 100 mA, and up to 500 mA of current
    from the USB bus), the power consumption of the device should be set in the max power ﬁeld in the EEPROM.
    A high-power bus powered device must use this descriptor in the EEPROM to inform the system of its power
    requirements.
d) For 3.3V power controlled circuits VCCIO must not be powered down with the external circuitry (PWREN# gets
    its VCC supply from VCCIO). Either connect the power switch between the output of the 3.3V regulator and the
    external 3.3V logic OR if appropriate power VCCIO from the 3v3OUT pin of the FT245BL.

Figure 12 illustrates a typical interface between the FT245BL and a MicroController (MCU). This examples uses two
IO Ports of the MCU, one port (8 bits) to transfer data and the other port (4 / 5 bits) to monitor the TXE# and RXF#
status bits and generate the RD# and WR strobes to the FT245BL as required. Optionally, SI / WU can be connected
to another IO pin if this function is required. If the SI / WU function is not required, tie this pin of the FT245BL to
VCCIO. If the MCU is handling power management functions, then PWREN# should also be connected to an IO pin of
the MCU.
The 8 data bits of Port 1 can be shared with other peripherals when the MCU is not accessing the FT245BL.
