                  Rev. 2 — 4 March 2019                                      Product short data sheet
1. General description
              The NX20P3483UK is a product with combined multiple power switches and an LDO for
              USB PD application. The device includes a bidirectional high voltage power switch which
              supports both 20V sink and 6V source; a 5V power switch for source and a 100mA LDO
              provides power supply for dead battery operation.
              The high voltage power switch has 29V DC tolerance, and is able to sink up to 5A at
              maximum of 20V and source up to 3.4A at maximum of 6V. When it is configured as a
              high voltage sink switch, the path has overvoltage protection and reverse current
              protection features. While it is configured as high voltage source switch, the adjustable
              overcurrent limit circuit is integrated.
              The 5V power switch has an adjustable overcurrent limit, “ideal diode” feature and short
              circuit protection. The maximum current capability is 3.4A. It supports fast role swap for
              USB PD3.0 application.
              A VBUS discharge circuit is integrated according to USB PD VBUS discharging
              requirement. To minimize inrush current during normal startup, turn on slew rate control
              has been built in for all power switches. Over temperature protection is also equipped to
              automatically isolate the switch terminals when the device is overheated.
              The device is controlled through an I2C-bus interface, allowing the host to configure
              switches and program different specified parameters according to an I2C register map.
              The NX20P3483UK is offered with WLCSP42 package: 0.4mm pitch, 2.51 x 2.91 x
              0.525mm, 0.4mm pitch.
