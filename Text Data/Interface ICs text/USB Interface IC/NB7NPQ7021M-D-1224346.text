NB7NPQ7021M
3.3 V USB 3.1 Dual Channel
Linear Redriver
Description
   The NB7NPQ7021M is a 3.3 V dual channel redriver for USB 3.1
Gen 1 and USB 3.1 Gen 2 applications that supports both 5 Gbps and                        www.onsemi.com
10 Gbps data rates. Signal integrity degrades from PCB traces,
transmission cables, and inter−symbol interference (ISI). The
NB7NPQ7021M compensates for these losses by engaging varying                                                 MARKING
levels of equalization at the input receiver, and flat gain amplification                                    DIAGRAM
on the output transmitter. The Flat Gain and Equalization are                                                   NB7N
controlled by four level control pins. Each channel has a set of                    1                            7021
independent control pins to make signal optimization possible.                    UQFN16                        ALYWG

VCC Bus Requirements
Place the 100nF and
10uF capacitors to
ground on the VCC Bus
near the NB7NPQ7021M
to filter noise to the
VCC pins.
