STUSBCD01B                                                                    Functional description
3        Functional description
         The STUSBCD01B is designed to provide USB charger detection functionality to USB
         platforms which do not have this feature integrated in the PHY. The device can work with a
         supply voltage ranging from 2.2 V to 4.5 V and has an internal regulator which generates the
         1.8 V voltage required for the internal blocks and state machine.
         The STUSBCD01B can detect a dedicated charger or a Host/Hub charger connected to
         USB data lines and provides both an open drain pin and a digital I/O pin for the detection
         output signal. The open drain output can be disabled using the /OE input signal.
         Two different detection methods, selectable through the STATUS/METHOD pin, are
         implemented in order to distinguish between a dedicated charger and a Host/Hub charger. If
         the interface voltage is not present the detection method is defined by the status of default
         method pin.
         The STUSBCD01B features very low power consumption in Standby mode and low input
         capacitance on DP/DM pins. An over voltage protection circuit is also implemented on the
         VBUS pin in order to limit VBUS voltage to 6 V and provide protection to external devices
         connected to it.
3.1      Detection methods
         The STUSBCD01B implements a current source/sink method to detect dedicated chargers
         (wall chargers) and a current sink method for Host/Hub chargers (based on USB battery
         charging spec v1.0). If a standard Host/Hub is connected to the device it is recognized
         thanks to its pull-down resistors on DP/DM lines and therefore DETECT/STATUS outputs
         will be low.
3.2      Dedicated charger detection method
         Selected driving method pin low during the falling edge of shutdown or driving default
         method pin low if VIO is not present. The dedicated charger detection method uses a current
         source on DP pin and a current sink on DM pin to detect the resistor (max 200 Ω) which
         connects DP and DM in dedicated chargers.
3.3      Current sink method
         Selected driving method pin high during the falling edge of shutdown or driving default
         method pin high if VIO is not present. A voltage source of VDAT_SRC is connected to DP
         and a current of IDAT_SINK is drawn from DM.
         If a Host/Hub charger is connected, STUSBCD01B will see a voltage of VDAT_SRC on pin
         DM. The same happens if a dedicated charger is connected and, therefore, in order to
         distinguish between the two, if the current sink method detection is successful it is
         necessary to run the dedicated charger detection method immediately after.
                                                                                                   5/19


Functional description                                                                     STUSBCD01B
3.4         Detection triggering
            USB Charger detection automatically starts when VBUS voltage is over VTH_VBUS threshold
            and shutdown input is low.
            If VBUS drops under VTH_VBUS threshold or shutdown input is pulled high, the charger
            detection is immediately terminated.
            If no charger is detected (DETECT = 0 and /OE = 0), VBUS voltage is kept over VTH_VBUS
            threshold and VIO is not present then a new detection is started every 1 s.
            If a charger is detected, detect and status pins are kept high until VBUS drops under
            VTH_VBUS threshold or a new detection is started.
            Any hardware detection (VIO not present) is terminated as soon as VIO voltage rises above
            VTH_IO threshold.
3.5         VBUS clamping
            The STUSBCD01B features a built in over voltage protection circuit which prevents VBUS
            voltage from going over 6 V. The device is able to withstand continuous voltages of up to
            10 V applied to VBUS pin through an external resistor; in this case the clamping circuit limits
            the voltage to 6 V within 1 µs. A 470 Ω resistor in series between VBUS voltage and VBUS pin
            is required. Any external device needing VBUS over-voltage protection must be connected to
            STUSBCD01B's VBUS pin.
            Minimum input resistance for VBUS pin in normal operating conditions (up to ~ 5.3 V) is
            400 kΩ.
3.6         Internal regulator
            The STUSBCD01B has an internal regulator which outputs 1.8 V (nominal) to supply
            internal blocks. The regulator does not require any bypass capacitor for stability.
