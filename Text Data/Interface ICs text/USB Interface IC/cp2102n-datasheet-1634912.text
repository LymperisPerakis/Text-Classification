 2.1 Power
 In all cases, a 1 kΩ pull-up on the RSTb pin is recommended. This pull-up should be tied to VIO on devices that have it. On devices
 where VIO is connected to VDD or devices that do not have VIO, this pull-up should be tied to VDD. The RSTb pin will be driven low
 during power-on and power failure reset events.
 The figure below shows a typical connection diagram for the power pins of the CP2102N devices when the internal regulator is used
 and USB is connected (bus-powered).

second is the Input High Voltage (VIH) for VBUS to detect when the device is connected to a bus, which is defined as VIO – 0.6 V in
Table 3.7 GPIO on page 13. A resistor divider (or functionally-equivalent circuit) on VBUS is required to meet these specifications and
ensure reliable device operation. In this case, the current limitation of the resistor divider prevents high VBUS pin leakage current, even
though the VIO + 2.5 V specification is not strictly met while the device is not powered.

The figure below shows a typical connection self-powered diagram for the USB pins of the CP2102N devices including ESD protection
diodes on the USB pins.
Note: There are two relevant restrictions on the VBUS pin voltage in self-powered and bus-powered configurations. The first is the ab-
solute maximum voltage on the VBUS pin, which is defined as VIO + 2.5 V in Table 3.10 Absolute Maximum Ratings on page 15. The
second is the Input High Voltage (VIH) for VBUS to detect when the device is connected to a bus, which is defined as VIO – 0.6 V in
Table 3.7 GPIO on page 13. A resistor divider (or functionally-equivalent circuit) on VBUS is required to meet these specifications and
ensure reliable device operation. In this case, the current limitation of the resistor divider prevents high VBUS pin leakage current, even
though the VIO + 2.5 V specification is not strictly met while the device is not powered.

 Note:
    1. Includes supply current from internal LDO regulator, supply monitor, and internal oscillators. These power consumption numbers
       are only for the CP2102N and do not include an external RS232 transceiver or other external circuitry.
    2. USB Pull-up current should be added for total supply current. Normal and suspended supply current is current flowing into VRE-
       GIN.
    3. The USB Pull-up supply current values are calculated values based on USB specifications. USB Pull-up supply current is current
       flowing from VDD to GND through USB pull-down/pull-up resistors on D+ and D-.

4. Functional Description
4.1 USB Function Controller and Transceiver
The Universal Serial Bus function controller in the CP2102N is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with integrated transceiver and
on-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data transfers between the USB and the UART as well
as command requests generated by the USB host controller and commands for controlling the function of the UART.
The USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2102N device as well as external circuitry.
The CP2102N will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. On entering Suspend mode, the CP2102N
asserts the SUSPEND and SUSPENDb signals. SUSPEND and SUSPENDb are also asserted after a CP2102N reset until device con-
figuration during USB Enumeration is complete.
The CP2102N exits Suspend mode when any of the following occur:
   1. Resume signaling is detected or generated.
   2. A USB Reset signal is detected.
   3. A device reset occurs.
   4. USB Remote Wakeup functionality is enabled and the WAKEUP pin is grounded.
On exit of Suspend mode, the SUSPEND and SUSPENDb signals are de-asserted. Both SUSPEND and SUSPENDb temporarily float
high during a CP2102N reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pull-down (10 kΩ) can be used to ensure SUSPENDb remains
low during reset.
4.2 Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) Interface
The CP2102N UART interface consists of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the RTS, CTS, DSR, DTR, DCD,
and RI control signals. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR, and Xon/Xoff handshaking.
The UART is programmable to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port drivers are used, the data
format and baud rate are set during COM port configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers are used, the CP2102N is configured
through the USBXpress API. The data formats and baud rates available are listed in the table below.

4.2.1 Baud Rate Generation
The baud rate generator is very flexible, allowing the user to request any baud rate in the range from 300 baud to 3 Mbaud. If the baud
rate cannot be directly generated from the 48 MHz oscillator, the device will choose the closest possible option. The actual baud rate is
dictated by the following equations.
                                   48 MHz
Clock Divider =
                   2 × Prescale × Requested Baud Rate
                                   48 MHz
Actual Baud Rate =
                       2 × Prescale × Clock Divider
In both cases, the Prescale value is 4 if the Requested Baud Rate is ≤ 365 baud and 1 if the Requested Baud Rate value is > 365
baud.
Most baud rates can be generated with an error of less than 1.0%. A general rule of thumb for the majority of UART applications is to
limit the baud rate error on both the transmitter and the receiver to no more than ±2%. The Clock Divider value is rounded to the near-
est integer, which may produce an error source. Another error source will be the 48 MHz oscillator, which is accurate to ±0.25%. Know-
ing the actual and requested baud rates, the total baud rate error can be found using the equation below.
Baud Rate Error (%) = 100 × 1 –  (      Actual Baud Rate
                                      Requested Baud Rate   ) ± 0.25%
4.2.2 Sending Break Signaling
The CP2102N supports break signaling with an external 10k Ohm resistor between TXD and ground. This resistor is sufficient for break
signaling across all baud rates.
When a Send Break command is received, the CP2102N halts adding new data to the transmitter FIFO and will wait 6 byte times for in-
flight data to complete transmission. It will not process other USB transactions such as RX data reception or GPIO commands while
waiting - transactions will be processed once break is initiated. During this time, if enabled, the RS-485 signal will begin asserting. If
RTS TX Control is enabled, RTS will also begin asserting. Once the 6 byte time has expired, the CP2102N places the TXD line in a
high-impedance state - ignoring flow control status - and the external resistor pulls down TXD to initiate a break.
While sending break the TXT LED toggle is active. USB transactions including RX data reception and GPIO commands function nor-
mally.
When a Stop Break command is received, the CP2102N removes TXD from the high impedance state. It is held for 1 byte time to allow
for stabilization. After that time has expired the transmitter resumes normal operations, and the RS485 and RTS (if RTS TX Control is
enabled) signals wait the specified hold time.

4.3 Additional Features
4.3.1 General Purpose Input/Outputs (GPIO)
The CP2102N has up to 7 GPIO that can be controlled from the host. By default and during reset, these pins are set to open-drain with
a weak pull-up enabled and the port latch set to 1. The pins can be made push-pull to drive external circuitry like LEDs. In addition, the
state of these pins can be configured during standard operation, during Suspend, and immediately following reset.
Note: All pins temporarily float high during a device reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pull-down (10 kΩ) can be used to
ensure the pin remains low during reset.
The GPIO pins may also have alternate functions which are listed in the table below.

 Note:
    1. On QFN28 and QFN24 packages, the CLK signal is available on the same pin as RI.
By default, all of the GPIO pins are configured as a GPIO input. The speed of reading and writing the GPIO pins is subject to the timing
of the USB bus. GPIO pins configured as inputs or outputs are not recommended for real-time signaling.
More information regarding the configuration of these pins can be found in Xpress Configurator in Simplicity Studio and AN721: CP21xx
Device Customization Guide. Guidance on GPIO usage can be found in AN223: Runtime GPIO Control for CP210x.
4.3.2 Dynamic Suspend
By default, the latch values for all pins remains static during USB Suspend.
Alternatively, the dynamic suspend feature sets the pin latch to a predefined state when the CP2102N device moves from the config-
ured USB state to the suspend USB state (see chapter nine of USB 2.0 specification for more information on USB device states). When
the device exits the suspend USB state, the pin latch is restored to the previous value before entering the suspend state. Dynamic
Suspend is configured separately for the GPIO pins and UART/Modem Control pins.
4.3.3 Output Mode
Each pin has two options for the output mode: push-pull and open-drain.
By configuring for push-pull operation, a pin operates as a push-pull output. The output voltage is determined by pin’s latch value. This
type of output is most often used to connect directly to another device or drive external circuitry like an LED.
By configuring for open-drain operation, a pin operates as an open-drain output or input. The output voltage is determined by the pin's
latch value. If the pin latch value is 1, the pin is pulled up to VIO (or VDD if the device does not have a VIO pin) through an on-chip pull-
up resistor. Open-drain outputs are typically used when interfacing to logic at a higher voltage than the VIO pin. These pins can be
safely pulled to the higher, external voltage through an external pull-up resistor if VDD meets the 3.3 Absolute Maximum Ratings re-
quirements.

4.3.4 Battery Charging (CHREN, CHR0, and CHR1)
When battery charging is enabled, the D+/D- signals will detect the type of current source attached and set the CHREN, CHR0, and
CHR1 pins appropriately. CHREN enables 100 mA source current, CHR0 enables 500 mA source current, and CHR1 enables 1.5 A
source current.
The charging system may draw up to the limit specified by CHREN, CHR0, and CHR1. If the system also is operational while charging,
the current set points for the ISET resistors should be decreased based on how much the system could be using during battery charge.
When configuring a device to enable battery charging, the GPIO associated with the battery charging pins must also be configured cor-
rectly in Xpress Configurator as shown in the following table.

Note: Battery charging pins (CHREN, CHR1, CHR0) are disabled in Suspend only when using a Standard Data Port. If attached to a
Dedicated Charging Port or Charging Downstream Port, the battery charging pins are left on while in Suspend.
4.3.5 Remote Wakeup (WAKEUP)
The WAKEUP pin is an optional active low remote wakeup input. When the wakeup pin toggles from inactive to active (i.e. grounded)
and the CP2102N is in USB suspend, the CP2102N will begin the wakeup sequence.
Host software must enable USB remote wakeup for the device. In Windows, this is under Device Manager. To set this, right-click on the
device, select [Properties]>[Power Management] and enable the [Allow this device to wake the computer] feature.
4.3.6 Clock Output (CLK)
An optional clock output is available on CP2102N devices.
          48 MHz
F CLK =
           2×N
The valid values for N are 1 to 256.
Note: The clock output stops and is no longer present on the pin when the CP2102N device is in USB Suspend. This occurs when the
device is connected to USB and the host controller suspends the device (either through a feature like Selective Suspend or when the
host PC is in Hibernate or Sleep modes) or when the CP2102N is disconnected from the host in self-powered mode.

4.3.7 Hardware Handshaking (RTS and CTS)
To utilize the functionality of the RTS and CTS pins of the CP2102N, the device must be configured to use hardware flow control on the
USB host.
RTS, or Ready To Send, is an active-low output from the CP2102N and indicates to the external UART device that the CP2102N’s
UART RX FIFO has not reached the FLOW OFF watermark level of 448 bytes and is ready to accept more data. When the amount of
data in the RX FIFO reaches the watermark, the CP2102N pulls RTS high to indicate to the external UART device to stop sending data.
The CP2102N does not pull RTS low again until the UART RX FIFO is at the FLOW ON watermark level of 384 bytes (at least 128 free
bytes). This hysteresis allows for optimal operation. These RTS watermark levels are configurable using Xpress Configurator in Simplic-
ity Studio.
Note: RTS TX Control signaling is a special mode that asserts RTS while the CP2102N is transmitting. This mode is not available be-
low 300 baud. RTS hardware flow control works at all baud rates.
CTS, or Clear To Send, is an active-low input to the CP2102N and is used by the external UART device to indicate to the CP2102N
when the external UART device’s RX FIFO is getting full. The CP2102N will not send more than two bytes of data once CTS is pulled
high.
Hardware handshaking allows for optimal continuous transmission speeds at high baud rates (greater than 1 MBaud). The effective
throughput depends on USB bus loading and host USB stack efficiency. The typical maximum continuous bidirectional data transfer is

4.3.8 Software Handshaking
The CP2102N also supports software handshaking using the XON and XOFF event characters. The characters used for XON/XOFF is
set by the host software.
If the CP2102N receives an XOFF request, it will stop transmission, even if the CP2102N receiver needs to transmit an XOFF over
UART. This can potentially allow an overflow to occur or a deadlock condition if both the CP2102N and the connected UART device
transmit XOFF at the same time. The XOFF_CONTINUE setting allows the CP2102N transmitter to send XOFF/XON requests even if it
has received an XOFF request from the connected UART device. Once the connected UART device transmits XON, normal transmis-
sion from the CP2102N resumes.
Software handshaking uses the same watermark levels as hardware handshaking and can be configured dynamically by host software.
Watermark levels greater than 512 are converted to an XON limit of 192 bytes and an XOFF limit of 64 bytes. If the XON limit crosses
over the XOFF limit, the XON limit will automatically be modified to not cross over the XOFF limit. An XOFF limit of 0 is converted to 64
to guarantee buffer space is available until the UART end device stops transmission. When setting the XON and XOFF limits, it's rec-
ommended to use values where the XON limit added to the XOFF limit is less than 512 bytes, like 192/192 or 128/128. CP2102N
testing shows that the XON limit set to 192 and XOFF limit set to 192 provides optimal software flow control behavior.

4.3.9 Data Throughput Optimization
Effective throughput depends on several factors:
 •  CP2102N placement on the physical USB device tree
 •  USB bus load from other devices
 •  Host OS USB stack efficiency
 •  CP2102N configuration options
Handshaking is required at high baud rates (greater than 1 MBaud) to avoid receiver overrun. A request to stop transmission is only
initiated once the RX FIFO has reached the FLOW OFF watermark level. Once the USB bus lowers the RX FIFO level below the FLOW
ON watermark, a request to continue transmission is sent.
Hardware handshaking allows for optimal continuous transmission speeds at high baud rates. Using a Windows host PC, the
CP2102N's typical maximum continuous bidirectional throughput is > 450 kbytes/s at 3 Mbaud (> 70% efficiency).
Software handshaking using XON/XOFF transmission requires more overhead. Using a Windows host PC, the CP2102N's typical maxi-
mum continuous bidirectional throughput is > 330 kbytes/s at 3 Mbaud (> 55% efficiency).
For these performance numbers, the CP2102N is placed on a USB hub connected to the Windows host PC with a third party UART
adapter. The only significant USB traffic is generated by the USB to UART devices. The Windows host PC is running automated tests
with minimal CPU load.
Certain conditions will reduce the maximum throughput at high baud rates (> 1Mbaud):
 • Using DSR, DTR, or DCD handshaking signals lowers maximum performance. Use hardware CTS/RTS only for peak performance.
 • Embedded events or error character insertion requires free space in the UART RX FIFO to post events to the host. At high baud
    rates with continuous data reception, this space may not be available. Limit maximum baud rates with continuous data reception to 1
    MBaud when using embedded events or error character insertion to guarantee reception of events or the error character.
 • Transmitting an immediate character momentarily causes lower bidirectional throughput as the character forces a bypass of the cur-
    rent transmit FIFO. Once the character has been transmitted, the typical bidirectional throughput is restored.
Using Remote Wakeup, Charge Enable, Clock Out, or the GPIOs will not impact UART throughput.

The TX and RX LED toggle pins will toggle on and off at a fixed rate specified in Table 3.7 GPIO on page 13 whenever a byte is trans-
mitted or received by the CP2102N. These pins are logic high whenever a device is not transmitting or receiving data and can directly
drive basic LEDs within the device specification limits.

The modem control pins are enabled when requested on the host. If the Virtual COM Port drivers are used, the modem control pins are
enabled during COM port configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers are used, the CP2102N is configured through the USBX-
press API. The behavior of the modem control pins may vary between operating systems.

4.3.13 Receiver Timeout
The CP2102N supports a new custom vendor command to configure the internal buffer receive timeout. During normal operation, when
data is received the receive buffer waits up to 2 ms or 128 character times, whichever is fewer, before transferring data to host. This
timer is reset each time new data is received. For some usage models, this response time causes unwanted extra latency between
receiving a byte at the UART and the byte being available on the host. The Set Receiver Max Timeout custom vendor command allows
applications to set the timeout from .001 ms to 2 ms. Small values will cause the receiver to inefficiently use the 512 byte Receive
Buffer and should not be used at high data rates (greater than 230400).
4.4 Drivers
There are two sets of device drivers available for the CP2102N devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers and the USBXpress Direct
Access drivers. Only one set of drivers is necessary to interface with the device.
The latest drivers are available at www.silabs.com/interface-software.

4.4.1 Virtual COM Port (VCP) Drivers
The CP2102N Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2102N-based USB device to appear to the PC's application software
as a COM port. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2102N-based device as it would access a standard hardware
COM port. However, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2102N device is performed over the USB interface. Therefore,
existing COM port applications may be used to transfer data via the USB to the CP2102N-based device without modifying the applica-
tion. See AN197: Serial Communications Guide for the CP210x for Example Code for Interfacing to a CP2102N using the Virtual COM
drivers.
Note: Because the CP2102N uses a USB-based communication interface, timing will not be controllable or guaranteed as it is with a
standard COM port. Full-speed USB operates on 1 ms frames, and the host schedules packets for each USB device where it can in the
1 ms frame. It is recommended to use large data transfers when reading and writing from the host to send data as quickly as possible.
4.4.2 USBXpress Drivers
The Silicon Labs USBXpress drivers provide an alternate solution for interfacing with CP2102N devices. No serial port protocol exper-
tise is required. Instead, a simple, high-level application program interface (API) is used to provide simpler CP210x connectivity and
functionality. The USBXpress for CP210x Development Kit includes Windows device drivers, Windows device driver installer and unin-
stallers, and a host interface function library (host API) provided in the form of a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The USBXpress
driver set is recommended for new products that also include new PC software. The USBXpress interface is described in AN169:
USBXpress® Programmer's Guide.
4.4.3 Customization and Certification
In addition to customizing the device as described in 4.5 Device Customization, the drivers can be also be customized. See AN220:
USB Driver Customization for more information on generating customized VCP and USBXpress drivers.
The default drivers that are shipped with the CP2102N are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) certified. The certifica-
tion means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft and their latest operating systems will allow the drivers to be installed without
any warnings or errors. Some installations of Windows will prevent unsigned drivers from being installed at all. The customized drivers
that are generated using the AN220 software are not automatically certified. They must first go through the Microsoft Driver Reseller
Submission process. See AN807: Recertifying a Customized Windows HCK Driver Package for more information and contact Silicon
Labs support for assistance with this process.

4.5 Device Customization
The CP2102N includes an internal electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). This memory may be used to
customize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number and De-
vice Serial Number as desired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data
shown in the table below is used.

        Vendor ID (VID)          The Vendor ID is a four digit hexadecimal number that is                         0x10C4
                                 unique to a particular vendor. 0x10C4, for example, is the
                                 Silicon Labs Vendor ID.
        Product ID (PID)         The Product ID is a four digit hexadecimal number that                           0xEA60
                                 identifies the vendor's device. 0xEA60, for example, is the
                                 default Product ID for Silicon Labs' CP210x USB to UART
                                 Bridge devices.
           Power Mode            This setting determines whether the device is Bus-Pow-                     0x80 (Bus-Powered)
                                 ered, i.e. it is powered by the host, or Self-Powered, i.e. it
                                 is powered from a supply on the device.
            Max Power            This describes the maximum amount of power that the de-                            0x32
                                 vice will draw from the host in mA multiplied by 2. For ex-
                                 ample, 0x32 equates to 100 mA.
        Release Version          The Release Version is a binary-coded-decimal value that                          0x0100
                                 is assigned by the device manufacturer.
           Serial String         The Serial String is an optional string that is used by the     128-bit unique ID assigned by Silicon Labs
                                 host to distinguish between multiple devices with the same
                                 VID and PID combination. It is limited to 63 characters.
          Product String         The Product String is an optional string that describes the    "CP2102N USB to UART Bridge Controller"
                                 product. It is limited to 126 characters.
While customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended to customize the VID/PID combination. A unique
VID/PID combination will prevent the driver from conflicting with any other USB driver. A vendor ID can be obtained from http://
www.usb.org/ or Silicon Labs can provide a free PID for the OEM product that can be used with the Silicon Laboratories VID (http://
www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/request-PID.aspx).
If the OEM application supports multiple CP2102N-based devices attached to the same PC, each CP2102N must have a unique serial
number. By default, the CP2102N uses a unique 128 bit identifier as the serial number. Alternatively, sequential serial numbers can be
pre-programmed by Silicon Labs using settings provided by Xpress Configurator and delivered as a custom CP2102N part number.
These serial numbers can be unique per custom part number, or multiple part numbers can share the same group of sequential serial
numbers. For more details, see Xpress Configurator in Simplicity Studio.
The internal programmable ROM is programmed via the USB. This allows the OEM's USB configuration data and serial number to be
written to the CP2102N on-board ROM during the manufacturing and testing process. A simple GUI-based or command-line customiza-
tion utility for programming the internal programmable ROM is available from Silicon Labs as a part of Simplicity Studio or available
separately on the Silicon Labs website (www.silabs.com/interface-software).
The device parameters can be locked to prevent future modification on the CP2102N.
