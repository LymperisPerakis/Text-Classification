The Type 1 receivers of the ADN4691E/ADN4693E incorporate
25 mV of hysteresis. This ensures that slow changing signals or
a loss of input does not result in oscillation of the receiver output.
Type 1 receiver thresholds are ±50 mV; therefore, the state of the
receiver output is indeterminate if the differential between A and
B is about 0 V. This state occurs if the bus is idle (approximately 0 V
on both A and B), with no drivers enabled on the attached nodes.
