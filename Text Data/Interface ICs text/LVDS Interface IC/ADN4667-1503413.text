The transmitted signal develops a differential voltage of typi-

This is converted back to a TTL/CMOS logic level by an LVDS
receiver, such as the ADN4668.

  tSKD1 = |tPHLD − tPLHD| is the magnitude difference in differential propagation delay time between the positive going edge and the negative going edge of the
  same channel.
6
  tSKD2 is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event on the same device.
7
  tSKD3, differential part-to-part skew, is defined as the difference between the minimum and maximum specified differential propagation delays. This specification
  applies to devices at the same VCC and within 5°C of each other within the operating temperature range.
8
  tSKD4, part-to-part skew, is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event between devices. This specification applies to devices over recommended operating
  temperatures and voltage ranges, and across process distribution. tSKD4 is defined as |maximum − minimum| differential propagation delay.

  fMAX generator input conditions: tr = tf < 1 ns (0% to 100%), 50% duty cycle, 0 V to 3 V. Output criteria: duty cycle = 45% to 55%, VOD > 250 mV, all channels switching.

Pin No.    Mnemonic     Description
1          EN           Active High Enable and Power-Down Input (3 V TTL/CMOS). If EN is held low or open circuit, EN enables the
                        drivers when high and disables the drivers when low.
2          DIN1         Driver Channel 1 Logic Input.
3          DIN2         Driver Channel 2 Logic Input.
4          VCC          Power Supply Input. These parts can be operated from 3.0 V to 3.6 V. The supply should be decoupled with a
                        10 μF solid tantalum capacitor in parallel with a 0.1 μF capacitor to GND.
5          GND          Ground Reference Point for All Circuitry on the Part.
6          DIN3         Driver Channel 3 Logic Input.
7          DIN4         Driver Channel 4 Logic Input.
8          EN           Active Low Enable and Power-Down Input with Pull-Down (3 V TTL/CMOS). If EN is held high, EN enables the
                        drivers when low or open circuit and disables the drivers and powers down the device when high.
9          DOUT4−       Channel 4 Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN4 is high, current flows into DOUT4−. When DIN4 is low, current
                        flows out of DOUT4−.
10         DOUT4+       Channel 4 Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN4 is high, current flows out of DOUT4+. When DIN4 is low,
                        current flows into DOUT4+.
11         DOUT3+       Channel 3 Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN3 is high, current flows out of DOUT3+. When DIN3 is low,
                        current flows into DOUT3+.
12         DOUT3−       Channel 3 Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN3 is high, current flows into DOUT3−.When DIN3 is low, current
                        flows out of DOUT3−.
13         DOUT2−       Channel 2 Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN2 is high, current flows into DOUT2−. When DIN2 is low, current
                        flows out of DOUT2−.
14         DOUT2+       Channel 2 Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN2 is high, current flows out of DOUT2+. When DIN2 is low,
                        current flows into DOUT2+.
15         DOUT1+       Channel 1 Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN1 is high, current flows out of DOUT1+. When DIN1 is low,
                        current flows into DOUT1+.
16         DOUT1−       Channel 1 Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN1 is high, current flows into DOUT1−. When DIN1 is low, current
                        flows out of DOUT1−.
