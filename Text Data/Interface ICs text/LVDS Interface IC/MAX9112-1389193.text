Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

 Note 1:                    Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design. Devices are production tested at TA = +25°C.
 Note 2:                    By definition, current into the device is positive and current out of the device is negative. Voltages are referred to device
                            ground except VOD.
 Note                   3: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
 Note                   4: CL includes probe and fixture capacitance.
 Note                   5: Signal generator conditions for dynamic tests: VOL = 0, VOH = 3V, f = 20MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR ≤ 1ns, and tF
                            ≤ 1ns (0 to 100%).
 Note                   6: tSKD1 is the magnitude difference of differential propagation delays in a channel; tSKD1 = | tPHLD - tPLHD |.
 Note                   7: tSKD2 is the magnitude difference of the tPLHD or tPHLD of one channel and the tPLHD or tPHLD of the other channel on
                            the same device (MAX9112).
 Note                   8: tSKD3 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices at the same VCC and within 5°C
                            of each other.
 Note                   9: tSKD4 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over the rated supply
                            and temperature ranges.
 Note                   10: fMAX signal generator conditions: VOL = 0, VOH = +3V, frequency = 250MHz, tR ≤ 1ns, tF ≤ 1ns (0 to 100%) 50% duty
                            cycle. Transmitter output criteria: duty cycle = 45% to 55%, VOD ≥ 250mV.
