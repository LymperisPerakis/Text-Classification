  Output skew is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values of TPLHx within a device or the difference between the largest and smallest values of
  TPHLx within a device, whichever of the two is greater.

  Pulse skew is defined as the magnitude of the maximum difference between tPLH and tPHL for any channel of a device, that is, |tPHLx – tHLPx|.
4
  Part-to-part output skew is defined as the difference between the largest and smallest values of TPLHx across multiple devices or the difference between the largest and
  smallest values of TPHLx across multiple devices, whichever of the two is greater.
