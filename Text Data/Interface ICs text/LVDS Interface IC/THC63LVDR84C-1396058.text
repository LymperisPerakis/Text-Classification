“Absolute Maximum Ratings” are those values beyond which the safety of the device can not be guaranteed.
They are not meant to imply that the device should be operated at these limits. The tables of “Electrical
Characteristics Table4, 5, 6, 7” specify conditions for device operation.
“Absolute Maximum Rating” value also includes behavior of overshooting and undershooting.

Notes
1) Cable Connection and Disconnection
    Do not connect and disconnect the LVDS cable, when the power is supplied to the system.
2) GND Connection
   Connect each GND of the PCB which LVDS-Tx and THC63LVDR84C on it. It is better for EMI reduction
   to place GND cable as close to LVDS cable as possible.
3) Multi Drop Connection
   Multi drop connection is not recommended.

Reference Land Pattern
                                        Figure 16. Reference of Land Pattern
  The recommendation mounting method of THine device is reflow soldering.
  The reference pattern is using the calculation result on condition of reflow soldering.
Notes
This land pattern design is a calculated value based on JEITA ET-7501.
Please take into consideration in an actual substrate design about enough the ease of mounting, the intensity of
connection, the density of mounting, and the solder paste used, etc… The optimal land pattern size changes
with these parameters. Please use the value shown by the land pattern as reference data.
