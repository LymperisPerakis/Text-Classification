Description                                                                              www.onsemi.com
  The NB3L8504S is a differential 1:4 LVDS fanout buffer/translator
with OE control for each differential output. The differential inputs
which can be driven by either a differential or single−ended input, can                                          MARKING
accept various logic level standards such as LVPECL, LVDS, HSTL,                                                 DIAGRAM*
HCSL and SSTL. These signals are then translated to four identical                                               16
LVDS copies of the input up to 700 MHz. As such, the NB3L8504S is
                                                                                             TSSOP−16                 NB3L

Product parametric performance is indicated in the Electrical Characteristics for the listed test conditions, unless otherwise noted. Product
performance may not be indicated by the Electrical Characteristics if operated under different conditions.
NOTE: Device will meet the specifications after thermal equilibrium has been established when mounted in a test socket or printed circuit
          board with maintained transverse airflow greater than 500 lfpm. Electrical parameters are guaranteed only over the declared
          operating temperature range. Functional operation of the device exceeding these conditions is not implied. Device specification
          limit values are applied individually under normal operating conditions and not valid simultaneously.
4. Input pins open and output pins loaded with RL=100 W across differential.
5. LVDS outputs require 100 W receiver termination resistor between diff. pair. See Figure 14.
6. VOS max + ½ VOD max. Also see Figures 12 and 13.
7. VOS min − ½ VOD max. Also see Figures 12 and 13.
8. VIH, VIL, Vth, and VISE parameters must be complied with simultaneously.
9. Vth is applied to the complementary input when operating in single−ended mode.
10. VIHCMR max varies 1:1 with VDD, VIHCMR min varies 1:1 with GND.
11. VIHD, VILD, VID and VIHCMR parameters must be complied with simultaneously.
