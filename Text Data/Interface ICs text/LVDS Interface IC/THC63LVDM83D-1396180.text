 “Absolute Maximum Ratings” are those values beyond which the safety of the device can not be guaranteed.
 They are not meant to imply that the device should be operated at these limits. The tables of “Electrical
 Characteristics Table4, 5, 6, 7” specify conditions for device operation.
 “Absolute Maximum Rating” value also includes behavior of overshooting and undershooting.

 The graph indicates the range that the IC works normally under SS clock input operation.
 The results are measured with a typical sample on condition of +25Cº and 3.3V, therefore these
 values are for reference and do not guarantee the performance of a product under other
 circumstance.

 Notes
 1) Cable Connection and Disconnection
      Do not connect and disconnect the LVDS cable, when the power is supplied to the system.
 2) GND Connection
    Connect each GND of the PCB which THC63LVDM83D and LVDS-Rx on it.                     It is better for EMI
    reduction to place GND cable as close to LVDS cable as possible.
 3) Multi Drop Connection
    Multi drop connection is not recommended.

                     The recommendation mounting method of THine device is reflow soldering.
                    The reference pattern is using the calculation result on condition of reflow soldering.
 Notes
 This land pattern design is a calculated value based on JEITA ET-7501.
 Please take into consideration in an actual substrate design about enough the ease of mounting, the intensity of
 connection, the density of mounting, and the solder paste used, etc… The optimal land pattern size changes
 with these parameters. Please use the value shown by the land pattern as reference data.
