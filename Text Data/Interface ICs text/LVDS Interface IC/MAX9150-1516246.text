The MAX9150 low-jitter, 10-port, low-voltage differential      ♦ Ultra-Low 120psp-p (max) Total Jitter
signaling (LVDS) repeater is designed for applications           (Deterministic and Random)
that require high-speed data or clock distribution while
minimizing power, space, and noise. The device                 ♦ 100ps (max) Skew Between Channels
accepts a single LVDS input and repeats the signal at          ♦ Guaranteed 400Mbps Data Rate
10 LVDS outputs. Each differential output drives a total
of 50Ω, allowing point-to-point distribution of signals on     ♦ 60µA Shutdown Supply Current
transmission lines with 100Ω terminations on each end.         ♦ Conforms to EIA/TIA-644 LVDS Standard

and random) ensures reliable communication in high-
speed links that are highly sensitive to timing error,         ♦ Fail-Safe Circuit Sets Output High for Undriven
especially those incorporating clock-and-data recovery,          Inputs
or serializers and deserializers. The high-speed switch-

Supply current at 400Mbps is 160mA (max) and is
reduced to 60µA (max) in low-power shutdown mode.                                        Ordering Information
Inputs and outputs conform to the EIA/TIA-644 LVDS
standard. A fail-safe feature sets the outputs high when            PART                TEMP. RANGE          PIN-PACKAGE

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

          Note 1: Current-into-device pins is defined as positive. Current-out-of-device pins is defined as negative. All voltages are
                  referenced to ground, except VTH, VTL, VOD, and ΔVOD.
          Note 2: Guaranteed by design, not production tested.
          Note 3: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
          Note 4: CL includes scope probe and test jig capacitance.
          Note 5: Signal generator conditions, unless otherwise noted: frequency = 200MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR = 1ns, and tF =
                  1ns (0% to 100%).
          Note 6: Signal generator conditions for tJPP: VOD = 200mV, VOS = 1.2V, frequency = 200MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR = 1ns,
                  and tF = 1ns (0% to 100%. tJPP includes pulse (duty cycle) skew.
          Note 7: tSKOO is the magnitude difference in differential propagation delay between outputs for a same-edge transition.
          Note 8: tSKPP is the |MAX - MIN| differential propagation delay.
          Note 9: Device meets VOD and AC specifications while operating at fMAX.
