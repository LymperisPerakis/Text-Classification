LVDS Driver
Description
  The NBA3N011S is a Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS)
driver for low power and high data rate applications. The device
                                                                                         www.onsemi.com
accepts LVCMOS/TTL input and translates it to LVDS and is
designed to support data rates higher than 400 Mbps (200 MHz).
  The driver provides low EMI with a typical output swing of 350 mV.                                      MARKING
The device can be paired with its companion single line receiver                                          DIAGRAM

    Product parametric performance is indicated in the Electrical Characteristics for the listed test conditions, unless otherwise noted. Product
    performance may not be indicated by the Electrical Characteristics if operated under different conditions
6. |tPHLD − tPLHD|, is the magnitude difference in differential propagation delay time between the positive going edge and the negative going
    edge of the same channel.
7. Differential Part to Part Skew, is defined as the difference between the minimum and maximum specified differential propagation delays. This
    specification applies to devices at the same VDD and within 5°C of each other within the operating temperature range.
8. Part to part skew, is the differential channel to channel skew of any event between devices. This specification applies to devices over
    recommended operating temperature and voltage ranges, and across process distribution. tSKD2 is defined as |Max − Min| differential
    propagation delay.
9. fMAX Input Conditions: tr = tf < 1 ns (0% to 100%), Duty Cycle 50%, 0 V to 3 V. fMAX Output Conditions: VOD > 250 mV, Duty Cycle = 45%/55%
