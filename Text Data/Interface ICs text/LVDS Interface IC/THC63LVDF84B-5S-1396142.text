Note
1)Power On Sequence
  Power on LVDS-Tx after THC63LVDF84B(5S).
2)Cable Connection and Disconnection
  Don't connect and disconnect the LVDS cable, when the power is supplied to the system.
3)GND Connection
 Connect the each GND of the PCB which LVDS-Tx and THC63LVDF84B(5S) on it. It is better for EMI reduction to
place GND cable as close to LVDS cable as possible.
4)Multi Drop Connection
  Multi drop connection is not recommended.
