                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to GND
         except VTH, VTL, and VID.
Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and are guaranteed by design for TA = -40°C to +85°C, as specified.
Note 3: Short only one output at a time. Do not exceed the absolute maximum junction temperature specification.
Note 4: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and not production tested.
Note 5: CL includes scope probe and test jig capacitance.
Note 6: Pulse generator output conditions: tR = tF < 1ns (0% to 100%), frequency = 250MHz, 50% duty cycle, VOH = 1.3V, VOL = 1.1V.
Note 7: tSKD1 is the magnitude of the difference of differential propagation delays in a channel. tSKD1 = |tPHLD - tPLHD|.
Note 8: tSKD2 is the magnitude of the difference of the tPLHD or tPHLD of one channel and the tPLHD or tPHLD of the other channel on
         the same part.
Note 9: tSKD3 is the magnitude of the difference of any differential propagation delays between parts at the same VCC and within
         5°C of each other.
Note 10: tSKD4 is the magnitude of the difference of any differential propagation delays between parts operating over the rated
         supply and temperature ranges.
