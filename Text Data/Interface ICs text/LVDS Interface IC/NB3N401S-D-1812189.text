NB3N401S
3.3 V Quad Channel
Half‐Duplex M-LVDS
Driver Receiver
Description
   The NB3N401S is a 3.3 V supply Quad Multipoint Low Voltage                            www.onsemi.com
Differential Signals (M−LVDS) line drivers and receivers. The device
is TIA/EIA−899 compliant. The device offers the Type 1 receiver
threshold at 0.0 V and the Type 2 receiver threshold at 0.1 V.
The NB3N401S supports four independent Half Duplex bus
configurations.
   Each of the four sections has Pin (SEL) for selection of Type−1 and                             1 48
Type−2 receivers that detect the bus state with as little as 50 mV of

to 3.4 V. The Type−1 receivers have near zero thresholds (±50 mV)
and exhibit 25 mV of differential input voltage hysteresis to prevent
output oscillations with slowly changing signals or loss of input.                     MARKING DIAGRAM
Type−2 receivers include an offset threshold to provide a detectable
voltage under open-circuit, idle-bus, and other faults conditions.                        1

Stresses exceeding those listed in the Maximum Ratings table may damage the device. If any of these limits are exceeded, device functionality
should not be assumed, damage may occur and reliability may be affected.
1. Maximum ratings applied to the device are individual stress limit values (not normal operating conditions) and not valid simultaneously.
    If stress limits are exceeded device functional operation is not implied, damage may occur and reliability may be affected.
