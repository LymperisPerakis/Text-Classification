Please note: As part of the Fairchild Semiconductor integration, some of the Fairchild orderable part numbers
will need to change in order to meet ON Semiconductor’s system requirements. Since the ON Semiconductor
product management systems do not have the ability to manage part nomenclature that utilizes an underscore
(_), the underscore (_) in the Fairchild part numbers will be changed to a dash (-). This document may contain
device numbers with an underscore (_). Please check the ON Semiconductor website to verify the updated
device numbers. The most current and up-to-date ordering information can be found at www.onsemi.com. Please
email any questions regarding the system integration to Fairchild_questions@onsemi.com.

     Notes:
     1. The outputs of the transmitter or receiver remain in a high-impedance state until VCC reaches 2V.
     2. TxCLKOut± settles at a free-running frequency when the part is powered up, /PwrDn is HIGH, and the TxCLKIn
         is a steady logic level (LOW / HIGH / High-Impedance).

         either ± inputs are shorted to ground or VCC) with no other current/voltage sources (noise) applied. If the VID is still
         in the valid range (greater than 100mV) and VCM is in the valid range (0V to 2.4V), the input signal is still
         recognized and the part responds normally.

     Absolute Maximum Ratings
     Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may damage the device. The device may not function or be
     operable above the recommended operating conditions and stressing the parts to these levels is not recommended.
     In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions may affect device reliability.
     The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only.

     Note:
     6. Absolute maximum ratings are DC values beyond which the device may be damaged or have its useful life
         impaired. The datasheet specifications should be met, without exception, to ensure that the system design is
         reliable over its power supply, temperature, and output/input loading variables.
     Recommended Operating Conditions
     The Recommended Operating Conditions table defines the conditions for actual device operation. Recommended
     operating conditions are specified to ensure optimal performance to the datasheet specifications. Fairchild does not
     recommend exceeding them or designing to Absolute Maximum Ratings.

     9. The power supply current for both transmitter and receiver can vary with the number of active I/O channels.
     10. The 16-grayscale test pattern tests device power consumption for a “typical” LCD display pattern. The test

     Notes:
     11. Outputs of all transmitters stay in 3-STATE until power reaches 2V. Clock and data output begins to toggle 10ms
         after VCC reaches 3.0V and /PwrDn pin is above 1.5V.
     12. This output data pulse position works for both transmitters for TTL inputs, except the LVDS output bit mapping
         difference (see Figure 18). Figure 20 shows the skew between the first data bit and clock output. A two-bit cycle
         delay is guaranteed when the MSB is output from transmitter.
     13. This jitter specification is based on the assumption that PLL has a reference clock with cycle-to-cycle input jitter
         of less than 2ns.

     Notes:
     14. The power supply current for the receiver can vary with the number of I/O channels.
     15. Total channel latency from serializer to deserializer is (t + tTCCD) where t is a clock period.
     16. Receiver skew margin is defined as the valid sampling window after considering potential setup/hold time and
         minimum/maximum bit position.
     17. For the receiver with falling-edge strobe, the definition of setup/hold time is slightly different from the one with
         rising-edge strobe. The clock reference point is the time when the clock falling edge passes through 2V. For hold
         time tRHRC, the clock reference point is the time when falling edge passes through +0.8V.
     18. Total channel latency from serializer to deserializer is (t + tCCD) (2•t + tRCCD) where t is the clock period.
     19. Receiver skew margin is defined as the valid sampling window after considering potential setup/hold time and
         minimum / maximum bit position.

     Note:
     20. The worst-case test pattern produces a maximum toggling of digital circuits, LVDS I/O, and LVTTL/CMOS I/O.
         Depending on the valid strobe edge of the transmitter, the TxCLKIn can be rising or falling edge data strobe.

     Note:
     21. For the receiver with falling-edge strobe, the definition of setup/hold time is slightly different from the one with
         rising-edge strobe. The clock reference point is the time when the clock falling edge passes through 2V. For hold
         time tRHRC, the clock reference point is the time when falling edge passes through +0.8V.

     Note:
     25. Test setup considers no requirement for separation of RMS and deterministic jitter. Other hardware setups,
         such as Wavecrest boxes, can be used if no M1 software is available, but the test methodology in Figure 24
         should be followed.
                                  Figure 24. Timing Diagram of Transmitter Clock Input with Jitter
     Note:
     26. This jitter pattern is used to test the jitter response (clock out) of the device over the power supply range with
         worst jitter ±3ns (cycle-to-cycle) clock input. The specific test methodology is as follows:
     27. Switching input data TxIn0 to TxIn20 at 0.5MHz and the input clock is shifted to left -3ns and to the right +3ns
         when data is HIGH.
     28. The ±3ns cycle-to-cycle input jitter is the static phase error between the two clock sources. Jumping between two
         clock sources to simulate the worst-case of clock-edge jump (3ns) from graphical controllers. Cycle-to-cycle jitter
         at TxCLKOut pin should be measured cross VCC range with 100mV noise (VCC noise frequency <2MHz).
