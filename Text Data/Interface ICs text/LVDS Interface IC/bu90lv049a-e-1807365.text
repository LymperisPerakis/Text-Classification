        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
