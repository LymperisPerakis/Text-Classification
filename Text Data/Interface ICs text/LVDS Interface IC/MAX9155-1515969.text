                             General Description                                                                 Features

The MAX9155 is a low-voltage differential signaling             ♦ Tiny SC70 Package
(LVDS) repeater, which accepts a single LVDS input
and duplicates the signal at a single LVDS output. Its          ♦ Ultra-Low Jitter

the bus. The point-to-point connection between the                Inputs (Open, Terminated, or Shorted)
MAX9155 output and the destination IC, such as an
FPGA or ASIC, allows the destination IC to be located           ♦ Low 10mA Supply Current
at greater distances from the bus connector.                    ♦ Low 6mA Supply Current in Fail-Safe

0.6psRMS added random jitter ensure reliable commu-

timing errors, especially those incorporating clock-and-          Power-Down Mode

MAX9155’s switching performance guarantees a

guaranteeing 0.5ns minimum output transition time.
The MAX9155 has fail-safe circuitry that sets the output
                                                                                         Ordering Information

Note 1: All devices are 100% tested at TA = +25°C. Limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 2: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
         except VTH, VTL, VOD, and ∆VOD.
Note 3: Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 4: Signal generator output (unless otherwise noted): frequency = 100MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR = 1.5ns, and tF =
         1.5ns (0% to 100%).
Note 5: CL includes scope probe and test jig capacitance.
Note 6: Signal generator output for tDJ: VOD = 150mV, VOS = 1.2V, tDJ includes pulse (duty-cycle) skew.
Note 7: Signal generator output for tRJ: VOD = 150mV, VOS = 1.2V.
Note 8: tSKPP1 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over rated conditions
         at the same supply voltage, input common-mode voltage, and ambient temperature.
Note 9: tSKPP2 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over rated conditions.
Note 10: Device meets VOD DC specification and AC specifications while operating at fMAX.
Note 11: Jitter added to the input signal.
