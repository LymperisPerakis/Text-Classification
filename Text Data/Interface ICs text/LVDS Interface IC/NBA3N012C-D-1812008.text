7. |tPHLD − tPLHD|, is the magnitude difference in differential propagation delay time between the positive going edge and the negative going
    edge of the same channel.
8. Differential Part to Part Skew, is defined as the difference between the minimum and maximum specified differential propagation delays. This
    specification applies to devices at the same VDD and within 5°C of each other within the operating temperature range.
9. Part to part skew, is the differential channel to channel skew of any event between devices. This specification applies to devices over
    recommended operating temperature and voltage ranges, and across process distribution. tSKD2 is defined as |Max − Min| differential
    propagation delay.
