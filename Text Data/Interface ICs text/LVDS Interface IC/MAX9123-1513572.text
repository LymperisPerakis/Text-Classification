 (Note 11)
Note 1: Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are 100% tested
         at TA = +25°C.
Note 2: Currents into the device are positive, and current out of the device is negative. All voltages are referenced to ground except
         VOD.
Note 3: Guaranteed by correlation data.
Note 4: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 5: CL includes probe and jig capacitance.
Note 6: Signal generator conditions for dynamic tests: VOL = 0, VOH = 3V, f = 100MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR ≤ 1ns, tF ≤
         1ns (0% to 100%).
Note 7: tSKD1 is the magnitude difference of differential propagation delay. tSKD1 = |tPHLD - tPLHD|.
Note 8: tSKD2 is the magnitude difference of tPHLD or tPLHD of one channel to the tPHLD or tPLHD of another channel on the same
         device.
Note 9: tSKD3 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices at the same VCC and within 5°C
         of each other.
Note 10: tSKD4 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over the rated supply
         and temperature ranges.
Note 11: fMAX signal generator conditions: VOL = 0, VOH = 3V, f = 400MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR ≤ 1ns, tF ≤ 1ns (0% to
         100%). Transmitter output criteria: duty cycle = 45% to 55%, VOD ≥ 250mV.
