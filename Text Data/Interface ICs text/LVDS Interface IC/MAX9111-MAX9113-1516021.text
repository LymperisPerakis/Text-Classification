Note 1:    Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are production
           tested at TA = +25°C.
Note   2: Current into the device is defined as positive. Current out of the devices is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced
           to ground except VTH and VTL.
Note   3: Guaranteed by design, not production tested.
Note   4: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note   5: CL includes probe and test jig capacitance.
Note   6: fMAX generator output conditions: tR = tF < 1ns (0 to 100%), 50% duty cycle, VOH = 1.3V, VOL = 1.1V.
Note   7: tSKD1 is the magnitude difference of differential propagation delays in a channel. tSKD1 = |tPLHD - tPHLD|.
Note   8: tSKD2 is the magnitude difference of the tPLHD or tPHLD of one channel and the tPLHD or tPHLD of the other channel on
           the same device.
Note   9: tSKD3 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices at the same VCC and within 5°C
           of each other.
Note   10: tSKD4, is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over the rated supply
           and temperature ranges.
