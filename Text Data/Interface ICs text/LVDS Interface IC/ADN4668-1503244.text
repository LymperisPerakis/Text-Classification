  Current-into-device pins are defined as positive. Current-out-of-device pins are defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground, unless otherwise specified.
2
  All typicals are given for VCC = 3.3 V and TA = 25°C.
3
  VCC is always higher than the RINx+ and RINx− voltage. RINx− and RINx+ have a voltage range of −0.2 V to VCC − VID/2. However, to be compliant with ac specifications, the
  common voltage range is 0.1 V to 2.3 V.
4
  VCMR is reduced for larger VID. For example, if VID = 400 mV, VCMR is 0.2 V to 2.2 V. The fail-safe condition with inputs shorted is not supported over the common-mode
  range of 0 V to 2.4 V but is supported only with inputs shorted and no external common-mode voltage applied. VID up to VCC − 0 V can be applied to the RINx+/RINx−
  inputs with the common-mode voltage set to VCC/2. Propagation delay and differential pulse skew decrease when VID is increased from 200 mV to 400 mV. Skew
  specifications apply for 200 mV ≤ VID ≤ 800 mV over the common-mode range.
5
  Output short-circuit current (IOS) is specified as magnitude only; a minus sign indicates direction only. Only one output should be shorted at a time; do not exceed the
  maximum junction temperature specification.

  Channel-to-channel skew, tSKD2, is defined as the difference between the propagation delay of one channel and that of the others on the same chip with any event on
  the inputs.
4
  Part-to-part skew, tSKD3, is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event between devices. This specification applies to devices at the same VCC and within 5°C of
  each other within the operating temperature range.

  AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.

  Current-into-device pins are defined as positive. Current-out-of-device pins are defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground, unless otherwise specified.

  tSKD1 is the magnitude difference in the differential propagation delay time between the positive-going edge and the negative-going edge of the same channel.

  Part-to-part skew, tSKD4, is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event between devices. This specification applies to devices over the recommended
  operating temperature and voltage ranges and across process distribution. tSKD4 is defined as |maximum − minimum| differential propagation delay.

Pin No.   Mnemonic      Description
1         RIN1−         Receiver Channel 1 Inverting Input. When this input is more negative than RIN1+, ROUT1 is high. When this input is
                        more positive than RIN1+, ROUT1 is low.
2         RIN1+         Receiver Channel 1 Noninverting Input. When this input is more positive than RIN1−, ROUT1 is high. When this input
                        is more negative than RIN1−, ROUT1 is low.
3         RIN2+         Receiver Channel 2 Noninverting Input. When this input is more positive than RIN2−, ROUT2 is high. When this input
                        is more negative than RIN2−, ROUT2 is low.
4         RIN2−         Receiver Channel 2 Inverting Input. When this input is more negative than RIN2+, ROUT2 is high. When this input is
                        more positive than RIN2+, ROUT2 is low.
5         RIN3−         Receiver Channel 3 Inverting Input. When this input is more negative than RIN3+, ROUT3 is high. When this input is
                        more positive than RIN3+, ROUT3 is low.
6         RIN3+         Receiver Channel 3 Noninverting Input. When this input is more positive than RIN3−, ROUT3 is high. When this input
                        is more negative than RIN3−, ROUT3 is low.
7         RIN4+         Receiver Channel 4 Noninverting Input. When this input is more positive than RIN4−, ROUT4 is high. When this input
                        is more negative than RIN4−, ROUT4 is low.
8         RIN4−         Receiver Channel 4 Inverting Input. When this input is more negative than RIN4+, ROUT4 is high. When this input is
                        more positive than RIN4+, ROUT4 is low.
9         EN            Active-Low Enable and Power-Down Input with Pull-Down (3 V TTL/CMOS). When EN is held high, EN enables the
                        receiver outputs when EN is low or open circuit and puts the receiver outputs into a high impedance state and
                        powers down the device when EN is high.
10        ROUT4         Receiver Channel 4 Output (3 V TTL/CMOS). If the differential input voltage between RIN4+ and RIN4− is positive, this
                        output is high. If the differential input voltage is negative, this output is low.
11        ROUT3         Receiver Channel 3 Output (3 V TTL/CMOS). If the differential input voltage between RIN3+ and RIN3− is positive, this
                        output is high. If the differential input voltage is negative, this output is low.
12        GND           Ground Reference Point for All Circuitry on the Part.
13        VCC           Power Supply Input. These parts can be operated from 3.0 V to 3.6 V.
14        ROUT2         Receiver Channel 2 Output (3 V TTL/CMOS). If the differential input voltage between RIN2+ and RIN2− is positive, this
                        output is high. If the differential input voltage is negative, this output is low.
15        ROUT1         Receiver Channel 1 Output (3 V TTL/CMOS). If the differential input voltage between RIN1+ and RIN1− is positive, this
                        output is high. If the differential input voltage is negative, this output is low.

                        receiver outputs when EN is high and puts the receiver outputs into a high impedance state and powers down
                        the device when EN is low.
