Supply current at 800Mbps is 118mA and reduces to
2µA in power-down mode. LVDS inputs and outputs con-
form to the ANSI/EIA/TIA -644 standard. A fail-safe fea-
ture on the MAX9153 sets the output high when the input
is undriven and open, terminated, or shorted. The
MAX9153/MAX9154 are available in a 28-pin TSSOP
