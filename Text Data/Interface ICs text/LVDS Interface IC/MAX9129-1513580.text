device is designed to drive a heavily loaded multipoint                                ♦ 1ns (0% to 100%) Minimum Transition Time
bus with controlled transition times (1ns 0% to 100%                                     Reduces Reflections

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

 (Note 10)
Note 1: Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are 100% tested
         at TA = +25°C.
Note 2: Current into the device is defined as positive, and current out of the device is defined as negative. All voltages are
         referenced to ground except VOD and ∆VOD.
Note 3: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 4: CL includes probe and jig capacitance.
Note 5: Signal generator conditions: VOL = 0, VOH = VCC, f = 100MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR = tF = 1ns (10% to 90%).
Note 6: tSKD1 is the magnitude difference of differential propagation delays. tSKD1 = | tPHLD - tPLHD |.
Note 7: tSKD2 is the magnitude difference of tPHLD or tPLHD of one channel to the tPHLD or tPLHD of another channel on the
         same device.
Note 8: tSKD3 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices at the same VCC and within 5°C
         of each other.
Note 9: tSKD4 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over the rated supply
         and temperature ranges.
Note 10: Signal generator conditions: VOL = 0, VOH = VCC, f = 100MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR = tF = 1ns (10% to 90%).
         MAX9129 output criteria: duty cycle = 45% to 55%, VOD ≥ 250mV, all channels switching.
