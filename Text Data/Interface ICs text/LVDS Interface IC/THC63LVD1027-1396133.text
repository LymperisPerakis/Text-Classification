1) LVDS input pin connection
    When LVDS line is not derived from the previous device, the line is pulled up to 3.3V internally in THC63LVD1027.
    This can cause violation of absolute maximum ratings to the previous LVDS Tx device whose operating condition is
    lower voltage power supply than 3.3V. This phenomenon may happen at power on phase of the whole system including
    THC63LVD1027. One solution for this problem is PD=L control during no LVDS input period because pull-up resistors
    are cut off at power down state.
                                       Figure 15. LVDS input pin connection
2) Power On Sequence
    Don’t input RCLK1+/- and RCLK2+/- before THC63LVD1027 is on in order to keep absolute maximum ratings.

3)Cable Connection and Disconnection
    Don’t connect and disconnect the LVDS cable, when the power is supplied to the system.
4)GND Connection
    Connect the each GND of the PCB which Transmitter, Receiver and THC63LVD1027 on it.
    It is better for EMI reduction to place GND cable as close to LVDS cable as possible.
5)Multi Drop Connection
    Multi drop connection is not recommended.
