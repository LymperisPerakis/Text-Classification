Please note: As part of the Fairchild Semiconductor integration, some of the Fairchild orderable part numbers
will need to change in order to meet ON Semiconductor’s system requirements. Since the ON Semiconductor
product management systems do not have the ability to manage part nomenclature that utilizes an underscore
(_), the underscore (_) in the Fairchild part numbers will be changed to a dash (-). This document may contain
device numbers with an underscore (_). Please check the ON Semiconductor website to verify the updated
device numbers. The most current and up-to-date ordering information can be found at www.onsemi.com. Please
email any questions regarding the system integration to Fairchild_questions@onsemi.com.

     Absolute Maximum Ratings
     Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may damage the device. The device may not function or be
     operable above the recommended operating conditions and stressing the parts to these levels is not recommended.
     In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions may affect device
     reliability. The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only.

     Notes:
     1. tSK(LH), tSK(HL) is the skew between specified outputs of a single device when the outputs have identical loads and
         are switching in the same direction.
     2. tSK(PP) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times between any specified terminals of two
         devices switching in the same direction (either LOW-to-HIGH or HIGH-to-LOW) when both devices operate with
         the same supply voltage, same temperature, and have identical test circuits.
