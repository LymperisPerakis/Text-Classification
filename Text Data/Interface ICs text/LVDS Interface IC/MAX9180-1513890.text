                                   Repeater in an SC70 Package
                            General Description                                                                  Features
                                                                                                                               MAX9180
The MAX9180 is a 400Mbps, low-voltage differential             ♦ Tiny SC70 Package
signaling (LVDS) repeater, which accepts a single
LVDS input and duplicates the signal at a single LVDS          ♦ Ultra-Low Jitter
output. Its low-jitter, low-noise performance makes it              23psP-P Added Deterministic Jitter
ideal for buffering LVDS signals sent over long dis-                (223 - 1 PRBS)
tances or noisy environments, such as cables and                    0.6psRMS Added Random Jitter
backplanes.
                                                               ♦ 0.5ns (min) Transition Time Minimizes Radiated
The MAX9180’s tiny size makes it especially suitable for         Noise
minimizing stub lengths in multidrop backplane appli-
cations. The SC70 package (half the size of a SOT23)           ♦ 400Mbps Guaranteed Data Rate
allows the MAX9180 to be placed close to the connec-           ♦ Fail-Safe Circuit Sets Output High for Undriven
tor, thereby minimizing stub lengths and reflections on          Inputs (Open, Terminated, or Shorted)
the bus. The point-to-point connection between the
MAX9180 output and the destination IC, such as an              ♦ Low 10mA Supply Current
FPGA or ASIC, allows the destination IC to be located          ♦ Low 6mA Supply Current in Fail-Safe
at greater distances from the bus connector.
                                                               ♦ Conforms to ANSI/EIA/TIA-644 LVDS Standard
Ultra-low, 23ps P-P added deterministic jitter and
0.6psRMS added random jitter ensure reliable commu-            ♦ High-Impedance Inputs and Outputs in
nication in high-speed links that are highly sensitive to        Power-Down Mode
timing errors, especially those incorporating clock-and-
data recovery, PLLs, serializers, or deserializers. The
MAX9180’s switching performance guarantees a
400Mbps data rate, but minimizes radiated noise by
guaranteeing 0.5ns minimum output transition time.                                       Ordering Information
The MAX9180 has fail-safe circuitry that sets the output                                                  PIN-        TOP

The MAX9180 operates from a single 3.3V supply and              MAX9180EXT-T         -40°C to +85°C       6 SC70-6   ABH

ture range. Refer to the MAX9129 data sheet for a quad

Note 1: All devices are 100% tested at TA = +25°C. Limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 2: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
         except VTH, VTL, VOD, and ∆VOD.
Note 3: Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 4: Signal generator output (unless otherwise noted): frequency = 200MHz, 50% duty cycle, RO = 50Ω, tR = 1.5ns, and tF =
         1.5ns (0% to 100%).
Note 5: CL includes scope probe and test jig capacitance.
Note 6: Signal generator output for tDJ: VOD = 150mV, VOS = 1.2V, tDJ includes pulse (duty-cycle) skew.
Note 7: Signal generator output for tRJ: VOD = 150mV, VOS = 1.2V.
Note 8: tSKPP1 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over rated conditions
         at the same supply voltage, input common-mode voltage, and ambient temperature.
Note 9: tSKPP2 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between devices operating over rated conditions.
Note 10: Device meets VOD DC specification and AC specifications while operating at fMAX.
Note 11: Jitter added to the input signal.
