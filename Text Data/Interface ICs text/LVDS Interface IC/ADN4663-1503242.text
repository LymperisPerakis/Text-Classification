4         GND         Ground reference point for all circuitry on the part.
5         DOUT2−      Channel 2 Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN2 is high, current flows into DOUT2−. When DIN2 is low, current
                      flows out of DOUT2−.
6         DOUT2+      Channel 2 Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN2 is high, current flows out of DOUT2+. When DIN2 is low,
                      current flows into DOUT2+.
7         DOUT1+      Channel 1 Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN1 is high, current flows out of DOUT1+. When DIN1 is low,
                      current flows into DOUT1+.
8         DOUT1−      Channel 1 Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN1 is high, current flows into DOUT1−. When DIN1 is low, current
                      flows out of DOUT1−.

receiver input is typically (1.2 V + [355 mV/2]) = 1.377 V, and
the inverting receiver input is (1.2 V − [355 mV/2]) = 1.023 V
for Logic 1. For Logic 0, the inverting and noninverting output
voltages are reversed. Note that because the differential voltage
reverses polarity, the peak-to-peak voltage swing across RT is
twice the differential voltage.
Current mode drivers offer considerable advantages over
voltage mode drivers such as RS-422 drivers. The operating
current remains fairly constant with increased switching
frequency, whereas that of voltage mode drivers increase
exponentially in most cases. This is caused by the overlap
as internal gates switch between high and low, which causes
currents to flow from the device power supply to ground.
