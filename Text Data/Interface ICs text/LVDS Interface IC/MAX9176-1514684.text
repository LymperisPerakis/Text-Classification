                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
