Maximum Operating Frequency            fMAX      All channels switching (Note 12)                 250                          MHz
Note 1:  Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
         except VTH, VTL, and VID.
Note 2: Devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and are guaranteed by design for TA = -40°C to +85°C as specified.
Note 3: Short only one output at a time. Do not exceed the absolute maximum junction temperature specification.
Note 4: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 5: CL includes scope probe and test jig capacitance.
Note 6: Pulse generator output conditions: tR = tF < 1ns (0% to 100%), frequency = 250MHz, 50% duty cycle, VOH = 1.3V, VOL =
         1.1V. High-impedance delay pulse generator output conditions: tR = tF < 3ns (0% to 100%), frequency = 1MHz, 50% duty
         cycle, VOH = 3V and VOL = 0.
Note 7: Propagation delay and differential pulse skew decrease when |VID| is increased from 200mV to 400mV. Skew specifications
         apply for 200mV ≤ |VID| ≤ 1.2V over the common-mode range VCM = |VID|/2 to VCC - |VID|/2.
Note 8: tSKD1 is the magnitude of the difference of differential propagation delays in a channel. tSKD1 = |tPHLD - tPLHD|.
Note 9: tSKD2 is the magnitude of the difference of the tPLHD or tPHLD of one channel and the tPLHD or tPHLD of any other channel
         on the same part.
Note 10: tSKD3 is the magnitude of the difference of any differential propagation delays between parts operating over rated conditions
         at the same VCC and within 5°C of each other.
Note 11: tSKD4 is the magnitude of the difference of any differential propagation delays between parts operating over rated conditions.
Note 12: 60% to 40% duty cycle, VOL = 0.4V (max), VOH = 2.7V (min), load = 15pF.
