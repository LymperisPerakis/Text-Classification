600 Mbps (300 MHz) and ultra-low power consumption.                                                         low power alternative to emitter-coupled logic (ECL) or positive

separation of input and output signals.
The device accepts low voltage TTL/CMOS logic signals and
converts them to a differential current output of typically
±3.1 mA for driving a transmission medium such as a twisted-
pair cable. The transmitted signal develops a differential voltage
of typically ±355 mV across a termination resistor at the receiv-
ing end, and this is converted back to a TTL/CMOS logic level
by a line receiver.

5         NC           No Connect. This pin should be left unconnected.
6         NC           No Connect. This pin should be left unconnected.
7         DOUT+        Noninverting Output Current Driver. When DIN is high, current flows out of DOUT+. When DIN is low, current flows into DOUT+.
8         DOUT−        Inverting Output Current Driver. When DIN is high, current flows into DOUT−. When DIN is low, current flows out of DOUT−.

around the receiver offset of 1.2 V. Therefore, the noninverting
receiver input for Logic 1 is typically (1.2 V + [355 mV/2]) =
1.377 V, and the inverting receiver input is (1.2 V − [355 mV/2])
= 1.023 V. For Logic 0, the inverting and noninverting output
voltages are reversed. Note that because the differential voltage
reverses polarity, the peak-to-peak voltage swing across RT is
twice the differential voltage.
Current-mode drivers offer considerable advantages over
voltage mode drivers such as RS-422 drivers. The operating
current remains fairly constant with increased switching
frequency, whereas the current of voltage mode drivers
increases exponentially in most cases. This is caused by the
overlap as internal gates switch between high and low, which
causes currents to flow from the device power supply to ground.
