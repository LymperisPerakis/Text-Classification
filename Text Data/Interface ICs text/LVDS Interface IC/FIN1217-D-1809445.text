Please note: As part of the Fairchild Semiconductor integration, some of the Fairchild orderable part numbers
will need to change in order to meet ON Semiconductor’s system requirements. Since the ON Semiconductor
product management systems do not have the ability to manage part nomenclature that utilizes an underscore
(_), the underscore (_) in the Fairchild part numbers will be changed to a dash (-). This document may contain
device numbers with an underscore (_). Please check the ON Semiconductor website to verify the updated
device numbers. The most current and up-to-date ordering information can be found at www.onsemi.com. Please
email any questions regarding the system integration to Fairchild_questions@onsemi.com.

     Notes:
     3. The outputs of the transmitter or receiver remain in a high-impedance state until VCC reaches 2V.
     4. Failsafe condition is defined as the input being terminated and un-driven, shorted, or open.
     5. If RxCLKIn± is removed prior to the RxIn± date being removed, RxOut is the last valid state. If RxIn± data is
         removed prior to RxCLKIn± being removed, RxOut is HIGH.

     Absolute Maximum Ratings
     Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may damage the device. The device may not function or be
     operable above the recommended operating conditions and stressing the parts to these levels is not recommended.
     In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions may affect device
     reliability. The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only.

     Notes:
     7. Positive current values refer to the current flowing into device and negative values means current flowing out of
         pins. Voltages are referenced to ground unless otherwise specified (except ΔVOD and VOD).
     8. The power supply current for both transmitter and receiver can be different with the number of active I/O
         channels.
     9. The 16-grayscale test pattern tests device power consumption for a “typical” LCD display pattern. The test

     Notes:
     11. Outputs of all transmitters stay in 3-STATE until power reaches 2V. Clock and data output begins to toggle
         10ms after VCC reaches 3V and /PwrDn pin is above 1.5V.
     12. This output data pulse position works for both transmitters with 21 TTL inputs, except the LVDS output bit
         mapping difference (see Figure 19). Figure 20 shows the skew between the first data bit and clock output. A
         two-bit cycle delay is guaranteed when the MSB is output from transmitter.
     13. This jitter specification is based on the assumption that PLL has a reference clock with cycle-to-cycle input jitter
         of less than 2ns.

     Typical values are at TA=25°C and with VCC=3.3V. Positive current values refer to the current flowing into device and
     negative values means current flowing out of pins. Voltages are referenced to ground unless otherwise specified
     (except ΔVOD and VOD). Minimum and maximum values are at over supply voltage and operating temperature ranges
     unless otherwise specified.

      Note: The worst-case test pattern produces a maximum toggling of digital circuits, LVDS I/O and LVTTL/CMOS I/O.
        Depending on the valid strobe edge of transmitter, the TxCLKIn can be either rising or failing edge data strobe.

     Note: tRSKM is the budget for the cable skew and source clock skew plus Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI).
           The minimum and maximum pulse position values are based on the bit position of each of the seven bits within
           the LVDS data stream across PVT (Process, Voltage Supply, and Temperature).

     Note: This jitter pattern is used to test the jitter response (clock out) of the device over the power supply range with
           worst jitter ±ns (cycle-to-cycle) clock input. The specific test methodology is as follows:
                        Switching input data TxIn0 to TxIn20 at 0.5MHz and the input clock is shifted to left -3ns and to
                         the right +3ns when data is HIGH (by switching between CLK1 and CLK2 in Figure 11).
                     The ±3ns cycle-to-cycle input jitter is the static phase error between the two clock sources.
                         Jumping between two clock sources to simulate the worst-case of clock edge jump (3ns) from
                         graphical controllers. Cycle-to-cycle jitter at TxCLK out pin should be measured cross VCC range
                         with 100mV noise (VCC noise frequency <2MHz).
