  AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
3
  Generator waveform for all tests, unless otherwise specified: f = 50 MHz, ZO = 50 Ω, tr ≤ 1 ns, and tf ≤ 1 ns.
4
  All input voltages are for one channel, unless otherwise specified. Other inputs are set to GND.
5
  tSKD1 = |tPHLD − tPLHD| is the magnitude difference in differential propagation delay time between the positive-going edge and the negative-going edge of the
  same channel.
6
  tSKD2 is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event on the same device.
7
  tSKD3, differential part-to-part skew, is defined as the difference between the minimum and maximum specified differential propagation delays. This specification
  applies to devices at the same VCC and within 5°C of each other within the operating temperature range.
8
  tSKD4, part-to-part skew, is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event between devices. This specification applies to devices over the recommended operating
  temperature and voltage ranges, and across process distribution. tSKD4 is defined as |maximum − minimum| differential propagation delay.

  fMAX generator input conditions: tr = tf < 1 ns (0% to 100%), 50% duty cycle, 0 V to 3 V. Output criteria: duty cycle = 45% to 55%, VOD > 250 mV, all channels switching.

The ADN4665 is a quad line driver for low voltage differential                      This is similar to emitter-coupled logic (ECL) and positive

it to a differential current output. The data can then be trans-                    current of ECL and PECL.

internal gates switch between high and low, which causes currents
to flow from the device power supply to ground. A current-mode
device simply reverses a constant current between its two outputs,
with no significant overlap currents.
