GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADN4666 is a quad-channel, CMOS low voltage differential                                                disable the receivers and switch the outputs to a high impedance
signaling (LVDS) line receiver offering data rates of over 400 Mbps                                         state. Consequently, the outputs of one or more ADN4666
(200 MHz) and ultralow power consumption.                                                                   devices can be multiplexed together to reduce the quiescent
The device accepts low voltage (350 mV typical) differential                                                power consumption to 10 mW typical.

  Current into device pins is defined as positive. Current out of device pins is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground, unless otherwise specified.
2
  All typical values are given for VCC = 3.3 V and TA = 25°C.
3
  VCC is always higher than the RINx+ and RINx− voltage. RINx− and RINx+ have a voltage range of −0.2 V to VCC − VID/2. However, to be compliant with ac specifications, the
  common-mode voltage range is 0.1 V to 2.3 V.
4
  VCMR is reduced for larger input differential voltage (VID). For example, if VID is 400 mV, VCMR is 0.2 V to 2.2 V. The fail-safe condition with inputs shorted is not supported
  over the common-mode range of 0 V to 2.4 V, but is supported only with inputs shorted and no external common-mode voltage applied. VID up to VCC − 0 V can be
  applied to the RINx+/RINx− inputs with the common-mode voltage set to VCC/2. Propagation delay and differential pulse skew decrease when VID is increased from 200 mV to
  400 mV. Skew specifications apply for 200 mV ≤ VID ≤ 800 mV over the common-mode range.
5
  Output short-circuit current (IOS) is specified as magnitude only; a minus sign indicates direction only. Note that only one output should be shorted at a time; do not
  exceed the maximum junction temperature specification (150°C).

  Generator waveform for all tests, unless otherwise specified: f = 1 MHz, ZO = 50 Ω, tTLH and tTHL (0% to 100%) ≤ 3 ns for RINx+/RINx−.
2
  AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
3
  All typical values are given for VCC = 3.3 V and TA = 25°C.
4
  Current into device pins is defined as positive. Current out of device pins is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground, unless otherwise specified.
5
  CL includes load and jig capacitance.
6
  tSKD1 is the magnitude difference in the differential propagation delay time between the positive-going edge and the negative-going edge of the same channel.
7
  Channel-to-channel skew, tSKD2, is defined as the difference between the propagation delay of one channel and that of the others on the same chip with any event on
  the inputs.
8
  tSKD3 part-to-part skew is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event between devices. The tSKD3 specification applies to devices at the same VCC and within
  5°C of each other within the operating temperature range.
9
  tSKD4 part-to-part skew is the differential channel-to-channel skew of any event between devices. The tSKD4 specification applies to devices over the recommended
  operating temperature and voltage ranges and across process distribution. tSKD4 is defined as |maximum − minimum| differential propagation delay.

THEORY OF OPERATION
The ADN4666 is a quad-channel line receiver for low voltage                      This is similar to emitter-coupled logic (ECL) and positive emitter-
differential signaling (LVDS). It takes a differential input signal              coupled logic (PECL), but without the high quiescent current of
of 350 mV typical and converts it into a single-ended, 3 V TTL/                  ECL and PECL.

The differential voltage is detected by the receiver and converted
