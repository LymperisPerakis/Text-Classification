                  Note 1: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
                          except VTH, VTL, and VID.
                  Note 2: Short only one output at a time. Do not exceed the absolute maximum junction temperature specification.
                  Note 3: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.

Keep the LVDS and any other digital signals separated

from each other to reduce crosstalk.
For LVDS applications, a four-layer PC board that pro-
vides separate power, ground, LVDS signals, and input
signals is recommended. Isolate the input LVDS signals
from each other to prevent coupling. Isolate the output
LVCMOS/LVTTL signals from each other to prevent
coupling. Separate the input LVDS signals from the out-
put signals planes with the power and ground planes
for best results.
