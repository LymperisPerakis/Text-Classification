Note 2: Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are production
        tested at TA = +25°C.
Note 3: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
        except VTH, VTL, and VID.
Note 4: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 5: CL includes scope probe and test jig capacitance.
Note 6: tSKD1 is the magnitude difference of differential propagation delays. tSKD1 = |tPHLD - tPLHD|.
Note 7: tSKD2 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between parts operating over rated conditions at
        the same VCC and within 5°C of each other.
Note 8: tSKD3 is the magnitude difference of any differential propagation delays between parts operating over rated conditions.
Note 9: fMAX pulse generator output conditions: rise time = fall time = 1ns (0% to 100%), 50% duty cycle, VOH = +1.3V, VOL = +1.1V.
        MAX9130 output criteria: 60% to 40% duty cycle, VOL = 0.25V max, VOH = 2.7V min, load = 15pF.

The MAX9130 requires an external termination resistor.
The termination resistor should match the differential
impedance of the transmission line. Termination resis-
tance is typically 100Ω but may range between 90Ω to
132Ω, depending on the characteristic impedance of                                         R1

When using the MAX9130, minimize the distance
