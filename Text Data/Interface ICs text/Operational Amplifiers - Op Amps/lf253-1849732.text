1. All voltage values, except differential voltage, are with respect to the zero reference level (ground) of the supply voltages
   where the zero reference level is the midpoint between VCC+ and VCC-.
2. The magnitude of the input voltage must never exceed the magnitude of the supply voltage or 15 volts, whichever is less.
3. Differential voltages are the non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal.
4. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating and destructive dissipation. Values are typical.
5. The output may be shorted to ground or to either supply. Temperature and/or supply voltages must be limited to ensure
   that the dissipation rating is not exceeded
6. Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a 1.5 kΩ resistor
   between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
7. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two pins of the
   device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
   while the other pins are floating.
8. Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then discharged directly
   to the ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.
