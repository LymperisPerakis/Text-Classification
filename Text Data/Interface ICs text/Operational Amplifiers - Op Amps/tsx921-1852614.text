Notes:
(1)
    Typical value is based on the Vio drift observed after 1000 h at 125 °C extrapolated to 25 °C using the Arrhenius law and
assuming an activation energy of 0.7 eV. The operational amplifier is aged in follower mode configuration (see Section 5.5: "Long
term input offset voltage drift").
(2)
   When used in comparator mode, with high differential input voltage, during a long period of time with VCC close to 16 V and
Vicm>VCC/2, Vio can experience a permanent drift of a few mV drift. This phenomenon is notably worse at low temperatures.

Notes:
(1)
    Typical value is based on the Vio drift observed after 1000 h at 125 °C extrapolated to 25 °C using the Arrhenius law and
assuming an activation energy of 0.7 eV. The operational amplifier is aged in follower mode configuration (see Section 5.5: "Long
term input offset voltage drift").
(2)
   When used in comparator mode, with high differential input voltage, during a long period of time with VCC close to 16 V and
Vicm>VCC/2, Vio can experience a permanent drift of a few mV drift. This phenomenon is notably worse at low temperatures.

Notes:
(1)
    Typical value is based on the Vio drift observed after 1000 h at 125 °C extrapolated to 25 °C using the Arrhenius law and
assuming an activation energy of 0.7 eV. The operational amplifier is aged in follower mode configuration (see Section 5.5: "Long
term input offset voltage drift").
(2)
   When used in comparator mode, with high differential input voltage, during a long period of time with VCC close to 16 V and
Vicm>VCC/2, Vio can experience a permanent drift of a few mV drift. This phenomenon is notably worse at low temperatures.

5         Application information
5.1       Operating voltages
          The TSX92x operational amplifiers can operate from 4 V to 16 V. The parameters are fully
          specified at 4.5 V, 10 V, and 16 V power supplies. However, parameters are very stable in
          the full VCC range. Additionally, main specifications are guaranteed in the extended
          temperature range from -40 to 125 °C.
5.2       Rail-to-rail input
          The TSX92x series is designed with two complementary PMOS and NMOS input
          differential pairs. The device has a rail-to-rail input and the input common mode range is
          extended from (VCC-) - 0.1 V to (VCC+) + 0.1 V. However, the performance of this device is
          clearly optimized for the PMOS differential pairs (which means from (V CC-) - 0.1 V to
          (VCC+) - 2 V).
          Beyond (VCC+) - 2 V, the operational amplifier is still functional but with downgraded
          performances (see Figure 19). Performances are still suitable for a large number of
          applications requiring the rail-to-rail input feature.
          The TSX92x operational amplifiers are designed to prevent phase reversal.
5.3       Input pin voltage range
          The TSX92x operational amplifiers have internal ESD diode protections on the inputs.
          These diodes are connected between the input and each supply rail to protect MOSFETs
          inputs from electrostatic discharges.
          Thus, if the input pin voltage exceeds the power supply by 0.5 V, the ESD diodes become
          conductive and excessive current could flow through them. To prevent any permanent
          damage, this current must be limited to 10 mA. This can be done by adding a resistor in
          series with the input pin (Figure 38: "Limiting input current with a series resistor"). The
          resistor value has to be calculated for a 10 mA current limitation on the input pins.

5.4         Input offset voltage drift over temperature
            The maximum input voltage drift over the temperature variation is defined as the offset
            variation related to offset value measured at 25 °C. The operational amplifier is one of the
            main circuits of the signal conditioning chain, and the amplifier input offset is a major
            contributor to the chain accuracy. The signal chain accuracy at 25 °C can be compensated
            during production at application level. The maximum input voltage drift over temperature
            enables the system designer to anticipate the effect of temperature variations.
            The maximum input voltage drift over temperature is computed using Equation 1.
            Equation 1
                                            ∆Vio       V T – Vio 25 °C
                                                 = max io
                                             ∆T                  T – 25 °C
            with T = -40 °C and 125 °C.
            The datasheet maximum value is guaranteed by a measurement on a representative
            sample size ensuring a Cpk (process capability index) greater than 2.
5.5         Long term input offset voltage drift
            To evaluate product reliability, two types of stress acceleration are used:
                  Voltage acceleration, by changing the applied voltage
                  Temperature acceleration, by changing the die temperature (below the maximum
                  junction temperature allowed by the technology) with the ambient temperature.
            The voltage acceleration has been defined based on JEDEC results, and is defined using
            Equation 2.
            Equation 2
                                                             β . V S – VU
                                                   AFV = e
            Where:
            AFV is the voltage acceleration factor
            β is the voltage acceleration constant in 1/V, constant technology parameter (β = 1)
            VS is the stress voltage used for the accelerated test
            VU is the voltage used for the application
            The temperature acceleration is driven by the Arrhenius model, and is defined in
            Equation 3.
            Equation 3

          k is the Boltzmann constant (8.6173 x 10 eV.K )
          TU is the temperature of the die when VU is used (K)
          TS is the temperature of the die under temperature stress (K)
          The final acceleration factor, AF, is the multiplication of the voltage acceleration factor and
          the temperature acceleration factor (Equation 4).
          Equation 4
                                                      AF = AFT × AFV
          AF is calculated using the temperature and voltage defined in the mission profile of the
          product. The AF value can then be used in Equation 5 to calculate the number of months of
          use equivalent to 1000 hours of reliable stress duration.
          Equation 5
                                    Months = AF × 1000 h × 12 months / 24 h × 365.25 days
          To evaluate the op amp reliability, a follower stress condition is used where VCC is defined
          as a function of the maximum operating voltage and the absolute maximum rating (as
          recommended by JEDEC rules).
          The Vio drift (in µV) of the product after 1000 h of stress is tracked with parameters at
          different measurement conditions (see Equation 6).
          Equation 6
                                           VCC = maxVop with Vicm = VCC 2
          The long term drift parameter (ΔVio), estimating the reliability performance of the product, is
          obtained using the ratio of the Vio (input offset voltage value) drift over the square root of
          the calculated number of months (Equation 7).
          Equation 7
                                                              Vio dr ift

          Where Vio drift is the measured drift value in the specified test conditions after 1000 h
          stress duration.

5.6         Capacitive load
            Driving a large capacitive load can cause stability issues. Increasing the load capacitance
            produces gain peaking in the frequency response, with overshooting and ringing in the step
            response. It is usually considered that with a gain peaking higher than 2.3 dB the op-amp
            might become unstable. Generally, the unity gain configuration is the worst configuration
            for stability and the ability to drive large capacitive loads. Figure 39: "Stability criteria with a
            serial resistor" shows the serial resistor (Riso) that must be added to the output, to make
            the system stable.

5.7       High-side current sensing
          TSX92x rail to rail input devices can be used to measure a small differential voltage on a
          high side shunt resistor and translate it into a ground referenced output voltage. The gain is
          fixed by external resistance.
                                   Figure 41: High-side current sensing configuration
          Vout can be expressed as follows:
          Equation 8

          Assuming that Rf2 = Rf1 = Rf and Rg2 = Rg1 = Rg, Equation 8 can be simplified as follows:
          Equation 9
                                                            Rf             Rf

          With the TSX92x operational amplifiers, the high side current measurement must be made
          by respecting the common mode voltage of the amplifier: (VCC-) - 0.1 V to (VCC+) + 0.1 V. If
          the application requires a higher common voltage please refer to the TSC high side current
          sensing family.

5.8         High-speed photodiode
            The TSX92x series is an excellent choice for current to voltage (I-V) conversions. Due to
            the CMOS technology, the input bias currents are extremely low. Moreover, the low noise
            and high unity-gain bandwidth of the TSX92x operational amplifiers make them particularly
            suitable for high-speed photodiode preamplifier applications.
            The photodiode is considered as a capacitive current source. The input capacitance, C IN,
            includes the parasitic input Common mode capacitance, CCM (3pF), and the input
            differential mode capacitance, CDIFF (8pF). CIN acts in parallel with the intrinsic capacitance
            of the photodiode, CD. At higher frequencies, the capacitors affect the circuit response. The
            output capacitance of a current sensor has a strong effect on the stability of the op-amp
            feedback loop.
            CF stabilizes the gain and limits the transimpedance bandwidth. To ensure good stability
            and to obtain good noise performance, CF can be set as shown in Equation 10.
            Equation 10
            where,
                  CIN = CCM + CDIFF = 11 pF
                  CDIFF is the differential input capacitance: 8 pF typical
                  CCM is the Common mode input capacitance: 3 pF typical
                  CD is the intrinsic capacitance of the photodiode
                  CSMR is the parasitic capacitance of the surface mount RF resistor: 0.2 pF typical
                  FGBP is the gain bandwidth product: 10 MHz at 16 V
            RF fixes the gain as shown in Equation 11.
            Equation 11
