Description
The MC3x172 series are dual bipolar operational                                           D
amplifiers offering both low consumption                                                 SO-8
(200 µA/Amp) and good speed (2.1 MHz, 2 V/µs).                               (Plastic micropackage)
Moreover, the input common mode range extends
down to the lower supply rail, allowing single
supply operation from +4 V to +44 V.

         2. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating and destructive dissipation. Values are typical.
         3. Human body model: A 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
            1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
            while the other pins are floating.
         4. Machine model: A 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
            two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
            connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
         5. Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
            discharged directly to the ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.
