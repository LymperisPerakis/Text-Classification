  Ground compatible inputs                       Description
  Low saturation voltage
                                                  The L2720W is a monolithic integrated circuit in
  Thermal shutdown                               SO16 (Wide) package, intended for use as a
  Clamp diode                                    power operational amplifier in a wide range of
                                                  applications including servo amplifiers and power
                                                  supplies.
                                                  It is particularly suitable for driving coils, inductive
                                                  loads and for use in motors.
                                                  The high gain and high output power capability
                                                  provide superior performance whenever an
                                                  operational amplifier/power booster combination
                                                  is required.
