          1. Either or both input voltages must not exceed the magnitude of VCC + or VCC-.
          2. Power dissipation must be considered to ensure maximum junction temperature (Tj) is not exceeded.
          3. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating and destructive dissipation.
          4. Rth are typical values.
          5. Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through
              a 1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
              while the other pins are floating.
          6. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
              two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
              connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
          7. Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
              discharged directly to ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.
