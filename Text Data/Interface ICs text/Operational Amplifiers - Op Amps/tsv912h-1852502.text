           Notes:
           (1)
               All voltage values, except the differential voltage, are with respect to the network ground terminal.
           (2)
               Differential voltages are the non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal.
           (3)
               VCC - Vin must not exceed 6 V.
           (4)
               Input current must be limited by a resistor in series with the inputs.
           (5)
               Rth are typical values.
           (6)
               Short-circuits can cause excessive heating and destructive dissipation.
           (7)
               Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a 1.5 kΩ
           resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations while the other
           pins are floating.
           (8)
               Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two
           pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of connected
           pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
           (9)
               Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
           discharged directly to the ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.

5.1         Driving resistive and capacitive loads
            These products are low-voltage, low-power operational amplifiers optimized to drive rather
            large resistive loads above 2 kΩ.
            In follower configuration, these operational amplifiers can drive capacitive loads up to
            100 pF with no oscillations. When driving larger capacitive loads, adding a small in-series
            resistor at the output can improve the stability of the devices (see Figure 19: "In-series
            resistor vs. capacitive load" for recommended in-series resistor values). Once the in-series
            resistor value has been selected, the stability of the circuit should be tested on the bench
            and simulated with the simulation model.

            For correct operation, it is advised to add 10 nF decoupling capacitors as close as possible
            to the power supply pins.
