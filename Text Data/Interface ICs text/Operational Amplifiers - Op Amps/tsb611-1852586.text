TSB611                                                                       Application information
3      Application information
3.1    Operating voltages
       The TSB611 operational amplifier can operate from 2.7 V to 36 V. The parameters are fully
       specified at 2.7 V, 12 V, and 36 V power supplies. However, parameters are very stable in
       the full Vcc range. Additionally, main specifications are guaranteed in the extended
       temperature range from -40 to 125 °C.
3.2    Input common-mode range
       The TSB611 has an input common-mode range that includes ground. The input common-
       mode range is extended from (VCC-) - 0.1 V to (VCC+) - 1 V.
3.3    Rail-to-rail output
       The operational amplifier's output levels can go close to the rails: 100 mV maximum below
       the positive rail and 110 mV maximum above the negative rail when connected to a 10 kΩ
       resistive load to VCC/2 for a power supply voltage of 36 V.
3.4    Input offset voltage drift over temperature
       The maximum input voltage drift variation over temperature is defined as the offset
       variation related to the offset value measured at 25 °C. The operational amplifier is one of
       the main circuits of the signal conditioning chain, and the amplifier input offset is a major
       contributor to the chain accuracy. The signal chain accuracy at 25 °C can be compensated
       during production at application level. The maximum input voltage drift over temperature
       enables the system designer to anticipate the effect of temperature variations.
       The maximum input voltage drift over temperature is computed using Equation 1.
       Equation 1
                                       ∆V io       V ( T ) – V io ( 25 °C )
                                             = ma x io
                                        ∆T              T – 25 °C
       Where T = -40 °C and 125 °C.
       The datasheet maximum value is guaranteed by measurements on a representative
       sample size ensuring a Cpk (process capability index) greater than 2.
3.5    Long term input offset voltage drift
       To evaluate product reliability, two types of stress acceleration are used:
       •    Voltage acceleration, by changing the applied voltage
       •    Temperature acceleration, by changing the die temperature (below the maximum
            junction temperature allowed by the technology) with the ambient temperature.
       The voltage acceleration has been defined based on JEDEC results, and is defined using
       Equation 2.

       To evaluate the op amp reliability, a follower stress condition is used where VCC is defined
       as a function of the maximum operating voltage and the absolute maximum rating (as
       recommended by JEDEC rules).
       The Vio drift (in µV) of the product after 1000 h of stress is tracked with parameters at
       different measurement conditions (see Equation 6).
       Equation 6
                                       V CC = maxV op with V icm = V CC / 2
       The long term drift parameter (ΔVio), estimating the reliability performance of the product, is
       obtained using the ratio of the Vio (input offset voltage value) drift over the square root of
       the calculated number of months (Equation 7).
       Equation 7
                                                        V io dr ift
                                             ∆V io =
                                                       ( month s )
       Where Vio drift is the measured drift value in the specified test conditions after 1000 h
       stress duration.
3.6    ESD structure of TSB611
       The TSB611 is protected against electrostatic discharge (ESD) with dedicated diodes (see
       Figure 35). These diodes must be considered at application level especially when signals
       applied on the input pins go beyond the power supply rails (VCC+ or VCC-). Current through
       the diodes must be limited to a maximum of 10 mA as stated in Table 1. A serial resistor or
       a Schottky diode can be used on the inputs to improve protection but the 10 mA limit of
       input current must be strictly observed.

3.7          Initialization time
             The TSB611 has a good power supply rejection ratio (PSRR), but as with all devices, it is
             recommended to use a 22 nF bypass capacitor as close as possible to the power supply
             pins. It prevents the noise present on the power supply impacting the signal conditioning. In
             addition, this bypass capacitor enhances the initialization time (see Figure 36 and Figure
             37).
