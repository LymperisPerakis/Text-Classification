Description
The MC33079 device is a monolithic quad
operational amplifier particularly well suited for                        Pin connections
audio applications.                                                           (top view)
It offers low voltage noise (4.5 nV/√Hz) and high
frequency performance (15 MHz gain bandwidth
product, 7 V/µs slew rate).
In addition the MC33079 device has a very low
distortion (0.002%) and excellent phase/gain
margins.
The output stage allows a large output voltage
swing and symmetrical source and sink currents.
