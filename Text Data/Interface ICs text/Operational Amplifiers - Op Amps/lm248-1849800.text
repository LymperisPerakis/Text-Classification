                                                              designed to provide functional characteristics
                                                              identical to those of the familiar UA741
                                                              operational amplifier. In addition, the total supply
                                                              current for all four amplifiers is compatible with

                                                              much less than those of a standard UA741. Also,
                                                              excellent isolation between amplifiers has been
                                                              achieved by independently biasing each amplifier
                                                              and using layout techniques which minimize

             supply voltage.

             simultaneously shorted as the maximum junction will be exceeded.
          3. Human body model: 100pF discharged through a 1.5kΩ resistor between two pins of the device, done for
             all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
          4. Machine model: a 200pF cap is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two pins
             of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5Ω), done for all couples of pin
             combinations with other pins floating.
          5. Charged device model: all pins plus package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
             discharged directly to the ground.
