      1. All voltage values are measured with respect to the ground pin.
      2. With two sides, two-plane PCB following the EIA/JEDEC JESD51-7 standard.
      3. Human body model: A 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
          1.5 kΩresistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
          while the other pins are left floating.
      4. Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
          discharged directly to the ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.
      5. Machine model: A 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
          two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
          connected pin combinations while the other pins are left floating.
      6. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating. Destructive dissipation can result from a short-circuit on one or
          two amplifiers simultaneously.

3           Application information
3.1         Exposed-pad package description
            The dual operational amplifier TS982 is housed in an SO-8 exposed-pad plastic package.
            As shown in Figure 40, the die is mounted and glued on a lead frame. This lead frame is
            exposed as a thermal pad on the underside of the package. The thermal contact is direct
            with the die and therefore, offers an excellent thermal performance in comparison with the
            common SO packages. The thermal contact between the die and the exposed-pad is
            characterized using the parameter Rthjc.
                                      Figure 40. Exposed-pad plastic package
            As 90% of the heat is removed through the pad, the thermal dissipation of the circuit is
            directly linked to the copper area soldered to the pad. In other words, the Rthja depends on
            the copper area and the number of layers of the printed circuit board under the pad.
                           Figure 41. TS982 test board layout - 6 cm2 of copper topside
3.2         Exposed-pad electrical connection
            In the SO-8 exposed-pad package, the silicon die is mounted on the thermal pad (see
            Figure 40). The silicon substrate is not directly connected to the pad because of the glue.
            Therefore, the copper area of the exposed-pad must be connected to the substrate voltage
            (VCC-) pin 4.

TS982                                                                      Application information
3.3   Thermal management benefits
      A good thermal design is important to maintain the temperature of the silicon junction below
      Tj = 150 °C as given in the absolute maximum ratings and also to maintain the operating
      power level.
      Another effect of temperature is that the life expectancy of an integrated circuit decreases
      exponentially when operating at high temperature over an extended period of time. It is
      estimated that, the chip failure rate doubles for every 10 to 20 °C. This demonstrates that
      reducing the junction temperature is also important to improve the reliability of the amplifier.
      Because of the high dissipation capability of the SO-8 exposed-pad package, the dual
      op amp TS982 has a lower junction temperature for high current applications in high
      ambient temperatures.
3.4   Thermal management guidelines
      The following guidelines are a simple procedure to determine the PCB you should use in
      order to get the best from the SO-8 exposed-pad package:
      1.   Determine the total power Ptotal to be dissipated by the IC.
           Ptotal = ICC x VCC + Vdrop1 x Iout1+ Vdrop2 x Iout2
           ICC x VCC is the DC power needed by the TS982 to operate with no load. Refer to
           Figure 1: Current consumption vs. supply voltage on page 7 to determine ICC versus
           VCC and versus temperature.
           The other terms are the power dissipated by the two operators to source the load. If the
           output signal can be assimilated to a DC signal, you can calculate the dissipated power
           using the voltage drop curves versus output current, supply voltage, and temperature
           (Figure 2 on page 7 to Figure 8 on page 8).
      2.   Specify the maximum operating temperature, (Ta) of the TS982.
      3.   Specify the maximum junction temperature (Tj) at the maximum output power. As
           discussed above, Tj must be below 150 °C and as low as possible for reliability
           considerations.
      Therefore, the maximum thermal resistance between junction and ambient Rthja is:
           Rthja = (Tj - Ta)/Ptotal
      Different PCBs can give the right Rthja for a given application. Figure 42 gives the Rthja of
      the SO-8 exposed pad versus the copper area of a top side PCB.

            45 °C/W by using two power planes and metallized holes.
3.5         Parallel operation
            Using the two amplifiers of the TS982 device in parallel mode provides a higher output
            current: 400 mA.
