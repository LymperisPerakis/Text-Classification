1. All voltage values, except differential voltage, are with respect to the zero reference level (ground) of the supply voltages
   where the zero reference level is the midpoint between VCC+ and VCC-.
2. The magnitude of the input voltage must never exceed the magnitude of the supply voltage or 15 volts, whichever is less.
3. Differential voltages are the non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal.
4. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating. Destructive dissipation can result from simultaneous short-circuits on all
   amplifiers.
5. Rth are typical values.
6. The output may be shorted to ground or to either supply. Temperature and/or supply voltages must be limited to ensure
   that the dissipation rating is not exceeded.
7. Human body model: 100 pF discharged through a 1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device, done for all couples of pin
   combinations with other pins floating.
8. Machine model: a 200 pF cap is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two pins of the device
   with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω), done for all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
9. Charged device model: all pins plus package are charged together to the specified voltage and then discharged directly to
   the ground.
