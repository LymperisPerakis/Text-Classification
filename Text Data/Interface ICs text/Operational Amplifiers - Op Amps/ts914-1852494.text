Description
The TS914 device is a rail-to-rail CMOS quad
operational amplifier designed to operate with a
single or dual supply voltage.
The input voltage range Vicm includes the two
supply rails VCC+ and VCC-.
The output reaches VCC- +50 mV, VCC+ -50 mV,
with RL = 10 kΩ, and VCC- +350 mV, VCC+ -
350 mV, with RL = 600 Ω.
This product offers a broad supply voltage
operating range from 2.7 to 16 V and a supply
current of only 200 μA/amp. (VCC = 3 V).
The source and sink output current capability is
typically 40 mA (at VCC = 3 V), fixed by an internal
limitation circuit.

          1. All voltage values, except differential voltage are with respect to network ground terminal.
          2. Differential voltages are the non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal.
          3. The magnitude of input and output voltages must never exceed VCC+ +0.3 V.
          4. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating. Destructive dissipation can result from simultaneous short-
             circuit on all amplifiers. These are typical values.
          5. Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
             1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
             while the other pins are floating.
          6. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
             two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
             connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
          7. Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
             discharged directly to ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.

4.1        Important note concerning this macromodel
           ●   All models are a trade-off between accuracy and complexity (that is, simulation time).
               Macromodels are not a substitute for breadboarding; rather, they confirm the validity of
               a design approach and help to select surrounding component values.
           ●   A macromodel emulates the nominal performance of a typical device within specified
               operating conditions (such as temperature or supply voltage, etc.). Thus, the
               macromodel is often not as exhaustive as the datasheet, its purpose is to illustrate the
               main parameters of the product.
           ●   Data derived from macromodels used outside of the specified conditions (such as VCC,
               or temperature) or even worse, outside of the device’s operating conditions (such as
               VCC or Vicm) is not reliable in any way.
           The values provided in Table 6 are derived from this macromodel.
