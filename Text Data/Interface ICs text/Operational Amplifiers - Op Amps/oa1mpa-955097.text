          1. All voltage values, except the differential voltage are with respect to the network ground terminal.
          2. The differential voltage is a non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal. The
             OA2MPA and OA4MPA devices include an internal differential voltage limiter that clamps internal
             differential voltage at 0.5 V.
          3. VCC - Vin must not exceed 6 V, Vin must not exceed 6 V.
          4. Input current must be limited by a resistor in series with the inputs.
          5. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating and destructive dissipation.
          6. Rth are typical values.
          7. Human body model: 100 pF discharged through a 1.5 kresistor between two pins of the device, done for
             all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
          8. Machine model: a 200 pF cap is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two
             pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 ), done for all couples of pin
             combinations with other pins floating.
          9. Charged device model: all pins plus package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
             discharged directly to ground.

1. See Section 4.4: Input offset voltage drift over temperature.
2. Typical value is based on the Vio drift observed after 1000h at 125 °C extrapolated to 25 °C using the Arrhenius law and
   assuming an activation energy of 0.7 eV. The operational amplifier is aged in follower mode configuration. See Section 4.5:
   Long-term input offset voltage drift.
3. Guaranteed by characterization.
4. Slew rate value is calculated as the average between positive and negative slew rates.
5. Initialization time is defined as the delay after power-up which guarantees operation within specified performances.
   Guaranteed by design. See Section 4.6: Initialization time.

Application information                                                                             OA1MPA, OA2MPA, OA4MPA
4           Application information
4.1         Operating voltages
            The OA1MPA, OA2MPA, and OA4MPA series of devices can operate from 1.5 V to 5.5 V.
            The parameters are fully specified for 1.8 V, 3.3 V, and 5 V power supplies. However, they
            are very stable in the full VCC range and several characterization curves show OA1MPA,
            OA2MPA, and OA4MPA device characteristics at 1.5 V. In addition, the main specifications
            are guaranteed in the extended temperature range from -40 °C to +125 °C.
4.2         Rail-to-rail input
            The OA1MPA, OA2MPA, and OA4MPA devices have a rail-to-rail input, and the input
            common mode range is extended from VCC-- 0.1 V to VCC+ + 0.1 V.
4.3         Rail-to-rail output
            The output levels of the OA1MPA, OA2MPA, and OA4MPA operational amplifiers can go
            close to the rails: to a maximum of 40 mV below the upper rail and to a maximum of 75 mV
            above the lower rail when a 10 k resistive load is connected to VCC/2.
4.4         Input offset voltage drift over temperature
            The maximum input voltage drift over the temperature variation is defined as the offset
            variation related to offset value measured at 25 °C. The operational amplifier is one of the
            main circuits of the signal conditioning chain, and the amplifier input offset is a major
            contributor to the chain accuracy. The signal chain accuracy at 25 °C can be compensated
            during production at application level. The maximum input voltage drift over temperature
            enables the system designer to anticipate the effect of temperature variations.
            The maximum input voltage drift over temperature is computed using Equation 1.
            Equation 1
             V io              V io  T  – V io  25C 
             ------------ = max -------------------------------------------------
                                                                                -
               T                            T – 25C
            with T = -40 °C and 125 °C.
            The datasheet maximum value is guaranteed by a measurement on a representative
            sample size ensuring a Cpk (process capability index) greater than 1.33.

4.5      Long-term input offset voltage drift
         To evaluate product reliability, two types of stress acceleration are used:
              Voltage acceleration, by changing the applied voltage
              Temperature acceleration, by changing the die temperature (below the maximum
               junction temperature allowed by the technology) with the ambient temperature.
         The voltage acceleration has been defined based on JEDEC results, and is defined using
         Equation 2.
         Equation 2
                       VS – VU 
          A FV = e
         Where:

         AF is calculated using the temperature and voltage defined in the mission profile of the
         product. The AF value can then be used in Equation 5 to calculate the number of months of

            To evaluate the op amp reliability, a follower stress condition is used where VCC is defined
            as a function of the maximum operating voltage and the absolute maximum rating (as
            recommended by JEDEC rules).
            The Vio drift (in µV) of the product after 1000 h of stress is tracked with parameters at
            different measurement conditions (see Equation 6).

             V CC = maxV op with V icm = V CC  2
            The long term drift parameter (Vio), estimating the reliability performance of the product, is
            obtained using the ratio of the Vio (input offset voltage value) drift over the square root of the
            calculated number of months (Equation 7).

4.6       Initialization time
          The OA1MPA, OA2MPA, and OA4MPA series of devices use a proprietary trimming
          topology that is initiated at each device power-up and allows excellent Vio performance to be
          achieved. The initialization time is defined as the delay after power-up which guarantees
          operation within specified performances. During this period, the current consumption (ICC)
          and the input offset voltage (Vio) can be different to the typical ones.
                                           Figure 22. Initialization phase
          The initialization time is VCC and temperature dependent. Table 7 sums up the
          measurement results for different supply voltages and for temperatures varying from -40 °C
          to 125 °C.

4.8         Macromodel
            Accurate macromodels of the OA1MPA, OA2MPA, and OA4MPA devices are available on
            the STMicroelectronics’ website at www.st.com. These model are a trade-off between
            accuracy and complexity (that is, time simulation) of the OA1MPA, OA2MPA, and OA4MPA
            op amp. They emulate the nominal performance of a typical device within the specified
            operating conditions mentioned in the datasheet. They also help to validate a design
            approach and to select the right op amp, but they do not replace on-board measurements.
