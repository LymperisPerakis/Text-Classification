The TL081, TL081A and TL081B are high-speed
JFET input single operational amplifiers
incorporating well matched, high-voltage JFET               Pin connections
and bipolar transistors in a monolithic integrated               (top view)
circuit.
The devices feature high slew rates, low input
bias and offset currents, and low offset voltage
temperature coefficient.

      1. All voltage values, except differential voltage, are with respect to the zero reference level (ground) of the
         supply voltages where the zero reference level is the midpoint between VCC+ and VCC-.
      2. The magnitude of the input voltage must never exceed the magnitude of the supply voltage or 15 volts,
         whichever is less.
      3. Differential voltages are the non-inverting input terminal with respect to the inverting input terminal.
      4. The output may be shorted to ground or to either supply. Temperature and/or supply voltages must be
         limited to ensure that the dissipation rating is not exceeded.
      5. Short-circuits can cause excessive heating and destructive dissipation.
      6. Rth are typical values.
      7. Human body model: 100 pF discharged through a 1.5kΩ resistor between two pins of the device, done for
         all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
      8. Machine model: a 200 pF cap is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two
         pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω), done for all couples of pin
         combinations with other pins floating.
      9. Charged device model: all pins plus package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
         discharged directly to the ground.
