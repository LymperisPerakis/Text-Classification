                                                      Description
                                                      The TS321 device is intended for cost-sensitive
                                                      applications where space-saving is of great
                                                      importance. This bipolar operational amplifier
                      SOT23-5
                                                      (op amp) offers the benefits of a reduced
                  (plastic package)
                                                      component size (SOT23-5 package) with
                                                      specifications that match (or are better than)
             Pin connections (top view)               industry standard devices (such as the popular
                                                      LM358A, LM324, and other similar devices). The
                                                      TS321 device has an input common mode range
                                                      (Vicm) that includes ground and therefore can be
                                                      employed in single supply applications.

            Notes:
            (1)
                Short-circuits from the output to VCC can cause excessive heating if VCC > 15 V. The maximum output
            current is approximately 40 mA independent of the magnitude of VCC.
            (2)
                This input current only exists when the voltage at any of the input leads is driven negative. It is due to the
            collector-base junction of the input PNP transistor becoming forward biased and thereby acting as input diodes
            clamps. In addition to this diode action, there is also NPN parasitic action on the IC chip. This transistor action
            can cause the output voltages of the op amp to go to the VCC voltage level (or to ground for a large overdrive)
            for the time during which an input is driven negative. This is not destructive and normal output is restored when
            the input voltage goes back above -0.3 V.
            (3)
                Short-circuits can cause excessive heating. Destructive dissipation can result from simultaneous
            short-circuits on all amplifiers. All values are typical.
            (4)
                Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
            1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
            while the other pins are floating.
            (5)
                Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two
            pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
            connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
            (6)
                Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
            discharged directly to ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.

    The direction of the input current is out of the IC. This current is essentially constant and independent of the state of the output.
Therefore, there is no change in the load on the input lines.

4.1      Important note concerning this macromodel
         Please not the following points before using this macromodel
         •    All models are a trade-off between accuracy and complexity (that is, simulation time)
         •    Macromodels are not a substitute for breadboarding, rather, they confirm the validity of
              a design approach and help to select surrounding component values.
         •    A macromodel emulates the nominal performance of a typical device within specified
              operating conditions (for example, temperature and supply voltage). Thus, the
              macromodel is often not as exhaustive as the datasheet. Its purpose is to illustrate the
              main parameters of the product.
         Data derived from macromodels used outside the specified conditions (for example, VCC
         and temperature) or even worse, outside of the device’s operating conditions (for example,
         VCC and Vicm), are not reliable in any way.
