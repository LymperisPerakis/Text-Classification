           Notes:
           (1)
               All voltage values, except the differential voltage, are with respect to the zero reference level (ground) of the
                                                                                            +          -
           supply voltages where the zero reference level is the midpoint between VCC and VCC .
           (2)
               The magnitude of the input voltage must never exceed the magnitude of the supply voltage or 15 volts,
           whichever is less.
           (3)
               Differential voltages are the non-inverting input terminal voltages with respect to the inverting input terminal.
           (4)
               Short-circuits can cause excessive heating. Destructive dissipation can result from simultaneous short-
           circuits on all amplifiers.
           (5)
               The output may be shorted to ground or to either supply. Temperature and/or supply voltages must be
           limited to ensure that the dissipation rating is not exceeded.
           (6)
               Human body model: 100 pF discharged through a 1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is
           done for all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
           (7)
               Machine model: a 200 pF cap is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two pins
           of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 W). This is done for all couples of pin
           combinations with other pins floating.
           (8)
               Charged device model: all pins plus package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
           discharged directly to the ground.
