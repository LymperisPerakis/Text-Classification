                                                       Description
                                                       This circuit consists of four independent, high-
                                                       gain operational amplifiers which have frequency
                                                       compensation implemented internally and are
                                                       designed especially for automotive and industrial
                                                       control systems.
                                                       The device operates from a single power supply
                                                       over a wide range of voltages. Operation from
                                                       split power supplies is also possible and the low
                                                       power supply current drain is independent of the
                                                       magnitude of the power supply voltage.
                                                       All the pins are protected against electrostatic
                                                       discharges up to 800 V.

        Notes:
        (1)                                       +
            Short-circuits from the output to VCC can cause excessive heating and potential destruction. The maximum
                                                                                         +
        output current is approximately 20 mA, independent of the magnitude of VCC
        (2)
            This input current only exists when the voltage at any of the input leads is driven negative. It is due to the
        collector-base junction of the input PNP transistor becoming forward biased and thereby acting as an input diode
        clamp. In addition to this diode action, there is also NPN parasitic action on the IC chip. This transistor action can
        cause the output voltages of the op amps to go to the VCC voltage level (or to ground for a large overdrive) for the
        time during which an input is driven negative. This is not destructive and normal output is restored for input
        voltages higher than -0.3 V.
        (3)
            Rthja/c are typical values.
        (4)
            Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a 1.5 kΩ
        resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations while the other
        pins are floating.
        (5)
            Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two
        pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of connected
        pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
        (6)
            Charged device model: all pins and the package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
        discharged directly to the ground through only one pin. This is done for all pins.

    The direction of the input current is out of the IC. This current is essentially constant, independent of the state of the output, so
there is no change in the load on the input lines.
(3)
    Due to the proximity of external components, ensure that stray capacitance does not cause coupling between these external
parts. Typically, this can be detected as this type of capacitance increases at higher frequencies.

7       Macromodel
        An accurate macromodel of the LM2902W is available on STMicroelectronics’ web site at
        www.st.com. This model is a trade-off between accuracy and complexity (that is, time
        simulation) of the LM2902W operational amplifiers. It emulates the nominal performances
        of a typical device within the specified operating conditions mentioned in the datasheet. It
        also helps to validate a design approach and to select the right operational amplifier, but it
        does not replace on-board measurements.
