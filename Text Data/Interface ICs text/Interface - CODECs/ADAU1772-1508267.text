Table 10. Pin Function Descriptions
Pin No.   Mnemonic                       Type 1       Description
1         SDA/MISO                       D_IO         I2C Data (SDA). This pin is a bidirectional open-collector. The line connected to this pin should have
                                                      a 2.0 kΩ pull-up resistor.
                                                      SPI Data Output (MISO). This SPI data output is used for reading back registers and memory locations.
                                                      It is tristated when an SPI read is not active.
2         SCL/SCLK                       D_IN         I2C Clock (SCL). This pin is always an open-collector input when the device is in I2C control mode.
                                                      When the device is in self-boot mode, this pin is an open-collector output (I2C master). The line
                                                      connected to this pin should have a 2.0 kΩ pull-up resistor.
                                                      SPI Clock (SCLK). This pin can either run continuously or be gated off between SPI transactions.
3         ADDR1/MOSI                     D_IN         I2C Address 1 (ADDR1).
                                                      SPI Data Input (MOSI).
4         ADDR0/SS                       D_IN         I2C Address 0 (ADDR0).
                                                      SPI Latch Signal (SS). This pin must go low at the beginning of an SPI transaction and high at the
                                                      end of a transaction. Each SPI transaction can take a different number of SCLK cycles to complete,
                                                      depending on the address and read/write bit that are sent at the beginning of the SPI transaction.
5         SELFBOOT                       D_IN         Self-Boot. Pull this pin up to IOVDD at power-up to enable the self-boot mode.
6         MICBIAS0                       A_OUT        Bias Voltage for Electret Microphone. Decouple with a 1 µF capacitor.
7         MICBIAS1                       A_OUT        Bias Voltage for Electret Microphone. Decouple with a 1 µF capacitor.
8         AIN0REF                        A_IN         ADC0 Input Reference. This reference pin should be ac-coupled to ground with a 10 µF capacitor.
9         AIN0                           A_IN         ADC0 Input.
10        AVDD                           PWR          1.8 V to 3.3 V Analog Supply. This pin should be decoupled to AGND with a 0.1 μF capacitor.
11        AGND                           PWR          Analog Ground. The AGND and DGND pins can be tied directly together in a common ground plane.
                                                      AGND should be decoupled to AVDD with a 0.1 μF capacitor.
12        CM                             A_OUT        AVDD/2 V Common-Mode Reference. A 10 μF to 47 μF decoupling capacitor should be connected
                                                      between this pin and ground to reduce crosstalk between the ADCs and DACs. The material of the
                                                      capacitors is not critical. This pin can be used to bias external analog circuits, as long as they are
                                                      not drawing current from CM (for example, the noninverting input of an op amp).

LAYOUT
Pin 24 is the AVDD supply for the headphone amplifiers. If the
headphone amplifiers are enabled, the PCB trace to this pin should
be wider than traces to other pins to increase the current carrying
capacity. A wider trace should also be used for the headphone
output lines.
GROUNDING
A single ground plane should be used in the application layout.
                                                                                                                                                      10804-088

CLKOUT SETTING SELECTION REGISTER
Address: 0x0007, Reset: 0x00, Name: CLKOUT_SEL
When Pin ADC_SDATA1/CLKOUT/MP6 is set to clock output mode, the frequency of the output clock is set here. CLKOUT can be used
to provide a master clock to another IC, the clock for digital microphones, or as the clock for the PDM output stream. The 12 MHz/24
MHz setting is used when clocking another IC, 3 MHz/6 MHz for PDMOUT, and 1.5 MHz/3 MHz when clocking digital microphones.
The CLKOUT frequency is derived from the master clock frequency, which is assumed to (and always should) be 12.288 MHz. The
12.288 MHz and 24.576 MHz output modes are not functional if PDM is enabled (Register PDM_OUT, Bits[1:0]).

These bits enable clocks to the digital filters and ASRC decimator filters of the ADCs. These bits must be enabled for all channels that will be used
in the design. To use the ADCs, these SINC_x_EN bits must be enabled along with the appropriate ADC_x_EN bits in the ADC_CONTROL2
and ADC_CONTROL3 registers. If the digital microphone inputs are used, the SINC_x_EN bits can be set without setting ADC_x_EN.
