  the IDT821024.
  Power-on Sequence and Master Clock Configuration
     To power on the IDT821024 users should follow this sequence:
     1. Apply ground;
     2. Apply VCC, finish signal connections;
     3. Set PDN1-4 pins high, thus all of the 4 channels are powered down;
     The master clock (MCLK) frequency of IDT821024 can be configured
  as 2.048 MHz, 4.096 MHz or 8.192 MHz. Using the Transmit Frame Sync
  (FSX) inputs, the device determines the MCLK frequency and makes the
  necessary internal adjustments automatically. The MCLK frequency must
  be an integer multiple of the Frame Sync frequency.
  Operating Modes
     There are two operating modes for each transmit or receive channel:
  standby mode (when the channel is powered down) and normal mode (when
  the channel is powered on). The mode selection of each channel is done
  by its corresponding PDN pin. When PDNn is 1, Channel N is in standby
  mode; when PDNn is 0, Channel N is in normal mode.
     In standby mode, all circuits are powered down with the analog outputs
  placed in high impedance state.
     In normal mode, each channel of the IDT821024 is able to transmit and
  receive both PCM and analog information. The normal mode is used when
  a telephone call is in progress.
  Companding Law Selection
     An A/μ pin is provided by IDT821024 for the companding law selection.
  When this pin is low, μ-law is selected; when the pin is high, A-law is
  selected.

  TRANSMISSION CHARACTERISTICS
    0dBm0 is defined as 0.6832Vrms for A-law and 0.6778 Vrms for A-law, both for 600 Ω load. Unless otherwise noted, the analog input is a 0 dBm0,
  1020 Hz sine wave; the input amplifier is set for unity gain. The digital input is a PCM bit stream equivalent to that obtained by passing a 0 dBm0, 1020
  Hz sine wave through an ideal encoder. The output level is sin(x)/x-corrected. Typical value are tested at VDD = 5V and TA = 25°C.
