・Notes for use
  (1) Absolute Maximum Ratings
       We are careful enough for quality control about this IC. So, there is no problem under normal operation,
       excluding that it exceeds the absolute maximum ratings. However, this IC might be destroyed when the
       absolute maximum ratings, such as impressed voltages or the operating temperature range, is exceeded, and
       whether the destruction is short circuit mode or open circuit mode cannot be specified. Pleases take into
       consideration the physical countermeasures for safety, such as fusing, if a particular mode that exceeds the
       absolute maximum rating is assumed.
  (2) GND Potential
       Make setting of the potential of the GND terminal so that it will be maintained at the minimum in any operating
       state.
  (3) Short circuit mode between terminals and wrong mounting
       In order to mount the IC on a set PCB, pay thorough attention to the direction and offset of the ICs. Erroneous
       mounting can destroy the IC. Furthermore, if a short circuit occurs due to foreign matters entering between
       terminals or between the terminal and the power supply or the GND terminal, the IC can destroy
  (4) Operation in supply voltage range
       Functional Circuit operation is guaranteed within operation ambient temperature, as long as it is within operation
       supply voltage range. The electrical characteristics standard value cannot be guaranteed.
       However, there is no drastic variation in these values, as long as it is within operation supply voltage
       range.
