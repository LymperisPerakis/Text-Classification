       6. Guaranteed by design. See Figure 2. RL and CL reflect the recommended minimum resistance and
            maximum capacitance required for the internal op-amp’s stability. CL affects the dominant pole of the
            internal output amp; increasing CL beyond 100 pF can cause the internal op-amp to become unstable.

4. APPLICATIONS
4.1     Recommended Power-Up Sequence
        1. Hold RESET low until the power supply, MCLK, and LRCK are stable. In this state, the Control Port is
             reset to its default settings.
        2. Bring RESET high. The device will remain in a low power state with the PDN bit set by default. The con-
             trol port will be accessible.
        3. The desired register settings can be loaded while the PDN bit remains set.
        4. Clear the PDN bit to initiate the power-up sequence.
4.2     System Clocking
        The CS4265 will operate at sampling frequencies from 4 kHz to 200 kHz. This range is divided into three
        speed modes as shown in Table 1.
                                               Mode             Sampling Frequency

                                      Double-Speed                    50-100 kHz
                                      Quad-Speed                     100-200 kHz

4.2.1     Master Clock
          MCLK/LRCK must maintain an integer ratio as shown in Table 2. The LRCK frequency is equal to Fs, the
          frequency at which audio samples for each channel are clocked into or out of the device. The FM bits (See
          “Functional Mode (Bits 7:6)” on page 38.) and the MCLK Freq bits (See “MCLK Frequency - Address 05h”
          on page 39.) configure the device to generate the proper clocks in Master Mode, and receive the proper
          clocks in Slave Mode. Table 2 illustrates several standard audio sample rates and the required MCLK and
          LRCK frequencies.

        In Slave Mode, SCLK and LRCK operate as inputs. The Left/Right clock signal must be equal to the sam-

        The serial bit clock, SCLK, must be synchronously derived from the master clock, MCLK, and be equal to
        128x, 64x, 48x or 32x Fs, depending on the desired speed mode. Refer to Table 4 for required clock ra-

4.3   High-Pass Filter and DC Offset Calibration
      When using operational amplifiers in the input circuitry driving the CS4265, a small DC offset may be driven
      into the A/D converter. The CS4265 includes a high-pass filter after the decimator to remove any DC offset
DS657F3                                                                                                          25


                                                                                                     CS4265
   which could result in recording a DC level, possibly yielding clicks when switching between devices in a mul-
   tichannel system.
   The high-pass filter continuously subtracts a measure of the DC offset fro m the output of the decimation
   filter. If the HPFFreeze bit (See “ADC High-Pass Filter Freeze (Bit 1)” on page 39.) is set during normal op-
   eration, the current value of the DC offset for the each channel is frozen and this DC offset will continue to
   be subtracted from the conversion result. This feature makes it possible to perform a system DC offset cal-
   ibration by:
   1. Running the CS4265 with the high-pass filter enabled until the filter settles. See the ADC Digital Filter
         Characteristics section for filter settling time.
   2. Disabling the high-pass filter and freezing the stored DC offset.
   A system calibration performed in this way will eliminate offsets anywhere in the signal path between the
   calibration point and the CS4265.

4.4   Analog Input Multiplexer, PGA, and Mic Gain
      The CS4265 contains a stereo 2-to-1 analog input multiplexer followed by a programmable gain amplifier
      (PGA). The input multiplexer is able to select either a line-level input source, or a mic-level input source, and
      route it to the PGA. The mic-level input passes through a +32 dB gain stage prior to the input multiplexer,
      allowing it to be used for microphone-level signals without the need for any external gain. The PGA stage
      provides 12 dB of gain or attenuation in 0.5 dB steps. Figure 11 shows the architecture of the input multi-
      plexer, PGA, and mic gain stages.

      tiplexer and mic gain. “Channel B PGA Control - Address 07h” on page 40 and “Channel A PGA Control -
      Address 08h” on page 40 outline the register settings necessary to control the PGA. By default, the line-
      level input is selected by the input multiplexer, and the PGA is set to 0 dB.
4.5   Input Connections
      The analog modulator samples the input at 6.144 MHz (MCLK=12.288 MHz). The digital filter will reject sig-
      nals within the stopband of the filter. However, there is no rejection for input signals               which are
      (n  6.144 MHz) the digital passband frequency, where n=0,1,2,... Refer to the Typical Connection Diagram
      for the recommended analog input circuit that will attenuate noise energy at 6.144 MHz. The use of capac-
      itors which have a lar ge voltage coefficient (such as ge neral-purpose ceramics) must be avoided since
      these can degrade signal linearity. Any unused analog input pairs should be left unconnected.
4.5.1    Pseudo-Differential Input
         The CS4265 implements a pseudo-differential input stage. The SGND input is intended to be used as a
         pseudo-differential reference signal. This feature allows for common mode noise rejection with single-

4.6   Output Connections
      The CS4265 DACs implement a switched-capacitor filter, followed by a continuous time low-pass filter. Its
      response, combined with tha t of the digital interpolator, is sh own in Section 8. “DAC Filter Plots” on
      page 48”. The recommended external analog circuitry is shown in the Typical Connection Diagram.
      The CS4265 DAC does not include phase or amplitude compensation for an external filter. Therefore, the
      DAC system phase and amplitude response is dependent on the external analog circuitry.
4.7   Output Transient Control
      The CS4265 uses Popguard® technology to minimize the effects of output transients during power-up and
      power-down. This technique eliminates the audio transients commonly produced by single-ended, single-
      supply converters when it is implemented with external DC-blocking capacitors connected in series with the
      audio outputs. To make best use of this feature, it is necessary to understand its operation.
4.7.1   Power-Up
        When the device is initially powered-up, the DAC outputs AOUTA and AOUTB are clamped to VQ, which
        is initially low. After the PDN bit is released (set to ‘0’), the outputs begin to ramp with VQ towards the
        nominal quiescent voltage. This ramp takes approximately 200 ms to complete. The gradual voltage
        ramping allows time for the external DC-blocking capacitors to charge to VQ, effectively blocking the qui-
        escent DC voltage. Audio output will begin after approximately 2000 sample periods.
4.7.2   Power-Down
        To prevent audio transients at power-down, the DC-blocking capacitors must fully discharge before turn-
        ing off the power. In order to do this, either the PDN should be set or the device should be reset about
        250 ms before removing power. During this time, the voltage on VQ and the DAC outputs will gradually
        discharge to GND. If power is removed before this 250 ms time period has passed, a transient will occur
        when the VA supply drops below that of VQ. There is no minimum time for a power cycle; power may be
        re-applied at any time.
4.7.3   Serial Interface Clock Changes
        When changing the clock ratio or sample rate, it is recommended that zero data (or near zero data) be
        present on the selected SDIN pin for at least 10 LRCK samples before the change is made. During the
28                                                                                                                    DS657F3


                                                                                                        CS4265
        clocking change, the DAC outputs will always be in a zero-data state. If non-zero serial audio input is
        present at the time of switching, a slight click or pop may be heard as the DAC output automatically goes
        to its zero-data state.
4.8   DAC Serial Data Input Multiplexer
      The CS4265 contains a 2-to-1 serial data input multiplexer. This allows two se parate data sources to be
      input into the DAC without the use of any external multiplexing components. “Section 6.6.1 “DAC SDIN
      Source (Bit 7)” on page 40” describes the control port settings necessary to control the multiplexer.
4.9   De-Emphasis Filter
      The CS4265 includes on-chip digital de-emphasis optimized for a sample rate of 44.1 kHz. The filter re-
      sponse is shown in Figure 13. The frequency response of the de-emphasis curve scales proportionally with
      changes in sample rate, Fs. Please see Section 6.3.3 “De-Emphasis Control (Bit 1)” on page 38 for de-em-
      phasis control.
      The de-emphasis feature is included to accommodate audio recordings that utilize 50/15 s pre-emphasis
      equalization as a means of noise reduction.
      De-emphasis is only available in Single-Speed Mode.

4.10  Internal Digital Loopback
      The CS4265 supports an internal digital loopback mode in which the output of the ADC is routed to the input
      of the DAC. This mode may be activated by setting the LOOP bit in the Signal Selection register (See “Signal
      Selection - Address 06h” section on page 40).
      When this bit is set, the status of the DAC_DIF[1:0] bits in register 03h will be disregarded by the CS4265.
      Any changes made to the DAC_DIF[1:0] bits while the LOOP bit is set will have no impact on operation until
      the LOOP bit is cleared, at which time the Digital Interface Format of the DAC will operate according to the
      format selected by the DAC_DIF[1:0] bits. While the LOOP bit is set, data will be present on the SDOUT pin
      in the format selected by the ADC_DIF bit in register 04h.

4.11  Mute Control
      The MUTEC pin becomes active during power-up initialization, reset, muting, if the MCLK to LRCK ratio is
      incorrect, and during power-down. The MUTEC pin is intended to be used as control for an external mute
      circuit in order to add off-chip mute capability.
      Use of the Mute Control function is not mandatory but recommended for designs requiring the absolute min-
      imum in extraneous clicks and pops. Also, use of the Mute Control function can enable the system designer
      to achieve idle channel noise/signal-to-noise ratios which are only limited by the external mute circuit. The
      MUTEC pin is an active-low CMOS driver. See Figure 14 for a suggested active-low mute circuit.

4.12  AES3 Transmitter
      The CS4265 includes an IEC60958-3 digital audio transmitter. A comprehensive buffering scheme provides
      write access to the channel status data. This buffering scheme is described in the “Channel Status Buffer
      Management” section on page 53.
      The IEC60958-3 transmitter encodes and transmits audio and digital data according to the IEC60958-3
      (S/PDIF) interface standard. The transmitter receives audio data from the input pin TXSDIN and control
      clocks from the PCM Serial Interface. Audio and control data are multiplexed together and bi-phase mark
      encoded. The resulting bit stream is driven from the output pin TXOUT to an output connector either directly
      or through a transformer. The transmitter is clocked from the clock input pin MCLK.
      The channel status (C) bits in the transmitted data stream are taken from storage areas within the CS4265.
      The user can manually access the internal storage of the CS4265 to configure the transmitted channel sta-
      tus data. The “Channel Status Buffer M anagement” section describes the method of manually accessing
      the storage areas. The CS4265 transmits all zeros in the user (U) data fields.
4.12.1 TxOut Driver
         The line driver is a low skew, low impedance, single-ended output capable of driving cables directly. The
         driver is set to ground during reset (RESET = LOW), when no transmit clock is provided, and optionally
30                                                                                                       DS657F3


                                                                                                            CS4265
         under the control of a register bit. The CS4265 also allows immediate muting of the IEC60958-3 transmit-
         ter audio data through a control register bit.
         External components are used to terminate and isolate the external cable from the CS4265. These com-
         ponents are detailed in the “External IEC60958-3 Transmitter Components” section on page 52.
4.12.2 Mono Mode Operation
         An IEC60958-3 stream may be used in more than one way to transmit 192 kHz sample rate data. One
         method is to double the frame rate of the current format. This results is a stereo signal with a sample rate
         of 192 kHz. An alternate method is implemented using the two sub-frames in a 96 kHz frame rate
         IEC60958-3 signal to carry consecutive samples of a mono signal, resulting in a 192 kHz sample rate
         stream. This allows older equipment, whose IEC60958-3 transmitters and receivers are not rated for
         192 kHz frame rate operation, to handle 192 kHz sample rate information. In this “mono mode”, two ca-
         bles are needed for stereo data transfer. The CS4265 offers Mono Mode operation. The CS4265 is placed
         into and out of Mono Mode with the MMT control bit.
         In Mono Mode, the input port will run at the audio sample rate (Fs), while the IEC60958-3 transmitter
         frame rate will be at Fs/2. Consecutive left or right channel serial audio data samples may be selected for
         transmission on the A and B sub-frames, and the channel status block transmitted is also selectable.
         Using Mono Mode is only necessary if the incoming audio sample rate is already at 192 kHz and contains
         both left and right audio data words. The “Mono Mode” IEC60958-3 output stream may also be achieved
         by keeping the CS4265 in normal stereo mode and placing consecutive audio samples in the left and right
         positions in an incoming 96 kHz word-rate data stream.
4.13  I²C Control Port Description and Timing
      The control port is used to access the registers, allowing the CS4265 to be configured for the desired oper-
      ational modes and formats. The operation of the control port may be completely asynchronous with respect
      to the audio sample rates. However, to avoid potential interference problems, the control port pins should
      remain static if no operation is required.
      SDA is a bidirectional data line. Data is clocked into and out of the part by the clock, SCL. A 47 k pull-up
      or pull-down on the SDOUT pin will set AD0, the least significant bit of the chip address. A pull-up to VLS
      will set AD0 to ‘1’ and a pull-down to DGND will set AD0 to ‘0’. The state of the SDOUT pin is sensed and
      AD0 is set upon the release of RESET.
      The signal timings for a read and write cycle are shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16. A Start condition is de-
      fined as a falling transition of SDA while the clock is high. A Stop condition is a rising transition while the
      clock is high. All other transitions of SDA occur while the clock is low. The first byte sent to the CS4265 after
      a Start condition consists of a 7-bit chip address field and an R/W bit (high for a read, low for a write). The
      upper 6 bits of the 7-bit address field are fixed at 100111. To communicate with a CS4265, the chip address
      field, which is the first byte sent to the CS4265, should match 100111 followed by the setting of AD0. The
      eighth bit of the address is the R/W bit. If the operation is a write, the next byte is the Memory Address Point-
      er (MAP), which selects the register to be read or written. If the operation is a read, the contents of the reg-
      ister pointed to by the MAP will be output. Following each data byte, the memory address pointer will
      automatically increment to facilitate block reads and writes of successive registers. Each byte is separated
      by an acknowledge bit. The ACK bit is output from the CS4265 after each input byte is read, and is input to
      the CS4265 from the microcontroller after each transmitted byte.

       Since the read operation cannot set the MAP, an aborted write operation is used as a preamble. As shown
       in Figure 16, the write operation is aborted after the acknowledge for the MAP byte by sending a stop con-
       dition. The following pseudocode illustrates an aborted write operation followed by a read operation.
       Send start condition.
       Send 100111x0 (chip address & write operation).
       Receive acknowledge bit.
       Send MAP byte.
       Receive acknowledge bit.
       Send stop condition, aborting write.
       Send start condition.
       Send 100111x1(chip address & read operation).
       Receive acknowledge bit.
       Receive byte, contents of selected register.
       Send acknowledge bit.
       Send stop condition.
4.14   Status Reporting
       The CS4265 has comprehensive status reporting capabilities. Many conditions can be reported in the status
       register, as listed in the status register descriptions. See “Status - Address 0Dh” on page 43. Each source
       may be masked off through mask register bits. In addition, each source may be set to ris ing edge, falling
       edge, or level sensitive. Combined with the option of level-sensitive or edge-sensitive modes within the mi-
       crocontroller, many different configurations are possible, depending on the needs of the equipment design-
       er.

                                                                                                          CS4265
4.15  Reset
      When RESET is low, the CS4265 enters a low-power mode and all internal states are reset, including the
      control port and registers, the outputs are muted. When RESET is high, the control port becomes operation-
      al, and the desired settings should be loaded into the control registers. Writing a 0 to the PDN bit in the Pow-
      er Control register will then cause the part to leave the low-power state and begin operation.
      The delta-sigma modulators settle in a matter of microseconds after the analog section is powered, either
      through the application of power or by setting the RESET pin high. However, the voltage reference will take
      much longer to reach a final value due to the presence of external capacitance on the FILT+ pin. During this
      voltage reference ramp delay, both SDOUT and DAC outputs will be automatically muted.
      It is recommended that RESET be activated if the analog or digital supplies drop below the recommended
      operating condition to prevent power-glitch-related issues.
4.16  Synchronization of Multiple Devices
      In systems where multiple ADCs are required, care must be taken to achieve simultaneous sampling. To
      ensure synchronous sampling, the master clocks a nd left/right clocks mu st be the same for all o f the
      CS4265s in the system. If only one master clock source is needed, one solution is to place one CS4265 in
      Master Mode, and slave all of the other CS4265s to the one master. If multiple master clock sources are
      needed, a possible solution would be to supply all clocks from the same external source and time the
      CS4265 reset with the inactive edge of master clock. This will ensure that all converters begin sampling on
      the same clock edge.
4.17  Grounding and Power Supply Decoupling
      As with any high-resolution converter, the CS4265 requires careful attention to power supply and grounding
      arrangements if its po tential performance is to b e realized. Figure 9 shows the recommended power ar-
      rangements, with VA connected to a clean supply. VD, which powers the digital filter, may be run from the
      system logic supply (VLS or VLC) or may be powered from the analog supply (VA) via a resistor. In this
      case, no additional devices should be powered from VD. Power supply decoupling capacitors should be as
      near to the CS4265 as possible, with the low value ceramic capacitor being the nearest. All signals, espe-
      cially clocks, should be kept away from the FILT+ and VQ pins in order to avoid unwanted coupling into the
      modulators. The FILT+ and VQ decoupling capacitors, particularly the 0.1 µF, must be positioned to mini-
      mize the electrical path from FILT+ and AGND. The CS4265 evaluation board demonstrates the optimum
      layout and power supply arrangements. To minimize digital noise, connect the CS4265 digital outputs only
      to CMOS inputs.
4.18  Package Considerations
      The CS4265 is available in the compact QFN package. The under side of the QFN package reveals a large
      metal pad that serves as a thermal relief to provide for maximum heat dissipation. This pad must mate with
      an equally dimensioned copper pad on the PCB and must be electrically connected to ground. A series of
      vias should be used to connect this copper pad to one or more larger ground planes on other PCB layers.
      In split ground systems, it is recommended that this thermal pad be connected to AGND for best perfor-
      mance. The CS4265 evaluation board demonstrates the optimum thermal pad and via configuration.

6.3.2    Mute DAC (Bit 2)
         Function:
         The DAC outputs will mute and the MUTEC pin will become active when this bit is set. Though this bit is
         active high, it should be noted that the MUTEC pin is active low. The common mode voltage on the outputs
         will be retained when this bit is set. The muting function is effected, similar to attenuation changes, by the
         DACSoft and DACZero bits in the DAC Control 2 register.

6.9.1    PGA Soft Ramp or Zero Cross Enable (Bits 4:3)
         Function:
         Soft Ramp Enable
         Soft Ramp allows level changes, both muting and attenuation, to be implemented by incrementally ramp-
         ing, in 1/8 dB steps, from the current level to the new level at a rate of 1 dB per 8 left/right clock periods.
         See Table 14.
         Zero Cross Enable
         Zero Cross Enable dictates that signal-level changes, either by attenuation changes or muting, will occur
         on a signal zero crossing to minimize audible artifacts. The requested level change will occur after a time-
         out period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sample rate) if the signal
         does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently monitored and implemented
         for each channel. See Table 14.
         Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable
         Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable dictate that signal-level changes, either by attenuation changes or mut-
         ing, will occur in 1/8 dB steps and be implemented on a signal zero crossing. The 1/8 dB level change will
         occur after a time-out period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sam-
         ple rate) if the signal does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently mon-
         itored and implemented for each channel. See Table 14.

6.11.1   Volume Control (Bits 7:0)
         Function:
         The digital volume control allows the user to attenuate the signal in 0.5 dB increments from 0 to -127 dB.
         The Vol0 bit activates a 0.5 dB attenuation when set, and no attenuation when cleared. The Vol[7:1] bits
         activate attenuation equal to their decimal equivalent (in dB). Example volume settings are decoded as
         shown in Table 16. The volume changes are implemented as dictated by the DACSoft and DACZero-
         Cross bits in the DAC Control 2 register (see Section 6.12.1).

6.12.1 DAC Soft Ramp or Zero Cross Enable (Bits 7:6)
         Function:
         Soft Ramp Enable
         Soft Ramp allows level changes, both muting and attenuation, to be implemented by incrementally ramp-
         ing, in 1/8 dB steps, from the current level to the new level at a rate of 1 dB per 8 left/right clock periods.
         See Table 17.
         Zero Cross Enable
         Zero Cross Enable dictates that signal-level changes, either by attenuation changes or muting, will occur
         on a signal zero crossing to minimize audible artifacts. The requested level change will occur after a time-
         out period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sample rate) if the signal
         does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently monitored and implemented
         for each channel. See Table 17.
         Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable
         Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable dictate that signal-level changes, either by attenuation changes or mut-
         ing, will occur in 1/8 dB steps and be implemented on a signal zero crossing. The 1/8 dB level change will

7. PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
Dynamic Range
        The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified
        bandwidth. Dynamic Range is a signal-to-noise ratio measurement over the specified bandwidth made with
        a -60 dBFS signal. 60 dB is added to resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full scale. This
        technique ensures that the distortion components are below the noise level and do not affect the measure-
        ment. This measurement technique has been accepted by the Audio Engineering Society, AES17-1991,
        and the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, EIAJ CP-307. Expressed in decibels.
Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise
        The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified
        bandwidth (typically 10 Hz to 20 kHz), including distortion components. Expressed in decibels. Measured
        at -1 and -20 dBFS as suggested in AES17-1991 Annex A.
Frequency Response
        A measure of the amplitude response variation from 10 Hz to 20 kHz relative to the amplitude response at
        1 kHz. Units in decibels.
Interchannel Isolation
        A measure of crosstalk between the left and right channels. Measured for each channel at the converter's
        output with no signal to the input under test and a full-scale signal applied to the other channel. Units in deci-
        bels.
Interchannel Gain Mismatch
        The gain difference between left and right channels. Units in decibels.
Gain Drift
        The change in gain value with temperature. Units in ppm/°C.

10.EXTERNAL IEC60958-3 TRANSMITTER COMPONENTS
This section details the external components required to interface the IEC60958-3 transmitter to cables and fiber-
optic components.
10.1    IEC60958-3 Transmitter External Components
        The IEC60958-3 specifications call for an unbalanced drive circuit with an output impedance of 75  
        and an output drive level of 0.5 volts peak-to-peak ±20% when measured across a 75  load using no cable.
        The circuit shown in Figure 42 provides the proper output impedance and drive level using standard 1% re-
        sistors. If VD is driven from +3.3 V, use resistor values of 243  in place of the 374  resistor and a 107 
        resistor in place of the 90.9  resistor. The standard connector for a consumer application is an RCA phono
        socket.
        The TXOUT pin may be used to drive TTL or CMOS gates as shown in Figure 43. This circuit may be used
        for optical connectors for digital audio as they typically implement TTL or CMOS compatible inputs. This cir-
        cuit is also useful when driving multiple digital audio outputs as RS422 line drivers typically implement TTL
        compatible inputs.

11.CHANNEL STATUS BUFFER MANAGEMENT
The CS4265 has a comprehensive channel status (C) data buffering scheme which allows the user to manage the
C data through the control port.
11.1    IEC60958-3 Channel Status (C) Bit Management
        The CS4265 contains sufficient RAM to store a full block of C data for both A and B channels (192x2 = 384
        bits). The user may read from, or write to, these RAM buffers through the control port.
        The CS4265 manages the flow of channel status data at the block level, meaning that entire blocks of chan-
        nel status information are buffered at the input, synchronized to the output time base, and then transmitted.
        The buffering scheme involves a cascade of two block-sized buffers, named E and F, as shown in Figure 44.
        The MSB of each byte represents the first bit in the serial C data stream. For example, the MSB of byte 0
        (which is at control port address 13h) is the consumer/professional bit for channel status block A.
        The E buffer is accessible from the control port, allowing read and writing of the C data. The F buffer is used
        as the source of C data for the IEC60958-3 transmitter. The F buffer accepts block transfers from the E buff-
        er.

11.1.1    Accessing the E Buffer
          The user can monitor the data being transferred by reading the E buffer, which is mapped into the register
          space of the CS4265, through the control port. The user can modify the data to be transmitted by writing
          to the E buffer.
          The E buffer is only accessible when an MCLK signal is applied to the CS4265 and the device is out of
          the power-down state (the PDN bit in register 02h is cleared). If either of these conditions is not met, the
          values stored in the E buffer will not change when written via the control port.
          The user can configure the status register such that EFTC bit is set whenever an E to F transfer com-
          pletes. With this configuration in place, periodic polling of the status register allows determination of the
          time periods acceptable for E buffer interaction.
          Also provided is an “E to F” inhibit bit. The “E to F” buffer transfer is disabled whenever the user sets this
          bit. This may be used whenever “long” control port interactions are occurring.
          A flowchart for reading and writing to the E buffer is shown in Figure 45. For writing, the sequence starts
          after an E to F transfer, which is based on the output time base.
                                                                Begin
                                                 Configure the EFTC status bit as

11.2   Serial Copy Management System (SCMS)
       The CS4265 allows read/modify/write access to all the channel status bits. For consumer mode SCMS com-
       pliance, the host microcontroller needs to manipulate the Category Code, Copy bit and L bit appropriately.
11.3   Channel Status Data E Buffer Access
       The E buffer is organized as 24 x 16 -bit words. For each word, the most significant byte is the A channel
       data, and the least significant byte is the B channel data (see Figure 44).
       There are two methods of accessing this memory, known as One-Byte Mode and Two-Byte Mode. The de-
       sired mode is selected through a control register bit.
54                                                                                                            DS657F3


                                                                                                           CS4265
11.3.1  One-Byte Mode
        In many applications, the channel status blocks for the A and B channels will be identical. In this situation,
        if the user reads a byte from one of the channel's blocks, the corresponding byte for the other channel will
        be the same. Similarly, if the user wrote a byte to one channel's block, it would be necessary to write the
        same byte to the other block. One-Byte Mode takes advantage of the often identical nature of A and B
        channel status data.
        When reading data in One-Byte Mode, a single byte is returned, which can be from channel A or B data,
        depending on a register control bit. If a write is being done, the CS4265 expects a single byte to be input
        to its control port. This byte will be written to both the A and B locations in the addressed word.
        One-Byte Mode saves the user substantial control port access time, as it effectively accesses two byte’s
        worth of information in 1 byte's worth of access time. If the control port's auto increment addressing is used
        in combination with this mode, multi-byte accesses such as full-block reads or writes can be done espe-
        cially efficiently.
11.3.2  Two-Byte Mode
        There are those applications in which the A and B channel status blocks will not be the same, and the
        user is interested in accessing both blocks. In these situations, Two-Byte Mode should be used to access
        the E buffer.
        In this mode, a read will cause the CS4265 to output two bytes from its control port. The first byte out rep-
        resents the A channel status data, and the second byte represents the B channel status data. Writing is
        similar, in that two bytes must now be input to the CS4265's control port. The A channel status data is
        first; B channel status data is second.
