Notes:
          8. Full-scale differential output signal.
          9. Current consumption increases with increasing FS and increasing MCLK. Values are based on FS of
               100 kHz and MCLK of 25.6 MHz. Current variance between speed modes is small.
          10. PLL is activated by setting the MCLK RATE bit to either 000 (operating in 256x mode) or 001 (operating
               in 384kHz).
          11. Internal to the CS4244, the analog to digital converters are grouped together in stereo pairs. ADC1 and
               ADC2 are grouped together as are ADC3 and ADC4. The ADC group current draw is the current that
               is drawn whenever one of these groups become active.
          12. To calculate total current draw for an arbitrary amount of ADCs or DACs, the following equations apply:
  Total Running Current Draw from VA Supply = Power Down Overhead + PLL (If Applicable)+ DAC Current Draw + ADC Current Draw
                                                               where
                                 DAC Current Draw = DAC Overhead + (Number of DACs x DAC Channel)
  ADC Current Draw = ADC Overhead + (Number of active ADC Groups x ADC Group) + (Number of active ADC Channels x ADC Channel)
                                                                and
            Total Running Current Draw from VL Supply = PDN Overhead + (Number of active ADC Channels x ADC Channel)

Notes:
          22. Response is clock-dependent and will scale with FS.
          23. For Single-Speed Mode, the measurement bandwidth is 0.5465 FS to 3 FS.
              For Double-Speed Mode, the measurement bandwidth is 0.577 FS to 1.4 FS.
          24. The DAC group delay is measured from the FS/LRCK transition (rising or falling) before the first bit of
              a (group of) sample(s) is transmitted on the SDINx pins to the time it appears on the AOUTx pins.

Notes:
        25. After applying power to the CS4244, RST should be held low until after the power supplies and MCLK
              are stable.
        26. MCLK must be synchronous to and scale with FS.
        27. The SCLK frequency must remain less than or equal to the MCLK frequency. For this reason, SCLK
              may range from 256x to 512x only in single speed mode. In double speed mode, 256x is the only ratio
              supported.
        28. The MSB of CH1 is always aligned with the second SCLK rising edge following FS/LRCK rising edge.
        29. Where “n” is equal to the MCLK to LRCK ratio (set by the Master Clock Rate register bits), i.e. in 256x
              mode, n = 256, in 512x mode, n = 512, etc.

4. APPLICATIONS
4.1   Power Supply Decoupling, Grounding, and PCB Layout
      As with any high-resolution converter, the CS4244 requires careful attention to power supply and grounding
      arrangements if its potential performance is to be realized. Figure 2 shows the recommended power ar-
      rangements, with VA connected to clean supplies. VDREG, which powers the digital circuitry, is generated
      internally from an on-chip regulator from the VA supply. The VDREG pin provides a connection point for the
      decoupling capacitors, as shown in Figure 2.
      Extensive use of power and ground planes, ground plane fill in unused areas and surface mount decoupling
      capacitors are recommended. Decoupling capacitors should be as near to the pins of the CS4244 as pos-
      sible. The low value ceramic capacitor should be the nearest to the pin and should be mounted on the same
      side of the board as the CS4244 to minimize inductance effects. All signals, especially clocks, should be
      kept away from the FILT+, VBIAS, and VQ pins in order to avoid unwanted coupling into the modulators.
      The FILT+, VBIAS, and VQ decoupling capacitors, particularly the 0.1 µF, must be positioned to minimize
      the electrical path from their respective pins and GND.VA_SEL
      For optimal heat dissipation from the package, it is recommended that the area directly under the device be
      filled with copper and tied to the ground plane. The use of vias connecting the topside ground to the back-
      side ground is also recommended.
4.2   Recommended Power-up & Power-down Sequence
      The initialization and Power-Up/Down sequence flow chart is shown in Figure 9. For the CS4244 Reset is
      defined as all lines held static, RST line is pulled low. Power Down is defined as all lines (excluding MCLK)
      held static, RST line is high, all PDNx bits are ‘1’. Running is defined as RST line high, all PDNx bits are ‘0’.
4.2.1     Power-up
          The CS4244 enters a reset state upon the initial application of VA and VL. When these power supplies
          are initially applied to the device, the audio outputs, AOUTxx, are clamped to VQ which is initially low.
          Additionally, the interpolation and decimation filters, delta-sigma modulators and control port registers are
          all reset and the internal voltage reference, multi-bit digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters and
          low-pass filters are powered down. The device remains in the reset state until the RST pin is brought high.
          Once RST is brought high, the control port address is latched after 2 ms + (3000/MCLK). Until this latching
          transition is complete, the device will not respond to I²C reads or writes, but the I²C bus may still be used
          during this time. Once the latching transition is complete, the address is latched and the control port is
          accessible. At this point and the desired register settings can be loaded per the interface descriptions de-
          tailed in the Section 4.3 I²C Control Port. To ensure specified performance and timing, the VA_SEL must
          be set to “0” for VA = 3.3 VDC and “1” for VA = 5.0 VDC before audio output begins.
          After the RST pin is brought high and MCLK is applied, the outputs begin to ramp with VQ towards the
          nominal quiescent voltage. VQ will charge to VA/2 upon initial power up. The time that it takes to charge
          up to VA/2 is governed by the size of the capacitor attached to the VQ pin. With the capacitor value shown
          in the typical connection diagram, the charge time will be approximately 250 ms. The gradual voltage
          ramping allows time for the external DC-blocking capacitors to charge to VQ, effectively blocking the qui-
          escent DC voltage. Once FS/LRCK is valid, MCLK occurrences are counted over one FS period to deter-
          mine the MCLK/FS ratio. With MCLK valid and any of the PDNx bits cleared, the internal voltage
          references will transition to their nominal voltage. Power is applied to the D/A converters and filters, and
          the analog outputs are un-clamped from the quiescent voltage, VQ. Afterwards, normal operation begins.

                                                                                                                             CS4244
4.2.2   Power-down
        To prevent audio transients at power-down, the DC-blocking capacitors must fully discharge before turn-
        ing off the power. In order to do this in a controlled manner, it is recommended that all the converters be
        muted to start the sequence. Next, set PDNx for all converters to 1 to power them down internally. Then,
        FS/LRCK and SCLK can be removed if desired. Finally, the “VQ RAMP” bit in the "DAC Control 4" register
        must be set to ‘1’ for a period of 50 ms before applying reset or removing power or MCLK. During this
        time, voltage on VQ and the audio outputs discharge gradually to GND. If power is removed before this
        50 ms time period has passed, a transient will occur and a slight click or pop may be heard. There is no
        minimum time for a power cycle. Power may be re-applied at any time.
        It is important to note that all clocks should be applied and removed in the order specified in Figure 9. If
        MCLK is removed or applied before RST has been pulled low, audible pops, clicks and/or distortion can
        result. If either SCLK or FS/LRCK is removed or applied before all PDNx bits are set to 1, audible pops,
        clicks and/or distortion can result.

        “Typical Connection Diagram” on page 8. See Section 4.6.5.2 for volume ramp behavior.

4.2.3   DAC DC Loading
        Figure 10 shows the analog output configuration during power-up, with the AOUTx± pins clamped to VQ
        to prevent pops and clicks. Thus any DC loads (RLx) on the output pins will be in parallel when the switch-
        es are closed. These DC loads will pull the VQ voltage down towards ground. If the parallel combination
        of all DC loads exceeds the specification shown in the Analog Output Characteristics tables on pages 16
DS900F2                                                                                                                           23


                                                                                                        CS4244
        and 17, the VQ voltage will never rise to its minimum operating voltage. If the VQ voltage never rises
        above this minimum operating voltage, the device will not finish the power-up sequence and normal op-
        eration will not begin.
        Also note that any AOUTx± pin(s) with a DC load must remain powered up (PDN DACx = 0) to keep the
        VQ net at its nominal voltage during normal operation, otherwise clipping may occur on the outputs.
        Note that the load capacitors (CLx) are also in parallel during power-up. The amount of total capacitance
        on the VQ net during power-up will affect the amount of time it takes for the VQ voltage to rise to its nom-
        inal operating voltage after VA power is applied. The time period can be calculated using the time constant
        given by the internal series resistor and the load capacitors.

4.3   I²C Control Port
      All device configuration is achieved via the I²C control port registers as described in the Switching Specifi-
      cations - Control Port table. The operation via the control port may be completely asynchronous with respect
      to the audio sample rates. However, to avoid potential interference problems, the I²C pins should remain
      static if no operation is required. The CS4244 acts as an I²C slave device.
      SDA is a bidirectional data line. Data is clocked into and out of the device by the clock, SCL. The AD0 and
      AD1 pins form the two least significant bits of the chip address and should be connected through a resistor
      to VL or GND as desired. The SDOUT2 pin is used to set the AD2 bit by connecting a resistor from the SD-
      OUT2 pin to VL or to GND. The state of these pins are sensed after the CS4244 is released from reset.

                                                                                                                                               CS4244
      The signal timings for a read and write cycle are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12. A Start condition is de-
      fined as a falling transition of SDA while the clock is high. A Stop condition is a rising transition while the
      clock is high. All other transitions of SDA occur while the clock is low. The first byte sent to the CS4244 after
      a Start condition consists of a 7-bit chip address field and a R/W bit (high for a read, low for a write). The
      upper 4 bits of the 7-bit address field are fixed at 0010. To communicate with a CS4244, the chip address
      field, which is the first byte sent to the CS4244, should match 0010 followed by the settings of the ADx pins.
      The eighth bit of the address is the R/W bit. If the operation is a write, the next byte is the Memory Address
      Pointer (MAP) which selects the register to be read or written. If the operation is a read, the contents of the
      register pointed to by the MAP will be output. Setting the auto increment bit in MAP allows successive reads
      or writes of consecutive registers. Each byte is separated by an acknowledge bit. The ACK bit is output from
      the CS4244 after each input byte is read, and is input to the CS4244 from the microcontroller after each trans-
      mitted byte.

      Since the read operation can not set the MAP, an aborted write operation is used as a preamble. As shown
      in Figure 12, the write operation is aborted after the acknowledge for the MAP byte by sending a stop con-
      dition. The following pseudocode illustrates an aborted write operation followed by a read operation.
      Send start condition.
      Send 0010xxx0 (chip address & write operation).
      Receive acknowledge bit.
      Send MAP byte, auto increment off.
      Receive acknowledge bit.
      Send stop condition, aborting write.
      Send start condition.
      Send 0010xxx1 (chip address & read operation).
      Receive acknowledge bit.
      Receive byte, contents of selected register.
      Send acknowledge bit.
      Send stop condition.
      Setting the auto increment bit in the MAP allows successive reads or writes of consecutive registers. Each
      byte is separated by an acknowledge bit.

4.3.1   Memory Address Pointer (MAP)
        The MAP byte comes after the address byte and selects the register to be read or written. Refer to the
        pseudocode above for implementation details.
        4.3.1.1        Map Increment (INCR)
        The CS4244 has MAP auto-increment capability enabled by the INCR bit (the MSB) of the MAP. If INCR
        is set to ‘0’, MAP will stay constant for successive I²C reads or writes. If INCR is set to ‘1’, MAP will auto-
        increment after each byte is read or written, allowing block reads or writes of successive registers.
4.4   System Clocking
      The CS4244 will operate at sampling frequencies from 30 kHz to 100 kHz. This range is divided into two
      speed modes as shown in Table 1.
                                            Mode            Sampling Frequency
                                   Single-Speed                  30-50 kHz
                                   Double-Speed                  60-100 kHz
                                                Table 1. Speed Modes
      The serial port clocking must be changed while all PDNx bits are set. If the clocking is changed otherwise,
      the device will enter a mute state, see Section 4.8 on page 43.
4.4.1   Master Clock
        The ratio of the MCLK frequency to the sample rate must be an integer. The FS/LRCK frequency is equal
        to FS, the frequency at which all of the slots of the TDM stream or channels in Left Justified or I²S formats
        are clocked into or out of the device. The Speed Mode and Master Clock Rate bits configure the device
        to generate the proper clocks in Master Mode and receive the proper clocks in Slave Mode. Table 2 illus-
        trates several standard audio sample rates and the required MCLK and FS/LRCK frequencies.
        The CS4244 has an internal fixed ratio PLL. This PLL is activated when the “MCLK RATE[2:0]” bits in the
        "Clock & SP Sel." register are set to either 000 or 001, corresponding to 256x or 384x. When in either of
        these two modes, the PLL will activate to adjust the frequency of the incoming MCLK to ensure that the
        internal state machines operate at a nominal 24.576 MHz rate. As is shown in the Typical Current Con-
        sumption table, activation of the PLL will increase the power consumption of the CS4244.

4.4.2   Master Mode Clock Ratios

        is equal to FS and SCLK is equal to 64x FS as shown in Figure 13. TDM format is not supported in Master

        In Slave Mode, SCLK and FS/LRCK operate as inputs. The FS/LRCK clock frequency must be equal to
        the sample rate, FS, and must be synchronously derived from the supplied master clock, MCLK.
        The serial bit clock, SCLK, must be synchronously derived from the master clock, MCLK, and be equal to

4.5   Serial Port Interface
      The serial port interface format is selected by the Serial Port Format register bits. The TDM format is avail-
      able in Slave Mode only.
4.5.1   TDM Mode
        The serial port of the CS4244 supports the TDM interface format with varying bit depths from 16 to 24 as
        shown in Figure 15. Data is clocked out of the ADC on the falling edge of SCLK and clocked into the DAC
        on the rising edge.
        As indicated in Figure 15, TDM data is received most significant bit (MSB) first, on the second rising edge
        of the SCLK occurring after a FS/LRCK rising edge. All data is valid on the rising edge of SCLK. All bits
        are transmitted on the falling edge of SCLK. Each slot is 32 bits wide, with the valid data sample left jus-
        tified within the slot. Valid data lengths are 16, 18, 20, or 24 bits.
        FS/LRCK identifies the start of a new frame and is equal to the sample rate, FS. As shown in Figure 14,
        FS/LRCK is sampled as valid on the rising SCLK edge preceding the most significant bit of the first data
        sample and must be held valid for at least 1 SCLK period.
                                                                      Frame

        The structure in which the serial data is coded into the TDM slots is shown in Figure 16. SDOUT2 is un-
        used in TDM mode and is placed in a high-impedance state. When using a 48 kHz sample rate with a
        24.576 MHz MCLK and SCLK, a 16 slot TDM structure can be realized. When using a 48 kHz sample rate
        with 12.288 MHz SCLK and 24.576 MHz MCLK, or a 96 kHz sample rate with a 24.576 MHz MCLK and
        SCLK, an 8 slot TDM structure can be realized. The data that is coded into the TDM slots is extracted into
        the appropriate signal path via the settings in the Control port. Please refer to Section 4.6.1 Routing the
        Serial Data within the Signal Paths for more details.

4.5.2      Left Justified and I²S Modes
           The serial port of the CS4244 supports the Left Justified and I²S interface formats with valid bit depths of
           16, 18, 20, or 24 bits for the SDOUTx pins and 24 bits for the SDINx pins. All data is valid on the rising
           edge of SCLK. Data is clocked out of the ADC on the falling edge of SCLK and clocked into the DAC on
           the rising edge. In Master Mode each slot is 32 bits wide.
           In Left Justified mode (see Figure 17) the data is received or transmitted most significant bit (MSB) first,
           on the first rising edge of the SCLK occurring after a FS/LRCK edge. The left channel is received or trans-
           mitted while FS/LRCK is logic high.
           In I²S mode (see Figure 18) the data is received or transmitted most significant bit (MSB) first, on the sec-
           ond rising edge of the SCLK occurring after a FS/LRCK edge. The left channel is received or transmitted
           while FS/LRCK is logic low.
           The AIN1 and AIN2 signals are transmitted on the SDOUT1 pin; the AIN3 and AIN4 signals are transmit-
           ted on the SDOUT2 pin. The data on the SDIN1 pin is routed to AOUT1 and AOUT2; the data on the
           SDIN2 pin is routed to AOUT3 and AOUT4.

         The CS4244 device includes two paths in which audio data can be routed. The analog input path, shown in
         yellow, allows up to four analog signals to be combined into a single TDM stream on the SDOUT1 pin or
         output as stereo pairs on the SDOUT1 and SDOUT2 pins. The DAC1-4 path, highlighted in blue, converts
         serial audio data to analog audio data.
4.6.1        Routing the Serial Data within the Signal Paths
            4.6.1.1             ADC Signal Routing
            In TDM mode, the CS4244 is designed to load the first four slots of the TDM stream on the SDOUT1 pin
            with the internal ADC data. Additionally, in order to minimize the number of SDOUT lines that must be run
            to the system controller in a multiple IC application, the SDOUT data for up to 4 devices can be loaded
            into a single TDM stream by side chaining the devices together, as shown in Figure 20. To enable the

                       This diagram shows the configuration for 16 slot TDM streams. If 8 slot TDM streams are used, two separate serial data lines will need to be
                       connected from the DSP. One would carry the serial data for Devices C&D and the other would carry the serial data for Devices A&B
                Figure 20. Conventional SDOUT (Left) vs. Sidechain SDOUT (Right) Configuration
        In Left Justified or I²S mode, the CS4244 transmits the AIN1 and AIN2 signals on the SDOUT1 pin and
        the AIN3 and AIN4 signals on the SDOUT2 pin.
        4.6.1.2      DAC1-4 Signal Routing
        In TDM mode, the “DAC1-4 SOURCE[2:0]” bits in the "SP Data Sel." register advise the CS4244 where
        data for the DAC1-4 path is located within the incoming TDM streams. Details for this register and the bit
        settings can be found in Figures 21 and 22.
        In Left Justified or I²S mode, the CS4244 routes the data on the SDIN1 pin to DAC1 and DAC2 and the
        data on the SDIN2 pin to DAC3 and DAC4.

        4.6.2.1             Analog Inputs
        AINx+ and AINx- are line-level differential analog inputs. The analog input pins do not self-bias and must
        be externally biased to VA/2 to avoid clipping of the input signal. The full-scale analog input levels are
        scaled according to VA and can be found in the Analog Input Characteristics tables on pages 12 and 13.
        The ADC output data is in two’s complement binary format. For inputs above positive full scale or below
        negative full scale, the ADC will output 7FFFFFH or 800000H, respectively, and cause the ADC Overflow
        bit in the Interrupt Notification 1 register to be set to a ‘1’.
        4.6.2.2             Active ADC Input Filter
        The analog modulator samples the input at 6.144 MHz (internal MCLK = 12.288 MHz). The digital filter
        will reject signals within the stopband of the filter. However, there is no rejection for input signals which
        are multiples of the digital passband frequency (n  6.144 MHz), where n = 0,1,2,... Refer to Figure 24 for
        a recommended analog input filter that will attenuate any noise energy at 6.144 MHz, in addition to pro-
        viding the optimum source impedance for the modulators. The use of capacitors that have a large voltage
        coefficient (such as general-purpose ceramics) must be avoided since these can degrade signal linearity.

        4.6.2.3       ADC HPF
        The ADC path contains an optional HPF which can be enabled or disabled for all four ADCs via the “EN-
        ABLE HPF” bit in the "ADC Control 1" register. The HPF should only be disabled when the DC component
        of the input signal needs to be preserved in the digital output data. The HPF characteristics are given in
        the ADC Digital Filter Characteristics table and plotted in Section 7. The Analog Input Characteristics ta-
        bles on pages 12 and 13 specify the DC offset error when the HPF is enabled or disabled.
        The following figure shows how the recommended single-ended to differential active input filter
        (Figure 24) can be modified to allow for DC coupled inputs when the HPF is disabled. Note that the volt-
        age swing should not exceed the ADC full-scale input specification.

        The AOUT1-4 signals are driven by the data placed into the DAC1-4 path. This data can be placed into
        the DAC1-4 path via the DAC1-4 Data Source settings in the control port. These settings allow the input
        source to be selected from any of the up to 32 slots of data on the incoming TDM streams on SDIN1 and
        SDIN2.
        The DAC1-4 path also includes individual channel mutes. Separate volume controls are available for each
        channel, along with a master volume control that simultaneously attenuates all four channels. The master
        volume attenuation is added to any channel attenuation that is applied.
        4.6.3.1             De-emphasis Filter
        The CS4244 includes on-chip digital de-emphasis for 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz sample rates. It is not support-
        ed for 96 kHz or for any settings in Double-speed Mode. The filter response is adjusted to be appropriate
        for a particular base rate by the Base Rate Advisory bits. This filter response, shown in Figure 27, will vary
        if these bits are not set appropriately for the given base rate. The frequency response of the de-emphasis
        curve scales proportionally with changes in sample rate, FS. Please see Section 6.9.2 DAC1-4 De-em-
        phasis for de-emphasis control.
        The de-emphasis feature is included to accommodate audio recordings that utilize 50/15 s pre-emphasis
        equalization as a means of noise reduction.

        The recommended differential passive output filter is shown below. The filter has a flat frequency re-
        sponse in the audio band while rejecting as much signal energy outside of the audio band as possible.
        The filter has a single-pole high-pass filter to AC-couple the output signal to the load and a single-pole
        low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency energy resulting from the CS4244 DAC’s noise shaping func-

        4.6.5.1            Mute Behavior
        Each DAC channel volume is controlled by the sum (in dB) of the individual channel volume and the mas-
        ter volume registers. The channel and master volume control registers have a range of +6 dB to -90 dB
        with a nominal resolution of 6.02/16 dB per each bit, which is approximately 0.4 dB. The sum of the two
        volume settings is limited to a range of +6 dB to -90 dB. Any volume setting below this range will result in
        infinite attenuation thus muting the channel.
        A DAC channel may alternatively be muted by using the mute register bits, the power down bits, or the
        Noise Gate feature. For any case when the mute engages (volume is less than -90 dB, power down bit is
        set, mute bit is set, or Noise Gate is engaged), the CS4244 will mute the channel immediately or soft-ramp
        the volume down at a rate specified by the MUTE DELAY[1:0] bits depending on the settings of the DAC1-
        4 ATT. bit in the "DAC Control 3" register. This behavior also applies when unmuting a channel.
        4.6.5.2            Soft Ramp
        The CS4244 soft ramp feature (enabled using the DAC1-4 ATT. bit) is activated on mute and unmute tran-
        sitions as well as any normal volume register changes. To avoid any potential audible artifacts due to the
        soft ramping, the volume control algorithm implements the ramping function differently based upon how
        the user attempts to control the volume.
        If the user changes the volume in distant discrete steps such as what would happen if a button were
        pressed on a user interface to temporarily add attenuation to or mute a channel, then the volume is
        ramped from the current setting to the new setting at a constant rate set by the MUTE DELAY[1:0] bits.
        Alternatively, if the user controls the volume through a knob or slider interface, a volume envelope is sam-
        pled at a slow, not-necessarily uniform rate (typically 1-20 Hz) and sent to the CS4244. In this case the
        ramping algorithm detects a short succession of volume changes attempting to track the volume envelope
        and dynamically adjusts the soft-ramp rate.
        If the CS4244 were to use a constant ramp rate between the volume changes it receives, its output volume
        envelope may either lag behind the user-generated envelope if the ramp rate is set too low (possibly not
        reaching the peaks and dulling the envelope) or the output volume envelope may cause a stair-case effect
        resulting in audible zipper noise if the ramp rate is set too high. By instead adapting the soft-ramp rate to
        fit the envelope given by the incoming volume samples, the envelope lag time is limited and the zipper

        noise is avoided. In this mode the soft ramp algorithm linearly interpolates the volume between the volume
        changes. There is a lag of one volume change sample since two samples are required to calculate the
        first ramp rate.
        See Figure 30 for the soft ramp diagram. On the first volume sample received, the CS4244 only detects
        the possible beginning of a volume envelope sequence and resets an envelope counter. The volume
        starts ramping to the new volume setting at a constant rate controlled by the MUTE DELAY[1:0] setting.
        If the envelope counter times out before a new volume sample is received, the next received sample is
        treated in the same way as the previous sample and the ramp rate is kept constant. In this way, as long
        as the volume samples are distant from each other by more than the envelope counter time out, the rate
        is kept constant resulting in the soft-ramp behavior described in the button-press example.
        However if the next volume sample is received before the envelope counter times out, then it is assumed
        to be part of a volume envelope sequence. The envelope counter is reset and as long as new samples
        are received in succession before a time out occurs, the sequence is continued. Starting at the second
        volume sample of an envelope sequence, the ramp rate is adjusted using the equation shown in
        Figure 30.

        Two control parameters allow the user to limit the ramp-rate range to achieve optimum effect. The MIN
        DELAY[2:0] setting limits the maximum ramp rate; higher values will introduce more lag in the envelope
        tracking while providing a smoother ramp. The MAX DELAY[2:0] setting limits the minimum ramp rate;
        lower values will permit closer tracking of the envelope but may re-introduce zipper noise. The default val-
        ues of these registers are recommended as a starting point. It is possible to disable the volume envelope

        DELAY[2:0] values to match the MUTE DELAY[1:0] setting.
        The envelope counter time out period which defines the boundary between the two soft-ramping behav-
        iors depends on the base rate. It is equal to approximately 100,000/Fs.
        The MUTE DELAY[1:0], MIN DELAY[2:0], and MAX DELAY[2:0] bits specify a delay equal to a multiple
        of the base period between volume steps of 6.02/64 dB, which is approximately 0.1 dB. This is the internal
        resolution of the volume control engine. Consequently the soft-ramp rate can be expressed in ms/dB as
        shown in Table 6.
                            Fs = 48 kHz or 96 kHz (Base = 48 kHz)       Fs = 32 kHz or 64 kHz (Base = 32 kHz)

        4.6.5.3       Noise Gate
        The CS4244 is equipped with a Noise Gate feature that mutes the output if the signal drops below a given
        bit depth for 8192 samples. While the enabling or disabling of the Noise Gate feature is done for the entire
        DAC1-4 output path, each of the channels within the path have separate monitoring circuitry that will trig-
        ger the Noise Gate function independently of the other channels. For instance, if the Noise Gate were en-
        abled for and one of the channels were to exhibit a pattern of more than 8192 samples of either all “1’s”
        or all “0’s”, the output for that particular channel would be muted (and subsequently unmuted), inde-
        pendently of the other channels. To enable the Noise Gate feature, set the DAC1-4 NG[2:0] bits to the
        desired bit depth. The available bit depth settings are shown in Table 7.

         When the upper “x” bits, as dictated by the DAC1-4 NG[2:0] settings, are either all “1’s” or all “0’s” for 8192
         consecutive samples, the Noise Gate will engage for that channel. Setting these bits to ‘111’ will disable
         the Noise Gate feature. If the Noise Gate feature engages, it will transition into and out of mute as dictated
         by the DAC1-4 ATT. bit in the "DAC Control 3" register.
4.7   Reset Line
      The reset line of the CS4244 is used to place the device into a reset condition. In this condition, all of the
      values of the CS4244 control port are set to their default values. This mode of operation is the lowest power
      mode of operation for the CS4244 and should be used whenever the device is not operating in order to save
      power. During the power up and power down sequence, it is often necessary for the CS4244 devices to be
      placed into (and taken out of) reset at a different moment in time than the amplifiers to which they are con-
      nected in order to minimize audible clicks and pops during the sequence. For this reason, it is advisable to
      run separate reset lines for each type of device, i.e. one reset line for the CS4244 devices and one for the
      amplifier devices.
4.8   Error Reporting and Interrupt Behavior
      The CS4244 is equipped with a suite of error reporting and protection. The types of errors that are detected,
      the notification method for these errors, and the steps needed to clear the errors are detailed in Table 8.
      It is important to note that the interrupt notification bits for all of the errors are triggered on the edge of the
      occurrence of the event. They are not level-triggered and therefore do not indicate the presence of an error
      in real time. This means that, a “1” in the error’s respective field inside the Interrupt Notification register only
      indicates that the error has occurred since the last time the register was cleared and not necessarily that
      the error is currently occurring.
                                                                                            All PDNx bits must be set

4.8.1   Interrupt Masking
        An occurrence of any of the errors mentioned above will cause the interrupt line to engage in order to no-
        tify the system controller that an error has occurred. If it is preferred that the error not cause the interrupt
        line to engage, this error can be masked in its respective mask register. It is important to note that, in the
        event of an error, the interrupt notification bit for the respective error will reflect the occurrence of the
        event, regardless of the setting of the mask bit. Setting the mask bit only prevents the interrupt pin from
        being flagged upon the occurrence.
4.8.2   Interrupt Line Operation
        As mentioned previously, the interrupt line of the CS4244 will be pulled low or high (depending on the set-
        tings of the “INT PIN[1:0]” bits in the "Interrupt Control" register) after an interrupt condition occurs, pro-
        vided that the event is not masked in the mask register. If the CS4244’s interrupt line is to be connected
        onto a single bus with other devices, it is advisable to use it in the open drain mode of operation. If no
        other devices are connected to the interrupt line, it may be used in the CMOS mode of operation. When
        used in the open drain configuration, it is necessary to connect a pull-up resistor to this net, which will

        for the appropriate pull-up resistor value.
4.8.3   Error Reporting and Clearing
        In the event of an error, the interrupt line will be engaged - provided the mask bit for that error is not set.
        When the interrupt notification registers are read to determine the source of the error, the mask bit for
        whichever error occurred will be set automatically by the CS4244. The system controller should begin to
        take corrective action to clear the error. Once the error has been cleared, the system controller should
        clear the mask bit in the appropriate mask register to ensure that a subsequent occurrence of the error
        will cause the interrupt line to engage appropriately. This behavior is detailed in Figure 31 on page 45.
