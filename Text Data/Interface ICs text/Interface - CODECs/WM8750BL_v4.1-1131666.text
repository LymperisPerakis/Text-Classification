 TYPICAL PERFORMANCE
 POWER CONSUMPTION
 The power consumption of the WM8750BL depends on the following factors.
    Supply voltages: Reducing the supply voltages also reduces supply currents, and therefore results in significant power
     savings, especially in the digital sections of the WM8750BL.
       Oversampling rate: Significant power savings can be achieved by running the DAC and ADC at the lower over-sampling
        rate of 64 (this is achieved by setting ADCOSR and DACOSR to ‘1’ in R24). Note all figures quoted here assume
        ADCOSR=DACOSR=1.
       Operating mode: Disabling parts of the WM8750BL that are not currently in use (e.g. mic pre-amps, unused outputs,
        DAC, ADC, etc.) also saves power.

                The WM8750BL includes an internal Power-On-Reset Circuit, as shown in Figure 6, which is used to
                reset the digital logic into a default state after power up. The power on reset circuit is powered from
                DCVDD and monitors DCVDD and AVDD. It asserts PORB low if DCVDD or AVDD are below a
                minimum threshold.
                Figure 7 Typical Power-Up Sequence
                Figure 7 shows a typical power-up sequence. When DCVDD and AVDD rise above the minimum
                thresholds, Vpord_dcvdd and Vpord_avdd, there is enough voltage for the circuit to guarantee the
                Power on Reset is asserted low and the chip is held in reset. In this condition, all writes to the control
                interface are ignored. When DCVDD rises to Vpor_dcvdd_on and AVDD rises to Vpor_avdd_on,
                PORB is released high and all registers are in their default state and writes to the control interface
                may take place. If DCVDD and AVDD rise at different rates then PORB will only be released when
                DCVDD and AVDD have both exceeded the Vpor_dcvdd_on and Vpor_avdd_on thresholds.
                On power down, PORB is asserted low whenever DCVDD drops below the minimum threshold
                Vpor_dcvdd_off or AVDD drops below the minimum threshold Vpor_avdd_off.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION
                The WM8750BL is a low power audio codec offering a combination of high quality audio, advanced
                features, low power and small size. These characteristics make it ideal for portable digital audio
                applications such as MP3 and minidisk player / recorders. Stereo 24-bit multi-bit delta sigma ADCs
                and DACs are used with oversampling digital interpolation and decimation filters.
                The device includes three stereo analogue inputs that can be switched internally. Each can be used
                as either a line level input or microphone input and LINPUT1/RINPUT1 and LINPUT2/RINPUT2 can
                be configured as mono differential inputs. A programmable gain amplifier with automatic level control
                (ALC) keeps the recording volume constant. The on-chip stereo ADC and DAC are of a high quality
                using a multi-bit, low-order oversampling architecture to deliver optimum performance with low power
                consumption.
                The DAC output signal first enters an analogue mixer where an analogue input and/or the post-ALC
                signal can be added to it. This mix is available on line and headphone outputs.
                The WM8750BL has a configurable digital audio interface where ADC data can be read and digital
                                                                                                               2
                audio playback data fed to the DAC. It supports a number of audio data formats including I S, DSP
                Mode (a burst mode in which frame sync plus 2 data packed words are transmitted), and MSB-First,
                left justified, and can operate in master or slave modes.
                The WM8750BL uses a unique clocking scheme that can generate many commonly used audio
                sample rates from either a 12.00MHz USB clock or an industry standard 256/384 fs clock. This feature
                eliminates the common requirement for an external phase-locked loop (PLL) in applications where the
                master clock is not an integer multiple of the sample rate. Sample rates of 8kHz, 11.025kHz, 12kHz,
                16kHz, 22.05kHz, 24kHz, 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz and 96kHz can be generated. The digital
                filters used for recording and playback are optimised for each sampling rate used.
                To allow full software control over all its features, the WM8750BL offers a choice of 2 or 3 wire MPU
                control interface. It is fully compatible and an ideal partner for a wide range of industry standard
                microprocessors, controllers and DSPs.
                The design of the WM8750BL has given much attention to power consumption without compromising
                performance. It operates at very low voltages, and includes the ability to power off parts of the
                circuitry under software control, including standby and power off modes.
INPUT SIGNAL PATH
                The input signal path for each channel consists of a switch to select between three analogue inputs,
                followed by a PGA (programmable gain amplifier) and an optional microphone gain boost. A
                differential input of either (LINPUT1 – RINPUT1) or (LINPUT2 – RINPUT2) may also be selected. The
                gain of the PGA can be controlled either by the user or by the on-chip ALC function (see Automatic
                Level Control).
                The signal then enters an ADC where it is digitised. Alternatively, the two channels can also be mixed
                in the analogue domain and digitised in one ADC while the other ADC is switched off. The mono-mix
                signal appears on both digital output channels.
                SIGNAL INPUTS
                The WM8750BL has three sets of high impedance, low capacitance AC coupled analogue inputs,
                LINPUT1/RINPUT1, LINPUT2/RINPUT2 and LINPUT3/RINPUT3. Inputs can be configured as
                microphone or line level by enabling or disabling the microphone gain boost.
                LINSEL and RINSEL control bits (see Table 3) are used to select independently between external
                inputs and internally generated differential products (LINPUT1-RINPUT1 or LINPUT2-RINPUT2). The
                choice of differential signal, LINPUT1-RINPUT1 or LINPUT2-RINPUT2 is made using DS (refer to
                Table 5).
                As an example, the WM8750BL can be set up to convert one differential and one single ended mono
                signal by applying the differential signal to LINPUT1/RINPUT1 and the single ended signal to
                RINPUT2. By setting LINSEL to L-R Differential (see Table 3), DS to LINPUT1 - RINPUT1 (see Table
                5) and RINSEL to RINPUT2, each mono signal can then be routed to a separate ADC or Bypass
                path.

                The signal inputs are biased internally to the reference voltage VREF. Whenever the line inputs are
                muted or the device placed into standby mode, the inputs are kept biased to VREF using special anti-
                thump circuitry. This reduces any audible clicks that may otherwise be heard when changing inputs.
                DC MEASUREMENT
                For DC measurements (for example, battery voltage monitoring), the input signal at the LINPUT1
                and/or RINPUT1 pins can be taken directly into the respective ADC, bypassing both PGA and
                microphone boost. The ADC output then becomes unsigned relative to AVDD, instead of being a
                signed (two’s complement) number relative to VREF. Setting L/RDCM will override L/RINSEL. The
                input range for dc measurement is AGND to AVDD.

         MONO MIXING
         The stereo ADC can operate as a stereo or mono device, or the two channels can be mixed to mono
         in the analogue domain (i.e. before the ADC). MONOMIX selects the mode of operation; either the left
         or right channel ADC can be used, allowing the unused ADC to be powered off or used for a DC
         measurement conversion. The user also has the flexibility to select the data output from the audio
         interface using DATSEL. The default is for left and right channel ADC data to be output, but the
         interface may also be configured so that e.g. left channel ADC data is output as both left and right
         data for when mono mixing is selected.
         Note:
         If DC measurement is selected this overrides the MONOMIX selection.

                PGA CONTROL
                The PGA matches the input signal level to the ADC input range. The PGA gain is logarithmically
                adjustable from +30dB to –17.25dB in 0.75dB steps. Each PGA can be controlled either by the user
                or by the ALC function (see Automatic Level Control). When ALC is enabled for one or both channels,
                then writing to the corresponding PGA control register has no effect.
                The gain is independently adjustable on both Right and Left Line Inputs. Additionally, by controlling
                the register bits LIVU and RIVU, the left and right gain settings can be simultaneously updated.
                Setting the LZCEN and RZCEN bits enables a zero-cross detector which ensures that PGA gain
                changes only occur when the signal is at zero, eliminating any zipper noise. If zero cross is enabled a
                timeout is also available to update the gain if a zero cross does not occur. This function may be
                enabled by setting TOEN in register R23 (17h).
                The inputs can also be muted in the analogue domain under software control. The software control
                registers are shown in Table 9. If zero crossing is enabled, it is necessary to enable zero cross
                timeout to un-mute the input PGAs. This is because their outputs will not cross zero when muted.
                Alternatively, zero cross can be disabled before sending the un-mute command.

         ANALOGUE TO DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC)
         The WM8750BL uses a multi-bit, oversampled sigma-delta ADC for each channel. The use of multi-
         bit feedback and high oversampling rates reduces the effects of jitter and high frequency noise. The
         ADC Full Scale input level is proportional to AVDD. With a 3.3V supply voltage, the full scale level is
         1.0 Volts r.m.s. Any voltage greater than full scale may overload the ADC and cause distortion.
         ADC DIGITAL FILTER
         The ADC filters perform true 24 bit signal processing to convert the raw multi-bit oversampled data
         from the ADC to the correct sampling frequency to be output on the digital audio interface. The digital
         filter path is illustrated in Figure 9.
                                                                          TO DIGITAL

         Figure 9 ADC Digital Filter
         The ADC digital filters contain a digital high pass filter, selectable via software control. The high-pass
         filter response is detailed in the Digital Filter Characteristics section. When the high-pass filter is
         enabled the dc offset is continuously calculated and subtracted from the input signal. By setting
         HPOR, the last calculated dc offset value is stored when the high-pass filter is disabled and will
         continue to be subtracted from the input signal. If the DC offset is changed, the stored and subtracted
         value will not change unless the high-pass filter is enabled. This feature can be used for calibration
         purposes. In addition the highpass filter may be enabled separately on the left and right channels
         (see Table 11).
         The output data format can be programmed by the user to accommodate stereo or monophonic
         recording on both inputs. The polarity of the output signal can also be changed under software
         control. The software control is shown in Table 10.

         DIGITAL ADC VOLUME CONTROL
         The output of the ADCs can be digitally amplified or attenuated over a range from –97dB to +30dB in
         0.5dB steps. The volume of each channel can be controlled separately. The gain for a given eight-bit
         code X is given by:
         0.5  (X-195) dB for 1  X  255;        MUTE for X = 0
         The LAVU and RAVU control bits control the loading of digital volume control data. When LAVU or
         RAVU are set to 0, the LADCVOL or RADCVOL control data will be loaded into the respective control
         register, but will not actually change the digital gain setting. Both left and right gain settings are
         updated when either LAVU or RAVU are set to 1. This makes it possible to update the gain of both
         channels simultaneously.

 AUTOMATIC LEVEL CONTROL (ALC)
                 The WM8750BL has an automatic level control that aims to keep a constant recording volume
                 irrespective of the input signal level. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the PGA gain so that
                 the signal level at the ADC input remains constant. A digital peak detector monitors the ADC output
                 and changes the PGA gain if necessary. Note that when the ALC function is enabled, the settings of
                 registers 0 and 1 (LINVOL, LIVU, LIZC, LINMUTE, RINVOL, RIVU, RIZC and RINMUTE) are ignored.

                 Figure 10 ALC Operation
                 The ALC function is enabled using the ALCSEL control bits. When enabled, the recording volume can
                 be programmed between –6dB and –28.5dB (relative to ADC full scale) using the ALCL register bits.
                 An upper limit for the PGA gain can be imposed by setting the MAXGAIN control bits.
                 HLD, DCY and ATK control the hold, decay and attack times, respectively:
                 Hold time is the time delay between the peak level detected being below target and the PGA gain
                                                                                           n
                 beginning to ramp up. It can be programmed in power-of-two (2 ) steps, e.g. 2.67ms, 5.33ms,
                 10.67ms etc. up to 43.7s. Alternatively, the hold time can also be set to zero. The hold time only
                 applies to gain ramp-up: there is no delay before ramping the gain down when the signal level is
                 above target.
                 Decay (Gain Ramp-Up) Time is the time that it takes for the PGA gain to ramp up across 90% of its
                 range (e.g. from –15B up to 27.75dB). The time it takes for the recording level to return to its target
                 value therefore depends on both the decay time and on the gain adjustment required. If the gain
                 adjustment is small, it will be shorter than the decay time. The decay time can be programmed in
                                  n
                 power-of-two (2 ) steps, from 24ms, 48ms, 96ms, etc. to 24.58s.
                 Attack (Gain Ramp-Down) Time is the time that it takes for the PGA gain to ramp down across 90%
                 of its range (e.g. from 27.75dB down to -15B gain). The time it takes for the recording level to return to
                 its target value therefore depends on both the attack time and on the gain adjustment required. If the
                 gain adjustment is small, it will be shorter than the attack time. The attack time can be programmed in
                                  n
                 power-of-two (2 ) steps, from 6ms, 12ms, 24ms, etc. to 6.14s.
                 When operating in stereo, the peak detector takes the maximum of left and right channel peak values,
                 and any new gain setting is applied to both left and right PGAs, so that the stereo image is preserved.
                 However, the ALC function can also be enabled on one channel only. In this case, only one PGA is
                 controlled by the ALC mechanism, while the other channel runs independently with its PGA gain set
                 through the control register.
                 When one ADC channel is unused or used for DC measurement, the peak detector disregards that
                 channel. The ALC function can also operate when the two ADC outputs are mixed to mono in the
                 digital domain, but not if they are mixed to mono in the analogue domain, before entering the ADCs.

Production Data                                                                                      WM8750BL
                PEAK LIMITER
                To prevent clipping when a large signal occurs just after a period of quiet, the ALC circuit includes a
                limiter function. If the ADC input signal exceeds 87.5% of full scale (–1.16dB), the PGA gain is
                ramped down at the maximum attack rate (as when ATK = 0000), until the signal level falls below
                87.5% of full scale. This function is automatically enabled whenever the ALC is enabled.
                Note:
                If ATK = 0000, then the limiter makes no difference to the operation of the ALC. It is designed to
                prevent clipping when long attack times are used.
                NOISE GATE
                When the signal is very quiet and consists mainly of noise, the ALC function may cause “noise
                pumping”, i.e. loud hissing noise during silence periods. The WM8750BL has a noise gate function
                that prevents noise pumping by comparing the signal level at the LINPUT1/2/3 and/or RINPUT1/2/3
                pins against a noise gate threshold, NGTH. The noise gate cuts in when:
                      Signal level at ADC [dB] < NGTH [dB] + PGA gain [dB] + Mic Boost gain [dB]
                This is equivalent to:

                The ADC output can then either be muted or alternatively, the PGA gain can be held constant
                (preventing it from ramping up as it normally would when the signal is quiet).
                The table below summarises the noise gate control register. The NGTH control bits set the noise gate
                threshold with respect to the ADC full-scale range. The threshold is adjusted in 1.5dB steps. Levels
                at the extremes of the range may cause inappropriate operation, so care should be taken with set–up
                of the function. Note that the noise gate only works in conjunction with the ALC function, and always
                operates on the same channel(s) as the ALC (left, right, both, or none).

         3D STEREO ENHANCEMENT
         The WM8750BL has a digital 3D enhancement option to artificially increase the separation between
         the left and right channels. This effect can be used for recording or playback, but not for both
         simultaneously. Selection of 3D for record or playback is controlled by register bit MODE3D.
         Important:
         Switching the 3D filter from record to playback or from playback to record may only be done
         when ADC and DAC are disabled. The WM8750BL control interface will only allow MODE3D to
         be changed when ADC and DAC are disabled (i.e. bits ADCL, ADCR, DACL and DACR in reg. 26
         / 1Ah are all zero).
         The 3D enhancement function is activated by the 3DEN bit, and has two programmable parameters.
         The 3DDEPTH setting controls the degree of stereo expansion. Additionally, one of four filter
         characteristics can be selected for the 3D processing, using the 3DVC and 3DLC control bits.

 OUTPUT SIGNAL PATH
                 The WM8750BL output signal paths consist of digital filters, DACs, analogue mixers and output
                 drivers. The digital filters and DACs are enabled when the WM8750BL is in ‘playback only’ or ‘record
                 and playback’ mode. The mixers and output drivers can be separately enabled by individual control
                 bits (see Analogue Outputs). Thus it is possible to utilise the analogue mixing and amplification
                 provided by the WM8750BL, irrespective of whether the DACs are running or not.
                 The WM8750BL receives digital input data on the DACDAT pin. The digital filter block processes the
                 data to provide the following functions:
                       Digital volume control
                       Graphic equaliser and Dynamic Bass Boost
                       Sigma-Delta Modulation
                 Two high performance sigma-delta audio DACs convert the digital data into two analogue signals (left
                 and right). These can then be mixed with analogue signals from the LINPUT1/2/3 and RINPUT1/2/3
                 pins, and the mix is fed to the output drivers, LOUT1/ROUT1, LOUT2/ROUT2, OUT3 and
                 MONOOUT.
                       LOUT1/ROUT1/OUT3: can drive a 16 or 32 stereo headphone or stereo line output.
                       LOUT2/ROUT2: can drive a 16 or 32 stereo headphone or stereo line output, or an
                        8 mono speaker.
                       MONOOUT: can drive a mono line output or other load down to 10k
                 DIGITAL DAC VOLUME CONTROL
                 The signal volume from each DAC can be controlled digitally, in the same way as the ADC volume
                 (see Digital ADC Volume Control). The gain and attenuation range is –127dB to 0dB in 0.5dB steps.
                 The level of attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
                 0.5  (X-255) dB for 1  X  255;           MUTE for X = 0
                 The LDVU and RDVU control bits control the loading of digital volume control data. When LDVU or
                 RDVU are set to 0, the LDACVOL or RDACVOL control data is loaded into an intermediate register,
                 but the actual gain does not change. Both left and right gain settings are updated simultaneously
                 when either LDVU or RDVU are set to 1.

         GRAPHIC EQUALISER
         The WM8750BL has a digital graphic equaliser and adaptive bass boost function. This function
         operates on digital audio data before it is passed to the audio DACs. Bass enhancement can take two
         different forms:
               Linear bass control: bass signals are amplified or attenuated by a user programmable
                gain. This is independent of signal volume, and very high bass gains on loud signals may
                lead to signal clipping.
               Adaptive bass boost: The bass volume is amplified by a variable gain. When the bass
                volume is low, it is boosted more than when the bass volume is high. This method is
                recommended because it prevents clipping, and usually sounds more pleasant to the
                human ear.
         Treble control applies a user programmable gain, without any adaptive boost function. Bass and
         treble control are completely independent with separately programmable gains and filter
         characteristics.

                DIGITAL TO ANALOGUE CONVERTER (DAC)
                After passing through the graphic equaliser filters, digital ‘de-emphasis’ can be applied to the audio
                data if necessary (e.g. when the data comes from a CD with pre-emphasis used in the recording). De-
                emphasis filtering is available for sample rates of 48kHz, 44.1kHz and 32kHz.
                The WM8750BL also has a Soft Mute function, which gradually attenuates the volume of the digital
                signal to zero. When removed, the gain will return to the original setting. This function is enabled by
                default. To play back an audio signal, it must first be disabled by setting the DACMU bit to zero.

                Table 19 DAC Control
                The digital audio data is converted to oversampled bit streams in the on-chip, true 24-bit digital
                interpolation filters. The bitstream data enters two multi-bit, sigma-delta DACs, which convert them to
                high quality analogue audio signals. The multi-bit DAC architecture reduces high frequency noise and
                sensitivity to clock jitter. It also uses a Dynamic Element Matching technique for high linearity and low
                distortion.
                In normal operation, the left and right channel digital audio data is converted to analogue in two
                separate DACs. However, it is also possible to disable one channel, so that the same signal (left or
                right) appears on both analogue output channels. Additionally, there is a mono-mix mode where the
                two audio channels are mixed together digitally and then converted to analogue using only one DAC,
                while the other DAC is switched off. The mono-mix signal can be selected to appear on both
                analogue output channels.
                The DAC output defaults to non-inverted. Setting DACINV will invert the DAC output phase on both
                left and right channels.

         OUTPUT MIXERS
         The WM8750BL provides the option to mix the DAC output signal with analogue line-in signals from
         the LINPUT1/2/3, RINPUT1/2/3 pins or a mono differential input (LINPUT1 – RINPUT1) or (LINPUT2
         – RINPUT2), selected by DS (see Table 5) . The level of the mixed-in signals can be controlled with
         PGAs (Programmable Gain Amplifiers).
         The mono mixer is designed to allow a number of signal combinations to be mixed, including the
         possibility of mixing both the right and left channels together to produce a mono output. To prevent
         overloading of the mixer when full-scale DAC left and right signals are input, the mixer inputs from the
         DAC outputs each have a fixed gain of -6dB. The bypass path inputs to the mono mixer have variable
         gain as determined by R38/R39 bits [6:4].

ANALOGUE OUTPUTS
              LOUT1/ROUT1 OUTPUTS
              The LOUT1 and ROUT1 pins can drive a 16 or 32 headphone or a line output (see Headphone
              Output and Line Output sections, respectively). The signal volume on LOUT1 and ROUT1 can be
              independently adjusted under software control by writing to LOUT1VOL and ROUT1VOL,
              respectively. Note that gains over 0dB may cause clipping if the signal is large. Any gain setting below
              0101111 (minimum) mutes the output driver. The corresponding output pin remains at the same DC
              level (the reference voltage on the VREF pin), so that no click noise is produced when muting or un-
              muting.
              A zero cross detect on the analogue output may also be enabled when changing the gain setting to
              minimize audible clicks and zipper noise as the gain updates. If zero cross is enabled a timeout is
              also available to update the gain if a zero cross does not occur. This function may be enabled by
              setting TOEN in register R23 (17h).

                LOUT2/ROUT2 OUTPUTS
                The LOUT2 and ROUT2 output pins are essentially similar to LOUT1 and ROUT1, but they are
                independently controlled and can also drive an 8 mono speaker (see Speaker Output section). For
                speaker drive, the ROUT2 signal must be inverted (ROUT2INV = 1), so that the left and right channel
                are mixed to mono in the speaker [L–(-R) = L+R].

ENABLING THE OUTPUTS
                Each analogue output of the WM8750BL can be separately enabled or disabled. The analogue mixer
                associated with each output is powered on or off along with the output pin. All outputs are disabled by
                default. To save power, unused outputs should remain disabled.
                Outputs can be enabled at any time, except when VREF is disabled (VR=0), as this may cause pop
                noise (see “Power Management” and “Applications Information” sections)

                Table 29 Analogue Output Control
                Whenever an analogue output is disabled, it remains connected to VREF (pin 20) through a resistor.
                This helps to prevent pop noise when the output is re-enabled. The resistance between VREF and
                each output can be controlled using the VROI bit in register 27. The default is low (1.5k), so that any
                capacitors on the outputs can charge up quickly at start-up. If a high impedance is desired for
                disabled outputs, VROI can then be set to 1, increasing the resistance to about 40k.

HEADPHONE SWITCH
                The RINPUT3/HPDETECT pin can be used as a headphone switch control input to automatically
                disable the speaker output and enable the headphone output e.g. when a headphone is plugged into
                a jack socket. In this mode, enabled by setting HPSWEN, HPDETECT switches between headphone
                and speaker outputs (e.g. when the pin is connected to a mechanical switch in the headphone socket
                to detect plug-in). The HPSWPOL bit reverses the pin’s polarity. Note that the LOUT1, ROUT1,
                LOUT2 and ROUT2 bits in register 26 must also be set for headphone and speaker output (see Table
                31 and Table 32).
                Note:
                When RINPUT3/HPDETECT is used as the HPDETECT input, the thresholds become CMOS levels
                (0.3 AVDD / 0.7 AVDD).

 THERMAL SHUTDOWN
                The speaker and headphone outputs can drive very large currents. To protect the WM8750BL from
                overheating a thermal shutdown circuit is included. If the device temperature reaches approximately

HEADPHONE OUTPUT
              Analogue outputs LOUT1/ROUT1, LOUT2/ROUT2, and OUT3, can drive a 16 or 32 headphone
              load, either through DC blocking capacitors, or DC coupled without any capacitor.
                     Headphone Output using DC blocking                     DC Coupled Headphone Output
                                  capacitors                                       (OUT3SW = 00)
              Figure 13 Recommended Headphone Output Configurations
              When DC blocking capacitors are used, then their capacitance and the load resistance together
              determine the lower cut-off frequency, fc. Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the bass
              response. Smaller capacitance values will diminish the bass response. Assuming a 16 Ohm load and
              C1, C2 = 220F:
              fc = 1 / 2 RLC1 = 1 / (2 x 16 x 220F) = 45 Hz
              In the DC coupled configuration, the headphone “ground” is connected to the OUT3 pin, which must
              be enabled by setting OUT3 = 1 and OUT3SW = 00. As the OUT3 pin produces a DC voltage of
              AVDD/2 (=VREF), there is no DC offset between LOUT1/ROUT1 and OUT3, and therefore no DC
              blocking capacitors are required. This saves space and material cost in portable applications.
              It is recommended to connect the DC coupled headphone outputs only to headphones, and not to the
              line input of another device. Although the built-in thermal shutdown circuit will prevent any damage to
              the headphone outputs, such a connection may be noisy, and may not function properly if the other
              device is grounded.
              SPEAKER OUTPUT
              LOUT2 and ROUT2 can differentially drive a mono 8 speaker as shown below.
              Figure 14 Speaker Output Connection
              The right channel is inverted by setting the ROUT2INV bit, so that the signal across the loudspeaker
              is the sum of left and right channels.

                  LINE OUTPUT
                  The analogue outputs, LOUT1/ROUT1 and LOUT2/ROUT2, can be used as line outputs. Additionally,
                  OUT3 and MONOOUT can be used as a stereo line-out by setting OUT3SW=11 (reg. 24) and
                  ensuring the contents of registers 38 and 39 (mono-out mix) are the same as reg. 34 and 35 (left out
                  mix). Recommended external components are shown below.
                  Figure 15 Recommended Circuit for Line Output
                  The DC blocking capacitors and the load resistance together determine the lower cut-off frequency, fc.
                  Assuming a 10 kOhm load and C1, C2 = 1F:
                  fc = 1 / 2 (RL+R1) C1 = 1 / (2 x 10.1k x 1F) = 16 Hz
                  Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the bass response. Smaller values of C1 and C2 will
                  diminish the bass response. The function of R1 and R2 is to protect the line outputs from damage
                  when used improperly.
 DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE
                  The digital audio interface is used for inputting DAC data into the WM8750BL and outputting ADC
                  data from it. It uses five pins:
                        ADCDAT: ADC data output
                        ADCLRC: ADC data alignment clock
                        DACDAT: DAC data input
                        DACLRC: DAC data alignment clock
                        BCLK: Bit clock, for synchronisation
                  The clock signals BCLK, ADCLRC and DACLRC can be outputs when the WM8750BL operates as a
                  master, or inputs when it is a slave (see Master and Slave Mode Operation, below).
                  Four different audio data formats are supported:
                        Left justified
                          2
                        IS
                        DSP mode
                  All four of these modes are MSB first. They are described in Audio Data Formats, below. Refer to the
                  Electrical Characteristic section for timing information.
                  MASTER AND SLAVE MODE OPERATION
                  The WM8750BL can be configured as either a master or slave mode device. As a master device the
                  WM8750BL generates BCLK, ADCLRC and DACLRC and thus controls sequencing of the data
                  transfer on ADCDAT and DACDAT. In slave mode, the WM8750BL responds with data to clocks it
                  receives over the digital audio interface. The mode can be selected by writing to the MS bit (see
                  Table 23). Master and slave modes are illustrated below.
                  Figure 16 Master Mode                                    Figure 17 Slave Mode

WM8750BL                                                                                        Production Data
         Note: For optimum ADC audio performance in slave mode, the BCLK input signal should be
         configured to transition at the same time as the falling edge of MCLK.
         The ADCDAT digital data output is buffered inside the CODEC using a digital logic buffering block.
         However, the ADCDAT buffering block is not reset by the power-on reset circuit and hence the
         ADCDAT pin stage (logic high or logic low) is undefined at power up until data is clocked out from the
         ADC. Implementation of either of these workarounds will ensure correct operation:
                   Ensure that any external connection to the ADCDAT pin is made with the understanding
                    that ADCDAT pin may be driven high or low by the CODEC until ADC data is clocked out.
                   Tri-state the ADCDACDAT output pin by setting the TRI bit in R24 (Additional Control 2
                    register). Setting this bit will also configure ADCLRC, DACLRC and BCLK as inputs and (as
                    the CODEC has no internal pull-up/down resistors) the input voltage level must be set on
                    these pins by an external source (either the device connected to the digital audio interface
                    or pull-up/down resistors) to prevent excess current consumption.

         In I S mode, the MSB is available on the second rising edge of BCLK following a LRCLK transition.
         The other bits up to the LSB are then transmitted in order. Depending on word length, BCLK
         frequency and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of one sample and
         the MSB of the next.

                In DSP/PCM mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1 (mode B) or 2 (mode A) rising
                edge of BCLK (selectable by LRP) following a rising edge of LRC. Right channel data immediately
                follows left channel data. Depending on word length, BCLK frequency and sample rate, there may be
                unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of the right channel data and the next sample.
                In device master mode, the LRC output will resemble the frame pulse shown in Figure 20 and Figure
                21. In device slave mode, Figure 22 and Figure 23, it is possible to use any length of frame pulse less
                than 1/fs, providing the falling edge of the frame pulse occurs greater than one BCLK period before
                the rising edge of the next frame pulse.

         BIT CLOCK MODE
         The default master mode bit clock generator produces a bit clock frequency based on the sample rate
         and input MCLK frequency as shown in Table 40. When enabled by setting the appropriate BCM[1:0]
         bits, the bit clock mode (BCM) function overrides the default master mode bit clock generator to
         produce the bit clock frequency shown in the table below:

         Table 37 Master Mode BCLK Frequency Control
         The BCM mode bit clock generator produces 16 or 24 bit clock cycles per sample. The number of bit
         clock cycles per sample in this mode is determined by the word length bits (WL[1:0]) in the Digital
         Audio Interface Format register (R7). When these bits are set to 00, there will be 16 bit clock cycles
         per sample. When these bits are set to 01, 10 or 11, there will be 24 bit clock cycles per sample.
         Please refer to Figure 24.
         The BCM generator uses the ADCLRC signal, hence the ADCLRC signal must be enabled when
         using bit clock mode. To enable the ADCLRC signal, either the ADC must be powered up or, if the
         ADC is not in use, the LRCM bit must be set to enable both the ADCLRC and DACLRC signals when
         either the ADC or the DAC is enabled.
         When the BCM function is enabled, the following restrictions apply:
         1. The bit clock invert (BCLKINV) function is not available.
         2. The DAC and ADC must be operated at the same sample rate.
         3. DSP late digital audio interface mode is not available and must not be enabled.

                CLOCK OUTPUT
                By default ADCLRC (pin 9) is the ADC word clock input/output. Under the control of ADCLRM[1:0],
                register 27(1Bh) bits [8:7] the ADCLRC pin may be configured as a clock output. If ADCLRM is 01, 10
                or 11 then ADCLRC pin is always an output even in slave mode or when TRI = ‘1’, (see Table 38).
                The ADC then uses the DACLRC pin as its LRCLK in both master and slave modes.

 CLOCKING AND SAMPLE RATES
                The WM8750BL supports a wide range of master clock frequencies on the MCLK pin, and can
                generate many commonly used audio sample rates directly from the master clock. The ADC and DAC
                do not need to run at the same sample rate; several different combinations are possible.
                There are two clocking modes:
                     ‘Normal’ mode supports master clocks of 128fs, 192fs, 256fs, 384fs, and their multiples
                      (Note: fs refers to the ADC or DAC sample rate, whichever is faster)
                     USB mode supports 12MHz or 24MHz master clocks. This mode is intended for use in
                      systems with a USB interface, and eliminates the need for an external PLL to generate
                      another clock frequency for the audio codec.

                Table 39 Clocking and Sample Rate Control
                The clocking of the WM8750BL is controlled using the CLKDIV2, USB, and SR control bits. Setting
                the CLKDIV2 bit divides MCLK by two internally. The USB bit selects between ‘Normal’ and USB
                mode. Each value of SR[4:0] selects one combination of MCLK division ratios and hence one
                combination of sample rates (see next page). Since all sample rates are generated by dividing MCLK,
                their accuracy depends on the accuracy of MCLK. If MCLK changes, the sample rates change
                proportionately.
                Note that some sample rates (e.g. 44.1kHz in USB mode) are approximated, i.e. they differ from their
                target value by a very small amount. This is not audible, as the maximum deviation is only 0.27%
                (8.0214kHz instead of 8kHz in USB mode). By comparison, a half-tone step corresponds to a 5.9%
                change in pitch.
                The SR[4:0] bits must be set to configure the appropriate ADC and DAC sample rates in both master
                and slave mode.
                Note: When the ADC is configured at a sample rate of 88.2, 88.235 or 96kHZ (SR[4:0]), the ADC right
                channel data output will be delayed by one sample relative to the left channel data.

 CONTROL INTERFACE
                SELECTION OF CONTROL MODE
                The WM8750BL is controlled by writing to registers through a serial control interface. A control word
                consists of 16 bits. The first 7 bits (B15 to B9) are address bits that select which control register is
                accessed. The remaining 9 bits (B8 to B0) are data bits, corresponding to the 9 bits in each control
                register. The control interface can operate as either a 3-wire or 2-wire MPU interface. The MODE pin
                selects the interface format.

                2-WIRE SERIAL CONTROL MODE
                The WM8750BL supports software control via a 2-wire serial bus. Many devices can be controlled by
                the same bus, and each device has a unique 7-bit address (this is not the same as the 7-bit address
                of each register in the WM8750BL).
                The WM8750BL operates as a slave device only. The controller indicates the start of data transfer
                with a high to low transition on SDIN while SCLK remains high. This indicates that a device address
                and data will follow. All devices on the 2-wire bus respond to the start condition and shift in the next
                eight bits on SDIN (7-bit address + Read/Write bit, MSB first). If the device address received matches
                the address of the WM8750BL and the R/W bit is ‘0’, indicating a write, then the WM8750BL responds
                by pulling SDIN low on the next clock pulse (ACK). If the address is not recognised or the R/W bit is
                ‘1’, the WM8750BL returns to the idle condition and wait for a new start condition and valid address.
                Once the WM8750BL has acknowledged a correct address, the controller sends the first byte of
                control data (B15 to B8, i.e. the WM8750BL register address plus the first bit of register data). The
                WM8750BL then acknowledges the first data byte by pulling SDIN low for one clock pulse. The
                controller then sends the second byte of control data (B7 to B0, i.e. the remaining 8 bits of register
                data), and the WM8750BL acknowledges again by pulling SDIN low.
                The transfer of data is complete when there is a low to high transition on SDIN while SCLK is high.
                After receiving a complete address and data sequence the WM8750BL returns to the idle state and
                waits for another start condition. If a start or stop condition is detected out of sequence at any point
                during data transfer (i.e. SDIN changes while SCLK is high), the device jumps to the idle condition.

POWER SUPPLIES
               The WM8750BL can use up to four separate power supplies:
                     AVDD / AGND: Analogue supply, powers all analogue functions except the headphone drivers.
                      AVDD can range from 1.8V to 3.6V and has the most significant impact on overall power
                      consumption (except for power consumed in the headphone). A large AVDD slightly improves
                      audio quality.
                     HPVDD / HPGND: Headphone supply, powers the headphone drivers. HPVDD is normally tied
                      to AVDD, but it requires separate layout and decoupling capacitors to curb harmonic distortion.
                      If HPVDD is lower than AVDD, the output signal may be clipped.
                     DCVDD: Digital core supply, powers all digital functions except the audio and control interfaces.
                      DCVDD can range from 1.42V to 3.6V, and has no effect on audio quality. The return path for
                      DCVDD is DGND, which is shared with DBVDD.
                     DBVDD: Digital buffer supply, powers the audio and control interface buffers. This makes it
                      possible to run the digital core at very low voltages, saving power, while interfacing to other
                      digital devices using a higher voltage. DBVDD draws much less power than DCVDD, and has
                      no effect on audio quality. DBVDD can range from 1.8V to 3.6V. The return path for DBVDD is
                      DGND, which is shared with DCVDD.
               It is possible to use the same supply voltage on all four. However, digital and analogue supplies
               should be routed and decoupled separately to keep digital switching noise out of the analogue signal
               paths.
POWER MANAGEMENT
               The WM8750BL has two control registers that allow users to select which functions are active. For
               minimum power consumption, unused functions should be disabled. To avoid any pop or click noise,
               it is important to enable or disable functions in the correct order (see Applications Information).
               VMIDSEL is the enable for the Vmid reference, which defaults to disabled and can be enabled as a

         STOPPING THE MASTER CLOCK
         In order to minimise power consumed in the digital core of the WM8750BL, the master clock may be
         stopped in Standby and OFF modes. If this cannot be done externally at the clock source, the
         DIGENB bit (R25, bit 0) can be set to stop the MCLK signal from propagating into the device core. In
         Standby mode, setting DIGENB will typically provide an additional power saving on DCVDD of 20uA.
         However, since setting DIGENB has no effect on the power consumption of other system components
         external to the WM8750BL, it is preferable to disable the master clock at its source wherever
         possible.
               REGISTER             BIT        LABEL          DEFAULT                   DESCRIPTION

         Table 44 ADC and DAC Oversampling Rate Selection
         NOTE: Before DIGENB can be set, the control bits ADCL, ADCR, DACL and DACR must be set
         to zero and a waiting time of 1ms must be observed. Any failure to follow this procedure may
         prevent DACs and ADCs from re-starting correctly.
         SAVING POWER BY REDUCING OVERSAMPLING RATE
         The default mode of operation of the ADC and DAC digital filters is in 128x oversampling mode.
         Under the control of ADCOSR and DACOSR the oversampling rate may be halved. This will result in
         a slight decrease in noise performance but will also reduce the power consumption of the device. In
         USB mode ADCOSR must be set to 0, i.e. 128x oversampling.

         SAVING POWER AT HIGHER SUPPLY VOLTAGES
         The analogue supplies to the WM8750BL can run from 1.8V to 3.6V. By default, all analogue circuitry
         on the device is optimized to run at 3.3V. This set-up is also good for all other supply voltages down
         to 1.8V. At lower voltages, performance can be improved by increasing the bias current. If low power
         operation is preferred the bias current can be left at the default setting. This is controlled as shown
         below.

DIGITAL FILTER CHARACTERISTICS
                             The ADC and DAC employ different digital filters. There are 4 types of digital filter, called Type 0, 1, 2
                             and 3. The performance of Types 0 and 1 is listed in the table below, the responses of all filters is
                             shown in the proceeding pages.

 HIGHPASS FILTER
 The WM8750BL has a selectable digital highpass filter in the ADC filter path to remove DC offsets. The filter response is
 characterised by the following polynomial:
                                                                    H(z) =          1 - z-1

LINE INPUT CONFIGURATION
                 When LINPUT1/RINPUT1 or LINPUT2/RINPUT2 are used as line inputs, the microphone boost and
                 ALC functions should normally be disabled.
                 In order to avoid clipping, the user must ensure that the input signal does not exceed AVDD. This
                 may require a potential divider circuit in some applications. It is also recommended to remove RF
                 interference picked up on any cables using a simple first-order RC filter, as high-frequency
                 components in the input signal may otherwise cause aliasing distortion in the audio band. AC signals
                 with no DC bias should be fed to the WM8750BL through a DC blocking capacitor, e.g. 1F.

                 For interfacing to a microphone, the ALC function should be enabled and the microphone boost
                 switched on. Microphones held close to a speaker’s mouth would normally use the 13dB gain setting,
                 while tabletop or room microphones would need a 29dB boost.
                 The recommended application circuit is shown above. R1 and R2 form part of the biasing network
                 (refer to Microphone Bias section). R1 connected to MICBIAS is necessary only for electret type
                 microphones that require a voltage bias. R2 should always be present to prevent the microphone
                 input from charging to a high voltage which may damage the microphone on connection. R1 and R2
                 should be large so as not to attenuate the signal from the microphone, which can have source
                 impedance greater than 2kOhm. C1 together with the source impedance of the microphone and the
                 WM8750BL input impedance forms an RF filter. C2 is a DC blocking capacitor to allow the
                 microphone to be biased at a different DC voltage to the MICIN signal.
MINIMISING POP NOISE AT THE ANALOGUE OUTPUTS
                 To minimise any pop or click noise when the system is powered up or down, the following procedures
                 are recommended.
                 POWER UP
                    Switch on power supplies. By default the WM8750BL is in Standby Mode, the DAC is
                     digitally muted and the Audio Interface, Line outputs and Headphone outputs are all OFF
                     (DACMU = 1 Power Management registers 1 and 2 are all zeros).
                    Enable Vmid and VREF.
                    Enable DACs as required
                    Enable line and / or headphone output buffers as required.
                    Set DACMU = 0 to soft-un-mute the audio DACs.
                 POWER DOWN
                    Set DACMU = 1 to soft-mute the audio DACs.
                    Disable all output buffers.
                    Switch off the power supplies.
                                                                                             PD, Rev 4.1, August 2012
