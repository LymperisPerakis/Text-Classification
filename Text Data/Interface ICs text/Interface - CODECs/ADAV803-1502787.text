During asynchronous sample rate conversion, data can be
converted at the same sample rate or at different sample rates.
The simplest approach to an asynchronous sample rate
conversion is to use a zero-order hold between the two                                                           TIME DOMAIN OF fS_IN SAMPLES

is never equal to T1, nor is the ratio between T2 and T1
rational. As a result, samples at fS_OUT are repeated or dropped,

The frequency domain shows the wide side lobes that result
from this error when the sampling of fS_OUT is convolved with

CRCError           This bit is the error flag for the channel status CRCError check. This bit does not clear until the receiver error register is read.
NoStream           This bit is set if there is no AES3/S/PDIF stream present at the AES3/S/PDIF receiver. Once read, it remains high and does
                   not generate an interrupt unless it changes state.
BiPhase/Parity     This bit is set if a biphase or parity error occurred in the AES3/S/PDIF stream. This bit is not cleared until the register is read.
Lock               This bit is set if the PLL has locked or cleared when the PLL loses lock. Once read, it remains in its state and does not
                   generate an interrupt unless it changes state.

TOO_SLOW             This bit is set when the clock to the SRC is too slow, that is, there are not enough clock cycles to complete the
                     internal convolution.
OVRL                 This bit is set when the left output data of the sample rate converter has gone over the full-scale range and has been
                     clipped. This bit is not cleared until the register is read.
OVRR                 This bit is set when the right output data of the sample rate converter has gone over the full-scale range and has

RxERROR          This bit is set if one of the AES3/S/PDIF receiver interrupts is asserted, and the host should immediately read the receiver
