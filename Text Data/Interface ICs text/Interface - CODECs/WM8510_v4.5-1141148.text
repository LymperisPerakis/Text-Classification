ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS
Absolute Maximum Ratings are stress ratings only. Permanent damage to the device may be caused by continuously
operating at or beyond these limits. Device functional operating limits and guaranteed performance specifications are given
under Electrical Characteristics at the test conditions specified.
                ESD Sensitive Device. This device is manufactured on a CMOS process. It is therefore generically susceptible to
                damage from excessive static voltages. Proper ESD precautions must be taken during handling and storage of this
                device.
Wolfson tests its package types according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020B for Moisture Sensitivity to determine acceptable storage
conditions prior to surface mount assembly. These levels are:
MSL1 = unlimited floor life at <30°C / 85% Relative Humidity. Not normally stored in moisture barrier bag.
MSL2 = out of bag storage for 1 year at <30°C / 60% Relative Humidity. Supplied in moisture barrier bag.
MSL3 = out of bag storage for 168 hours at <30°C / 60% Relative Humidity. Supplied in moisture barrier bag.
The Moisture Sensitivity Level for each package type is specified in Ordering Information.

TERMINOLOGY
1. MICN input only in single ended microphone configuration. Maximum input signal to MICP without distortion is -3dBV.
2. Hold Time is the length of time between a signal detected being too quiet and beginning to ramp up the gain. It does
   not apply to ramping down the gain when the signal is too loud, which happens without a delay.
3. Ramp-up and Ramp-Down times are defined as the time it takes the PGA to change its gain by 6dB.
4. All hold, ramp-up and ramp-down times scale proportionally with MCLK
5. Signal-to-noise ratio (dB) – SNR is a measure of the difference in level between the full scale output and the output with
   no signal applied. (No Auto-zero or Automute function is employed in achieving these results).
6. THD (dB) – THD is a ratio, of the rms values, of Noise Signal.
7. The maximum output voltage can be limited by the speaker power supply. If MONOBOOST=1 then SPKVDD should
   be 1.5xAVDD or higher to prevent clipping taking place in the output stage.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION
                The WM8510 is a low power audio codec combining a high quality mono audio DAC and ADC, with
                flexible line and microphone input and output processing. Applications for this device are anticipated
                to include VoIP telephones, digital telephones, conference speaker phones and mobile hands-free
                kits.
                FEATURES
                The chip offers great flexibility in use, and so can support many different modes of operation as
                follows:
                MICROPHONE INPUTS
                Two microphone inputs are provided, allowing for either a differential microphone input or a single
                ended microphone to be connected. These inputs have a user programmable gain range of -12dB to
                +35.25dB using internal resistors. After the input PGA stage comes a boost stage which can add a
                further 20dB of gain. A microphone bias is output from the chip which can be used to bias the
                microphones. The signal routing can be configured to allow manual adjustment of mic levels, or to
                allow the ALC loop to control the level of mic signal that is transmitted.
                Total gain through the microphone paths of up to +55.25dB can be selected.
                FLEXIBLE MIC2 INPUT
                The flexible configuration of the mono input, MIC2, with integrated on-chip resistors allows several
                analogue signals to be summed into the single input if required. This can be used as a microphone,
                line input or an input for warning tones (beep) etc. The output from this circuit can be summed into
                the mono output and/or the speaker output paths, so allowing for mixing of audio with ‘backing music’
                etc as required.
                SIDETONE ATTENUATION
                A bypass path allows analog signals to travel directly to the outputs without passing through the ADC
                and DAC. For side tone features in telephone handsets this analogue bypass can be attenuated.
                PGA AND ALC OPERATION
                A programmable gain amplifier is provided in the input path to the ADC. This may be used manually
                or in conjunction with a mixed analogue/digital automatic level control (ALC) which keeps the
                recording volume constant.
                ADC
                The mono ADC uses a multi-bit high-order oversampling architecture to deliver optimum
                performance with low power consumption. Various sample rates are supported, from the 8ks/s rate
                typically used in voice dictation, up to the 48ks/s rate used in high quality audio applications.
                HI-FI DAC
                The hi-fi DAC provides high quality audio playback suitable for all portable mono audio type
                applications.
                DIGITAL FILTERING
                Advanced Sigma Delta Converters are used along with digital decimation and interpolation filters to
                give high quality audio at sample rates from 8ks/s to 48ks/s.
                Application specific digital filters are also available which help to reduce the effect of specific noise
                sources such as ‘wind noise’. The filters include a programmable ADC high pass filter and a
                programmable ADC notch filter.
                OUTPUT MIXING AND VOLUME ADJUST
                Flexible mixing is provided on the outputs of the device; a mixer is provided for the speaker outputs,
                and an additional mono summer for the mono output. These mixers allow the output of the DAC, the
                output of the ADC volume control and the MIC2 input to be combined. The output volume can be
                adjusted using the integrated digital volume control and there is additional analogue gain adjustment
                capability on the speaker output.
                                                                                           PD, Rev 4.5, September 2008

WM8510                                                                                                  Production Data
                 AUDIO INTERFACES
                 The WM8510 has a standard audio interface, to support the transmission of audio data to and from
                 the chip. This interface is a 4 wire standard audio interface which supports a number of audio data
                 formats including I2S, DSP Mode, MSB-First, left justified and MSB-First, right justified, and can
                 operate in master or slave modes.
                 CONTROL INTERFACES
                 To allow full software control over all its features, the WM8510 offers a choice of 2 or 3 wire MPU
                 control interface. It is fully compatible and an ideal partner for a wide range of industry standard
                 microprocessors, controllers and DSPs. The selection between 2-wire mode and 3-wire mode is
                 determined by the state of the MODE pin. If MODE is high then 3-wire control mode is selected, if
                 MODE is low then 2-wire control mode is selected.
                 In 2 wire mode, only slave operation is supported, and the address of the device is fixed as 0011010.
                 CLOCKING SCHEMES
                 WM8510 offers the normal audio DAC clocking scheme operation, where 256fs MCLK is provided to
                 the DAC/ADC.
                 However, a PLL is also included which may be used to generate the internal master clock frequency
                 in the event that this is not available from the system controller. This PLL uses an input clock,
                 typically the 12MHz USB or ilink clock, to generate high quality audio clocks. If this PLL is not
                 required for generation of these clocks, it can be reconfigured to generate alternative clocks which
                 may then be output on the CSB/GPIO pin and used elsewhere in the system.
                 POWER CONTROL
                 The design of the WM8510 has given much attention to power consumption without compromising
                 performance. It operates at low supply voltages, and includes the facility to power off any unused
                 parts of the circuitry under software control, includes standby and power off modes.
INPUT SIGNAL PATH
                 The WM8510 has 3 flexible analogue inputs for two separate microphone inputs. These inputs can
                 be used in a variety of ways. The input signal path before the ADC has a flexible PGA block which
                 then feeds into a gain boost/mixer stage.
                 MICROPHONE INPUTS
                 The WM8510 can accommodate a variety of microphone configurations including single ended and
                 pseudo-differential inputs. The inputs through the MICN, MICP and optionally MIC2 pins are
                 amplified through the input PGA as shown in Figure 6.
                 A pseudo differential input is the preferential configuration where the positive terminal of the input
                 PGA is connected to the MICP input pin by setting MICP2INPPGA=1. The microphone ground
                 should then be connected to MICN (when MICN2INPPGA=1) or optionally to MIC2 (when
                 MIC2_2INPPGA=1) input pins.
                 Alternatively a single ended microphone can be connected to the MICN input with MICN2INPPGA set
                 to 1. The non-inverting terminal of the input PGA should be connected internally to VMID by setting
                 MICP2INPPGA to 0.

       INPUT PGA VOLUME CONTROL
       The input microphone PGA has a gain range from -12dB to +35.25dB in 0.75dB steps. The gain
       from the MICN input to the PGA output and from the MIC2 amplifier to the PGA output are always
       common and controlled by the register bits INPPGAVOL[5:0]. These register bits also affect the
       MICP pin when MICP2INPPGA=1.
       When the Automatic Level Control (ALC) is enabled the input PGA gain is then controlled
       automatically and the INPPGAVOL bits should not be used.

       MIC 2 INPUT
       A second mic input circuit, MIC2 (Figure 7) is provided which consists of an amplifier which can be
       configured either as an inverting buffer for a single input signal or as a mixer/summer for multiple
       inputs with the use of external resistors. The circuit is enabled by the register bit MIC2EN.
       Figure 7 MIC2 Input Circuit
       The MIC2MODE register bit controls the input mode of operation:
       In buffer mode (MIC2MODE=0) the switch labelled MIC2SW in Figure 7 is open and the signal at the
       MIC2 pin will be buffered and inverted through the MIC2 circuit using only the internal components.

                In mixer mode (MIC2MODE=1) the on-chip input resistor is bypassed, this allows the user to sum in
                multiple inputs with the use of external resistors. When used in this mode there will be gain
                variations through this path from part to part due to the variation of the internal 20kΩ resistors relative
                to the higher tolerance external resistors.

       capability for MICBIAS is 3mA. The external biasing resistors therefore must be large enough to limit
       the MICBIAS current to 3mA.

                             The WM8510 uses a multi-bit, oversampled sigma-delta ADC channel. The use of multi-bit feedback
                             and high oversampling rates reduces the effects of jitter and high frequency noise. The ADC Full
                             Scale input level is proportional to AVDD. With a 3.3V supply voltage, the full scale level is 1.0Vrms.
                             Any voltage greater than full scale may overload the ADC and cause distortion.
                             ADC DIGITAL FILTERS
                             The ADC filters perform true 24 bit signal processing to convert the raw multi-bit oversampled data
                             from the ADC to the correct sampling frequency to be output on the digital audio interface. The digital
                             filter path is illustrated in Figure 10.

       The polarity of the output signal can also be changed under software control using the ADCPOL
       register bit. The oversampling rate of the ADC can be adjusted using the ADCOSR register bit.
       With ADCOSR=0 the oversample rate is 64x which gives lowest power operation and when
       ADCOSR=1 the oversample rate is 128x which gives best performance.

                PROGRAMMABLE NOTCH FILTER
                A programmable notch filter is provided. This filter has a variable centre frequency and bandwidth,
                programmable via two coefficients, a0 and a1. These coefficients should be converted to 2’s
                complement numbers to determine the register values. a0 and a1 are represented by the register bits
                NFA0[13:0] and NFA1[13:0]. Because these coefficient values require four register writes to setup
                there is an NFU (Notch Filter Update) flag which should be set only when all four registers are setup.

                The coefficients are calculated as follows:

                 NFA1 = -a1 x 212

INPUT LIMITER / AUTOMATIC LEVEL CONTROL (ALC)
                  The WM8510 has an automatic PGA gain control circuit, which can function as an input peak limiter
                  or as an automatic level control (ALC).
                  The Automatic Level Control (ALC) provides continuous adjustment of the input PGA in response to
                  the amplitude of the input signal. A digital peak detector monitors the input signal amplitude and
                  compares it to a register defined threshold level (ALCLVL).
                  If the signal is below the threshold, the ALC will increase the gain of the PGA at a rate set by
                  ALCDCY. If the signal is above the threshold, the ALC will reduce the gain of the PGA at a rate set
                  by ALCATK.
                  The ALC has two modes selected by the ALCMODE register: normal mode and peak limiter mode.
                  The ALC/limiter function is enabled by setting the register bit R32[8] ALCSEL.

                When the ALC is disabled, the input PGA remains at the last controlled value of the ALC. An input
                gain update must be made by writing to the INPPGAVOLL/R register bits.

                        NORMAL MODE
                        In normal mode, the ALC will attempt to maintain a constant signal level by increasing or decreasing
                        the gain of the PGA. The following diagram shows an example of this.

                         LIMITER MODE
                         In limiter mode, the ALC will reduce peaks that go above the threshold level, but will not increase the
                         PGA gain beyond the starting level. The starting level is the PGA gain setting when the ALC is
                         enabled in limiter mode. If the ALC is started in limiter mode, this is the gain setting of the PGA at
                         start-up. If the ALC is switched into limiter mode after running in ALC mode, the starting gain will be
                         the gain at switchover. The diagram below shows an example of limiter mode.

                         ATTACK AND DECAY TIMES
                         The attack and decay times set the update times for the PGA gain. The attack time is the time
                         constant used when the gain is reducing. The decay time is the time constant used when the gain is
                         increasing. In limiter mode, the time constants are faster than in ALC mode. The time constants are
                         shown below in terms of a single gain step, a change of 6dB and a change of 90% of the PGAs gain
                         range.
                         Note that, these times will vary slightly depending on the sample rate used (specified by the SR
                         register).

        set to whilst under the control of the ALC. This has no effect on the PGA when ALC is not enabled.

        Table 17 ALC Max/Min Gain
        In normal mode, ALCMAX sets the maximum boost which can be applied to the signal. In limiter
        mode, ALCMAX will normally have no effect (assuming the starting gain value is less than the
        maximum gain specified by ALCMAX) because the maximum gain is set at the starting gain level.
        ALCMIN sets the minimum gain value which can be applied to the signal.

                Note that if the ALC gain setting strays outside the ALC operating range, either by starting the ALC
                outside of the range or changing the ALCMAX or ALCMIN settings during operation, the ALC will
                immediately adjust the gain to return to the ALC operating range. It is recommended that the ALC
                starting gain is set between the ALCMAX and ALCMIN limits.
                ALC HOLD TIME (NORMAL MODE ONLY)
                In Normal mode, the ALC has an adjustable hold time which sets a time delay before the ALC begins
                its decay phase (gain increasing). The hold time is set by the ALCHLD register.

                Table 20 ALC Hold Time
                If the hold time is exceeded this indicates that the signal has reached a new average level and the
                ALC will increase the gain to adjust for that new average level. If the signal goes above the threshold
                during the hold period, the hold phase is abandoned and the ALC returns to normal operation.

       PEAK LIMITER
       To prevent clipping when a large signal occurs just after a period of quiet, the ALC circuit includes a
       limiter function. If the ADC input signal exceeds 87.5% of full scale (–1.16dB), the PGA gain is
       ramped down at the maximum attack rate (as when ALCATK = 0000), until the signal level falls
       below 87.5% of full scale. This function is automatically enabled whenever the ALC is enabled.
       Note: If ALCATK = 0000, then the limiter makes no difference to the operation of the ALC. It is
       designed to prevent clipping when long attack times are used.
       NOISE GATE (NORMAL MODE ONLY)
       When the signal is very quiet and consists mainly of noise, the ALC function may cause “noise
       pumping”, i.e. loud hissing noise during silence periods. The WM8510 has a noise gate function that
       prevents noise pumping by comparing the signal level at the input pins against a noise gate
       threshold, NGTH. The noise gate cuts in when:
       Signal level at ADC [dBFS] < NGTH [dBFS] + PGA gain [dB] + Mic Boost gain [dB]
       This is equivalent to:
       Signal level at input pin [dBFS] < NGTH [dBFS]
       The PGA gain is then held constant (preventing it from ramping up as it normally would when the
       signal is quiet).
       The table below summarises the noise gate control register. The NGTH control bits set the noise
       gate threshold with respect to the ADC full-scale range. The threshold is adjusted in 6dB steps.
       Levels at the extremes of the range may cause inappropriate operation, so care should be taken with
       set–up of the function. The noise gate only operates in conjunction with the ALC and cannot be used
       in limiter mode.

OUTPUT SIGNAL PATH
                          The WM8510 output signal paths consist of digital application filters, up-sampling filters, a Hi-Fi DAC,
                          analogue mixers, speaker and mono output drivers. The digital filters and DAC are enabled by bit
                          DACEN. The mixers and output drivers can be separately enabled by individual control bits (see
                          Analogue Outputs). Thus it is possible to utilise the analogue mixing and amplification provided by
                          the WM8510, irrespective of whether the DACs are running or not.
                          The WM8510 DAC receives digital input data on the DACDAT pin. The digital filter block processes
                          the data to provide the following functions:
                          •    Digital volume control
                          •    A digital peak limiter
                          •    Sigma-Delta Modulation
                          The high performance sigma-delta audio DAC converts the digital data into an analogue signal.

                            The analogue output from the DAC can then be mixed with the MIC2 analogue input and the ADC
                            analogue input. The mix is fed to the output drivers, SPKOUTP/N, and MONOOUT.
                            MONOOUT: can drive a 16Ω or 32Ω headphone or line output or can be a buffered version of VMID
                            (When MONOMUTE=1).
                            SPKOUTP/N: can drive a 16Ω or 32Ω stereo headphone or stereo line output, or an 8Ω BTL mono

       The WM8510 also has a Soft Mute function, which gradually attenuates the volume of the digital
       signal to zero. When removed, the gain will ramp back up to the digital gain setting. This function is
       enabled by default. To play back an audio signal, it must first be disabled by setting the DACMU bit
       to zero.

       The digital audio data is converted to oversampled bit streams in the on-chip, true 24-bit digital
       interpolation filters. The bitstream data enters a multi-bit, sigma-delta DAC, which converts it to a
       high quality analogue audio signal. The multi-bit DAC architecture reduces high frequency noise and
       sensitivity to clock jitter.
       The DAC output defaults to non-inverted. Setting DACPOL will invert the DAC output phase.
       AUTOMUTE
       The DAC has an automute function which applies an analogue mute when 1024 consecutive zeros
       are detected. The mute is release as soon as a non-zero sample is detected. Automute can be
       disabled using the AMUTE control bit.

       DAC OUTPUT LIMITER
       The WM8510 has a digital output limiter function. The operation of this is shown in Figure 19. In this
       diagram the upper graph shows the envelope of the input/output signals and the lower graph shows
       the gain characteristic.

                The limiter has a programmable upper threshold which is close to 0dB. Referring to Table 30, in
                normal operation (LIMBOOST=000 => limit only) signals below this threshold are unaffected by the
                limiter. Signals above the upper threshold are attenuated at a specific attack rate (set by the
                LIMATK register bits) until the signal falls below the threshold. The limiter also has a lower threshold
                1dB below the upper threshold. When the signal falls below the lower threshold the signal is
                amplified at a specific decay rate (controlled by LIMDCY register bits) until a gain of 0dB is reached.
                Both threshold levels are controlled by the LIMLVL register bits. The upper threshold is 0.5dB above
                the value programmed by LIMLVL and the lower threshold is 0.5dB below the LIMLVL value.
                VOLUME BOOST
                The limiter has programmable upper gain which boosts signals below the threshold to compress the
                dynamic range of the signal and increase its perceived loudness. This operates as an ALC function
                with limited boost capability. The volume boost is from 0dB to +12dB in 1dB steps, controlled by the
                LIMBOOST register bits.
                The output limiter volume boost can also be used as a stand alone digital gain boost when the limiter
                is disabled.

ANALOGUE OUTPUTS
                The WM8510 has a single MONO output and two outputs SPKOUTP and SPOUTN for driving a
                mono BTL speaker. These analogue output stages are supplied from SPKVDD and are capable of
                driving up to 1.5V rms signals (equivalent to 3V rms into a bridge tied speaker) as shown in Figure
                20.
                Figure 20 Speaker and Mono Analogue Outputs
                The Mono and speaker outputs have output driving stages which can be controlled by the register
                bits MONOBOOST and SPKBOOST respectively. Each output stage has a selectable gain boost of
                1.5x. When this boost is enabled the output DC level is also level shifted (from AVDD/2 to
                1.5xAVDD/2) to prevent the signal from clipping. A dedicated amplifier, as shown in Figure 20, is
                used to perform the DC level shift operation. This buffer must be enabled using the BUFDCOPEN
                register bit for this operating mode. It should also be noted that if SPKVDD is not equal to or greater
                than 1.5xAVDD this boost mode may result in signals clipping. Table 30 summarises the effect of
                the SPKBOOST/MONOBOOST control bits.

       SPKOUTP/SPKOUTN OUTPUTS
       The SPKOUT pins can drive a single bridge tied 8Ω speaker or two headphone loads of 16Ω or 32Ω
       or a line output (see Headphone Output and Line Output sections, respectively). The signal to be
       output on SKPKOUT comes from the Speaker Mixer circuit and can be any combination of the DAC
       output, the Bypass path (output of the boost stage) and the MIC2 input. The Bypass path has the
       option of 0dB or -10dB attenuation, selected by the SPKATTN register bit. The SPKOUTP/N volume
       is controlled by the SPKVOL register bits. Note that gains over 0dB may cause clipping if the signal
       is large. The SPKMUTE register bit causes the speaker outputs to be muted (the output DC level is
       driven out). The output pins remains at the same DC level (VMIDOP), so that no click noise is
       produced when muting or un-muting.
       The SPKOUTN pin always drives out an inverted version of the SPKOUTP signal.

       ENABLING THE OUTPUTS
       Each analogue output of the WM8510 can be separately enabled or disabled. The analogue mixer
       associated with each output has a separate enable. All outputs are disabled by default. To save
       power, unused parts of the WM8510 should remain disabled.
       Outputs can be enabled at any time, but it is not recommended to do so when BUFIO is disabled
       (BUFIOEN=0), as this may cause pop noise (see “Power Management” and “Applications
       Information” sections).

       UNUSED ANALOGUE INPUTS/OUTPUTS
       Whenever an analogue input/output is disabled, it remains connected to a voltage source (either
       AVDD/2 or 1.5xAVDD/2 as appropriate) through a resistor. This helps to prevent pop noise when the
       output is re-enabled. The resistance between the voltage buffer and the output pins can be controlled
       using the VROI control bit. The default impedance is low, so that any capacitors on the outputs can
       charge up quickly at start-up. If a high impedance is desired for disabled outputs, VROI can then be
       set to 1, increasing the resistance to about 30kΩ.

OUTPUT SWITCH
              When the device is configured with a 2-wire interface the CSB/GPIO pin can be used as a switch
              control input to automatically disable the speaker outputs and enable the mono output. For example
              when a line is plugged into a jack socket. In this mode, enabled by setting GPIOSEL=001, pin
              CSB/GPIO switches between mono and speaker outputs (e.g. when pin 12 is connected to a
              mechanical switch in the headphone socket to detect plug-in). The GPIOPOL bit reverses the polarity
              of the CSB/GPIO input pin.
              Note that the speaker outputs and the mono output must be enabled for this function to work (see
              Table 39). The CSB/GPIO pin has an internal de-bounce circuit when in this mode in order to prevent
              the output enables from toggling multiple times due to input glitches. This debounce circuit is
              clocked from a slow clock with period 221 x MCLK, enabled using the SLOWCLKEN register bit.

              The speaker outputs can drive very large currents. To protect the WM8510 from overheating a

                        HEADPHONE OUTPUT
                        The speaker outputs can drive a 16Ω or 32Ω headphone load, either through DC blocking capacitors,
                        or DC coupled without any capacitor.
Headphone Output using DC Blocking Capacitors:                     DC Coupled Headphone Output:
Figure 23 Recommended Headphone Output Configurations
                        When DC blocking capacitors are used, then their capacitance and the load resistance together
                        determine the lower cut-off frequency, fc. Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the bass
                        response. Smaller capacitance values will diminish the bass response. Assuming a 16Ω load and
                        C1, C2 = 220µF:
                        fc = 1 / 2π RLC1 = 1 / (2π x 16Ω x 220µF) = 45 Hz
                        In the DC coupled configuration, the headphone “ground” is connected to the MONOOUT pin. The
                        MONOOUT pin can be configured as a DC output driver by setting the MONOMUTE register bit. The
                        DC voltage on MONOOUT in this configuration is equal to the DC offset on the SPKOUTP and
                        SPKOUTN pins therefore no DC blocking capacitors are required. This saves space and material
                        cost in portable applications.
                        It is recommended to connect the DC coupled outputs only to headphones, and not to the line input
                        of another device. Although the built-in short circuit protection will prevent any damage to the
                        headphone outputs, such a connection may be noisy, and may not function properly if the other
                        device is grounded.
                        MONO OUTPUT
                        The mono output, can be used as a line output, a headphone output or as a pseudo ground for cap-
                        less driving of loads by SPKOUT. Recommended external components are shown below.
                        Figure 24 Recommended Circuit for Line Output
                        The DC blocking capacitors and the load resistance together determine the lower cut-off frequency,
                        fc. Assuming a 10 kΩ load and C1 = 1µF:
                        fc = 1 / 2π (RL+R1) C1 = 1 / (2π x 10.1kΩ x 1µF) = 16 Hz
                        Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the bass response. Smaller values of C1 will diminish
                        the bass response. The function of R1 is to protect the line outputs from damage when used
                        improperly.

DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACES
                 The audio interface has four pins:
                       •    ADCDAT: ADC data output
                       •    DACDAT: DAC data input
                       •    FRAME: Data alignment clock
                       •    BCLK: Bit clock, for synchronisation
                 The clock signals BCLK, and FRAME can be outputs when the WM8510 operates as a master, or
                 inputs when it is a slave (see Master and Slave Mode Operation, below).
                 Five different audio data formats are supported:
                       •    Left justified
                       •    Right justified
                       •    I 2S
                       •    DSP mode A
                 All of these modes are MSB first. They are described in Audio Data Formats, below. Refer to the
                 Electrical Characteristic section for timing information.
                 MASTER AND SLAVE MODE OPERATION
                 The WM8510 audio interface may be configured as either master or slave. As a master interface
                 device the WM8510 generates BCLK and FRAME and thus controls sequencing of the data transfer
                 on ADCDAT and DACDAT. To set the device to master mode register bit MS should be set high. In
                 slave mode (MS=0), the WM8510 responds with data to clocks it receives over the digital audio
                 interfaces.
                 AUDIO DATA FORMATS
                 In Left Justified mode, the MSB is available on the first rising edge of BCLK following an FRAME
                 transition. The other bits up to the LSB are then transmitted in order. Depending on word length,
                 BCLK frequency and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles before each FRAME transition.
                 Figure 25 Left Justified Audio Interface (assuming n-bit word length)
                 In Right Justified mode, the LSB is available on the last rising edge of BCLK before a FRAME
                 transition. All other bits are transmitted before (MSB first). Depending on word length, BCLK
                 frequency and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles after each FRAME transition.

       AUDIO INTERFACE CONTROL
       The register bits controlling audio format, word length and master / slave mode are summarised
       below. Each audio interface can be controlled individually.
       Register bit MS selects audio interface operation in master or slave mode. In Master mode BCLK,
       and FRAME are outputs. The frequency of BCLK and FRAME in master mode are controlled with
       BCLKDIV. These are divided down versions of master clock. This may result in short BCLK pulses
       at the end of a frame if there is a non-integer ratio of BCLKs to FRAME clocks.

                Setting the LOOPBACK register bit enables digital loopback. When this bit is set the output data
                from the ADC audio interface is fed directly into the DAC data input.
                COMPANDING
                The WM8510 supports A-law and µ-law companding on both transmit (ADC) and receive (DAC)
                sides. Companding can be enabled on the DAC or ADC audio interfaces by writing the appropriate
                value to the DAC_COMP or ADC_COMP register bits respectively.

       Table 43 Companding Control
       Companding involves using a piecewise linear approximation of the following equations (as set out by
       ITU-T G.711 standard) for data compression:
       µ-law (where µ=255 for the U.S. and Japan):
       F(x) = ln( 1 + µ|x|) / ln( 1 + µ)     -1 ≤ x ≤ 1
       A-law (where A=87.6 for Europe):
       F(x) = A|x| / ( 1 + lnA)                    } for x ≤ 1/A
       F(x) = ( 1 + lnA|x|) / (1 + lnA)            } for 1/A ≤ x ≤ 1
       The companded data is also inverted as recommended by the G.711 standard (all 8 bits are inverted
       for µ-law, all even data bits are inverted for A-law). The data will be transmitted as the first 8 MSB’s
       of data.
       Companding converts 13 bits (µ-law) or 12 bits (A-law) to 8 bits using non-linear quantization. The
       input data range is separated into 8 levels, allowing low amplitude signals better precision than that
       of high amplitude signals. This is to exploit the operation of the human auditory system, where
       louder sounds do not require as much resolution as quieter sounds. The companded signal is an 8-
       bit word containing sign (1-bit), exponent (3-bits) and mantissa (4-bits).

AUDIO SAMPLE RATES
                  The WM8510 sample rates for the ADC and the DAC are set using the SR register bits. The cutoffs
                  for the digital filters and the ALC attack/decay times stated are determined using these values and
                  assume a 256fs master clock rate.
                  If a sample rate that is not explicitly supported by the SR register settings is required then the closest
                  SR value to that sample rate should be chosen, the filter characteristics and the ALC attack, decay
                  and hold times will scale appropriately.

MASTER CLOCK AND PHASE LOCKED LOOP (PLL)
                          The WM8510 has an on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit that can be used to:
                          Generate master clocks for the WM8510 audio functions from another external clock, e.g. in
                          telecoms applications.
                          Generate and output (on pin CSB/GPIO) a clock for another part of the system that is derived from
                          an existing audio master clock.
                          Figure 31 shows the PLL and internal clocking arrangement on the WM8510.
                          The PLL can be enabled or disabled by the PLLEN register bit.
                          Note: In order to minimise current consumption, the PLL is disabled when the VMIDSEL[1:0] bits are
                          set to 00b. VMIDSEL[1:0] must be set to a value other than 00b to enable the PLL.

                The PLL frequency ratio R = f2/f1 (see Figure 31) can be set using the register bits PLLK and PLLN:
                           PLLN = int R
                           PLLK = int (224 (R-PLLN))
                EXAMPLE:
                MCLK=12MHz, required clock = 12.288MHz.
                R should be chosen to ensure 5 < PLLN < 13. There is a fixed divide by 4 in the PLL and a
                selectable divide by N after the PLL which should be set to divide by 2 to meet this requirement.
                Enabling the divide by 2 sets the required f2 = 4 x 2 x 12.288MHz = 98.304MHz.
                           R = 98.304 / 12 = 8.192

               SELECTION OF CONTROL MODE AND 2-WIRE MODE ADDRESS
               The control interface can operate as either a 3-wire or 2-wire MPU interface. The MODE pin
               determines the 2 or 3 wire mode as shown in Table 50.
               The WM8510 is controlled by writing to registers through a serial control interface. A control word
               consists of 16 bits. The first 7 bits (B15 to B9) are address bits that select which control register is
               accessed. The remaining 9 bits (B8 to B0) are register bits, corresponding to the 9 bits in each
               control register.

                Figure 32 3-Wire Serial Control Interface
                2-WIRE SERIAL CONTROL MODE
                The WM8510 supports software control via a 2-wire serial bus. Many devices can be controlled by
                the same bus, and each device has a unique 7-bit device address (this is not the same as the 7-bit
                address of each register in the WM8510).
                The WM8510 operates as a slave device only. The controller indicates the start of data transfer with
                a high to low transition on SDIN while SCLK remains high. This indicates that a device address and
                data will follow. All devices on the 2-wire bus respond to the start condition and shift in the next eight
                bits on SDIN (7-bit address + Read/Write bit, MSB first). If the device address received matches the
                address of the WM8510, then the WM8510 responds by pulling SDIN low on the next clock pulse
                (ACK). If the address is not recognised or the R/W bit is ‘1’ when operating in write only mode, the
                WM8510 returns to the idle condition and wait for a new start condition and valid address.
                During a write, once the WM8510 has acknowledged a correct address, the controller sends the first
                byte of control data (B15 to B8, i.e. the WM8510 register address plus the first bit of register data).
                The WM8510 then acknowledges the first data byte by pulling SDIN low for one clock pulse. The
                controller then sends the second byte of control data (B7 to B0, i.e. the remaining 8 bits of register
                data), and the WM8510 acknowledges again by pulling SDIN low.
                Transfers are complete when there is a low to high transition on SDIN while SCLK is high. After a
                complete sequence the WM8510 returns to the idle state and waits for another start condition. If a
                start or stop condition is detected out of sequence at any point during data transfer (i.e. SDIN
                changes while SCLK is high), the device jumps to the idle condition.

RESETTING THE CHIP
                The WM8510 can be reset by performing a write of any value to the software reset register (address
                0 hex). This will cause all register values to be reset to their default values. In addition to this there
                is a Power-On Reset (POR) circuit which ensures that the registers are set to default when the
                device is powered up.

POWER SUPPLIES
               The WM8510 can use up to four separate power supplies:
               AVDD and AGND: Analogue supply, powers all analogue functions except the speaker output and
               mono output drivers. AVDD can range from 2.5V to 3.6V and has the most significant impact on
               overall power consumption (except for power consumed in the headphone). A large AVDD slightly
               improves audio quality.
               SPKVDD and SPKGND: Headphone and Speaker supplies, power the speaker and mono output
               drivers. SPKVDD can range from 2.5V to 5.5V. SPKVDD can be tied to AVDD, but it requires
               separate layout and decoupling capacitors to curb harmonic distortion. With a larger SPKVDD, louder
               headphone and speaker outputs can be achieved with lower distortion. If SPKVDD is lower than
               AVDD (or 1.5 x AVDD for BOOST mode), the output signal may be clipped.
               DCVDD: Digital core supply, powers all digital functions except the audio and control interfaces.
               DCVDD can range from 1.71V to 3.6V, and has no effect on audio quality. The return path for
               DCVDD is DGND, which is shared with DBVDD.
               DCVDD should be greater than or equal to 1.9V when using the PLL.
               DBVDD can range from 1.71V to 3.6V. DBVDD return path is through DGND.
               It is possible to use the same supply voltage for all four supplies. However, digital and analogue
               supplies should be routed and decoupled separately on the PCB to keep digital switching noise out of
               the analogue signal paths.
               Note:
               DCVDD should be greater than or equal to 1.9V when using the PLL.
               RECOMMENDED POWER UP/DOWN SEQUENCE
               In order to minimise output pop and click noise, it is recommended that the WM8510 device is
               powered up and down using one of the following sequences:
               Power Up When NOT Using the Output 1.5x Boost Stage:
               1.         Turn on external power supplies. Wait for supply voltage to settle.
               2.         Set BIASEN = 1, BUFIOEN = 1 and also the VMIDSEL[1:0] bits in the Power Management
                          1 register. * Notes 1 and 2.
               3.         Wait for the VMID supply to settle. * Note 2.
               4.         Enable DAC by setting DACEN = 1.
               5.         Enable mixers as required.
               6.         Enable output stages as required.
               7.         Unmute DAC by setting DACMU = 0.
               Power Up When Using the Output 1.5x Boost Stage:
               1.         Turn on external power supplies. Wait for supply voltage to settle.
               2.         Enable 1.5x output boost. Set MONOBOOST = 1 and SPKBOOST = 1 as required.
               3.         Set BIASEN = 1, BUFIOEN = 1, BUFDCOPEN = 1 and also the VMIDSEL[1:0] bits in the
                          Power Management 1 register. * Notes 1 and 2.
               4.         Wait for the VMID supply to settle. * Note 2.
               5.         Enable DAC by setting DACEN = 1.
               6.         Enable mixers as required.
               7.         Enable output stages as required.
               8.         Unmute DAC by setting DACMU = 0.
                                                                                       PD, Rev 4.5 ,September 2008

                                     Power Down (all cases):
                                     1.              Soft mute DAC by setting DACMU = 1.
                                     2.              Disable power management register 1 by setting R1[8:0]=0x000
                                     3.              Disable all other output stages.
                                     4.              Turn off external power supplies.
                                     Notes:
                                      1.    This step enables the internal device bias buffer and the VMID buffer for unassigned
                                            inputs/outputs. This will provide a startup reference voltage for all inputs and outputs. This will
                                            cause the inputs and outputs to ramp towards VMID (NOT using output 1.5x boost) or 1.5 x
                                            (AVDD/2) (using output 1.5x boost) in a way that is controlled and predictable (see note 2).
                                      2.    Choose the value of the VMIDSEL bits based on the startup time (VMIDSEL=10 for slowest
                                            startup, VMIDSEL=11 for fastest startup). Startup time is defined by the value of the VMIDSEL
                                            bits (the reference impedance) and the external decoupling capacitor on VMID.
                                     In addition to the power on sequence, it is recommended that the zero cross functions are used when
                                     changing the volume in the PGAs to avoid any audible pops or clicks.

                         Notes:
                         1.  The analogue input pin charge time, tmidrail_on, is determined by the VMID pin charge time. This
                             time is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling capacitor and VMID pin input resistance
                             and AVDD power supply rise time.
                         2.  The analogue input pin discharge time, tmidrail_off, is determined by the analogue input coupling
                             capacitor discharge time. The time, tmidrail_off, is measured using a 1µF capacitor on the
                             analogue input but will vary dependent upon the value of input coupling capacitor.
                         3.  While the ADC is enabled there will be LSB data bit activity on the ADCDAT pin due to system
                             noise but no significant digital output will be present.
                         4.  The VMIDSEL and BIASEN bits must be set to enable analogue input midrail voltage and for
                             normal ADC operation.
                         5.  ADCDAT data output delay from power up - with power supplies starting from 0V - is determined
                             primarily by the VMID charge time. ADC initialisation and power management bits may be set
                             immediately after POR is released; VMID charge time will be significantly longer and will dictate
                             when the device is stabilised for analogue input.
                         6.  ADCDAT data output delay at power up from device standby (power supplies already applied) is
                             determined by ADC initialisation time, 2/fs.

                Notes:
                1.    The lineout charge time, tline_midrail_on, is mainly determined by the VMID pin charge time. This
                      time is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling capacitor and VMID pin input resistance
                      and AVDD power supply rise time. The values above were measured using a 4.7µF capacitor.
                2.    It is not advisable to allow DACDAT data input during initialisation of the DAC. If the DAC data
                      value is not zero at point of initialisation, then this is likely to cause a pop noise on the analogue
                      outputs. The same is also true if the DACDAT is removed at a non-zero value, and no mute
                      function has been applied to the signal beforehand.
                3.    The lineout discharge time, tline_midrail_off, is dependent upon the value of the lineout coupling
                      capacitor and the leakage resistance path to ground. The values above were measured using a
                      10µF output capacitor.
                4.    The headphone charge time, thp_midrail_on, is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling
                      capacitor and VMID pin input resistance and AVDD power supply rise time. The values above
                      were measured using a 4.7µF VMID decoupling capacitor.
                5.    The headphone discharge time, thp_midrail_off, is dependent upon the value of the headphone
                      coupling capacitor and the leakage resistance path to ground. The values above were
                      measured using a 100µF capacitor.
                The VMIDSEL and BIASEN bits must be set to enable analogue output midrail voltage and for
                normal DAC operation.
POWER MANAGEMENT
                SAVING POWER BY REDUCING OVERSAMPLING RATE
                The default mode of operation of the ADC and DAC digital filters is in 64x oversampling mode. Under
                the control of ADCOSR and DACOSR the oversampling rate may be doubled. 64x oversampling
                results in a slight decrease in noise performance compared to 128x but lowers the power
                consumption of the device.

       VMID
       The analogue circuitry will not work when VMID is disabled (VMIDSEL[1:0] = 00b). The impedance of
       the VMID resistor string, together with the decoupling capacitor on the VMID pin will determine the
       startup time of the VMID circuit.

       ESTIMATED SUPPLY CURRENTS
       When either the DAC or ADC are enabled it is estimated that approximately 4mA will be drawn from
       DCVDD when DCVDD=1.8V and fs=48kHz (This will be lower at lower sample rates). When the PLL
       is enabled an additional 700 microamps will be drawn from DCVDD.
       Table 45 shows the estimated 3.3V AVDD current drawn by various circuits, by register bit.

                POWER SAVING
                For minimum power consumption in standby mode, VMIDSEL should not be set to default. Instead,
                the following sequence of writes should be implemented:
                1.    R10[6] = 1 (DACMU=1).
                2.    R1 = 0x00.
                3.    R2 = 0x00.
                4.    R3 = 0x00
                5.    R1 = 0x02 (VMIDSEL[1:0] = 10).
                After reset, all register values are set to default. In order to achieve minimum power consumption,
                the following sequence of writes should be implemented.
                1.    R10[6] = 1 (DACMU=1).
                2.    R1 = 0x00.
                3.    R0 = 0xFF.
                4.    R1 = 0x02 (VMIDSEL[1:0] = 10).

TERMINOLOGY
1.   Stop Band Attenuation (dB) – the degree to which the frequency spectrum is attenuated (outside audio band)
2.   Pass-band Ripple – any variation of the frequency response in the pass-band region
3.   Note that this delay applies only to the filters and does not include additional delays through other digital circuits.
