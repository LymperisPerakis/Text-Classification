                                                   Multipurpose Pin (MP6).
A5        XTALO                        A_OUT       Crystal Clock Output. This pin is the output of the crystal amplifier; do not use this pin to
                                                   provide a clock to other ICs in the system. If a master clock output is needed, use CLKOUT

A7        IOVDD                        PWR         Supply for Digital Input and Output Pins. The digital output pins are supplied from IOVDD;
                                                   thus, the IOVDD voltage level is the highest input voltage that can be present on the
                                                   digital input pins. The current draw of this pin is variable because it is dependent on the
                                                   loads of the digital outputs. Decouple IOVDD to DGND with a 0.1 μF capacitor.

                                                             It is tristated when an SPI read is not active.
B7          SCL/SCLK                             D_IN        I2C Clock (SCL). This pin is always an open-collector input when the device is in I2C
                                                             control mode. When the device is in self boot mode, this pin is an open-collector output (I2C

                                                             high at the end of a transaction. Each SPI transaction can take a different number of

D7          MICBIAS1                             A_OUT       Bias Voltage for Electret Microphone. Decouple this pin with a 1 µF capacitor.

                                                             as they are not drawing current from CM (for example, the noninverting input of an op amp).

ASYNCHRONOUS SAMPLE RATE CONVERTERS
The ADAU1777 includes ASRCs to enable synchronous, full
duplex operation of the serial ports. Two stereo ASRCs are
available for the digital outputs, and one stereo ASRC is available
for the digital input signals.
The ASRCs can convert serial output data from the core rates to
the serial port rates of 192 kHz down to less than 8 kHz. All
intermediate frequencies and ratios are also supported.

7      PLL_EN                       Enable PLL. When this bit is set to 0, the PLL is powered down and the PLL output       0x0   R/W
                                    clock is disabled. Do not enable the PLL until after all the PLL control settings
                                    (Register PLL_CTRL0 to Register PLL_CTRL5) are set. The PLL clock output is active
                                    when both PLL_EN = 1 and COREN = 1.
                                0   PLL disabled.

5      SPK_FLT_DIS                  Disable I2C spike filter. By default, the SDA and SCL inputs have a 50 ns spike         0x0   R/W
                                    suppression filter. When the control interface is in SPI mode, this filter is disabled
                                    regardless of this setting.
                                0   I2C spike filter enabled.
                                1   I2C spike filter disabled.

                                1   PLL drives main clock. This bit must only be set after LOCK in Register PLL_CTRL5 has
                                    gone high.
2      CC_CDIV                      SCLK divider control. The core clock (SCLK) is used only by the core. It must run at    0x0   R/W
                                    12.288 MHz.
                                0   Div 2: divide PLL/external clock by 2.

1     CC_MDIV                      MCLK divider control. The internal master clock (MCLK) of the IC is used by all digital     0x0     R/W
                                   logic except the core. It must run at 12.288 MHz.

0     COREN                        Main clock enable. When COREN = 0, it is only possible to write to this register and the    0x0     R/W
                                   PLL control registers (PLL_CTRL0 to PLL_CTRL5). This control also enables the PLL
                                   clock. If using the PLL, do not set COREN = 1 until LOCK in Register PLL_CTRL5 is 1.
                                   Note that, after COREN is enabled, writing to the parameters is disabled until setting
                                   DSP_CLK_EN in the CORE_ENABLE register.
                               0   Main clock disabled.

CLKOUT SETTING SELECTION REGISTER
Address: 0x07, Reset: 0x00, Name: CLKOUT_SEL
When the ADC_SDATA1/CLKOUT/MP6 pin is set to clock output mode, the frequency of the output clock is set in this register.
CLKOUT can be used to provide a master clock to another IC, the clock for digital microphones, or as the clock for the PDM output stream.
The 12 MHz/24 MHz setting is used when clocking another IC, 3 MHz/6 MHz is used for PDMOUT, and 1.5 MHz/3 MHz is used when
clocking digital microphones. The CLKOUT frequency is derived from the master clock frequency, which is assumed to (and always must) be
12.288 MHz. The 12.288 MHz and 24.576 MHz output modes are not functional if PDM is enabled (Register PDM_OUT, Bits[1:0]).

FILTER ENGINE AND LIMITER CONTROL REGISTER

Disabling the limiter only disables the attack operation. The decay operation is always active; therefore, a limiter can be safely disabled
while the decay operation performs gain adjustments.

The core can write data to this register, and the data is automatically converted to a level in dB. The most common use for this register is to determine
the rms value of a signal by taking the absolute value, and then performing low-pass filtering and moving the result to the DBREG0 register.

When SINC_3_EN is set, the volume starts to ramp from −95.625 dB to the value in this register. The volume ramp time is (number of
steps) × 16/fS, where there are 256 steps between 0 dB and −95.625 dB. For example, with fS = 192 kHz, the volume ramps from
−95.625 dB to 0 dB in 21 ms.

DECIMATOR POWER CONTROL REGISTER

The bits in this register enable clocks to the digital filters and the ASRC decimator filters of the ADCs. These bits must be enabled for all
channels used in the design. To use the ADCs, these SINC_x_EN bits must be enabled along with the appropriate ADC_x_EN bits in the
ADC_CONTROL2 and ADC_CONTROL3 registers. If the digital microphone inputs are used, the SINC_x_EN bits can be set without
setting ADC_x_EN.

DAC INTERPOLATION CONTROL REGISTER

The lowest interpolator latency is achieved with a zero-order hold (ZOH) selection. ZOH can be used for both 768 kHz and 192 kHz data.
For 96 kHz data, use the linear interpolation to attain the lowest latency.
