5. APPLICATIONS
5.1      Stand-Alone Mode
5.1.1       Recommended Power-Up Sequence
1) When using the CS4272 with an external MCLK, hold RST low until the power supply, MCLK, and LRCK are
     stable. When using the CS4272 with internally generated MCLK, hold RST low until the power supply is stable.
2) Bring RST high. If the internally generated MCLK is being used, it will appear on the MCLK pin prior to 1 ms from
     the release of RST.
5.1.2       Master/Slave Mode
The CS4272 supports operation in either Master Mode or Slave Mode.
In Master Mode, LRCK and SCLK are outputs and are synchronously generated on-chip. LRCK is equal to Fs and
SCLK is equal to 64x Fs.
In Slave Mode, LRCK and SCLK are inputs, requiring external generation that is synchronous to MCLK. It is recom-
mended that SCLK be 64x Fs to maximize system performance.
In Stand-Alone Mode, the CS4272 will default to Slave Mode. Master Mode may be accessed by placing a 47 kΩ
pull-up to VL on the SDOUT (M/S) pin.
Configuration of clock ratios in each of these modes will be outlined in the Tables 3 and 4.
5.1.3       System Clocking
The CS4272 will operate at sampling frequencies from 4 kHz to 200 kHz. This range is divided into three speed
modes as shown in Table 1 below.
                                               Table 1. Speed Modes

                                       Single Speed               4-50 kHz
                                       Double Speed             50-100 kHz
                                        Quad Speed             100-200 kHz
5.1.3.1      Crystal Applications (XTI/XTO)
An external crystal may be used in conjunction with the CS4272 to generate the master clock signal. To accomplish
this, a 20 pF fundamental mode parallel resonant crystal must be connected between the XTI and XTO pins as
shown in the Typical Connection Diagram on page 23. This crystal must oscillate at the frequency shown in Table 2.
In this configuration, MCLK is a buffered output and, as shown in the Typical Connection Diagram, nothing other
than the crystal and its load capacitors should be connected to XTI and XTO. The MCLK signal will appear on the
MCLK pin prior to 1 ms from the release of RST.
                                            Table 2. Crystal Frequencies
                                            Mode           Crystal Frequency
                                       Single Speed              512 x Fs
                                      Double Speed               256 x Fs
                                       Quad Speed                128 x Fs
To operate the CS4272 with an externally generated MCLK signal, no crystal should be used, XTI should be con-
nected to ground and XTO should be left unconnected. In this configuration, MCLK is an input and must be driven
externally with an appropriate speed clock.

5.1.3.2   Clock Ratio Selection
Depending on the use of an external crystal, or whether the CS4272 is in Master or Slave Mode, different
MCKL/LRCK and SCLK/LRCK ratios may be used. These ratios are shown in the Tables 3 and 4 below.

5.1.4      16-Bit Auto-Dither
The CS4272 will auto-configure to output properly dithered 16-bit data when placed in Slave Mode and a 32x SCLK
to LRCK ratio is used. In this configuration, one half of a bit of dither is added to the LSB of the 16-bit word. This
applies only to the serial audio output of the ADC and will not affect DAC performance. See Figure 9.

5.1.5      Auto-Mute
The DAC output will mute following the reception of 8192 consecutive audio samples of static 0 or -1. A single sam-
ple of non-static data will release the mute. Detection and muting are done independently for each channel. The
common mode on the output will be retained and the Mute Control pin for that channel will go active during the mute
period.
5.1.6      High Pass Filter
The operational amplifiers in the input circuitry driving the CS4272 may generate a small DC offset into the ADC.
The CS4272 includes a high pass filter after the decimator to remove any DC offset which could result in recording
a DC level, possibly yielding "clicks" when switching between devices in a multichannel system.
In Stand-Alone Mode, the high pass filter continuously subtracts a measure of the DC offset from the output of the
decimation filter. This function cannot be disabled in Stand-Alone Mode.
5.1.7       Interpolation Filter
In Stand-Alone Mode, the fast roll-off interpolation filter is used.
Filter specifications can be found in Section 3. Plots of the data are contained in the “Appendix” on page 47.
5.1.8      Mode Selection & De-Emphasis
The sample rate, Fs, can be adjusted from 4 kHz to 200 kHz. In Stand-Alone Mode, the CS4272 must be set to the
proper mode via the mode pins, M1 and M0. De-emphasis, optimized for a 44.1 kHz sampling frequency, is avail-
able.

5.1.9      Serial Audio Interface Format Selection
         2
Either I S or left justified serial audio data format may be selected in Stand-Alone Mode. The selection will affect
both the input and output format. Placing a 10 kΩ pull-up to VL on the I2S/LJ pin will select the I2S format, while
placing a 10 kΩ pull-down to DGND on the I2S/LJ pin will select the left justified format.

5.2      Control Port Mode
5.2.1      Recommended Power-Up Sequence - Access to Control Port Mode
1) When using the CS4272 with an external MCLK, hold RST low until the power supply, MCLK, and LRCK are
    stable. When using the CS4272 with internally generated MCLK, hold RST low until the power supply is stable.
    In this state, the Control Port is reset to its default settings.
2) Bring RST high. The device will remain in a low power state and the control port will be accessible. If internally
    generated MCLK is being used, it will appear on the MCLK pin prior to 1 ms from the release of RST.
3) Write 03h to register 07h within 10 ms following the release of RST. This sets the Control Port Enable (CPEN)
    and Power Down (PDN) bits, activating the Control Port and placing the part in power-down. When using the
    CS4272 with internally generated MCLK, it is necessary to wait 1 ms following the release of RST before initi-
    ating this Control Port write.
4) The desired register settings can be loaded while keeping the PDN bit set.
5) Clear the PDN bit to initiate the power-up sequence. This power-up sequence requires approximately 85 µS.
5.2.2      Master / Slave Mode Selection
The CS4272 supports operation in either Master Mode or Slave Mode.
In Master Mode, LRCK and SCLK are outputs and are synchronously generated on-chip. LRCK is equal to Fs and
SCLK is equal to 64x Fs.
In Slave Mode, LRCK and SCLK are inputs, requiring external generation that is synchronous to MCLK. It is recom-
mended that SCLK be 64x Fs to maximize system performance.
Configuration of clock ratios in each of these modes will be outlined in the Tables 8 and 9.
In Control Port Mode the CS4272 will default to Slave Mode. The user may change this default setting by changing
the status of the M/S bit in the Mode Control 1 register (01h).
5.2.3      System Clocking
The CS4272 will operate at sampling frequencies from 4 kHz to 200 kHz. This range is divided into three speed
modes as shown in Table 6 below.

                                         Double Speed                50-100 kHz

5.2.3.1       Crystal Applications (XTI/XTO)
An external crystal may be used in conjunction with the CS4272 to generate the MCLK signal. To accomplish this,
a 20 pF fundamental mode parallel resonant crystal must be connected between the XTI and XTO pins as shown in
the Typical Connection Diagram on page 23. This crystal must oscillate at the frequency shown in Table 7. In this
configuration, MCLK is a buffered output and, as shown in the Typical Connection Diagram, nothing other than the
crystal and its load capacitors should be connected to XTI and XTO. The MCLK signal will appear on the MCLK pin
prior to 1 ms from the release of RST.

To operate the CS4272 with an externally generated MCLK signal, no crystal should be used, XTI should be con-
nected to ground and XTO should be left unconnected. In this configuration, MCLK is an input and must be driven
externally with an appropriate speed clock.
5.2.3.2      Clock Ratio Selection
Depending on the use of an external crystal, or whether the CS4272 is in Master or Slave Mode, different
MCKL/LRCK and SCLK/LRCK ratios may be used. These ratios as well as the Control Port Register Bits that must
be set in order to obtain them are shown in Tables 8 and 9 below.

5.2.4         Internal Digital Loopback
In Control Port Mode, the CS4272 supports an internal digital loopback mode in which the output of the ADC is rout-
ed to the input of the DAC. This mode may be activated by setting the LOOP bit in the Mode Control 2 register (07h).
When this bit is set, the status of the DAC_DIF(2:0) bits in register 01h will be disregarded by the CS4272. Any
changes made to the DAC_DIF(2:0) bits while the LOOP bit is set will have no impact on operation until the LOOP
bit is released, at which time the Digital Interface Format of the DAC will operate according to the format selected in
the DAC_DIF(2:0) bits. While the LOOP bit is set, data will be present on the SDOUT pin in the format selected in
the ADC_DIF bit in register 06h.
5.2.5         Dither for 16-Bit Data
The CS4272 may be configured to properly dither for 16-bit data. To do this, the Dither16 bit in the ADC Control
Register (06h) must be set. When set, a half bit of dither is added to the least significant bit of the 16 most significant
bits of the data word. The remaining bits should be disregarded. See Figure 10. This function is useful when 16-bit
devices are downstream of the ADC. This bit should not be set when using word lengths greater than 16 bits.
It should be noted that this function is supported for all serial audio output formats, and may be activated in either
Master or Slave Mode.

5.2.6         Auto-Mute
The Auto-Mute function is controlled by the status of the AMUTE bit in the DAC Control register. When set, the DAC
output will mute following the reception of 8192 consecutive audio samples of static 0 or -1. A single sample of non-
static data will release the mute. Detection and muting are done independently for each channel. Auto-Mute detec-
tion and muting can become dependent on either channel if the MUTECA=B function is enabled. The common mode
on the output will be retained and the Mute Control pin for that channel will become active during the mute period.
The muting function is effected, similar to volume control changes, by the Soft and ZeroCross bits in the DAC Vol-
ume and Mixing Control register. The AMUTE bit is set by default.
5.2.7         High Pass Filter and DC Offset Calibration
The operational amplifiers in the input circuitry driving the CS4272 may generate a small DC offset into the A/D con-
verter. The CS4272 includes a high pass filter after the decimator to remove any DC offset which could result in
recording a DC level, possibly yielding "clicks" when switching between devices in a multichannel system.
The high pass filter continuously subtracts a measure of the DC offset from the output of the decimation filter. The
high pass filter can be independently enabled and disabled for channels A and B. If the HPFDisableA or HPFDis-
ableB bit is set during normal operation, the current value of the DC offset for the corresponding channel is frozen
and this DC offset will continue to be subtracted from the conversion result. This feature makes it possible to perform
a system DC offset calibration by:
1) Running the CS4272 with the high pass filter enabled until the filter settles. See the Digital Filter Characteristics
      for filter settling time.
2) Disabling the high pass filter and freezing the stored DC offset.

                                                                                                              CS4272
A system calibration performed in this way will eliminate offsets anywhere in the signal path between the calibration
point and the CS4272.
5.2.8          Interpolation Filter
To accommodate the increasingly complex requirements of digital audio systems, the CS4272 incorporates select-
able interpolation filters for each mode of operation. Fast and slow roll-off filters are available in each of Single, Dou-
ble, and Quad Speed modes. These filters have been designed to accommodate a variety of musical tastes and
styles. The FILT_SEL bit in the DAC Control register (02h) is used to select which filter is used. By default, the fast
roll-off filter is selected.
Filter specifications can be found in Section 3. Plots of the data are contained in the “Appendix” on page 47.
5.2.9         De-Emphasis
Three de-emphasis modes are available via the Control Port. The available filters are optimized for 32 kHz,
44.1 kHz, and 48 kHz sampling rates. See Table 13 for de-emphasis selection in Control Port Mode.
5.2.10 Oversampling Modes
The CS4272 operates in one of three oversampling modes based on the input sample rate. Mode selection is de-
termined by the M1 and M0 bits in the Mode Control 1 register. Single-Speed mode supports input sample rates up
to 50 kHz and uses a 128x oversampling ratio. Double-Speed mode supports input sample rates up to 100 kHz and
uses an oversampling ratio of 64x. Quad-Speed mode supports input sample rates up to 200 kHz and uses an over-
sampling ratio of 32x. See Table 11 for Control Port Mode settings.
5.3        De-Emphasis Filter
The CS4272 includes on-chip digital de-emphasis. Figure 11 shows the de-emphasis curve for Fs equal to 44.1 kHz.
The frequency response of the de-emphasis curve will scale proportionally with changes in sample rate, Fs. Please
see section 5.1.8 for the desired de-emphasis control for Stand-Alone mode and section 5.2.9 for control port mode.
The de-emphasis feature is included to accommodate audio recordings that utilize 50/15 µS pre-emphasis equal-
ization as a means of noise reduction.
De-emphasis is only available in Single Speed Mode.

5.4      Analog Connections
5.4.1      Input Connections
The analog modulator samples the input at 6.144 MHz (MCLK=12.288 MHz). The digital filter will reject signals with-
in the stopband of the filter. However, there is no rejection for input signals which are (n × 6.144 MHz) the digital
passband frequency, where n=0,1,2,... Refer to Figure 12 for a recommended analog input buffer that will attenuate
any noise energy at 6.144 MHz, in addition to providing the optimum source impedance for the modulators. The use
of capacitors which have a large voltage coefficient (such as general purpose ceramics) must be avoided since
these can degrade signal linearity. Figure 13 shows the full-scale analog input levels.

5.4.2      Output Connections
The recommended output filter configuration is shown in Figure 14. This filter configuration accounts for the normally
differing AC loads on the AOUT+ and AOUT- differential output pins. It also shows an AC coupling configuration
which minimizes the number of required AC coupling capacitors.
The CS4272 does not include phase or amplitude compensation for an external filter, and therefore the DAC system
phase and amplitude response will be dependent on the external analog circuitry. Figure 15 shows the full-scale an-
alog output levels.

5.5      Mute Control
The Mute Control pins become active during power-up initialization, reset, muting, if the MCLK to LRCK ratio is in-
correct, and during power-down. The Auto-Mute function causes the MUTEC pin corresponding to an individual
channel to activate following the reception of 8192 consecutive audio samples of static 0 or -1 on the respective
channel. A single sample of non-zero data on this channel will cause the MUTEC pin to deactivate. In Control Port
Mode, however, auto-mute detection and muting can become dependent on either channel if the MuteB=A function
is enabled. The MUTEC pins are intended to be used as control for an external mute circuit in order to add off-chip
mute capability.
Use of the Mute Control function is not mandatory but recommended for designs requiring the absolute minimum in
extraneous clicks and pops. Also, use of the Mute Control function can enable the system designer to achieve idle
channel noise/signal-to-noise ratios which are only limited by the external mute circuit. The MUTEC pins are active-
low. See Figure 16 below for a suggested active-low mute circuit.

5.6      Synchronization of Multiple Devices
In systems where multiple ADCs are required, care must be taken to achieve simultaneous sampling. To ensure
synchronous sampling, the MCLK and LRCK must be the same for all of the CS4272’s in the system. If only one
MCLK source is needed, one solution is to place one CS4272 in Master Mode, and slave all of the other CS4272’s
to the one master. If multiple MCLK sources are needed, a possible solution would be to supply all clocks from the
same external source and time the CS4272 reset with the inactive edge of MCLK. This will ensure that all converters
begin sampling on the same clock edge.
5.7      Grounding and Power Supply Decoupling
As with any high resolution converter, the CS4272 requires careful attention to power supply and grounding arrange-
ments if its potential performance is to be realized. Figure 8 shows the recommended power arrangements, with VA
and VL connected to clean supplies. VD, which powers the digital filter, may be run from the system logic supply
(VL) or may be powered from the analog supply (VA) via a resistor. In this case, no additional devices should be
powered from VD. Power supply decoupling capacitors should be as near to the CS4272 as possible, with the low
value ceramic capacitor being the nearest. All signals, especially clocks, should be kept away from the VREF and
VCOM pins in order to avoid unwanted coupling into the modulators. The VREF and VCOM decoupling capacitors,
particularly the 0.1 µF, must be positioned to minimize the electrical path from VREF and AGND. The CDB4272
evaluation board demonstrates the optimum layout and power supply arrangements. To minimize digital noise, con-
nect the CS4272 digital outputs only to CMOS inputs.

                                                                                                          CS4272
6. CONTROL PORT INTERFACE
The Control Port is used to load all the internal settings of the CS4272. The operation of the Control Port may be
completely asynchronous to the audio sample rate. However, to avoid potential interference problems, the Control
Port pins should remain static if no operation is required.
The Control Port has 2 modes: SPI and I²C, with the CS4272 operating as a slave to control messages in both
modes. If I²C operation is desired, AD0/CS should be tied to VA or AGND. If the CS4272 ever detects a high to low
transition on AD0/CS after power-up, SPI mode will be selected. The Control Port registers are write-only in SPI
mode.
Upon release of the RST pin, the CS4272 will wait approximately 10 ms before it begins its start-up sequence. The
part defaults to Stand-Alone Mode, in which all operational modes are controlled as described under “Stand-Alone
Mode” on page 24. The Control Port is active at all times, and if bit 1 of register 07h (CPEN) is set, the part enters
Control-Port Mode and all operational modes are controlled by the Control Port registers. This bit can be set at any
time, but to avoid unpredictable output noises, bit 1 (CPEN) and bit 0 (PDN) of register 07h should be set by writing
03h before the end of the 10 ms start-up wait period. All registers can then be set as desired before releasing the
PDN bit to begin the start-up sequence. If system requirements do not allow writing to the control port immediately
following the release of RST, the SDIN line should be held at logic “0” until the proper serial mode can be selected.
6.1      SPI Mode
In SPI mode, CS is the CS4272 chip select signal, CCLK is the control port bit clock, CDIN is the input data line from
the microcontroller and the chip address is 0010000. All control signals are inputs and data is clocked in on the rising
edge of CCLK.
Figure 17 shows the operation of the Control Port in SPI mode. To write to a register, bring CS low. The first 7 bits
on CDIN form the chip address, and must be 0010000. The eighth bit is a read/write indicator (R/W), which must be
low to write. The next 8 bits form the Memory Address Pointer (MAP), which is set to the address of the register that
is to be updated. The next 8 bits are the data which will be placed into the register designated by the MAP. See
Table 10 on page 36.

The CS4272 has MAP auto increment capability, enabled by the INCR bit in the MAP. If INCR is 0, then the MAP
will stay constant for successive writes. If INCR is set, then MAP will auto increment after each byte is written, al-
lowing block writes to successive registers.

6.2       I²C Mode
In I²C mode, SDA is a bi-directional data line. Data is clocked into and out of the part by the clock, SCL, with the clock
to data relationship as shown in Figure 18. There is no CS pin. Pin AD0 forms the partial chip address and should be
tied to VA or AGND as required. The upper 6 bits of the 7-bit address field must be 001000. To communicate with the
CS4272, the LSB of the chip address field, which is the first byte sent to the CS4272, should match the setting of the
AD0 pin. The eighth bit of the address byte is the R/W bit (high for a read, low for a write). If the operation is a write,
the next byte is the Memory Address Pointer, MAP, which selects the register to be read or written. The MAP is then
followed by the data to be written. If the operation is a read, then the contents of the register pointed to by the MAP will
be output after the chip address.
The CS4272 has MAP auto increment capability, enabled by the INCR bit in the MAP. If INCR is 0, then the MAP
will stay constant for successive writes. If INCR is set, then MAP will auto increment after each byte is written, al-
lowing block reads or writes of successive registers.

8.2.1    Auto-Mute (Bit 7)
        Function:
             When set, enables the Auto-Mute function. See “Auto-Mute” on page 30.
8.2.2    Interpolation Filter Select (Bit 6)
        Function:
             This Function allows the user to select whether the Interpolation Filter has a fast or slow roll off. When
             set, this bit selects the slow roll off filter, when cleared it selects the fast roll off filter. The - 3 dB corner
             is approximately the same for both filters, but the slope of the roll off is greater for the fast roll off filter.
8.2.3    De-Emphasis Control (Bits 5:4)
        Function:
             Implementation of the standard 50/15 µs digital de-emphasis filter response, Figure 19, requires re-
             configuration of the digital filter to maintain the proper filter response for 32, 44.1 or 48 kHz sample
             rates. NOTE: De-emphasis is available only in Single-Speed Mode. See Table 13 below.

8.2.4     Soft Volume Ramp-Up After Error (Bit 3)
        Function:
              An un-mute will be performed after executing a filter mode change, after a MCLK/LRCK ratio change
              or error, and after changing the Functional Mode. When this bit is set, this un-mute is effected, similar
              to attenuation changes, by the Soft and ZeroCross bits in the DAC Volume & Mixing Control register.
              When cleared, an immediate un-mute is performed in these instances.
              Note: For best results, it is recommended that this feature be used with the RMP_DN bit.
8.2.5     Soft Ramp-Down Before Filter Mode Change (Bit 2)
        Function:
              A mute will be performed prior to executing a filter mode change. When this bit is set, this mute is
              effected, similar to attenuation changes, by the Soft and ZeroCross bits in the DAC Volume & Mixing
              Control register. When cleared, an immediate mute is performed prior to executing a filter mode
              change.
              Note: For best results, it is recommended that this feature be used in conjunction with the RMP_UP
              bit.
8.2.6     Invert Signal Polarity (Bits 1:0)
        Function:
              When set, this bit activates an inversion of the signal polarity for the appropriate channel. This is use-
              ful if a board layout error has occurred, or other situations where a 180 degree phase shift is desirable.

8.3.1     Channel B Volume = Channel A Volume (Bit 6)
        Function:
              The AOUTA and AOUTB volume levels are independently controlled by the A and the B Channel Vol-
              ume Control Bytes when this function is disabled. The volume on both AOUTA and AOUTB are de-
              termined by the A Channel Volume Control Byte and the B Channel Byte is ignored when this function
              is enabled. Volume and muting functions are effected by the Soft Ramp and ZeroCross functions be-
              low.
8.3.2     Soft Ramp or Zero Cross Enable (Bits 5:4)
        Function:
      Soft Ramp Enable
              Soft Ramp allows level changes, both muting and attenuation, to be implemented by incrementally
              ramping, in 1/8 dB steps, from the current level to the new level at a rate of 1 dB per 8 left/right clock
              periods. See Table 14 on page 41.
      Zero Cross Enable
              Zero Cross Enable dictates that signal level changes, either by attenuation changes or muting, will
              occur on a signal zero crossing to minimize audible artifacts. The requested level change will occur
              after a time-out period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sample
              rate) if the signal does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently mon-

            itored and implemented for each channel. See Table 14 on page 41.
     Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable
            Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable dictate that signal level changes, either by attenuation changes or
            muting, will occur in 1/8 dB steps and be implemented on a signal zero crossing. The 1/8 dB level
            change will occur after a time-out period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms

8.5.1    Mute (Bit 7)
        Function:
             The DAC output will mute when this bit is set. Though this bit is active high, it should be noted that
             the MUTEC pins are active low. The common mode voltage on the output will be retained when this
             bit is set. The muting function is effected, similar to attenuation changes, by the Soft and ZeroCross
             bits in the Volume and Mixing Control register. The MUTEC pin for the respective channel will become
             active during the mute period if the MUTE bit is set. Both the AMUTEC and BMUTEC will become
             active if either MUTE register is enabled and the MUTECB=A bit (register 7) is enabled.
8.5.2    Volume Control (Bits 6:0)
        Function:
             The digital volume control allows the user to attenuate the signal in 1 dB increments from 0 to -127 dB.
             Volume settings are decoded as shown in Table 16. The volume changes are implemented as dictat-
             ed by the Soft and ZeroCross bits in the DAC Volume & Mixing Control register (see section 8.3.2).

8.7.1     Digital Loopback (Bit 4)
        Function:
             When this bit is set, an internal digital loopback from the ADC to the DAC will be enabled. Please refer
             to “Internal Digital Loopback” on page 30.
8.7.2     AMUTEC = BMUTEC (Bit 3)
        Function:
             When this function is enabled, the individual controls for AMUTEC and BMUTEC are internally con-
             nected through an AND gate prior to the output pins. Therefore, the external AMUTEC and BMUTEC
             pins will go active only when the requirements for both AMUTEC and BMUTEC are valid.

8.7.3   Freeze (Bit 2)
       Function:
             This function allows modifications to the control port registers without the changes taking effect until
             FREEZE is disabled. To make multiple changes in the Control Port registers take effect simultaneous-
             ly, set the FREEZE bit, make all register changes, then clear the FREEZE bit.
8.7.4   Control Port Enable (Bit 1)
       Function:
             This bit is cleared by default, allowing the device to power-up in Stand-Alone Mode. Control Port
             Mode can be accessed by setting this bit. This will allow the operation of the device to be controlled
             by the registers and the pin definitions will conform to Control Port Mode. See “Recommended Power-
             Up Sequence - Access to Control Port Mode” on page 27.
8.7.5   Power Down (Bit 0)
       Function:
             The device will enter a low-power state whenever this bit is set. The power-down bit is set by default
             and must be cleared before normal operation in Control Port Mode can occur. The contents of the
             control registers are retained when the device is in power-down.

9.    PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
Dynamic Range
           The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified
           bandwidth. Dynamic Range is a signal-to-noise ratio measurement over the specified bandwidth made
           with a -60 dBFS signal. 60 dB is added to resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full-scale.
           This technique ensures that the distortion components are below the noise level and do not affect the
           measurement. This measurement technique has been accepted by the Audio Engineering Society,
           AES17-1991, and the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, EIAJ CP-307. Expressed in decibels.
Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise
           The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified
           bandwidth (typically 10 Hz to 20 kHz), including distortion components. Expressed in decibels. Measured
           at -1 and -20 dBFS as suggested in AES17-1991 Annex A.
Frequency Response
           A measure of the amplitude response variation from 10 Hz to 20 kHz relative to the amplitude response
           at 1 kHz. Units in decibels.
Interchannel Isolation
           A measure of crosstalk between the left and right channels. Measured for each channel at the converter's
           output with no signal to the input under test and a full-scale signal applied to the other channel. Units in
           decibels.
Interchannel Gain Mismatch
           The gain difference between left and right channels. Units in decibels.
Gain Error
           The deviation from the nominal full-scale analog output for a full-scale digital input.
Gain Drift
           The change in gain value with temperature. Units in ppm/°C.
Offset Error
           The deviation of the mid-scale transition (111...111 to 000...000) from the ideal. Units in mV.
