     Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
     between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is operated over
     the absolute maximum ratings.

Power Supply Sequence
  Please power on/off the LSI with all kind of power at the same time.
  Each power supply should power up/down in 50ms. Also, keep all power supply in the ON state or the OFF state.
  Please avoid partial ON or partial OFF states.
  Please keep RESETB pin “L” level until all power supply become ON state. The CPU I/F become available when all power
  supply is powered on after tW_PURST and tW_REGU time exceeds.
  HVDD must be powered on first, but HVDD must be powered off last. About SPVDD, there is no limitation above.

    When PLL is not Used.
    Audio clock is generated by the CPU and supplied to the LSI when PLL is not used. Then CPU and the LSI are
    synchronized.
    ■case 5: MST (0x64/0x65) ="0"
    Audio clock (256fs, 512fs, 1024fs) is generated by the CPU and supplied to MCLKI port of the LSI. LRCLK and BCLK are
    also provided from the CPU.

    Even when using the same sampling frequency, the setting condition is different depending on clock frequency.
    When changing MCLKI input frequency, PLLOE should be set to “0”, then PLLOE should be set to “1” back.

     The filter coefficient is programmable. From required center frequency and band width, Programmable Equalizer
     Coefficient-a0 Control Register and Programmable Notch Filter Coefficient-a1 Control Register value is decided. Followings
     are the setting formula.
     a0 = (1 - tanπfb/fs) / (1 + tanπfb/fs)
     a1 = - 2cos2πf0/fs / (1 + tanπfb/fs)
     f0: Band center frequency [Hz]
     fb: -3dB band width [Hz]
     fs: Sampling frequency [Hz]
     * Actual setting value is an integral number that the result of above formula multiplied by 214 then round up numbers of five
     and above and round down anything under five to a integer.
     DSP filtering function: ON / OFF
     DSP Filter Function Enable register can set ON or OFF of each filter function. Please change this register when
     RECPLAY bit is 0x0. If this register is changed on playback or recording, the noise may be generated.

    Low Power Consumption Operation
    When PCM data is inputted into LSI consecutive "0" is detected, it will disable the output amplifier automatically and
    perform low power consumption mode operation by stopping the internal clock. When data except “0” are inputted, it will
    automatically return to original movement.
    When "0" is detected in both LCHRCH, this function is effective. When you use only LCH, please input "0" data into the
    RCH side. When you use only RCH, please input "0" data into the LCH side. This function is effective only at the time of the
    playback of the speaker amplifier. At the time of headphones amplifier playback and the recording, please set it to disable.

Touch Screen Controller
    SAR 12 bits ADC is integrated into this LSI and is available as 4 lines type touch screen controller.
    There is the function of the X-axis, the position sensing of the Y-axis, the pen pressure detection and the pen interrupt
    detection.
    It becomes independent to Codec and is controllable without minding timing. But the hard reset (reset signal input by
    RESETB pin) communizes it.
  Clock control
    When enabled clock is to be used for touch screen controller, set TCLKEN bit of Clock Enable Register to "1". The touch
    screen controller function uses a built-in oscillator. Therefore it is not necessary to perform clock control listing in item
    clock control when using only the touch screen controller.
  Position sensing
    This LSI is available for the position sensing of the touch screen. The twice measurement of the X-axis measurement, the

  The Pen Pressure Detection
    The measurement of touch pressure is carried out to measure the resistance between X plate and Y plate. It is calculable
    by two methods, from the location information by location determination, and the measurement result in touch pressure
    measurement mode.
    In case of X-Position and Y-Position are known
    Touch pressure resistance = X-plate resistance*(X-position/4096)*[(4096/Z1)-1] - Y-plate resistance*[1-(Y-position/4096)]
    In case of X-Position is known
    Touch pressure resistance = X-plate resistance*(X-position/4096)*[(Z2/Z1)-1]

  The Pen Interrupt Detection
    Touch detect function outputs the X-plate and Y-plate contact from IRQB pin. Please refer to Description of Registers for
    valid or invalid setup of Touch Detection. When X-plate and Y-plate do not contact, H level is outputted from IRQB pin by
    internal pull-up resister (typical 10kohm). When X-plate and Y-plate contact, L level is outputted from IRQB pin by touch
    plate resistance (about hundreds ohm). Please refer to Description of Registers for IRQB output selection. Touch Detect
    schematic diagram is shown below.

Register function explanation
    Register map
    Note: “-” indicates a reserved bit. They return “0” for read. Write “0” to the bit every time. If “1” is written to this bit, the
    operations cannot be guaranteed.
    Don’t write data to empty INDEX or register bit to guarantee normal operation.
    A function with (*)bit doesn’t need internal clock to change state.
    The following registers are accessible at the time of MAPCON=0x0 of the Register Map Control register (0x1c/0x1d).

                      analog volume changes by a +/-1 step towards a register set
                      point after the update in step time for AVFCON register setting.
  AVMUTE
    When this is set, mute becomes effective for the analog volume at the time of reproduction. It can control fading for the
    mute shift by this bit by the analog volume forcibly by AVFADE.

          0           As for the analog volume, a register set point of AVOL is effective.
                      At the time of re-start: The analog volume is set to MUTE.
                      It comes back to the setting Volume in AVOL by canceling it
          1
                      because it writes it. This register level of AVOL cannot be
                      replaced by the setting of this bit.

                      The register setting value of RDATT, PDATT and EQGAIN0 to 3
          0
                      is used actual volume value as it is. Therefore the value is
                      effective immediate.
                      Fading Function ON:
                      The volume is changing to the register setting value of RDATT,
          1
                      PDATT and EQGAIN0 to 3 with 1 step per DVFCON register step
                      time.
  DVMUTE
    This bit is to set MUTE of the digital volume. This mute function is effective for the recording digital volume at recording and
    effective for playback digital volume at playback. The fade function by DVFADE is effective against the volume change by
    this bit.
     DVMUTE                                        Explanation
          0           Register value of RDVOL and PDATT is effective.
                      Digital volume is set to MUTE.
                      Register value of RDVOL and PDATT cannot be changed by this
          1
                      bit, the volume is resumed by releasing this bit (DVMUTE=0) to
                      the original setting value of RDVOL and PDVOL.

    This register sets the gain of each band of the equalizer. If COEFSEL=0, then the register level of EQGAIN0 to 4 is effective.
    If COEFSEL=1, then value of the EQGAIN0B to EQGAIN4B register becomes effective.
    This register can set EQ gain from -71.5dB to 12.0dB(step by step 0.5dB). Also it can set MUTE.
    EQ can work as a notch filter by MUTE setting.

    This register is to set the cut-off frequency of the high-pass filter for the noise reduction during recording.
    Don’t change the setting of this register under the filter processing concerned(HPF2EN="1" and RELPLAY=0x1,0x3 or 0x7).
  HPF2CUT[2:0]
    These set the cut-off frequency of the noise reduction high-pass filter during recording and the numerical value of below list
    expresses 1.5dB damping and 3dB damping frequency in each second order filter(HPF2OD="1") and one order filter
    (HPF2OD="0").

    These registers are to set the coefficients a0 and a1 of each five band programmable equalizer. One coefficients value is
    specified by two bytes data. The centre frequency and band width of the filter can be set by changing these register value.
    Please don’t change the register setting during corresponding filter operation
    EQ0A0L to EQ4A1H are became effective at COEFSEL=0 and EQ0A0LB to EQ4A1HB are became effective at
    COEFSEL=1.
    The detailed setting value is described in the Filter function.

    This register controls zero detection for low power consumption mode. When zero detection is enable and "0" data are
    inputted in succession, a part of internal clock and speaker amplifier goes to disable to operate under low power
    consumption. Controlling a zero detection function for low power consumption mode movement, and enabling this function,
    some internal clocks stop it, and a speaker amplifier is disabled. When data, not 0 data, is input, the disable block starts
    operation again.
    In addition, the zero detection is effective only speaker amplifier playing mode. In the other modes, please set ZDEN bit in
    "0".
  ZDEN
    Enables/Disables the zero detection function.

         0x1         A zero detection function is enabled.
    ZEROTIM
    Sets "0" detection period. When "0" continues more than the following set points in succession with LCH/RCH, it becomes
    low power consumption mode.

    Please consider power dissipation by an actual using status, and perform the thermal design which has a margin enough.
    Although this product is exposing the frame on the bottom side of a package, heat dissipation processing is performed to
    this portion, and we assume raising and using heat dissipation efficiency. Please use not only PCB-top pattern but also
    PCB-bottom pattern, taking heat dissipation pattern as large as possible at it.
    Although D-class speaker amplifier have very high efficiency compared with the conventional analog-speaker amplifier and
    there is also little generation of heat, when continuous action is carried out by the maximum output power, actual power
    dissipation may exceed Pd. Please consider the thermal design enough so that power dissipation of averaging output
    power does not exceed Pd.
    （Tjmax ： Maximum junction temperature=125℃, Ta ：Ambient temperature[℃], θja ：Package thermal registance[℃/W],
    Poav：Averaging output power[W], η：Efficiency）
    Package Power dissipation Pd （W） = （Tjmax - Ta）/ θja
    Circuit Power dissipation Pdiss（W） = Poav * （1 / η- 1）

BU26154MUV                                                                                                            Datasheet
Operational Notes
    1)  Absolute Maximum Ratings
        An excess in the absolute maximum ratings, such as supply voltage, temperature range of operating conditions, etc.,
        can break down devices, thus don’t exceed the absolute maximum ratings of supply voltage, temperature. If any
        special mode exceeding the absolute maximum ratings is assumed, consideration should be given to take physical
        safety measures including the use of fuses, etc.
    2)  GND voltage
        Make setting of the potential of the GND terminal so that it will be maintained at the minimum in any operating state.
    3)  Short circuit between terminals and erroneous mounting
        In order to mount ICs on a set PCB, pay thorough attention to the direction and offset of the ICs. Erroneous mounting
        can break down the ICs. Furthermore, if a short circuit occurs due to foreign matters entering between terminals or
        between the terminal and the power supply or the GND terminal, the ICs can break down.
    4)  Operation in strong electromagnetic field
        Be noted that using ICs in the strong electromagnetic field can malfunction them.
    5)  Thermal design
        If use speaker amplifier function, please consider power dissipation by an actual using status, and perform the thermal
        design which have a margin enough. If an input signal is made excessive in the state with insufficient heat dissipation,
        desired output power may not only be securable, but the thermal shutdown may operate.
    6)  Thermal shutdown
        This IC has the thermal shutdown circuit. If the thermal shutdown operates, speaker output terminal and line output
        terminal will stop in the open state(high inpedance state).The thermal shutdown is only a function for suspending the
        output operation of IC to the last at the time of the thermal run-away under the abnormal condition in which chip
        temperature(Tjmax) exceeded 170 degrees. It is a circuit to protect IC, and the purpose is not offering protection and a
        guarantee of the set.
    7)  Short protection of output terminals
        This IC has the short protect function for output terminals. If the short protect function operates, output terminal will be
        latched and stop in the open state(high inpedance state).After a stop, even if a short state is removed, it does not
        return to normal operation automatically. Please once turn off a power supply or a shutdown signal to make it return,
        and let turn on again and reboot.
    8)  Operating condition
        Operating voltage and operating temperature are ranges which perform basic function. Electrical characteristics and
        absolute maximum rating are not guaranteed in full voltage range or full temperature range.
    9)  Electrical characteristics specification
        Each audio characteristic specification, such as limit output power, total harmonic distortion shows the standard
        performance of the device, and depends for it on board layout / use parts / power supply part greatly.
        Typical specification value is a value when a device and each parts are directly mounted in the board of Rohm's
        standard.
    10) Power supply
        Large peak current rushes into a SPVDD power supply line at the time of ClassD speaker amplifier use.
        The audio characteristic is affected by the value of a power supply decoupling capacitor, and layout.
        The power supply decoupling capacitor should be layouted (1uF or more) with sufficiently low ESR (equivalent series
        resistance) to most close of IC terminal.
        Moreover, in the design of a board pattern, the wiring of a power supply / GND line should become low impedance. In
        that case, even if digital power supply and analog power supply are same potential, please devide the digital power
        pattern and the analog power pattern and reduce a surroundings lump of the digital noise to the analog power supply
        by the common impedance of a wiring pattern.
        Please take the same pattern design into consideration also about a GND line. Moreover, while inserting a capacitor
        between power supply-GND terminals about all the power supply terminals of LSI, and please determine the value of
        capacitor after sufficient confirmation that there is no problem in the characteristics of capacitors to be used (a capacity
        omission happens at low temperature) in the case of electrolytic capacitors use.
    11) External capacitor
        In order to use a ceramic capacitor as the external capacitor, determine the constant with consideration given to a
        degradation in the nominal capacitance due to DC bias and changes in the capacitance due to temperature, etc.

        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
