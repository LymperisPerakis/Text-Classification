attenuation, a microphone bias circuit, handset hybrid circuit, and an
output drive for 32  headphones. The Si3000 can be connected directly
to the Si3034, Si3035, Si3044, and Si3056 North American and
international DAA chipsets through their daisy-chaining serial interface. It
also serves as a companion chip to a FAT ISOmodem chipset with voice
features, providing hardware support for a handset and speaker phone.
The device operates from a single 3.3 to 5 V power supply and is
available in a 16-pin small outline package (SOIC).

 Notes:
     1. All minimum and maximum specifications are guaranteed and apply across the recommended operating conditions.
        Typical values apply at nominal supply voltages and an operating temperature of 25°C unless otherwise stated.
     2. The digital supply, VD, and analog supply, VA, can operate from either 3.3 V or 5.0 V. The Si3000 supports interface to
        3.3 V logic when operating from 3.3 V. VD must be within 0.6 V of VA.
     3. The Si3000 specifications are guaranteed using the typical application circuit (including component tolerance) of
        Figure 13.

 Notes:
 General
    1. All dimensions shown are in millimeters (mm) unless otherwise noted.
    2. Dimensioning and Tolerancing per ASME Y14.5M-1994.
    3. This Land Pattern Design is based on the IPC-7351 guidelines.
    4. All dimensions shown are at Maximum Material Condition (MMC). Least Material Condition (LMC) is calculated based on a
         Fabrication Allowance of 0.05 mm.
 Solder Mask Design
    5. All metal pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance between the solder mask and the metal pad is to be 60 µm
         minimum, all the way around the pad.
 Stencil Design
    6. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be used to assure good solder paste release.
    7. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
    8. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1.
 Card Assembly
    9. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
    10. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020 specification for Small Body Components.
