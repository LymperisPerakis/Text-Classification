                                                             REV. B


                                                                                                                                      4/4
○ Cautions on use
   (1) Absolute Maximum Ratings
       An excess in the absolute maximum ratings, such as supply voltage, temperature range of operating conditions, etc.,
       can break down devices, thus making impossible to identify breaking mode such as a short circuit or an open circuit. If
       any special mode exceeding the absolute maximum ratings is assumed, consideration should be given to take physical
       safety measures including the use of fuses, etc.
   (2) Operating conditions
         These conditions represent a range within which characteristics can be provided approximately as expected. The
         electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
   (3) Reverse connection of power supply connector
         The reverse connection of power supply connector can break down ICs. Take protective measures against the
         breakdown due to the reverse connection, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the
         IC’s power supply terminal.
   (4) Power supply line
       Design PCB pattern to provide low impedance for the wiring between the power supply and the GND lines.In this
       regard, for the digital block power supply and the analog block power supply, even though these power supplies has the
       same level of potential, separate the power supply pattern for the digital block from that for the analog block, thus
       suppressing the diffraction of digital noises to the analog block power supply resulting from impedance common to the
       wiring patterns. For the GND line, give consideration to design the patterns in a similar manner.
       Furthermore, for all power supply terminals to ICs, mount a capacitor between the power supply and the GND terminal.
       At the same time, in order to use an electrolytic capacitor, thoroughly check to be sure the characteristics of the
       capacitor to be used present no problem including the occurrence of capacity dropout at a low temperature, thus
       determining the constant.
   (5) GND voltage
         Make setting of the potential of the GND terminal so that it will be maintained at the minimum in any operating state.
         Furthermore, check to be sure no terminals are at a potential lower than the GND voltage including an actual electric
         transient.
   (6) Short circuit between terminals and erroneous mounting
         In order to mount ICs on a set PCB, pay thorough attention to the direction and offset of the ICs. Erroneous mounting
         can break down the ICs. Furthermore, if a short circuit occurs due to foreign matters entering between terminals or
         between the terminal and the power supply or the GND terminal, the ICs can break down.
   (7) Operation in strong electromagnetic field
         Be noted that using ICs in the strong electromagnetic field can malfunction them.
   (8) Inspection with set PCB
         On the inspection with the set PCB, if a capacitor is connected to a low-impedance IC terminal, the IC can suffer
         stress. Therefore, be sure to discharge from the set PCB by each process. Furthermore, in order to mount or
         dismount the set PCB to/from the jig for the inspection process, be sure to turn OFF the power supply and then mount
         the set PCB to the jig. After the completion of the inspection, be sure to turn OFF the power supply and then dismount
         it from the jig. In addition, for protection against static electricity, establish a ground for the assembly process and pay
         thorough attention to the transportation and the storage of the set PCB.
   (9)Input terminals
         In terms of the construction of IC, parasitic elements are inevitably formed in relation to potential. The operation of the
         parasitic element can cause interference with circuit operation, thus resulting in a malfunction and then breakdown of
         the input terminal. Therefore, pay thorough attention not to handle the input terminals, such as to apply to the input
         terminals a voltage lower than the GND respectively, so that any parasitic element will operate. Furthermore, do not
         apply a voltage to the input terminals when no power supply voltage is applied to the IC. In addition, even if the power
         supply voltage is applied, apply to the input terminals a voltage lower than the power supply voltage or within the
         guaranteed value of electrical characteristics.
   (10) Ground wiring pattern
         If small-signal GND and large-current GND are provided, It will be recommended to separate the large-current GND
         pattern from the small-signal GND pattern and establish a single ground at the reference point of the set PCB so that
         resistance to the wiring pattern and voltage fluctuations due to a large current will cause no fluctuations in voltages of
         the small-signal GND. Pay attention not to cause fluctuations in the GND wiring pattern of external parts as well.
   (11) External capacitor
         In order to use a ceramic capacitor as the external capacitor, determine the constant with consideration given to a
         degradation in the nominal capacitance due to DC bias and changes in the capacitance due to temperature, etc.
