5. APPLICATIONS
5.1   Stand-Alone Mode
5.1.1   Access to Stand-Alone Mode
        Reliable power-up is achieved by keeping the device in reset until the power supplies, clocks and config-
        uration pins are stable. It is also recommended that RST be asserted if the analog or digital supplies drop
        below the minimum specified operating voltages to prevent power glitch related issues.
        The delay time from the release of reset until the device enters Stand-Alone Mode is 1,045 sample peri-
        ods. Table 2 lists the approximate wait time for each sampling mode.
                                      Speed Mode         Approximate Delay Time
                                Single-Speed                 21.8 ms (48 kHz)
                                Double-Speed                 10.9 ms (96 kHz)
                                Quad-Speed                   5.4 ms (192 kHz)
               Table 2. Approximate Delay Time from Release of RST to Entering Standalone Mode
5.1.2   Access to Master/Slave Mode
        The CS4270 supports operation in either Master Mode or Slave Mode.
        In Master Mode, LRCK and SCLK are outputs and are synchronously generated by the device. The LRCK
        frequency is equal to Fs and the SCLK frequency is equal to 64x Fs.
        In Slave Mode, LRCK and SCLK are inputs, requiring external generation that is synchronous to MCLK.
        SCLK must be 48x or 64x Fs to maximize system performance.
        In Stand-Alone Mode, the CS4270 enters Slave Mode when SDOUT (M/S) is pulled low through a 47 k
        resistor. Master Mode is accessed by placing a 47 k pull-up to VD on the SDOUT (M/S) pin.
        Configuration of clock ratios in each of these modes is outlined in Table 4.

        The CS4270 operates at sampling frequencies from 4 kHz to 216 kHz. This range is divided into three
        speed modes, as shown in Table 3.
                                            Mode           Sampling Frequency
                                  Single-Speed                   4-54 kHz
                                  Double-Speed                  50-108 kHz

5.1.4   Clock Ratio Selection
        Depending on whether the CS4270 is in Master or Slave Mode, different MCLK/LRCK and SCLK/LRCK
        ratios may be used. These ratios are shown in the Table 4. ‘0’ = DGND, ‘1’ = VLC.

Note: 22. Once the MDIVx pins have been configured for this setting, RST must be asserted and then deasserted
           before normal operation can begin. During startup, RST should remain asserted until after this selection
           is made and then deasserted.
5.1.5   Interpolation Filter
        In Stand-Alone Mode, the fast roll-off interpolation filter is used. Filter specifications can be found in Sec-
        tion 4. Plots of the data are contained in Section 9. “Filter Plots” on page 38.
5.1.6   High-Pass Filter
        At the system level, the input circuitry driving the CS4270 may generate a small DC offset into the ADC.
        The CS4270 includes one high-pass filter per channel after the decimator to remove any DC offset, which
20                                                                                                           DS686F1


                                                                                                           CS4270
         could result in recording a DC level, possibly yielding "clicks" when switching between devices in a multi-
         channel system. In Stand-Alone Mode, the high-pass filter is always active and continuously subtracts a
         measure of the DC offset from the output of the decimation filter.
5.1.7    Mode Selection & De-Emphasis
         The sample rate, Fs, can be adjusted from 4 kHz to 216 kHz and De-emphasis, optimized for 44.1 kHz,
         is available in Single-Speed Mode. In Stand-Alone Master Mode, the CS4270 must be set to the proper
         mode via the mode pins, M1 and M0. In Slave Mode, the CS4270 auto-detects Speed Mode and the M0
         pin becomes De-emphasis select. Stand-alone definitions of the mode pins in Master Mode are shown in
         Table 5.

5.1.8    Access to Serial Audio Interface Format
         Either I²S or Left-Justified serial audio data format may be selected in Stand-Alone Mode. To use the I2S
         format, tie the I²S/LJ pin to VLC during power up. To use LJ format, tie I²S/LJ to DGND during power up.
5.2   Serial Control Port Mode
5.2.1    Access to Serial Control Port Mode
         Reliable power-up is achieved by keeping the device in reset until the power supplies, clocks, and config-
         uration pins are stable. It is also recommended that RST be asserted if the analog or digital supplies drop
         below the minimum specified operating voltages to prevent power glitch related issues.
         After RST is released, the device is put into Serial Control Port Mode by setting the power down bit
         through a SPI or I²C transaction, as described in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.
         If the transaction is not completed within 1,045 sample periods after the release of reset, the device enters
         Stand-Alone Mode.
         If the first Serial Control Port transaction is ongoing while the device is executing pop control, there is a
         chance of generating audio transients. The details of the duration of pop control is outlined in Section 5.3.1
         “Power-Up” on page 24.
         When the device is Serial Control Port Mode, it can be programmed as desired. After clearing the power-
         down bit, desired device functioning can start.
5.2.2    Access to Master/Slave Mode
         The CS4270 supports operation in either Master Mode or Slave Mode.
       •    In Master Mode, LRCK and SCLK are outputs and are synchronously generated by the device. LRCK
            is equal to Fs and SCLK is equal to 64x Fs.
       •    In Slave Mode, LRCK and SCLK are inputs, requiring external generation that is synchronous to MCLK.
            It is recommended that SCLK be 48x or 64x Fs to maximize system performance.
DS686F1                                                                                                              21


                                                                                                   CS4270
      Clock-ratio configuration for each mode is outlined in the Table 11 on page 34 and Table 10 on page 33.
      In Serial Control Port Mode, the CS4270 defaults to Slave Mode. The user may change this default setting
      by changing the status of the FM bits in the Mode Control Register (03h).
5.2.3 System Clocking
      The CS4270 operates at sampling frequencies from 4 kHz to 216 kHz. This range is divided into three
      speed modes as shown in Table 6.
                                        Mode            Sampling Frequency
                                 Single-Speed                    4-54 kHz
                                 Double-Speed                   50-108 kHz
                                 Quad-Speed                    100-216 kHz
                                             Table 6. Speed Modes
5.2.4 Clock Ratio Selection
      In Serial Control Port Master Mode, the user must configure the mode bits (MCLK_FREQ[2:0]) to set the
      speed mode and select the appropriate clock ratios. Changes to these bits should only be done while the
      PDN bit is set. Depending on whether the CS4270 is in Master or Slave Mode, different MCLK/LRCK and
      SCLK/LRCK ratios may be used. These ratios as well as the Serial Control Port Register Bits are shown
      in Table 7, Table 10 on page 33, and Section 8.3 on page 33. ‘0’ = DGND, ‘1’ = VLC.

5.2.5   Internal Digital Loopback
        In Serial Control Port Mode, the CS4270 supports an internal digital loopback mode in which the output
        of the ADC is routed to the input of the DAC. This mode may be activated by setting the DIG_LOOPBK
        bit in the ADC and DAC Control register (04h).
        When this bit is set, the CS4270 ignores the status of the DAC_DIF(4:3) bits in register 04h. Any changes
        made to the DAC_DIF(4:3) bits while the DIG_LOOPBK bit is set will have no impact on operation until
        the DIG_LOOPBK bit is released, at which time the Digital Interface Format of the DAC will operate ac-
        cording to the format selected in the DAC_DIF(4:3) bits. While the DIG_LOOPBK bit is set, data will be
        present on the SDOUT pin in the format selected in the ADC_DIF(0) bit in register 04h.
5.2.6   Auto-Mute
        The Auto-Mute function is controlled by the status of the Auto Mute bit in the Mute register. When set, the
        DAC output will mute following the reception of 8192 consecutive audio samples of static 0 or -1. A single
        sample of non-static data will release the mute. Detection and muting are done independently for each
        channel. The common mode on the output will be retained and the Mute Control pin for that channel will
        become active during the mute period. The muting function is affected, similar to volume control changes,
        by the Soft and Zero Cross bits in the Transition and Control register. The Auto Mute bit is set by default.
5.2.7   DC Offset Calibration Using the High-Pass Filter
        At the system level, the input circuitry driving the CS4270 may generate a small DC offset level into the
        A/D converter which could result in possibly yielding "clicks" when switching between devices in a multi-
        channel system. The CS4270 includes one high-pass filter per channel (see “ADC High Pass Filter Freeze
        for CH A (Bit 7)” on page 34 and “ADC High Pass Filter Freeze for CH A (Bit 7)” on page 34) to alleviate
        this system problem.
        Running the CS4270 with the high-pass filter enabled, then freezing the stored DC offset value eliminates
        offsets anywhere in the signal path between the calibration point and the CS4270.

                                                                                                           CS4270
5.2.8   Oversampling Modes
        The CS4270 operates in one of three oversampling modes based on the input sample rate. Mode selec-
        tion is determined by the FM bits in the Mode Control Register (03h). Single-Speed Mode supports input
        sample rates from 4 to 54 kHz and uses a 128x oversampling ratio. Double-Speed Mode supports input
        sample rates from 50 to 108 kHz and uses an oversampling ratio of 64x. Quad-Speed Mode supports in-
        put sample rates from 100 to 216 kHz and uses an oversampling ratio of 32x. See Table 7 on page 22.
5.3   Popguard Transient Control
      The CS4270 uses a novel technique to minimize the effects of output transients during power-up and power-
      down. This technology, when used with external DC-blocking capacitors in series with the audio outputs,
      minimizes the audio transients commonly produced by single-ended single-supply converters. The Pop-
      guard Transient Control is activated inside the DAC when RST is toggled and requires no other external
      control, aside from choosing the appropriate DC-blocking capacitor. See Section 8.3.3 for information about
      configuration.
5.3.1   Power-Up
        When the device is initially powered-up, the audio outputs, AOUTA and AOUTB, are clamped to
        AGND.Following a delay of 1,045 sample periods, each output begins to ramp toward the quiescent volt-
        age. Approximately 0.4 seconds later, the outputs reach VQ and audio output begins.This gradual voltage
        ramping allows time for the external DC-blocking capacitors to charge to the quiescent voltage, minimizing
        audible power-up transients.
5.3.2   Power-Down
        To prevent audible transients at power-down, the device must first enter its power-down state. When this
        occurs, audio output ceases and the internal output buffers are disconnected from AOUTA and AOUTB.
        In their place, a soft-start current sink is substituted which allows the DC-blocking capacitors to slowly dis-
        charge. Once this charge is dissipated, the power to the device may be turned off and the system is ready
        for the next power-on.
5.3.3   Discharge Time
        To prevent an audio transient at the next power-on, the DC-blocking capacitors must fully discharge be-
        fore turning on the power or exiting the power-down state. If full discharge does not occur, a transient will
        occur when the audio outputs are initially clamped to AGND. The time that the device must remain in the
        power-down state is related to the value of the DC-blocking capacitance and the output load. For example,
        with a 3.3 F capacitor, the minimum power-down time will be approximately 0.4 seconds.
5.4   De-Emphasis Filter (Single-Speed Mode Only)
        The CS4270 includes a digital de-emphasis filter. Figure 14 shows the de-emphasis curve for Fs equal to
        44.1 kHz. The frequency response of the de-emphasis curve will scale proportionally with changes in
        sample rate, Fs. Please see Section 5.1.7 for the desired de-emphasis control for Stand-Alone Mode and
        Section 5.2 for Serial Control Port Mode.
        The de-emphasis feature is included to accommodate audio recordings that use 50/15 s pre-emphasis
        equalization as a means of noise reduction.

5.5   Analog Connections
        The analog modulator samples the input at 6.144 MHz for Fs = 48, 96, and 128 kHz and scales propor-
        tionally for all other sampling speeds.The digital filter rejects signals within the stopband of the filter. How-
        ever, there is no rejection for input signals that are multiples of the input sampling frequency (e.g.,
        n  6.144 MHz), where n = 0, 1, 2, ... . Figure 15 shows the recommended topology of the analog input
        network. The capacitor values are chosen not only provide the appropriate filtering of noise at the modu-
        lator sampling frequency, but to act as a charge source for the internal sampling circuits. The use of ca-
        pacitors with a large voltage coefficient (such as general-purpose ceramics) can degrade signal linearity.

        Table 8 shows the three parameters (source impedance, attenuation, and input impedance) that deter-
        mine the values of resistors R1 and R2, as seen in Figure 15, and shows the design equations used to
        determine these values.

        bined with that of the digital interpolator, is given in Figures 23 - 46. The recommended external analog
        circuitry is shown in Figure 18.

5.6   Mute Control
      The Mute Control pins become active during power-up initialization, reset, muting, when the MCLK to LRCK
      ratio is incorrect, and during power-down. The MUTE pins are intended to be used as control for an external
      mute circuit in order to add device mute capability.
      The CS4270 also features Auto-Mute, which is enabled by default. The Auto-Mute function causes the
      MUTE pin corresponding to an individual channel to activate following the reception of 8192 consecutive
      static-level audio samples on the respective channel. A single transition of data on the channel will cause
      the corresponding MUTE pin to deactivate.
      Use of the Mute Control function is not mandatory but recommended for designs requiring the absolute min-
      imum in extraneous clicks and pops. Also, use of the Mute Control function can enable the system designer
      to achieve idle channel noise/signal-to-noise ratios which are only limited by the external mute circuit. The
      MUTE pins are active-low. See Figure 19 for a suggested active-low mute circuit.

5.7  Synchronization of Multiple Devices
     In systems where multiple ADCs are required, care must be taken to achieve simultaneous sampling. To
     ensure synchronous sampling, the MCLK and LRCK must be the same for all of the CS4270s in the system.
     If only one MCLK source is needed, one solution is to place one CS4270 in Master Mode, and slave all of
     the other CS4270s to the one master. If multiple MCLK sources are needed, a possible solution would be
     to supply all clocks from the same external source and time the CS4270 reset with the inactive edge of
     MCLK. This will ensure that all converters begin sampling on the same clock edge.
5.8  Grounding and Power Supply Decoupling
     As with any high resolution converter, the CS4270 requires careful attention to power supply and grounding
     arrangements if its potential performance is to be realized. Figure 1 on page 7 shows the recommended
     power arrangements, with VA, VD and VLC connected to clean supplies. VD, which powers the digital filter,
     may be run from the system digital supply or may be powered from the analog supply via a resistor. In the
     latter case, no additional devices should be powered from VD. See Figure 1 on page 7 for an example. Pow-
     er supply decoupling capacitors should be as near to the CS4270 as possible, with the low value ceramic
     capacitor being the nearest. All signals, especially clocks, should be kept away from the FILT+ and VQ pins
     in order to avoid unwanted coupling into the modulators. The FILT+ and VQ decoupling capacitors, partic-
     ularly the 0.1 µF, must be positioned to minimize the electrical path to AGND. The CDB4270 evaluation
     board demonstrates the optimum layout and power supply arrangements. To minimize digital noise, connect
     the CS4270 digital outputs only to CMOS inputs.
6. SOFTWARE MODE
6.1  Software Mode - I²C Control Port
     Software Mode is used to access the registers, allowing the CS4270 to be configured for the desired oper-
     ational modes and formats. The operation in Software Mode may be completely asynchronous with respect
     to the audio sample rates. However, to avoid potential interference problems, the I²C pins should remain
     static if no operation is required. Software Mode supports the I²C interface, with the CS4270 acting as a
     slave device.
     SDA is a bidirectional data line. Data is clocked into and out of the part by the clock, SCL. Pin AD0 forms
     the least significant bit of the chip address and should be connected through a resistor to VL or GND as
     desired. The state of the pin is sensed while the CS4270 is being reset.
     The signal timings for a read and write cycle are shown in Figure 20 and Figure 21. A Start condition is de-
     fined as a falling transition of SDA while the clock is high. A Stop condition is a rising transition while the
     clock is high. All other transitions of SDA occur while the clock is low. The first byte sent to the CS4270 after
     a Start condition consists of a 7-bit chip address field and a R/W bit (high for a read, low for a write). The
     upper 5 bits of the 7-bit address field are fixed at 10011. To communicate with a CS4270, the chip address
     field, which is the first byte sent to the CS4270, should match 10011 followed by the settings of AD0. The
     eighth bit of the address is the R/W bit. If the operation is a write, the next byte is the Memory Address Point-
     er (MAP) which selects the register to be read or written. If the operation is a read, the contents of the reg-
     ister pointed to by the MAP will be output. Setting the auto increment bit in MAP allows successive reads or
     writes of consecutive registers. Each byte is separated by an acknowledge bit. The ACK bit is output from
     the CS4270 after each input byte is read, and is input to the CS4270 from the microcontroller after each
     transmitted byte.

      Since the read operation can not set the MAP, an aborted write operation is used as a preamble. As shown
      in Figure 21, the write operation is aborted after the acknowledge for the MAP byte by sending a stop con-
      dition. The following pseudocode illustrates an aborted write operation followed by a read operation.
         Send start condition.
         Send 10011xx0 (chip address & write operation).
         Receive acknowledge bit.
         Send MAP byte, auto increment off.
         Receive acknowledge bit.
         Send stop condition, aborting write.
         Send start condition.
         Send 10011xx1(chip address & read operation).
         Receive acknowledge bit.
         Receive byte, contents of selected register.
         Send acknowledge bit.
         Send stop condition.
      Setting the auto increment bit in the MAP allows successive reads or writes of consecutive registers. Each
      byte is separated by an acknowledge bit.
6.2   Software Mode - SPI Control Port
      In SPI Mode, data is clocked into the serial control data line, CDIN, by the serial clock, CCLK (see Figure 22
      for the clock to data relationship). There are no AD0 or AD1 pins. Pin CS is the chip select signal and is
      used to control SPI writes to the registers. When the device detects a high-to-low transition on the AD0/CS
      pin after power-up, SPI Mode will be selected. All signals are inputs and data is clocked in on the rising edge
      of CCLK.
6.2.1    SPI Write
         To write to the device, use the following procedure while adhering to the Software Mode switching spec-
         ifications in “Switching Characteristics - Software Mode - SPI Format” section on page 18.
DS686F1                                                                                                                                                   29

      1. Bring CS low.
      2. The address byte on the CDIN pin must then be 10011110 (R/W = 0).
      3. Write to the memory address pointer, MAP. This byte points to the register to be written.
      4. Write the desired data to the register pointed to by the MAP.
      5. If the INCR bit (see Section 6.2.3.1) is set to 1, repeat the previous step until all the desired registers
           are written, then bring CS high.
      6. If the INCR bit is set to 0 and further SPI writes to other registers are desired, it is necessary to bring
           CS high, and follow the procedure detailed from step 1. If no further writes to other registers are
           desired, bring CS high
6.2.2 SPI Read
      To read from the device, use the following procedure while adhering to the values specified in “Switching
      Characteristics - Software Mode - SPI Format” section on page 18.
      1.    Bring CS low.
      2. The address byte on the CDIN pin must then be 10011111 (R/W = 1).
      3. CDOUT pin will then output the data from the register pointed to by the MAP, which is set during the
           SPI write operation.
      4. If the INCR bit (see Section 6.2.3.1) is set to 1, keep CS low and continue providing clocks on CCLK
           to read from multiple consecutive registers. Bring CS high when reading is complete.
      5. If the INCR bit is set to 0 and further SPI reads from other registers are desired, it is necessary to bring
           CS high, and follow the procedure detailed from step 1. If no further reads from other registers are
           desired, bring CS high.

6.2.3      Memory Address Pointer (MAP)
           The MAP byte comes after the address byte and selects the register to be read or written. Refer to
           Figures 20 and 21 on page 29, and Figure 22 on page 30.
           6.2.3.1      Map Increment (INCR)
           The device has MAP auto increment capability enabled by the INCR bit (the MSB) of the MAP. If INCR is
           set to 0, MAP will stay constant for successive I²C writes or reads and SPI writes. If INCR is set to 1, MAP
           will auto increment after each byte is written, allowing block reads or writes of successive registers.

8.4.1    ADC High Pass Filter Freeze for CH A (Bit 7)
         Function:
         When this bit is set, the internal high-pass filter DC offset value for channel A are frozen.This value is con-
         tinuously subtracted from the conversion result. To recalibrate ADC channel A and obtain a new or con-
         tinuous value for the system DC offset, clear this bit. See “DC Offset Calibration Using the High-Pass
         Filter” on page 23.
8.4.2    ADC High Pass Filter Freeze for CH B (Bit 6)
         Function:
         When this bit is set, the internal high-pass filter for channel B are frozen.The current DC offset value will
         be static and continuously subtracted from the conversion. To recalibrate ADC channel A and obtain a
         new or continuous value for the system DC offset, clear this bit. See “DC Offset Calibration Using the
         High-Pass Filter” on page 23.
8.4.3    Digital Loopback (Bit 5)
         Function:
         When this bit is set, an internal digital loopback from the ADC to the DAC will be enabled. See Section

8.5.1    DAC Single Volume (Bit 7)
         Function:
         The AOUTA and AOUTB volume levels are independently controlled by the DAC Channel A & B Volume
         Control Registers when this bit is cleared.
         The volumes on AOUTA and AOUTB are locked together and determined by the DAC Channel A Volume
         Control Register (07h) when this bit is set.
8.5.2    Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable (Bits 6:5)
         Function:
         Soft Ramp Enable
         Soft Ramp allows level changes, both muting and attenuation, to be implemented by incrementally ramp-
         ing, in 1/8 dB steps, from the current level to the new level at a rate of 1 dB per 8 left/right clock periods.
         See Table 13 on page 35.
         Zero Cross Enable
         Zero Cross Enable dictates that signal level changes, either by attenuation changes or muting, will occur
         on a signal zero crossing to minimize audible artifacts. The requested level change will occur after a time-
         out period between 512 and 1,024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sample rate) if the signal
         does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently monitored and implemented
         for each channel.
         Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable
         Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable dictate that signal level changes, either by attenuation changes or mut-
         ing, will occur in 1/8 dB steps and be implemented on a signal zero crossing. The 1/8 dB level change will
         occur after a time-out period between 512 and 1,024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sam-
         ple rate) if the signal does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently mon-

         Function:
         The digital volume control allows the user to attenuate the signal in 0.5 dB increments from 0 to -127 dB.
         VOL0 activates a 0.5 dB attenuation when set, and no attenuation when cleared. VOL[7:0] activates at-
         tenuation equal to their decimal value (in dB). Example volume settings are decoded as shown in
         Table 14. The volume changes are implemented as dictated by the DAC_SOFT and DAC_ZC bits in the
         Transition Control register (see Section 8.5.2).

10.PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
Dynamic Range
The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified bandwidth.
Dynamic Range is a signal-to-noise ratio measurement over the specified bandwidth made with a -60 dBFS signal.
60 dB is added to resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full-scale. This technique ensures that the
distortion components are below the noise level and do not affect the measurement. This measurement technique
has been accepted by the Audio Engineering Society, AES17-1991, and the Electronic Industries Association of Ja-
pan, EIAJ CP-307. Expressed in decibels.
Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise
The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified bandwidth
(typically 10 Hz to 20 kHz), including distortion components. Expressed in decibels. For ADCs, measured at -1 and
-20 dBFS as suggested in AES17-1991 Annex A. For DACs, measured at 0 dB relative to full scale.
Frequency Response
A measure of the amplitude response variation from 10 Hz to 20 kHz relative to the amplitude response at 1 kHz.
Units in decibels.
Interchannel Isolation
A measure of crosstalk between the left and right channels. Measured for each channel at the converter's output
with no signal to the input under test and a full-scale signal applied to the other channel. Units in decibels.
Interchannel Gain Mismatch
The gain difference between left and right channels. Units in decibels.
Gain Error
The deviation from the nominal full-scale analog output for a full-scale digital input.
Gain Drift
The change in gain value with temperature. Units in ppm/°C.
