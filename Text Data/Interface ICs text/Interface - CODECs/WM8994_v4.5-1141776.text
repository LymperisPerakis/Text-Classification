                      ESD Sensitive Device. This device is manufactured on a CMOS process. It is therefore generically susceptible
                      to damage from excessive static voltages. Proper ESD precautions must be taken during handling and storage
                      of this device.
 Cirrus Logic tests its package types according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020B for Moisture Sensitivity to determine acceptable storage
 conditions prior to surface mount assembly. These levels are:
 MSL1 = unlimited floor life at <30C / 85% Relative Humidity. Not normally stored in moisture barrier bag.
 MSL2 = out of bag storage for 1 year at <30C / 60% Relative Humidity. Supplied in moisture barrier bag.

 Notes
 1.    Analogue, digital and speaker grounds must always be within 0.3V of AGND.
 2.    There is no power sequencing requirement; the supplies may be enabled in any order.
 3.    AVDD1 must be less than or equal to SPKVDD1 and SPKVDD2.
 4.    An internal LDO (powered by LDO1VDD) can be used to provide the AVDD1 supply.
 5.    When AVDD1 is supplied externally (not from LDO1), the LDO1VDD voltage must be greater than or equal to AVDD1
 6.    The WM8994 can operate with AVDD1 tied to 0V; power consumption may be reduced, but the analogue audio functions will
       not be supported.
 7.    An internal LDO (powered by LDO2VDD) can be used to provide the DCVDD supply.
 8.    When DCVDD is supplied externally (not from LDO2), the LDO2VDD voltage must be greater than or equal to DCVDD
 9.    DCVDD and AVDD1 minimum rise times do not apply when these domains are powered using the internal LDOs.
 10. The specified minimum power supply rise times assume a minimum decoupling capacitance of 100nF per pin. However, Cirrus
       Logic strongly advises that the recommended decoupling capacitors are present on the PCB and that appropriate layout
       guidelines are observed (see “Applications Information” section).
 11. The specified minimum power supply rise times also assume a maximum PCB inductance of 10nH between decoupling
       capacitor and pin.

 THERMAL PERFORMANCE
                               Thermal analysis should be performed in the intended application to prevent the WM8994 from
                               exceeding maximum junction temperature. Several contributing factors affect thermal performance
                               most notably the physical properties of the mechanical enclosure, location of the device on the PCB in
                               relation to surrounding components and the number of PCB layers. Connecting the GND balls through
                               thermal vias and into a large ground plane will aid heat extraction.
                               Three main heat transfer paths exist to surrounding air as illustrated below in Figure 1:
                                          -    Package top to air (radiation).
                                          -    Package bottom to PCB (radiation).
                                          -    Package balls to PCB (conduction).

                               The temperature rise TR is given by TR = PD * ӨJA
                                          -    PD is the power dissipated in the device.
                                          -    ӨJA is the thermal resistance from the junction of the die to the ambient temperature
                                               and is therefore a measure of heat transfer from the die to surrounding air. ӨJA is
                                               determined with reference to JEDEC standard JESD51-9.
                               The junction temperature TJ is given by TJ = TA +TR, where TA is the ambient temperature.

 Note:
 Junction temperature is a function of ambient temperature and of the device operating conditions. The ambient temperature limits
 and junction temperature limits must both be observed.

Notes:
1.   The full-scale input signal level changes in proportion with AVDD1. It is calculated as AVDD1/3.0.
2.   When mixing line inputs, input PGA outputs and DAC outputs the total signal must not exceed 1.0Vrms (0dBV).
3.   A 1.0Vrms differential signal equates to 0.5Vrms/-6dBV per input.
4.   A sinusoidal input signal is assumed.

 TERMINOLOGY
 1. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (dB) – SNR is a measure of the difference in level between the maximum full scale output signal and the
    output with no input signal applied.
 2. Total Harmonic Distortion (dB) – THD is the level of the rms value of the sum of harmonic distortion products relative to the
    amplitude of the measured output signal.
 3. Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (dB) – THD+N is the level of the rms value of the sum of harmonic distortion products
    plus noise in the specified bandwidth relative to the amplitude of the measured output signal.
 4. Power Supply Rejection Ratio (dB) - PSRR is the ratio of a specified power supply variation relative to the output signal that
    results from it. PSRR is measured under quiescent signal path conditions.
 5. Common Mode Rejection Ratio (dB) – CMRR is the ratio of a specified input signal (applied to both sides of a differential
    input), relative to the output signal that results from it.
 6. Channel Separation (L/R) (dB) – left-to-right and right-to-left channel separation is the difference in level between the active
    channel (driven to maximum full scale output) and the measured signal level in the idle channel at the test signal frequency.
    The active channel is configured and supplied with an appropriate input signal to drive a full scale output, with signal measured
    at the output of the associated idle channel.
 7. Multi-Path Crosstalk (dB) – is the difference in level between the output of the active path and the measured signal level in the
    idle path at the test signal frequency. The active path is configured and supplied with an appropriate input signal to drive a full
    scale output, with signal measured at the output of the specified idle path.
 8. Mute Attenuation – This is a measure of the difference in level between the full scale output signal and the output with mute
    applied.
 9. All performance measurements carried out with 20kHz low pass filter, and where noted an A-weighted filter. Failure to use
    such a filter will result in higher THD and lower SNR readings than are found in the Electrical Characteristics. The low pass
    filter removes out of band noise; although it is not audible it may affect dynamic specification values.

                                When TDM operation is used on the ADCDATn pins, it is important that two devices do not attempt to
                                drive the ADCDATn pin simultaneously. To support this requirement, the ADCDATn pins can be
                                configured to be tri-stated when not outputting data.
                                The timing of the WM8994 ADCDATn tri-stating at the start and end of the data transmission is
                                described in Figure 6 below.

 DEVICE DESCRIPTION
 INTRODUCTION
                The WM8994 is a low power, high quality audio codec designed to interface with a wide range of
                processors and analogue components. A high level of mixed-signal integration in a very small footprint
                makes it ideal for portable applications such as mobile phones. Fully differential internal architecture
                and on-chip RF noise filters ensure a very high degree of noise immunity.
                The analogue circuits of the WM8994 are almost entirely backwards-compatible with the WM8993
                with the exception of two additional DAC channels, a dual FLL and two integrated LDO regulators.
                Three sets of audio interface pins are available in order to provide independent and fully
                asynchronous connections to multiple processors, typically an application processor, baseband
                processor and wireless transceiver. Any two of these interfaces can operate totally independently and
                asynchronously while the third interface can be synchronised to either of the other two and can also
                provide ultra low power loopback modes to support, for example, wireless headset voice calls.
                Four digital microphone input channels are available to support advanced multi-microphone
                applications such as noise cancellation. An integrated microphone activity monitor is available to
                enable the processor to sleep during periods of microphone inactivity, saving power.
                Four DAC channels are available to support use cases requiring up to four simultaneous digital audio
                streams to the output drivers.
                Eight highly flexible analogue inputs allow interfacing to up to four microphone inputs (single-ended or
                differential), plus multiple stereo or mono line inputs. Connections to an external voice CODEC, FM
                radio, line input, handset MIC and headset MIC are all fully supported. Signal routing to the output
                mixers and within the CODEC has been designed for maximum flexibility to support a wide variety of
                usage modes. A ‘Direct Voice’ path from a voice CODEC directly to the Speaker or Earpiece output
                drivers is included.
                Nine analogue output drivers are integrated, including a stereo pair of high power, high quality
                Class D/AB switchable speaker drivers; these can support 2W each in stereo mode. It is also possible
                to configure the speaker drivers as a mono output, giving enhanced performance. A mono earpiece
                driver is provided, providing output from the output mixers or from the low-power differential ‘Direct
                Voice’ path.
                One pair of ground-reference headphone outputs is provided; these are powered from an integrated
                Charge Pump, enabling high quality, power efficient headphone playback without any requirement for
                DC blocking capacitors. A DC Servo circuit is available for DC offset correction, thereby suppressing
                pops and reducing power consumption. Four line outputs are provided, with multiple configuration
                options including 4 x single-ended output or 2 x differential outputs. The line outputs are suitable for
                output to a voice CODEC, an external speaker driver or line output connector. Ground loop feedback
                is available on the headphone outputs and the line outputs, providing rejection of noise on the ground
                connections. All outputs have integrated pop and click suppression features.
                Internal differential signal routing and amplifier configurations have been optimised to provide the
                highest performance and lowest possible power consumption for a wide range of usage scenarios,
                including voice calls and music playback. The speaker drivers offer low leakage and high PSRR; this
                enables direct connection to a Lithium battery. The speaker drivers provide eight levels of AC and DC
                gain to allow output signal levels to be maximised for many commonly-used SPKVDD/AVDD1
                combinations.
                The ADCs and DACs are of hi-fi quality, using a 24-bit low-order oversampling architecture to deliver
                optimum performance. A flexible clocking arrangement supports mixed sample rates, whilst integrated
                ultra-low power dual FLLs provide additional flexibility. A high pass filter is available in all ADC and
                digital MIC paths for removing DC offsets and suppressing low frequency noise such as mechanical
                vibration and wind noise. A digital mixing path from the ADC or digital MICs to the DAC provides a
                sidetone of enhanced quality during voice calls. DAC soft mute and un-mute is available for pop-free
                music playback.
                The integrated Dynamic Range Controllers (DRC) and ReTune Mobile 5-band parametric equaliser
                (EQ) provide further processing capability of the digital audio paths. The DRC provides compression
                and signal level control to improve the handling of unpredictable signal levels. ‘Anti-clip’ and ‘quick
                release’ algorithms improve intelligibility in the presence of transients and impulsive noises. The EQ
                provides the capability to tailor the audio path according to the frequency characteristics of an
                earpiece or loudspeaker, and/or according to user preferences.

                                                                                          WM8994
        The WM8994 has highly flexible digital audio interfaces, supporting a number of protocols, including
        I2S, DSP, MSB-first left/right justified, and can operate in master or slave modes. PCM operation is
        supported in the DSP mode. A-law and -law companding are also supported. Time division
        multiplexing (TDM) is available to allow multiple devices to stream data simultaneously on the same
        bus, saving space and power. The four digital MIC and ADC channels and four DAC channels are
        available via four TDM channels on Digital Audio Interface 1 (AIF1).
        A powerful digital mixing core allows data from each TDM channel of each audio interface and from
        the ADCs and digital MICs to be mixed and re-routed back to a different audio interface and to the 4
        DAC output channels. The digital mixing core can operate synchronously with either Audio Interface 1
        or Audio Interface 2, with asynchronous stereo full duplex sample rate conversion performed on the
        other audio interface as required.
        The system clock (SYSCLK) provides clocking for the ADCs, DACs, DSP core, digital audio interface
        and other circuits. SYSCLK can be derived directly from one of the MCLK1 or MCLK2 pins or via one
        of two integrated FLLs, providing flexibility to support a wide range of clocking schemes. Typical
        portable system MCLK frequencies, and sample rates from 8kHz to 96kHz are all supported.
        Automatic configuration of the clocking circuits is available, derived from the sample rate and from the
        MCLK / SYSCLK ratio.
        The WM8994 uses a standard 2, 3 or 4-wire control interface, providing full software control of all
        features, together with device register readback. An integrated Control Write Sequencer enables
        automatic scheduling of control sequences; commonly-used signal configurations may be selected
        using ready-programmed sequences, including time-optimised control of the WM8994 pop
        suppression features. It is an ideal partner for a wide range of industry standard microprocessors,
        controllers and DSPs. Unused circuitry can be disabled under software control, in order to save
        power; low leakage currents enable extended standby/off time in portable battery-powered
        applications.
        Versatile GPIO functionality is provided, with support for button/accessory detect inputs, or for clock,
        system status, or programmable logic level output for control of additional external circuitry. Interrupt
        logic, status readback and de-bouncing options are supported within this functionality.

ANALOGUE INPUT SIGNAL PATH
                           The WM8994 has eight highly flexible analogue input channels, configurable in a large number of
                           combinations:
                           1. Up to four fully differential or single-ended microphone inputs
                           2. Up to eight mono line inputs or 4 stereo line inputs
                           3. A dedicated mono differential input from external voice CODEC
                           These inputs may be mixed together or independently routed to different combinations of output
                           drivers. An internal record path is provided at the input mixers to allow DAC output to be mixed with
                           the input signal path (e.g. for voice call recording).
                           The WM8994 input signal paths and control registers are illustrated in Figure 12.

          MICROPHONE INPUTS
          Up to four microphones can be connected to the WM8994, either in single-ended or differential mode.
          A dedicated PGA is provided for each microphone input. Two low noise microphone bias circuits are
          provided, reducing the need for external components.
          For single-ended microphone inputs, the microphone signal is connected to the inverting input of the
          PGAs (IN1LN, IN2LN, IN1RN or IN2RN). The non-inverting inputs of the PGAs are internally
          connected to VMID in this configuration. The non-inverting input pins IN1LP, IN2LP, IN1RP and
          IN2RP are free to be used as line connections to the input or output mixers in this configuration.
          For differential microphone inputs, the non-inverted microphone signal is connected to the non-
          inverting input of the PGAs (IN1LP, IN2LP, IN1RP or IN2RP), whilst the inverted (or ‘noisy ground’)
          signal is connected to the inverting input pins (IN1LN, IN2LN, IN1RN and IN2RN).
          The gain of the input PGAs is controlled via register settings, as defined in Table 4. Note that the input
          impedance of both inverting and non-inverting inputs changes with the input PGA gain setting, as
          described under “Electrical Characteristics”. See also the “Applications Information” for details of input
          resistance at all PGA Gain settings.
          The microphone input configurations are illustrated in Figure 13 and Figure 14. Note that any PGA
          input pin that is used in either microphone configuration is not available for use as a line input path at
          the same time.

          MICROPHONE BIAS CONTROL
          There are two MICBIAS generators which provide low noise reference voltages suitable for powering
          silicon (MEMS) microphones or biasing electret condenser (ECM) type microphones via an external
          resistor.
          The MICBIAS voltages can be independently enabled using the MICB1_ENA and MICB2_ENA control
          bits; the voltage of each can be selected using the MICB1_LVL and MICB2_LVL register bits as
          detailed in Table 1.
          An external decoupling capacitor is required on each of the MICBIAS outputs, and must be connected
          whenever the associated MICBIAS output is enabled. Enabling either of the MICBIAS outputs with no
          external capacitor may result in degraded device performance and is not recommended. Refer to the
          “Applications Information” section for recommended external components.
          When a MICBIAS output is disabled, the output pin can be configured to be floating or to be actively
          discharged. This is selected using the MICB1_DISCH and MICB2_DISCH register btis.

   Table 1 Microphone Bias Control
   Note that the maximum source current capability for MICBIAS1 and MICBIAS2 is 2.4mA each. The
   external biasing resistance must be large enough to limit each MICBIAS current to 2.4mA across the
   full microphone impedance range.
   An external capacitor is required on MICBIAS1 and MICBIAS2 in order to ensure accuracy and
   stability of each regulator. The recommended capacitance is 4.7F in each case. See “Recommended
   External Components” for further details.
   Note that, if the MICBIAS1 or MICBIAS2 regulator is not enabled, then no external capacitor is
   required on the respective MICBIAS pin.
   MICROPHONE CURRENT DETECT
   A MICBIAS current detect function allows detection of accessories such as headset microphones.
   When the MICBIAS load current exceeds one of two programmable thresholds, (e.g. short circuit
   current or normal operating current), an interrupt or GPIO output can be generated. The current
   detection circuit is enabled by the MICD_ENA bit; the current thresholds are selected by the
   MICD_THR and MICD_SCTHR register fields as described in Table 83. See “General Purpose
   Input/Output” for a full description of these fields.

          LINE AND VOICE CODEC INPUTS
          All eight analogue input pins may be used as line inputs. Each line input has different signal path
          options, providing flexibility, high performance and low power consumption for many different usage
          modes.
          IN1LN and IN1RN can operate as single-ended line inputs to the input PGAs IN1L and IN1R
          respectively. These inputs provide a high gain path if required for low input signal levels.
          IN2LN and IN2RN can operate as single-ended line inputs to the input PGAs IN2L and IN2R
          respectively, providing further high gain signal paths. These pins can also be connected to either of
          the output mixers MIXOUTL and MIXOUTR.
          IN1LP and IN1RP can operate as single-ended line inputs to the input mixers MIXINL and MIXINR, or
          to the speaker mixers SPKMIXL and SPKMIXR. These signal paths enable power consumption to be
          reduced, by allowing the input PGAs and other circuits to be disabled if not required.
          IN2LP/VRXN and IN2RP/VRXP can operate in three different ways:
                       Mono differential ’RXVOICE’ input (e.g. from an external voice CODEC) to the input mixers
                        MIXINL and MIXINR.
                       Single-ended line inputs to either of the output mixers MIXOUTL and MIXOUTR.
                       Ultra-low power mono differential ‘Direct Voice’ input (e.g. from an external voice CODEC)
                        to the ear speaker driver on HPOUT2, or to either of the speaker drivers on SPKOUTL and
                        SPKOUTR.
          Signal path configuration to the input PGAs and input mixers is detailed later in this section. Signal
          path configuration to the output mixers and speaker mixers is described in “Analogue Output Signal
          Path”.
          The line input and voice CODEC input configurations are illustrated in Figure 15 through to Figure 18.

   Table 2 Input PGA Enable
   For normal operation of the input PGAs, the reference voltage VMID and the bias current must also be
   enabled. See “Reference Voltages and Master Bias” for details of the associated controls VMID_SEL
   and BIAS_ENA.
   INPUT PGA CONFIGURATION
   Each of the Input PGAs can operate in a single-ended or differential mode. In differential mode, both
   inputs to the PGA are connected to the input source. In single-ended mode, the non-inverting input to
   the PGA must be connected to VMID. Configuration of the PGA inputs to the WM8994 input pins is
   controlled using the register bits shown in Table 3.
   Single-ended microphone operation is configured by connecting the input source to the inverting input
   of the applicable PGA. The non-inverting input of the PGA must be connected to the buffered VMID
   reference. Note that the buffered VMID reference must be enabled, using the VMID_BUF_ENA
   register, as described in “Reference Voltages and Master Bias”.
   Differential microphone operation is configured by connecting the input source to both inputs of the
   applicable PGA.
   Line inputs to the input pins IN1LN, IN2LN, IN1RN and IN2RN must be connected to the applicable
   PGA. The non-inverting input of the PGA must be connected to VMID.
   Line inputs to the input pins IN1LP, IN2LP, IN1RP or IN2RP do not connect to the input PGAs. The
   non-inverting inputs of the associated PGAs must be connected to VMID. The inverting inputs of the
   associated PGAs may be used as separate mic/line inputs if required.
   The maximum available attenuation on any of these input paths is achieved by using register bits
   shown in Table 3 to disconnect the input pins from the applicable PGA.

   INPUT PGA VOLUME CONTROL
   Each of the four Input PGAs has an independently controlled gain range of -16.5dB to +30dB in 1.5dB
   steps. The gains on the inverting and non-inverting inputs to the PGAs are always equal. Each Input
   PGA can be independently muted using the PGA mute bits as described in Table 4, with maximum
   mute attenuation achieved by simultaneously disconnecting the corresponding inputs described in
   Table 3.
   Note that, under default conditions (following power-up or software reset), the PGA mute register bits
   are set to ‘1’, but the mute functions will only become effective after the respective bit has been
   toggled to ‘0’ and then back to ‘1’. The Input PGAs will be un-muted (Mute disabled) after power-up or
   software reset, regardless of the readback value of the respective PGA mute bits.
   To prevent "zipper noise", a zero-cross function is provided on the input PGAs. When this feature is
   enabled, volume updates will not take place until a zero-crossing is detected. In the case of a long
   period without zero-crossings, a timeout function is provided. When the zero-cross function is
   enabled, the volume will update after the timeout period if no earlier zero-cross has occurred. The
   timeout clock is enabled using TOCLK_ENA, the timeout period is set by TOCLK_DIV. See “Clocking
   and Sample Rates” for more information on these fields.
   The IN1_VU and IN2_VU bits control the loading of the input PGA volume data. When IN1_VU and
   IN2_VU are set to 0, the PGA volume data will be loaded into the respective control register, but will
   not actually change the gain setting. The IN1L and IN1R volume settings are both updated when a 1
   is written to IN1_VU; the IN2L and IN2R volume settings are both updated when a 1 is written to
   IN2_VU. This makes it possible to update the gain of the left and right signal paths simultaneously.
   The Input PGA Volume Control register fields are described in Table 4 and Table 5.

        The input mixers MIXINL and MIXINR are enabled by the MIXINL_ENA and MIXINR_ENA register
        bits, as described in Table 6. These control bits also enable the RXVOICE input path, described in the
        following section.
        For normal operation of the input mixers, the reference voltage VMID and the bias current must also
        be enabled. See “Reference Voltages and Master Bias” for details of the associated controls
        VMID_SEL and BIAS_ENA.

        INPUT MIXER CONFIGURATION AND VOLUME CONTROL
        The left and right channel input mixers MIXINL and MIXINR can be configured to take input from up to
        five sources:
        1.     IN1L or IN1R Input PGA
        2.     IN2L or IN2R Input PGA
        3.     IN1LP or IN1RP pin (PGA bypass)
        4.     RXVOICE mono differential input from IN2LP/VRXN and IN2RP/VRXP
        5.     MIXOUTL or MIXOUTR Output Mixer (Record path)
        The Input Mixer configuration and volume controls are described in Table 7 for the Left input mixer
        (MIXINL) and Table 8 for the Right input mixer (MIXINR). The signal levels from the Input PGAs may
        be set to Mute, 0dB or 30dB boost. Gain controls for the PGA bypass, RXVOICE and Record paths
        provide adjustment from -12dB to +6dB in 3dB steps.
        When using the IN1LP or IN1RP signal paths direct to the input mixers (PGA bypass paths), a signal
        gain of +15dB can be selected using the IN1RP_MIXINR_BOOST or IN1LP_MIXINL_BOOST register
        bits. See Table 7 and Table 8 for further details.
        When using the IN1LP or IN1RP signal paths direct to the input mixers (PGA bypass paths), the
        buffered VMID reference must be enabled, using the VMID_BUF_ENA register, as described in
        “Reference Voltages and Master Bias”.
        To prevent pop noise, it is recommended that gain and mute controls for the input mixers are not
        modified while the signal paths are active. If volume control is required on these signal paths, it is
        recommended that this is implemented using the input PGA volume controls or the ADC volume
        controls. The ADC volume controls are described in the “Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC)”
        section.

 DIGITAL MICROPHONE INTERFACE
                 The WM8994 supports a four-channel digital microphone interface. Two channels of audio data are
                 multiplexed on the DMICDAT1 pin and a further two channels are multiplexed on the DMICDAT2 pin.
                 All four channels are clocked using the DMICCLK output pin.
                 The DMICDAT1 function is shared with the IN2LN pin; the analogue signal paths from IN2LN cannot
                 be used when this pin is used for DMICDAT1 digital microphone input.
                 The DMICDAT2 function is shared with the IN2RN pin; the analogue signal paths from IN2RN cannot
                 be used when this pin is used for DMICDAT2 digital microphone input.
                 The digital microphone interface is referenced to the MICBIAS1 voltage domain; the MICBIAS1 output
                 must be enabled (MICB1_ENA = 1) when using the digital microphone interface.
                 The MICBIAS1 generator is suitable for use as a low noise supply for the digital microphones. (See
                 “Analogue Input Signal Path” for details of the MICBIAS1 generator.)
                 When digital microphone input is enabled, the WM8994 outputs a clock signal on the DMICCLK pin.
                 The DMICCLK frequency for all supported digital microphone clocking modes is described later in this
                 section.
                 A pair of digital microphones is connected as illustrated in Figure 19. The microphones must be
                 configured to ensure that the Left mic transmits a data bit when DMICCLK is high, and the Right mic
                 transmits a data bit when DMICCLK is low. The WM8994 samples the digital microphone data at the
                 end of each DMICCLK phase. Each microphone must tri-state its data output when the other
                 microphone is transmitting.
                                                                                  MICBIAS1

                 The DMICDAT1 digital microphone channels are enabled using DMIC1L_ENA and DMIC1R_ENA.
                 When these signal paths are enabled, the respective ADC path is disconnected and the digital
                 microphone data is routed to the digital mixing input bus, as illustrated in “Digital Mixing”.
                 The DMICDAT2 digital microphone channels are enabled using DMIC2L_ENA and DMIC2R_ENA.
                 When these signal paths are enabled, the digital microphone data is routed to the digital mixing input
                 bus, as illustrated in “Digital Mixing”.
                 Two microphone channels are interleaved on DMICDAT1; another two channels are interleaved on
                 DMICDAT2. The timing is illustrated in Figure 20. Each microphone must tri-state its data output when
                 the other microphone is transmitting.

   The four digital microphone channels can be routed to one of the four timeslots on AIF1. The
   DMICDAT1 microphones, when enabled, are routed to the Left/Right channels of AIF1 Timeslot 0.
   The DMICDAT2 microphones, when enabled, are routed to the Left/Right channels of AIF1 Timeslot
   1.
   Digital volume control of the digital microphone channels in the AIF1 signal paths is provided using
   the registers described in the “Digital Volume and Filter Control” section.
   The digital microphone channels can be routed, in a limited number of configurations, to the digital
   mixing output bus, via the digital sidetone signal paths. See “Digital Mixing” for further details.
   Digital volume control of the digital microphone channels in the digital sidetone signal paths is
   provided using the registers described in the “Digital Mixing” section.
   The digital microphone interface control fields are described in Table 9.

        Clocking for the Digital Microphone interface is derived from SYSCLK. The DMICCLK frequency is
        configured automatically, according to the AIFn_SR, AIFnCLK_RATE and ADC_OSR128 registers.
        (See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for further details of the system clocks and control registers.)
        The DMICCLK is enabled whenever a digital microphone input path is enabled on the DMICDAT1 or
        DMICDAT2 pin(s). Note that the SYSDSPCLK_ENA register must also be set.
        When AIF1CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 0), then the DMICCLK
        frequency is controlled by the AIF1_SR and AIF1CLK_RATE registers.
        When AIF2CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 1), then the DMICCLK
        frequency is controlled by the AIF2_SR and AIF2CLK_RATE registers.
        The DMICCLK frequency is as described in Table 10 (for ADC_OSR128=1) and Table 11 (for
        ADC_OSR128=0). The ADC_OSR128 bit is set by default, giving best audio performance. Note that
        the only valid DMICCLK configurations are the ones listed in Table 10 and Table 11.
        The applicable clocks (SYSCLK, and AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK) must be present and enabled when using
        the digital microphone interface.

                 DIGITAL PULL-UP AND PULL-DOWN
                 The WM8994 provides integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors on the DMICDAT1 and DMICDAT2
                 pins. This provides a flexible capability for interfacing with other devices. Each of the pull-up and pull-
                 down resistors can be configured independently using the register bits described in Table 12.
                 Note that, if the DMICDAT1 or DMICDAT2 digital microphone channels are disabled, or if
                 DMICDATn_PU and DMICDATn_PD are both set, then the pull-up and pull-down will be disabled on
                 the respective pin.

 ANALOGUE TO DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC)
                 The WM8994 uses stereo 24-bit sigma-delta ADCs. The use of multi-bit feedback and high
                 oversampling rates reduces the effects of jitter and high frequency noise. The oversample rate can be
                 adjusted, if required, to reduce power consumption - see “Clocking and Sample Rates” for details. The
                 ADC full scale input level is proportional to AVDD1 - see “Electrical Characteristics”. Any input signal
                 greater than full scale may overload the ADC and cause distortion.
                 The ADCs are enabled by the ADCL_ENA and ADCR_ENA register bits.

        ADC CLOCKING CONTROL
        Clocking for the ADCs is derived from SYSCLK. The required clock is enabled when the
        SYSDSPCLK_ENA register is set.
        The ADC clock rate is configured automatically, according to the AIFn_SR, AIFnCLK_RATE and
        ADC_OSR128 registers. (See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for further details of the system clocks
        and control registers.)
        When AIF1CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 0), then the ADC clocking is
        controlled by the AIF1_SR and AIF1CLK_RATE registers.
        When AIF2CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 1), then the ADC clocking is
        controlled by the AIF2_SR and AIF2CLK_RATE registers.
        The supported ADC clocking configurations are described in Table 14 (for ADC_OSR128=1) and
        Table 15 (for ADC_OSR128=0). The ADC_OSR128 bit is set by default, giving best audio
        performance.

 DIGITAL CORE ARCHITECTURE
                 The WM8994 Digital Core provides an extensive set of mixing and signal processing features. The
                 Digital Core Architecture is illustrated in Figure 21, which also identifies the datasheet sections
                 applicable to each portion of the Digital Core.
                 Audio Interface 1 (AIF1) supports audio input and output on two stereo timeslots simultaneously,
                 making a total of four inputs and four outputs. The mixing of the four AIF1 output paths is described in
                 “Audio Interface 1 (AIF1) Output Mixing”.
                 A digital mixing path from the ADCs or Digital Microphones to the DAC output paths provides a high
                 quality sidetone for voice calls or other applications. The sidetone configuration is described in “Digital
                 Sidetone Mixing”; the associated filter and volume control is described in “Digital Sidetone Volume
                 and Filter Control”.
                 Each of the four hi-fi DACs has a dedicated mixer for controlling the signal paths to that DAC. The
                 configuration of these signal paths is described in “DAC Output Digital Mixing”.
                 Each DAC is provided with digital volume control, soft mute / un-mute and a low pass filter. The
                 associated controls are defined in the “Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)” section.
                 Digital processing can be applied to the four input channels of AIF1 and the two input channels of
                 AIF2. The available features include 5-band equalization (EQ), 3D stereo expansion and dynamic
                 range control (DRC).
                 The EQ provides the capability to tailor the audio path according to the frequency characteristics of an
                 earpiece or loudspeaker, and/or according to user preferences. The EQ controls are described in
                 “ReTune Mobile Parametric Equalizer (EQ)”. The DRC provides adaptive signal level control to
                 improve the handling of unpredictable signal levels and to improve intelligibility in the presence of
                 transients and impulsive noises. The DRC controls are described in “Dynamic Range Control (DRC)”.
                 3D stereo expansion provides a stereo enhancement effect; the depth of the effect is programmable,
                 as described in “3D Stereo Expansion”.
                 The input channels of AIF1 and AIF2 are also equipped with digital volume control, soft mute / un-
                 mute and de-emphasis filter control; see “Digital Volume and Filter Control” for details of these
                 features.
                 The output channels of AIF1 and AIF2 can be configured using the digital volume control and a
                 programmable high-pass filter (HPF). The Dynamic Range Control (DRC) circuit can also be applied
                 here, with the restriction that a DRC cannot be enabled in the input and output path of one AIF
                 channel at the same time. The AIF output volume and filter controls are described in “Digital Volume
                 and Filter Control”.
                 The WM8994 provides an ultrasonic mode on the output paths of AIF1, allowing high frequency
                 signals (such as ultrasonic microphone signals) to be output. See “Ultrasonic (4FS) AIF Output Mode”
                 for further details.
                 The WM8994 provides two full audio interfaces, AIF1 and AIF2. Each interface supports a number of
                 protocols, including I2S, DSP, MSB-first left/right justified, and can operate in master or slave modes.
                 PCM operation is supported in the DSP mode. A-law and -law companding are also supported. Time
                 division multiplexing (TDM) is available to allow multiple devices to stream data simultaneously on the
                 same bus, saving space and power.
                 Four-channel input and output is supported using TDM on AIF1. Two-channel input and output is
                 supported on AIF2. A third interface, AIF3, is partially supported, using multiplexers to re-configure
                 alternate connections to AIF1 or AIF2.
                 Signal mixing between audio interfaces is possible. The WM8994 performs stereo full-duplex sample
                 rate conversion between the audio interfaces as required. (Note that sample rate conversion is not
                 supported on some signal paths, as noted in Figure 21).

        AUDIO INTERFACE 1 (AIF1) OUTPUT MIXING
        There are four AIF1 digital mixers, one for each AIF1 audio channel (ie. Left/Right channels on
        Timeslots 0/1). The inputs to each AIF1 mixer comprise signals from the ADC / Digital Microphone
        inputs and from AIF2.
        Note that the Left/Right channels of AIF1 can be inverted or interchanged if required; see “Digital
        Audio Interface Control”.
        The AIF1 Left Timeslot 0 output channel is derived from the ADCL / DMIC1 (Left) and AIF2 (Left)
        inputs. The ADCL / DMIC1 (Left) path is enabled by ADC1L_TO_AIF1ADC1L, whilst the AIF2 (Left)
        path is enabled by AIF2DACL_TO_AIF1ADC1L.
        The AIF1 Right Timeslot 0 output channel is derived from the ADCR / DMIC1 (Right) and AIF2 (Right)
        inputs. The ADCR / DMIC1 (Right) path is enabled by ADC1R_TO_AIF1ADC1R, whilst the AIF2
        (Right) path is enabled by AIF2DACR_TO_AIF1ADC1R.
        The AIF1 Left Timeslot 1 output channel is derived from the DMIC2 (Left) and AIF2 (Left) inputs. The
        DMIC2 (Left) path is enabled by ADC2L_TO_AIF1ADC2L, whilst the AIF2 (Left) path is enabled by
        AIF2DACL_TO_AIF1ADC2L.
        The AIF1 Right Timeslot 1 output channel is derived from the DMIC2 (Right) and AIF2 (Right) inputs.
        The DMIC2 (Right) path is enabled by ADC2R_TO_AIF1ADC2R, whilst the AIF2 (Right) path is
        enabled by AIF2DACR_TO_AIF1ADC2R.
        The AIF1 output mixer controls are defined in Table 16.

   DIGITAL SIDETONE MIXING
   There are two digital sidetone signal paths, STL and STR. The sidetone sources are selectable for
   each path. The sidetone mixer outputs are inputs to the DAC signal mixers.
   The following sources can be selected for sidetone path STL.
         ADCL or DMICDAT1 (Left) channel
         DMICDAT2 (Left) channel
   The following sources can be selected for sidetone path STR.
         ADCR or DMICDAT1 (Right) channel
         DMICDAT2 (Right) channel
   The sidetone signal sources are selected using STR_SEL and STL_SEL as described in Table 17.
   Note that, when STR_SEL = 0 or STL_SEL = 0, and the respective ADC is enabled (for analogue
   inputs), then the ADC data will be selected for applicable sidetone path.

   DIGITAL SIDETONE VOLUME AND FILTER CONTROL
   A digital volume control is provided for the digital sidetone paths. The associated register controls are
   described in Table 18.
   A digital high-pass filter can be enabled in the sidetone paths to remove DC offsets. This filter is
   enabled using the ST_HPF register bit; the cut-off frequency is configured using ST_HPF_CUT. When
   the filter is enabled, it is enabled in both digital sidetone paths.
   Note that the sidetone filter cut-off frequency scales according to the sample rate of AIF1 or AIF2.
   When AIF1CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 0), then the ST_HPF cut-off
   frequency is scaled according to the AIF1_SR register. When AIF2CLK is selected as the SYSCLK
   source (SYSCLK_SRC = 1), then the ST_HPF cut-off frequency is scaled according to the AIF2_SR
   register. See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for further details of the system clocks and control
   registers.

        DAC OUTPUT DIGITAL MIXING
        There are four DAC digital mixers, one for each DAC. The inputs to each DAC mixer comprise signals
        from AIF1, AIF2 and the digital sidetone signals.
        Note that the Left/Right channels of the AIF1 and AIF2 inputs can be inverted or interchanged if
        required; see “Digital Audio Interface Control”.

   Table 20 DAC Output Digital Mixing
   AUDIO INTERFACE 2 (AIF2) DIGITAL MIXING
   There are two output channels on AIF2. The audio source for these two channels is the same as the
   selected source for DAC2L and DAC2R, as described in “DAC Output Digital Mixing”.
   Note that the Left/Right channels of AIF2 can be inverted or interchanged if required; see “Digital
   Audio Interface Control”.
   ULTRASONIC (4FS) AIF OUTPUT MODE
   The WM8994 provides an ultrasonic mode on the output paths of the AIF1 audio interface. The
   ultrasonic mode enables high frequency signals (such as ultrasonic microphone signals) to be output.
   Ultrasonic mode is enabled on AIF1 using the AIF1ADC_4FS register bit. When the ultrasonic mode is
   selected, the AIF1 output sample rate is increased by a factor of 4. For example, a 48kHz sample rate
   will be output at 192kHz in ultrasonic mode.
   Ultrasonic mode is only supported in AIF Master mode and uses the ADCLRCLK output (not the
   LRCLK). When ultrasonic mode is enabled, AIF1 must be configured in Master mode, as described in
70                                                                                             Rev 4.5

          “Digital Audio Interface Control”. See “General Purpose Input/Output” to configure the GPIO1 pin as
          ADCLRCLK1. The ADCLRCLK1 rate is controlled as described in “Digital Audio Interface Control”.
          When ultrasonic mode is enabled, the audio band filtering and digital volume controls (see “Digital
          Volume and Filter Control”) are bypassed on the affected output paths.
          The Dynamic Range Control (DRC) function is not available on the AIF1 output signal paths in
          ultrasonic mode. Note, however, that the DRC is still available on the AIF input paths in this case.
          The ultrasonic (4FS) signal paths are illustrated in Figure 23. The AIF1ADC_4FS register bit is defined
          in Table 21.

 DYNAMIC RANGE CONTROL (DRC)
                The Dynamic Range Control (DRC) is a circuit which can be enabled in the digital playback or digital
                record paths of the WM8994 audio interfaces. The function of the DRC is to adjust the signal gain in
                conditions where the input amplitude is unknown or varies over a wide range, e.g. when recording
                from microphones built into a handheld system.
                The DRC can apply Compression and Automatic Level Control to the signal path. It incorporates ‘anti-
                clip’ and ‘quick release’ features for handling transients in order to improve intelligibility in the
                presence of loud impulsive noises.
                The DRC also incorporates a Noise Gate function, which provides additional attenuation of very low-
                level input signals. This means that the signal path is quiet when no signal is present, giving an
                improvement in background noise level under these conditions.
                The WM8994 provides three stereo Dynamic Range Controllers (DRCs); these are associated with
                AIF1 timeslot 0, AIF1 timeslot 1 and AIF2 respectively. Each DRC can be enabled either in the DAC
                playback (AIF input) path or in the ADC record (AIF output) path, as described in the “Digital Core
                Architecture” section.
                The DRCs are enabled in the DAC or ADCs audio signal paths using the register bits described in
                Table 22. Note that enabling any DRC in the DAC and ADC paths simultaneously is an invalid
                selection.
                When the DRC is enabled in any of the ADC (digital record) paths, the associated High Pass Filter
                (HPF) must be enabled also; this ensures that DC offsets are removed prior to the DRC processing.
                The output path HPF control registers are described in Table 36 (for AIF1 output paths) and Table 43
                (for AIF2 output paths). These are described in the “Digital Volume and Filter Control” section.
                Note that, when ultrasonic (4FS) mode is selected on AIF1, then the DRC function is bypassed on the
                respective ADC (output) signal paths. The DRC may still be selected on the AIF1 DAC (input) signal
                paths.

        Table 22 DRC Enable
        The following description of the DRC is applicable to all three DRCs. The associated register control
        fields are described in Table 24, Table 25 and Table 26 for the respective DRCs.
        Note that, where the following description refers to register names, the generic prefix [DRC] is quoted:
                        For the DRC associated with AIF1 timeslot 0, [DRC] = AIF1DRC1.
                        For the DRC associated with AIF1 timeslot 1, [DRC] = AIF1DRC2.
                        For the DRC associated with AIF2, [DRC] = AIF2DRC.
        DRC COMPRESSION / EXPANSION / LIMITING
        The DRC supports two different compression regions, separated by a “Knee” at a specific input
        amplitude. In the region above the knee, the compression slope [DRC]_HI_COMP applies; in the
        region below the knee, the compression slope [DRC]_LO_COMP applies.
        The DRC also supports a noise gate region, where low-level input signals are heavily attenuated. This
        function can be enabled or disabled according to the application requirements. The DRC response in
        this region is defined by the expansion slope [DRC]_NG_EXP.
        For additional attenuation of signals in the noise gate region, an additional “knee” can be defined
        (shown as “Knee2” in Figure 24). When this knee is enabled, this introduces an infinitely steep drop-
        off in the DRC response pattern between the [DRC]_LO_COMP and [DRC]_NG_EXP regions.
        The overall DRC compression characteristic in “steady state” (i.e. where the input amplitude is near-
        constant) is illustrated in Figure 24.

     Figure 24 DRC Response Characteristic
     The slope of the DRC response is determined by register fields [DRC]_HI_COMP and
     [DRC]_LO_COMP. A slope of 1 indicates constant gain in this region. A slope less than 1 represents
     compression (i.e. a change in input amplitude produces only a smaller change in output amplitude). A
     slope of 0 indicates that the target output amplitude is the same across a range of input amplitudes;
     this is infinite compression.
     When the noise gate is enabled, the DRC response in this region is determined by the
     [DRC]_NG_EXP register. A slope of 1 indicates constant gain in this region. A slope greater than 1
     represents expansion (ie. a change in input amplitude produces a larger change in output amplitude).
     When the DRC_KNEE2_OP knee is enabled (“Knee2” in Figure 24), this introduces the vertical line in
     the response pattern illustrated, resulting in infinitely steep attenuation at this point in the response.
     The DRC parameters are listed in Table 23.

     The noise gate is enabled when the [DRC]_NG_ENA register is set. When the noise gate is not
     enabled, parameters 5, 6, 7 above are ignored, and the [DRC]_LO_COMP slope applies to all input
     signal levels below Knee1.
     The DRC_KNEE2_OP knee is enabled when the [DRC]_KNEE2_OP_ENA register is set. When this
     bit is not set, then parameter 7 above is ignored, and the Knee2 position always coincides with the low
     end of the [DRC]_LO_COMP region.

        The “Knee1” point in Figure 24 is determined by register fields [DRC]_KNEE_IP and
        [DRC]_KNEE_OP.
        Parameter Y0, the output level for a 0dB input, is not specified directly, but can be calculated from the
        other parameters, using the equation:
           Y0 = [DRC]_KNEE_OP – ([DRC]_KNEE_IP * [DRC]_HI_COMP)
        GAIN LIMITS
        The minimum and maximum gain applied by the DRC is set by register fields [DRC]_MINGAIN,
        [DRC]_MAXGAIN and [DRC]_NG_MINGAIN. These limits can be used to alter the DRC response
        from that illustrated in Figure 24. If the range between maximum and minimum gain is reduced, then
        the extent of the dynamic range control is reduced.
        The minimum gain in the Compression regions of the DRC response is set by [DRC]_MINGAIN. The
        mimimum gain in the Noise Gate region is set by [DRC]_NG_MINGAIN. The minimum gain limit
        prevents excessive attenuation of the signal path.
        The maximum gain limit set by [DRC]_MAXGAIN prevents quiet signals (or silence) from being
        excessively amplified.
        DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS
        The dynamic behaviour determines how quickly the DRC responds to changing signal levels. Note
        that the DRC responds to the average (RMS) signal amplitude over a period of time.
        The [DRC]_ATK determines how quickly the DRC gain decreases when the signal amplitude is high.
        The [DRC]_DCY determines how quickly the DRC gain increases when the signal amplitude is low.
        These register fields are described in Table 24, Table 25 and Table 26. Note that the register defaults
        are suitable for general purpose microphone use.
        ANTI-CLIP CONTROL
        The DRC includes an Anti-Clip feature to avoid signal clipping when the input amplitude rises very
        quickly. This feature uses a feed-forward technique for early detection of a rising signal level. Signal
        clipping is avoided by dynamically increasing the gain attack rate when required. The Anti-Clip feature
        is enabled using the [DRC]_ANTICLIP bit.
        Note that the feed-forward processing increases the latency in the input signal path.
        Note that the Anti-Clip feature operates entirely in the digital domain. It cannot be used to prevent
        signal clipping in the analogue domain nor in the source signal. Analogue clipping can only be
        prevented by reducing the analogue signal gain or by adjusting the source signal.
        Note that the Anti-Clip feature should not be enabled at the same time as the Quick Release feature
        (described below) on the same DRC.
Rev 4.5                                                                                                       75


                                                                                    WM8994
   QUICK RELEASE CONTROL
   The DRC includes a Quick-Release feature to handle short transient peaks that are not related to the
   intended source signal. For example, in handheld microphone recording, transient signal peaks
   sometimes occur due to user handling, key presses or accidental tapping against the microphone.
   The Quick Release feature ensures that these transients do not cause the intended signal to be
   masked by the longer time constants of [DRC]_DCY.
   The Quick-Release feature is enabled by setting the [DRC]_QR bit. When this bit is enabled, the DRC
   measures the crest factor (peak to RMS ratio) of the input signal. A high crest factor is indicative of a
   transient peak that may not be related to the intended source signal. If the crest factor exceeds the
   level set by [DRC]_QR_THR, then the normal decay rate ([DRC]_DCY) is ignored and a faster decay
   rate ([DRC]_QR_DCY) is used instead.
   Note that the Quick Release feature should not be enabled at the same time as the Anti-Clip feature
   (described above) on the same DRC.
   SIGNAL ACTIVITY DETECT
   The DRC incorporates a configurable signal detect function, allowing the signal level at the DRC input
   to be monitored and to be used to trigger other events. This can be used to detect the presence of a
   microphone signal on an ADC or digital mic channel, or can be used to detect an audio signal
   received over the digital audio interface.
   The Peak signal level or the RMS signal level of the DRC input can be selected as the detection
   threshold. When the threshold condition is exceeded, an interrupt or GPIO output can be generated.
   See “General Purpose Input/Output” for a full description of the applicable control fields.

 RETUNE MOBILE PARAMETRIC EQUALIZER (EQ)
                 The ReTune Mobile Parametric EQ is a circuit which can be enabled in the digital playback path of the
                 WM8994 audio interfaces. The function of the EQ is to adjust the frequency characteristic of the
                 output in order to compensate for unwanted frequency characteristics in the loudspeaker (or other
                 output transducer). It can also be used to tailor the response according to user preferences, for
                 example to accentuate or attenuate specific frequency bands to emulate different sound profiles or
                 environments e.g. concert hall, rock etc.
                 The WM8994 provides three stereo EQ circuits; these are associated with AIF1 timeslot 0, AIF1
                 timeslot 1 and AIF2 respectively. The EQ is enabled in these three signal paths using the register bits
                 described in Table 27.

                 Table 27 ReTune Mobile Parametric EQ Enable
                 The following description of the EQ is applicable to all three EQ circuits. The associated register
                 control fields are described in Table 29, Table 30 and Table 31 for the respective EQs.
                 The EQ can be configured to operate in two modes - “Default” mode or “ReTune Mobile” mode.
                 DEFAULT MODE (5-BAND PARAMETRIC EQ)
                 In default mode, the cut-off / centre frequencies are fixed as per Table 28. The filter bandwidths are
                 also fixed in default mode. The gain of the individual bands (-12dB to +12dB) can be controlled as
                 described in Table 29.
                 The cut-off / centre frequencies noted in Table 28 are applicable to a sample rate of 48kHz. When
                 using other sample rates, these frequencies will be scaled in proportion to the selected sample rate for
                 the associated Audio Interface (AIF1 or AIF2).
                 If AIF1 and AIF2 are operating at different sample rates, then the cut-off / centre frequencies will be
                 different for the two interfaces. Note that the frequencies can be set to other values by using the
                 features described in “ReTune Mobile Mode”.

        RETUNE MOBILE MODE
        ReTune Mobile mode provides a comprehensive facility for the user to define the cut-off/centre
        frequencies and filter bandwidth for each EQ band, in addition to the gain controls already described.
        This enables the EQ to be accurately customised for a specific transducer characteristic or desired
        sound profile.
        The EQ enable and EQ gain controls are the same as defined for the default mode. The additional
        coefficients used in ReTune Mobile mode are held in registers R1154 to R1171 for AIF1DAC1,
        registers R1186 to R1203 for AIF1DAC2 and registers R1410 to R1427 for AIF2. These coefficients
        are derived using tools provided in WISCE™ evaluation board control software.
        Please contact your local Cirrus Logic representative for more details.
        Note that the WM8994 audio interfaces may operate at different sample rates concurrently. The EQ
        settings for each interface must be programmed relative to the applicable sample rate of the
        corresponding audio interface. If the audio interface sample rate is changed, then different EQ register
        settings will be required to achieve a given EQ response.

 3D STEREO EXPANSION
                The 3D Stereo Expansion is an audio enhancement feature which can be enabled in the digital
                playback path of the WM8994 audio interfaces. This feature uses configurable cross-talk mechanisms
                to adjust the depth or width of the stereo audio.
                The WM8994 provides three 3D Stereo Expansion circuits; these are associated with AIF1 timeslot 0,
                AIF1 timeslot 1 and AIF2 respectively. The 3D Stereo Expansion is enabled and controlled in these
                signal paths using the register bits described in Table 33.

 DIGITAL VOLUME AND FILTER CONTROL
                 This section describes the digital volume and filter controls of the WM8994 AIF paths.
                 Digital volume control and High Pass Filter (HPF) control is provided on four AIF1 output (digital
                 record) paths and two AIF2 output (digital record) paths.
                 Note that, when ultrasonic (4FS) mode is selected on AIF1, then the digital volume control and high
                 pass filter (HPF) control are bypassed on the respective ADC (output) signal paths.
                 Digital volume control, soft-mute control, mono mix and de-emphasis filter control is provided on four
                 AIF1 input (digital playback) paths and two AIF2 input (digital playback) paths.
                 AIF1 - OUTPUT PATH VOLUME CONTROL
                 The AIF1 interface supports up to four output channels. A digital volume control is provided on each of
                 these output signal paths, allowing attenuation in the range -71.625dB to +17.625dB in 0.375dB steps.
                 The level of attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
                 0.375  (X-192) dB for 1  X  239;         MUTE for X = 0        +17.625dB for 239  X  255
                 The AIF1ADC1_VU and AIF1ADC2_VU bits control the loading of digital volume control data. When
                 the volume update bit is set to 0, the associated volume control data will be loaded into the respective
                 control register, but will not actually change the digital gain setting.
                 The AIF1ADC1L and AIF1ADC1R gain settings are updated when a 1 is written to AIF1ADC1_VU.
                 The AIF1ADC2L and AIF1ADC2R gain settings are updated when a 1 is written to AIF1ADC2_VU.
                 This makes it possible to update the gain of left and right channels simultaneously.

        AIF1 - OUTPUT PATH HIGH PASS FILTER
        A digital high-pass filter can be enabled in the AIF1 output paths to remove DC offsets. This filter is
        enabled independently in the four AIF1 output channels using the register bits described in Table 36.
        The HPF cut-off frequency for the AIF1 Timeslot 0 channels is set using AIF1ADC1_HPF_CUT. The
        HPF cut-off frequency for the AIF1 Timeslot 1 channels is set using AIF1ADC2_HPF_CUT.
        In hi-fi mode, the high pass filter is optimised for removing DC offsets without degrading the bass
        response and has a cut-off frequency of 3.7Hz when the sample rate (fs) = 44.1kHz.
        In voice modes, the high pass filter is optimised for voice communication; it is recommended to set the
        cut-off frequency below 300Hz.
        Note that the cut-off frequencies scale with the AIF1 sample rate. (The AIF1 sample rate is set using
        the AIF1_SR register, as described in the “Clocking and Sample Rates” section.) See Table 37 for the
        HPF cut-off frequencies at all supported sample rates.

   AIF1 - INPUT PATH VOLUME CONTROL
   The AIF1 interface supports up to four input channels. A digital volume control is provided on each of
   these input signal paths, allowing attenuation in the range -71.625dB to 0dB in 0.375dB steps. The
   level of attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
   0.375  (X-192) dB for 1  X  192;         MUTE for X = 0        0dB for 192  X  255
   The AIF1DAC1_VU and AIF1DAC2_VU bits control the loading of digital volume control data. When
   the volume update bit is set to 0, the associated volume control data will be loaded into the respective
   control register, but will not actually change the digital gain setting.
   The AIF1DAC1L and AIF1DAC1R gain settings are updated when a 1 is written to AIF1DAC1_VU.
   The AIF1DAC2L and AIF1DAC2R gain settings are updated when a 1 is written to AIF1DAC2_VU.
   This makes it possible to update the gain of left and right channels simultaneously.
   Note that a digital gain function is also available at the audio interface input, to boost the DAC volume
   when a small signal is received on DACDAT1. See “Digital Audio Interface Control” for further details.
   Digital volume control is also possible at the DAC stage of the signal path, after the audio signal has
   passed through the DAC digital mixers. See “Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)” for further details.

        AIF1 - INPUT PATH SOFT MUTE CONTROL
        The WM8994 provides a soft mute function for each of the AIF1 interface input paths. When the soft-
        mute function is selected, the WM8994 gradually attenuates the associated signal paths until the path
        is entirely muted.
        When the soft-mute function is de-selected, the gain will either return instantly to the digital gain
        setting, or will gradually ramp back to the digital gain setting, depending on the applicable
        _UNMUTE_RAMP register field.
        The mute and un-mute ramp rate is selectable between two different rates.
        The AIF1 input paths are soft-muted by default. To play back an audio signal, the soft-mute must first
        be de-selected by setting the applicable Mute bit to 0.
        The soft un-mute would typically be used during playback of audio data so that when the Mute is
        subsequently disabled, a smooth transition is scheduled to the previous volume level and pop noise is
        avoided. This is desirable when resuming playback after pausing during a track.
        The soft un-mute would typically not be required when un-muting at the start of a music file, in order
        that the first part of the music track is not attenuated. The instant un-mute behaviour is desirable in
        this case, when starting playback of a new track. See “DAC Soft Mute and Soft Un-Mute” (Figure 30)
        for an illustration of the soft mute function.

    AIF1 - INPUT PATH MONO MIX AND DE-EMPHASIS FILTER
    A digital mono mix can be selected on one or both pairs of AIF1 input channels. The mono mix is
    generated as the sum of the Left and Right AIF channel data. When the mono mix function is enabled,
    the combined mono signal is applied to the Left channel and the Right channel of the respective AIF1
    signal processing and digital mixing paths. To prevent clipping, 6dB attenuation is applied to the mono
    mix.
    Digital de-emphasis can be applied to the AIF1 input (playback) paths; this is appropriate when the
    data source is a CD where pre-emphasis is used in the recording. De-emphasis filtering is available
    for sample rates of 48kHz, 44.1kHz and 32kHz. See “Digital Filter Characteristics “section for details
    of de-emphasis filter characteristics.

        AIF2 - OUTPUT PATH VOLUME CONTROL
        The AIF2 interface supports two output channels. A digital volume control is provided on each output
        signal path, allowing attenuation in the range -71.625dB to +17.625dB in 0.375dB steps. The level of
        attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
        0.375  (X-192) dB for 1  X  239;        MUTE for X = 0     +17.625dB for 239  X  255
        The AIF2ADC_VU bit controls the loading of digital volume control data. When AIF2ADC_VU bit is set
        to 0, the AIF2ADCL_VOL and AIF2ADCR_VOL control data will be loaded into the respective control
        register, but will not actually change the digital gain setting. Both left and right gain settings are
        updated when a 1 is written to AIF2ADC_VU. This makes it possible to update the gain of left and
        right channels simultaneously.

    AIF2 - OUTPUT PATH HIGH PASS FILTER
    A digital high-pass filter can be enabled in the AIF2 output paths to remove DC offsets. This filter is
    enabled independently in the two AIF2 output channels using the register bits described in Table 43.
    The HPF cut-off frequency for the AIF2 channels is set using AIF2ADC_HPF_CUT.
    In hi-fi mode, the high pass filter is optimised for removing DC offsets without degrading the bass
    response and has a cut-off frequency of 3.7Hz when the sample rate (fs) = 44.1kHz.
    In voice modes, the high pass filter is optimised for voice communication; it is recommended to set the
    cut-off frequency below 300Hz.
    Note that the cut-off frequencies scale with the AIF2 sample rate. (The AIF2 sample rate is set using
    the AIF2_SR register, as described in the “Clocking and Sample Rates” section.) See Table 37 for the
    HPF cut-off frequencies at all supported sample rates.

        AIF2 - INPUT PATH VOLUME CONTROL
        The AIF2 interface supports two input channels. A digital volume control is provided on each input
        signal path, allowing attenuation in the range -71.625dB to 0dB in 0.375dB steps. The level of
        attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
        0.375  (X-192) dB for 1  X  192;         MUTE for X = 0       0dB for 192  X  255
        The AIF2DAC_VU bit controls the loading of digital volume control data. When AIF2DAC_VU bit is set
        to 0, the AIF2DACL_VOL and AIF2DACR_VOL control data will be loaded into the respective control
        register, but will not actually change the digital gain setting. Both left and right gain settings are
        updated when a 1 is written to AIF2DAC_VU. This makes it possible to update the gain of left and
        right channels simultaneously.
        Note that a digital gain function is also available at the audio interface input, to boost the DAC volume
        when a small signal is received on DACDAT2. See “Digital Audio Interface Control” for further details.
        Digital volume control is also possible at the DAC stage of the signal path, after the audio signal has
        passed through the DAC digital mixers. See “Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)” for further details.

        AIF2 - INPUT PATH SOFT MUTE CONTROL
        The WM8994 provides a soft mute function for each of the AIF2 interface input paths. When the soft-
        mute function is selected, the WM8994 gradually attenuates the associated signal paths until the path
        is entirely muted.
        When the soft-mute function is de-selected, the gain will either return instantly to the digital gain
        setting, or will gradually ramp back to the digital gain setting, depending on the
        AIF2DAC_UNMUTE_RAMP register field.
        The mute and un-mute ramp rate is selectable between two different rates.
        The AIF2 input paths are soft-muted by default. To play back an audio signal, the soft-mute must first
        be de-selected by setting AIF2DAC_MUTE = 0.
Rev 4.5                                                                                                        103

    The soft un-mute would typically be used during playback of audio data so that when the Mute is
    subsequently disabled, a smooth transition is scheduled to the previous volume level and pop noise is
    avoided. This is desirable when resuming playback after pausing during a track.
    The soft un-mute would typically not be required when un-muting at the start of a music file, in order
    that the first part of the music track is not attenuated. The instant un-mute behaviour is desirable in
    this case, when starting playback of a new track. See “DAC Soft Mute and Soft Un-Mute” (Figure 30)
    for an illustration of the soft mute function.

    AIF2 - INPUT PATH MONO MIX AND DE-EMPHASIS FILTER
    A digital mono mix can be selected on the AIF2 input channels. The mono mix is generated as the
    sum of the Left and Right AIF channel data. When the mono mix function is enabled, the combined
    mono signal is applied to the Left channel and the Right channel of the AIF2 signal processing and
    digital mixing paths. To prevent clipping, 6dB attenuation is applied to the mono mix.
    Digital de-emphasis can be applied to the AIF2 input (playback) paths; this is appropriate when the
    data source is a CD where pre-emphasis is used in the recording. De-emphasis filtering is available
    for sample rates of 48kHz, 44.1kHz and 32kHz. See "Digital Filter Characteristics” section for details
    of de-emphasis filter characteristics.

 DIGITAL TO ANALOGUE CONVERTER (DAC)
                 The WM8994 DACs receive digital input data from the DAC mixers - see “Digital Mixing”. The digital
                 audio data is converted to oversampled bit streams in the on-chip, true 24-bit digital interpolation
                 filters. The bitstream data enters four multi-bit, sigma-delta DACs, which convert them to high quality
                 analogue audio signals. The multi-bit DAC architecture reduces high frequency noise and sensitivity to
                 clock jitter. It also uses a Dynamic Element Matching technique for high linearity and low distortion.
                 A high performance mode of DAC operation can be selected by setting the DAC_OSR128 bit - see
                 “Clocking and Sample Rates” for details.
                 The analogue outputs from the DACs can be mixed with analogue line/mic inputs using the line output
                 mixers MIXOUTL / MIXOUTR and the speaker output mixers SPKMIXL / SPKMIXR.
                 The DACs are enabled using the register bits defined in Table 47.
                 Note that the DAC clock must be enabled whenever the DACs are enabled.

                 DAC CLOCKING CONTROL
                 Clocking for the DACs is derived from SYSCLK. The required clock is enabled when the
                 SYSDSPCLK_ENA register is set.
                 The DAC clock rate is configured automatically, according to the AIFn_SR, AIFnCLK_RATE and
                 DAC_OSR128 registers. (See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for further details of the system clocks
                 and control registers.)
                 When AIF1CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 0), then the DAC clocking is
                 controlled by the AIF1_SR and AIF1CLK_RATE registers.
                 When AIF2CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 1), then the DAC clocking is
                 controlled by the AIF2_SR and AIF2CLK_RATE registers.
                 The supported DAC clocking configurations are described in Table 48 (for DAC_OSR128=0) and
                 Table 49 (for DAC_OSR128=1). Under default conditions, the DAC_OSR128 bit is not set.

    Table 49 DAC Clocking - DAC_OSR128 = 1
    Note 1 - These clocking rates are only supported for ‘simple’ DAC-only playback modes, under the
    following conditions:
              AIF input is enabled on a single interface (AIF1 or AIF2) only, or is enabled on AIF1 and
               AIF2 simultaneously provided AIF1 and AIF2 are synchronised (ie. AIF1CLK_SRC =
               AIF2CLK_SRC)
              All AIF output paths are disabled
              All DSP functions (ReTune Mobile Parametric Equaliser, 3D stereo expansion and Dynamic
               Range Control) are disabled
    The clocking requirements in Table 48 and Table 49 are only applicable to the AIFnCLK that is
    selected as the SYSCLK source. Note that both clocks (AIF1CLK and AIF2CLK) must satisfy the
    requirements noted in the “Clocking and Sample Rates” section.
    The applicable clocks (SYSCLK, and AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK) must be present and enabled when using
    the Digital to Analogue Converters (DACs).

        DAC DIGITAL VOLUME
        The output level of each DAC can be controlled digitally over a range from -71.625dB to 0dB in
        0.375dB steps. The level of attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
        0.375  (X-192) dB for 1  X  192;       MUTE for X = 0;                 0dB for 192  X  255
        Each of the DACs can be muted using the soft mute control bits described in Table 50. The WM8994
        always applies a soft mute, where the volume is decreased gradually. The un-mute behaviour is
        configurable, as described in the “DAC Soft Mute and Soft Un-Mute” section.
        The DAC1_VU and DAC2_VU bits control the loading of digital volume control data. When DAC1_VU
        is set to 0, the DAC1L_VOL or DAC1R_VOL control data will be loaded into the respective control
        register, but will not actually change the digital gain setting. Both left and right gain settings are
        updated when a 1 is written to DAC1_VU. This makes it possible to update the gain of both channels
        simultaneously. A similar function for DAC2L and DAC2R is controlled by the DAC2_VU register bit.

                                         DAC SOFT MUTE AND SOFT UN-MUTE
                                         The WM8994 has a soft mute function which ensures that a gradual attenuation is applied to the DAC
                                         outputs when the mute is asserted. The soft mute rate can be selected using the DAC_MUTERATE
                                         bit.
                                         When a mute bit is disabled, the gain will either gradually ramp back up to the digital gain setting, or
                                         return instantly to the digital gain setting, depending on the DAC_SOFTMUTEMODE register bit. If the
                                         gradual un-mute ramp is selected (DAC_SOFTMUTEMODE = 1), then the un-mute rate is determined
                                         by the DAC_MUTERATE bit.
                                         Note that each DAC is soft-muted by default. To play back an audio signal, the mute must first be
                                         disabled by setting the applicable mute control to 0 (see Table 50).
                                         Soft Mute Mode would typically be enabled (DAC_SOFTMUTEMODE = 1) when using mute during
                                         playback of audio data so that when the mute is subsequently disabled, the volume increase will not
                                         create pop noise by jumping immediately to the previous volume level (e.g. resuming playback after
                                         pausing during a track).
                                         Soft Mute Mode would typically be disabled (DAC_SOFTMUTEMODE = 0) when un-muting at the
                                         start of a music file, in order that the first part of the track is not attenuated (e.g. when starting
                                         playback of a new track, or resuming playback after pausing between tracks).
                                         The DAC soft-mute function is illustrated in Figure 30 for DAC1L and DAC1R. The same function is
                                         applicable to DAC2L and DAC2R also.
                                                                                                 DAC muting and un-muting using volume control bits

        The DAC Soft Mute register controls are defined in Table 52.
        The volume ramp rate during soft mute and un-mute is controlled by the DAC_MUTERATE bit. Ramp
        rates of fs/32 and fs/2 are selectable. The ramp rate determines the rate at which the volume will be
        increased or decreased. Note that the actual ramp time depends on the extent of the difference
        between the muted and un-muted volume settings.

ANALOGUE OUTPUT SIGNAL PATH
               The WM8994 output routing and mixers provide a high degree of flexibility, allowing operation of many
               simultaneous signal paths through the device to a variety of analogue outputs. The outputs include a
               ground referenced headphone driver, two switchable class D/AB loudspeaker drivers, an ear speaker
               driver and four highly flexible line drivers. See “Analogue Outputs” for further details of these outputs.
               The WM8994 output signal paths and control registers are illustrated in Figure 31.

        OUTPUT SIGNAL PATHS ENABLE
        The output mixers and drivers can be independently enabled and disabled as described in Table 53.
        The supply rails for headphone outputs HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R are generated using an integrated
        dual-mode Charge Pump, which must be enabled whenever the headphone outputs are used. See the
        “Charge Pump” section for details on enabling and configuring this circuit.
        Note that the headphone outputs HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R have dedicated output PGAs and volume
        controls. As a result, a low power consumption DAC playback path can be supported without needing
        to enable the output mixers MIXOUTL / MIXOUTR or the mixer output PGAs MIXOUTLVOL /
        MIXOUTRVOL.
        Note that the Headphone Outputs are also controlled by fields located within Register R96, which
        provide suppression of pops & clicks when enabling and disabling the HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R
        signal paths. These registers are described in the following “Headphone Signal Paths Enable” section.
        Under recommended usage conditions, the Headphone Pop Suppression control bits will be
        configured by scheduling the default Start-Up and Shutdown sequences as described in the “Control
        Write Sequencer” section. In these cases, the user does not need to set the register fields in R1 and
        R96 directly.
        For normal operation of the output signal paths, the reference voltage VMID and the bias current must
        also be enabled. See “Reference Voltages and Master Bias” for details of the associated controls
        VMID_SEL and BIAS_ENA.

        The HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R output paths can be actively discharged to AGND through internal
        resistors if desired. This is desirable at start-up in order to achieve a known output stage condition
        prior to enabling the VMID reference voltage. This is also desirable in shutdown to prevent the
        external connections from being affected by the internal circuits. The HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R
        outputs are shorted to AGND by default; the short circuit is removed on each of these paths by setting
        the applicable fields HPOUT1L_RMV_SHORT or HPOUT1R_RMV_SHORT.
        The ground-referenced Headphone output drivers are designed to suppress pops and clicks when
        enabled or disabled. However, it is necessary to control the drivers in accordance with a defined
        sequence in start-up and shutdown to achieve the pop suppression. It is also necessary to schedule
        the DC Servo offset correction at the appropriate point in the sequence (see “DC Servo”). Table 54
        and Table 55 describe the recommended sequences for enabling and disabling these output drivers.

        OUTPUT MIXER CONTROL
        The Output Mixer path select and volume controls are described in Table 57 for the Left Channel
        (MIXOUTL) and Table 58 for the Right Channel (MIXOUTR). The gain of each of input path may be
        controlled independently in the range described in Table 59.
        Note that the DAC input levels may also be controlled by the DAC digital volume controls (see “Digital
        to Analogue Converter (DAC)”) and the Audio Interface digital volume controls (see “Digital Volume
        and Filter Control”).
        When using the IN2LP, IN2LN, IN2RP or IN2RN signal paths to the output mixers, the buffered VMID
        reference must be enabled, using the VMID_BUF_ENA register, as described in “Reference Voltages
        and Master Bias”.

        Care should be taken when enabling more than one path to a speaker mixer in order to avoid clipping.
        The gain of each input path is adjustable using a selectable -3dB control in each path to facilitate this.
        Each Speaker Mixer output is also controlled by an additional independent volume control.
        Note that the DAC input levels may also be controlled by the DAC digital volume controls (see “Digital
        to Analogue Converter (DAC)”) and the Audio Interface digital volume controls (see “Digital Volume
        and Filter Control”).
        When using the IN1LP or IN1RP signal paths to the speaker mixers, the buffered VMID reference
        must be enabled, using the VMID_BUF_ENA register, as described in “Reference Voltages and
        Master Bias”.

    OUTPUT SIGNAL PATH VOLUME CONTROL
    There are six output PGAs - MIXOUTLVOL, MIXOUTRVOL, HPOUT1LVOL, HPOUT1RVOL,
    SPKLVOL and SPKRVOL. Each can be independently controlled, with MIXOUTLVOL and
    MIXOUTRVOL providing volume control to both the earpiece and line drivers, HPOUT1LVOL and
    HPOUT1RVOL to the headphone driver, and SPKLVOL and SPKRVOL to the speaker drivers.
    The volume control of each of these output PGAs can be adjusted over a wide range of values. To
    minimise pop noise, it is recommended that only the MIXOUTLVOL, MIXOUTRVOL, HPOUT1LVOL,
    HPOUT1RVOL, SPKLVOL and SPKRVOL are modified while the output signal path is active. Other
    gain controls are provided in the signal paths to provide scaling of signals from different sources, and
    to prevent clipping when multiple signals are mixed. However, to prevent pop noise, it is
    recommended that those other gain controls should not be modified while the signal path is active.
    To prevent "zipper noise", a zero-cross function is provided on the output PGAs. When this feature is
    enabled, volume updates will not take place until a zero-crossing is detected. In the case of a long
    period without zero-crossings, a timeout function is provided. When the zero-cross function is
    enabled, the volume will update after the timeout period if no earlier zero-cross has occurred. The
    timeout clock is enabled using TOCLK_ENA; the timeout period is set by TOCLK_DIV. See “Clocking
    and Sample Rates” for more information on these fields.
    The mixer output PGA controls are shown in Table 62. The MIXOUT_VU bits control the loading of the
    output mixer PGA volume data. When MIXOUT_VU is set to 0, the volume control data will be loaded
    into the respective control register, but will not actually change the gain setting. The output mixer PGA
    volume settings are both updated when a 1 is written to either MIXOUT_VU bit. This makes it possible
    to update the gain of both output paths simultaneously.

        Table 62 Mixer Output PGA (MIXOUTLVOL, MIXOUTRVOL) Control
        The headphone output PGA is configurable between two input sources. The default input to each
        headphone output PGA is the respective output mixer (MIXOUTL or MIXOUTR). A direct path from
        the DAC1L or DAC1R can be selected using the DAC1L_TO_HPOUT1L and DAC1R_TO_HPOUT1R
        register bits. When these bits are selected, a DAC to Headphone playback path is possible without
        using the output mixers; this offers reduced power consumption by allowing the output mixers to be
        disabled in this typical usage case.
        The headphone output PGA controls are shown in Table 63. The HPOUT1_VU bits control the loading
        of the headphone PGA volume data. When HPOUT1_VU is set to 0, the volume control data will be
        loaded into the respective control register, but will not actually change the gain setting. The
        headphone PGA volume settings are both updated when a 1 is written to either HPOUT1_VU bit. This
        makes it possible to update the gain of both output paths simultaneously.

        SPEAKER BOOST MIXER
        Each class D/AB speaker driver has its own boost mixer which performs a dual role. It allows the
        output from the left speaker mixer (via SPKLVOL), right speaker mixer (via SPKRVOL), or the ‘Direct
        Voice’ path to be routed to either speaker driver. The speaker boost mixers are controlled using the
        registers defined in Table 66 below.
        The ‘Direct Voice’ path is the differential input, VRXN-VRXP, routed directly to the output drivers,
        providing a low power differential path from baseband voice to loudspeakers. Note that a phase
        inversion exists between VRXP and SPKOUTxP. The ‘Direct Voice’ path output therefore represents
        VVRXN - VVRXP.
        The second function of the speaker boost mixers is that they provide an additional AC gain (boost)
        function to shift signal levels between the AVDD1 and SPKVDD voltage domains for maximum output
        power. The AC gain (boost) function is described in the “Analogue Outputs” section.

    EARPIECE DRIVER MIXER
    The earpiece driver has a dedicated mixer, HPOUT2MIX, which is controlled using the registers
    defined in Table 67. The earpiece driver is configurable to select output from the left output mixer (via
    MIXOUTLVOL), the right output mixer (via MIXOUTRVOL), or the ‘Direct Voice’ path.
    The ‘Direct Voice’ path is the differential input, VRXN-VRXP, routed directly to the output drivers,
    providing a low power differential path from baseband voice to earpiece. Note that a phase inversion
    exists between VRXP and HPOUT2P. The ‘Direct Voice’ path output therefore represents VVRXN -
    VVRXP.
    Care should be taken to avoid clipping when enabling more than one path to the earpiece driver. The
    HPOUT2VOL volume control can be used to avoid clipping when more than one full scale signal is
    input to the mixer.

        LINE OUTPUT MIXERS
        The WM8994 provides two pairs of line outputs, both with highly configurable output mixers. The
        outputs LINEOUT1N and LINEOUT1P can be configured as two single-ended outputs or as a
        differential output. In the same manner, LINEOUT2N and LINEOUT2P can be configured either as two
        single-ended outputs or as a differential output. The respective line output mixers can be configured in
        single-ended mode or differential mode; each mode supports multiple signal path configurations.
        LINEOUT1 single-ended mode is selected by setting LINEOUT1_MODE = 1. In single-ended mode,
        any of three possible signal paths may be enabled:
                   MIXOUTL (left output mixer) to LINEOUT1P
                   MIXOUTR (right output mixer) to LINEOUT1N
                   MIXOUTL (left output mixer) to LINEOUT1N
        LINEOUT1 differential mode is selected by setting LINEOUT1_MODE = 0. In differential mode, any of
        three possible signal paths may be enabled:
                   MIXOUTL (left output mixer) to LINEOUT1N and LINEOUT1P
                   IN1L (input PGA) to LINEOUT1N and LINEOUT1P
                   IN1R (input PGA) to LINEOUT1N and LINEOUT1P
        The LINEOUT1 output mixers are controlled as described in Table 68. Care should be taken to avoid
        clipping when enabling more than one path to the line output mixers. The LINEOUT1_VOL control can
        be used to provide -6dB attenuation when more than one full scale signal is applied.
        When using the LINEOUT1 mixers in single-ended mode, a buffered VMID must be enabled. This is
        achieved by setting LINEOUT_VMID_BUF_ENA, as described in the “Analogue Outputs” section.

 CHARGE PUMP
             The WM8994 incorporates a dual-mode Charge Pump which generates the supply rails for the
             headphone output drivers, HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R.
             The Charge Pump has a single supply input, CPVDD, and generates split rails CPVOUTP and
             CPVOUTN according to the selected mode of operation.
             The Charge Pump connections are illustrated in Figure 32 (see “Applications Information” for external
             component values). An input decoupling capacitor may also be required at CPVDD, depending upon
             the system configuration.

             The Charge Pump is enabled by setting the CP_ENA bit. When enabled, the charge pump adjusts the
             output voltages (CPVOUTP and CPVOUTN) as well as the switching frequency in order to optimise
             the power consumption according to the operating conditions. This can take two forms, which are
             selected using the CP_DYN_PWR register bit.
                  Register control (CP_DYN_PWR = 0)
                  Dynamic control (CP_DYN_PWR = 1)
             Under Register control, the HPOUT1L_VOL and HPOUT1R_VOL register settings are used to control
             the charge pump mode of operation.
             Under Dynamic control, the audio signal level in the digital audio interface is used to control the
             charge pump mode of operation. The CP_DYN_SRC_SEL register determines which of the digital
             signal paths is used for this function - this may be AIF1 Timeslot 0, AIF Timeslot 1 or AIF2. The
             CP_DYN_SRC_SEL should be set according to the active source for the HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R
             outputs.
             The Dynamic Charge Pump Control mode is the Wolfson ‘Class W’ mode, which allows the power
             consumption to be optimised in real time, but can only be used if a single AIF source is the only signal
             source. The Class W mode should not be used if any of the bypass paths are used to feed analogue
             inputs into the output signal path, or if more than one AIF source is used to feed the headphone
             output via the Digital Mixers.
             Under the recommended usage conditions of the WM8994, the Charge Pump will be enabled by
             running the default headphone Start-Up sequence as described in the “Control Write Sequencer”
             section. (Similarly, it will be disabled by running the Shut-Down sequence.) In these cases, the user
             does not need to write to the CP_ENA bit. The Charge Pump operating mode defaults to Register
             control; Dynamic control may be selected by setting the CP_DYN_PWR register bit, if appropriate.

        Note that the charge pump clock is derived from internal clock SYSCLK; either MCLK or the FLL
        output selectable using the SYSCLK_SRC bit. Under normal circumstances an external clock signal
        must be present for the charge pump to function. However, the FLL has a free-running mode that
        does not require an external clock but will generate an internal clock suitable for running the charge
        pump. The clock division from SYSCLK is handled transparently by the WM8994 without user
        intervention, as long as SYSCLK and sample rates are set correctly. Refer to the “Clocking and
        Sample Rates” section for more detail on the FLL and clocking configuration.
        When the Charge Pump is disabled, the output can be left floating or can be actively discharged,
        depending on the CP_DISCH control bit.
        If the headphone output drivers (HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R) are not used, then the Charge Pump and
        the associated external components are not required. The Charge Pump and Headphone drivers
        should not be enabled in this case (CP_ENA=0, HPOUT1L_ENA=0, HPOUT1R_ENA=0).
        If the Charge Pump is not used, and the associated external components are omitted, then the CPCA
        and CPCB pins can be left floating; the CPVOUTP and CPVOUTN pins should be grounded as
        illustrated in Figure 33.
        Note that, when the Charge Pump is disabled, it is still recommended that the CPVDD pin is kept
        within its recommended operating conditions (1.71V to 2.0V).

 DC SERVO
          The WM8994 provides a DC servo circuit on the headphone outputs HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R in
          order to remove DC offset from these ground-referenced outputs. When enabled, the DC servo
          ensures that the DC level of these outputs remains within 1mV of ground. Removal of the DC offset is
          important because any deviation from GND at the output pin will cause current to flow through the
          load under quiescent conditions, resulting in increased power consumption. Additionally, the presence
          of DC offsets can result in audible pops and clicks at power up and power down.
          The recommended usage of the DC Servo is initialised by running the default Start-Up sequence as
          described in the “Control Write Sequencer” section. The default Start-Up sequence executes a series
          of DC offset corrections, after which the measured offset correction is maintained on the headphone
          output channels. If a different usage is required, eg. if a periodic DC offset correction is required, then
          the default Start-Up sequence may be modified according to specific requirements. The relevant
          control fields are described in the following paragraphs and are defined in Table 71.
          DC SERVO ENABLE AND START-UP
          The DC Servo circuit is enabled on HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R by setting DCS_ENA_CHAN_0 and
          DCS_ENA_CHAN_1 respectively. When the DC Servo is enabled, the DC offset correction can be
          commanded in a number of different ways, including single-shot and periodically recurring events.
          Writing a logic 1 to DCS_TRIG_STARTUP_n initiates a series of DC offset measurements and applies
          the necessary correction to the associated output; (‘n’ = 0 for Left channel, 1 for Right channel). On
          completion, the headphone output will be within 1mV of AGND. This is the DC Servo mode selected
          by the default Start-Up sequence. Completion of the DC offset correction triggered in this way is
          indicated by the DCS_STARTUP_COMPLETE field, as described in Table 71. Typically, this operation
          takes 86ms per channel.
          For correct operation of the DC Servo Start-Up mode, it is important that there is no active audio
          signal present on the signal path while the mode is running. The DC Servo Start-Up mode should be
          scheduled at the correct position within the Headphone Output Enable sequence, as described in the
          “Analogue Output Signal Path” section. All other stages of the analogue signal path should be fully
          enabled prior to commanding the Start-Up mode; the DAC Digital Mute function should be used,

        where appropriate, to ensure there is no active audio signal present during the DC Servo
        measurements.
        Writing a logic 1 to DCS_TRIG_DAC_WR_n causes the DC offset correction to be set to the value
        contained in the DCS_DAC_WR_VAL_n fields in Register R89. This mode is useful if the required
        offset correction has already been determined and stored; it is faster than the
        DCS_TRIG_STARTUP_n mode, but relies on the accuracy of the stored settings. Completion of the
        DC offset correction triggered in this way is indicated by the DCS_DAC_WR_COMPLETE field, as
        described in Table 71. Typically, this operation takes 2ms per channel.
        For pop-free operation of the DC Servo DAC Write mode, it is important that the mode is scheduled at
        the correct position within the Headphone Output Enable sequence, as described in the “Analogue
        Output Signal Path” section.
        The current DC offset value for each Headphone output channel can be read from the
        DCS_DAC_WR_VAL_n fields. These values may form the basis of settings that are subsequently
        used by the DC Servo in DAC Write mode. Note that these fields have a different definition for Read
        and Write, as described in Table 71.
        When using either of the DC Servo options above, the status of the DC offset correction process is
        indicated by the DCS_CAL_COMPLETE field; this is the logical OR of the
        DCS_STARTUP_COMPLETE and DCS_DAC_WR_COMPLETE fields.
        The DCS_DAC_WR_COMPLETE bits can be used as inputs to the Interrupt control circuit or used to
        generate an external logic signal on a GPIO pin. See “Interrupts” and “General Purpose Input/Output”
        for further details.
        The DC Servo control fields associated with start-up operation are described in Table 71. It is
        important to note that, to minimise audible pops/clicks, the Start-Up and DAC Write modes of DC
        Servo operation should be commanded as part of a control sequence which includes muting and
        shorting of the headphone outputs; a suitable sequence is defined in the default Start-Up sequence.

    Table 71 DC Servo Enable and Start-Up Modes
    DC SERVO ACTIVE MODES
    The DC Servo modes described above are suitable for initialising the DC offset correction circuit on
    the Headphone outputs as part of a controlled start-up sequence which is executed before the signal
    path is fully enabled. Additional modes are available for use whilst the signal path is active; these
    modes may be of benefit following a large change in signal gain, which can lead to a change in DC
    offset level. Periodic updates may also be desirable to remove slow drifts in DC offset caused by
    changes in parameters such as device temperature.
    The DC Servo circuit is enabled on HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R by setting DCS_ENA_CHAN_0 and
    DCS_ENA_CHAN_1 respectively, as described earlier in Table 71.

        Writing a logic 1 to DCS_TRIG_SINGLE_n initiates a single DC offset measurement and adjustment
        to the associated output; (‘n’ = 0 for Left channel, 1 for Right channel). This will adjust the DC offset
        correction on the selected channel by no more than 1LSB (0.25mV).
        Setting DCS_TIMER_PERIOD_01 to a non-zero value will cause a single DC offset measurement and
        adjustment to be scheduled on a periodic basis. Periodic rates ranging from every 0.52s to in excess
        of 2 hours can be selected.
        Writing a logic 1 to DCS_TRIG_SERIES_n initiates a series of DC offset measurements and applies
        the necessary correction to the associated output. The number of DC Servo operations performed is
        determined by DCS_SERIES_NO_01. A maximum of 128 operations may be selected, though a much
        lower value will be sufficient in most applications.
        The DC Servo control fields associated with active modes (suitable for use on a signal path that is in
        active use) are described in Table 72.

               GPIO / INTERRUPT OUTPUTS FROM DC SERVO
               When using the DC Servo Start-Up or DAC Write modes, the DCS_CAL_COMPLETE register
               provides readback of the status of the DC offset correction. This can be read from register R88 as
               described in Table 71.
               The DCS_CAL_COMPLETE bits can also be used as inputs to the Interrupt control circuit and used to
               trigger an Interrupt event - see “Interrupts”.
               The DCS_CAL_COMPLETE bits can also be used as inputs to the GPIO function and used to
               generate external logic signals indicating the DC Servo status. See “General Purpose Input/Output”
               for details of how to configure a GPIO pin to output the DC Servo status.
 ANALOGUE OUTPUTS
               The speaker, headphone, earpiece and line outputs are highly configurable and may be used in many
               different ways.
               SPEAKER OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS
               The speaker outputs SPKOUTL and SPKOUTR can be driven by either of the speaker mixers,
               SPKMIXL or SPKMIXR, or by the low power, differential Direct Voice path from IN2LP/VRXN and
               IN2RP/VRXP. Fine volume control is available on the speaker mixer paths using the SPKLVOL and
               SPKRVOL PGAs. A boost function is available on both the speaker mixer paths and the Direct Voice
               path. For information on the speaker mixing options, refer to the “Analogue Output Signal Path”
               section.
               The speaker outputs SPKOUTL and SPKOUTR operate in a BTL configuration in Class AB or Class D
               amplifier modes. The default mode is class D but class AB mode can be selected by setting the
               SPKOUT_CLASSAB register bit, as defined in Table 74.
               The speaker outputs can be configured as a pair of stereo outputs, or as a single mono output. Note
               that, for applications requiring only a single speaker output, it is possible to improve the THD
               performance by configuring the speaker outputs in mono mode. See “Typical Performance” for further
               details.
               The mono configuration is selected by applying a logic high input to the SPKMODE pin (A3), as
               described in Table 73. For Stereo mode this pin should be connected to GND. Note that SPKMODE is
               referenced to DBVDD.
               An internal pull-up resistor is enabled by default on the SPKMODE pin; this can be configured using
               the SPKMODE_PU register bit described in Table 74.
                    SPEAKER CONFIGURATION                   SPKMODE PIN (A3)
                             Stereo Mode                          GND

               Table 73 SPKMODE Pin Function
               In the mono configuration, the P channels, SPKOUTLP and SPKOUTRP should be connected
               together on the PCB, and similarly with the N channels, SPKOUTLN and SPKOUTRN, as illustrated in
               Figure 34. In this configuration both left and right speaker drivers should be enabled
               (SPKOUTL_ENA=1 and SPKOUTR_ENA=1), but path selection and volume controls are available on
               left channel only (SPKMIXL, SPKLVOL and SPKOUTLBOOST).
               Note that the minimum speaker load resistance and the maximum power output has a dependency on
               the SPKMODE output configuration, and also on the Class D/AB mode selection. See “Electrical
               Characteristics” for further details.

        Eight levels of AC signal boost are provided in order to deliver maximum output power for many
        commonly-used SPKVDD/AVDD1 combinations. (Note that SPKVDD1 powers the Left Speaker
        driver, and SPKVDD2 powers the Right Speaker driver; it is assumed that SPKVDD1 = SPKVDD2 =
        SPKVDD.)
        The signal boost options are available in both Class AB and Class D modes. The AC boost levels
        from 0dB to +12dB are selected using register bits SPKOUTL_BOOST and SPKOUTR_BOOST. To
        prevent pop noise, SPKOUTL_BOOST and SPKOUTR_BOOST should not be modified while the
        speaker outputs are enabled. Figure 35 illustrates the speaker outputs and the mixing and gain/boost
        options available.
        Ultra-low leakage and high PSRR allow the speaker supply SPKVDD to be directly connected to a
        lithium battery. Note that an appropriate SPKVDD supply voltage must be provided to prevent
        waveform clipping when speaker boost is used.
        DC gain is applied automatically in both class AB and class D modes with a shift from VMID to
        SPKVDD/2. This provides optimum signal swing for maximum output power. In class AB mode, an
        ultra-high PSRR mode is available, in which the DC reference for the speaker driver is fixed at VMID.
        This mode is selected by enabling the SPKAB_REF_SEL bit (see Table 74). In this mode, the output
        power is limited but the driver will still be capable of driving more than 500mW in 8 while maintaining
        excellent suppression of noise on SPKVDD (for example, TDMA noise in a GSM phone application).
        The AC and DC gain functions are illustrated in Figure 35.

        Clocking of the Class D output driver is derived from SYSCLK. The clocking frequency division is
        configured automatically, according to the AIFn_SR and AIFnCLK_RATE registers. (See “Clocking
        and Sample Rates” for further details of the system clocks and control registers.)
        The Class D switching clock is enabled whenever SPKOUTL_ENA or SPKOUTR_ENA is set,
        provided also that SPKOUT_CLASSAB = 0. The frequency is as described in Table 75.
        When AIF1CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 0), then the Class D clock
        frequency is controlled by the AIF1_SR and AIF1CLK_RATE registers.
        When AIF2CLK is selected as the SYSCLK source (SYSCLK_SRC = 1), then the Class D clock
        frequency is controlled by the AIF2_SR and AIF2CLK_RATE registers.
        Note that the applicable clocks (SYSCLK, AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK) must be present and enabled when
        using the speaker outputs in Class D mode.

        HEADPHONE OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS
        The headphone outputs HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R are driven by the headphone output PGAs
        HPOUT1LVOL and HPOUT1RVOL. Each PGA has its own dedicated volume control, as described in
        the “Analogue Output Signal Path” section. The input to these PGAs can be either the output mixers
        MIXOUTL and MIXOUTR or the direct DAC1 outputs DAC1L and DAC1R.
        The headphone output driver is capable of driving up to 30mW into a 16Ω load or 25mW into a 32Ω
        load such as a stereo headset or headphones. The outputs are ground-referenced, eliminating any
        requirement for AC coupling capacitors. This is achieved by having separate positive and negative
        supply rails powered by an on-chip charge pump. A DC Servo circuit removes any DC offset from the
        headphone outputs, suppressing ‘pop’ noise and minimising power consumption. The Charge Pump
        and DC Servo are described separately (see “Charge Pump” and “DC Servo” respectively).
        It is recommended to connect a zobel network to the headphone output pins HPOUT1L and
        HPOUT1R for best audio performance in all applications. The components of the zobel network have
        the effect of dampening high frequency oscillations or instabilities that can arise outside the audio
Rev 4.5                                                                                                  143

    band under certain conditions. Possible sources of these instabilities include the inductive load of a
    headphone coil or an active load in the form of an external line amplifier. The capacitance of lengthy
    cables or PCB tracks can also lead to amplifier instability. The zobel network should comprise of a
    20 resistor and 100nF capacitor in series with each other, as illustrated in Figure 36.
    If any ground-referenced headphone output is not used, then the zobel network components can be
    omitted from the corresponding output pin, and the pin can be left floating. The respective headphone
    driver(s) should not be enabled in this case.

    The headphone output incorporates a common mode, or ground loop, feedback path which provides
    rejection of system-related ground noise. The return path is via HPOUT1FB. This pin must be
    connected to ground for normal operation of the headphone output. No register configuration is
    required.
    Note that the HPOUT1FB pin should be connected to GND close to the headphone jack, as illustrated
    in Figure 36.
    EARPIECE DRIVER OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS
    The earpiece driver outputs HPOUT2P and HPOUT2N are driven by the HPOUT2MIX output mixer,
    which can take inputs from the mixer output PGAs MIXOUTLVOL and MIXOUTRVOL, or from the low
    power, differential Direct Voice path IN2LP/VRXN and IN2RP/VRXP. Fine volume control is available
    on the output mixer paths using MIXOUTLVOL and MIXOUTRVOL. A selectable -6dB attenuation is
    available on the HPOUT2MIX output, as described in Table 67 (refer to the “Analogue Output Signal
    Path” section).
    The earpiece outputs are designed to operate in a BTL configuration, driving 50mW into a typical 16
    ear speaker.
    For suppression of pop noise there are two separate enables for the earpiece driver; HPOUT2_ENA
    enables the output stage and HPOUT2_IN_ENA enables the mixer and input stage.
    HPOUT2_IN_ENA should be enabled a minimum of 50s before HPOUT2_ENA – see “Control Write
    Sequencer” section for an example power sequence.
    LINE OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS
    The four line outputs LINEOUT1P, LINEOUT1N, LINEOUT2P and LINEOUT2N provide a highly
    flexible combination of differential and single-ended configurations, each driven by a dedicated output
    mixer. There is a selectable -6dB gain option in each mixer to avoid clipping when mixing more than
    one signal into a line output. Additional volume control is available at other locations within each of the
    supported signal paths. For more information about the line output mixing options, refer to the
    “Analogue Output Signal Path” section.

              Typical applications for the line outputs (single-ended or differential) are:
                            Handset or headset microphone output to external voice CODEC
                            Stereo line output
                            Output to external speaker driver(s) to support additional loudspeakers
              When single-ended mode is selected for either LINEOUT1 or LINEOUT2, a buffered VMID must be
              enabled as a reference for the outputs. This is enabled by setting the LINEOUT_VMID_BUF_ENA bit
              as defined in Table 76.

               The line outputs incorporate a common mode, or ground loop, feedback path which provides rejection
               of system-related ground noise. The return path, via LINEOUTFB, is enabled separately for
               LINEOUT1 and LINEOUT2 using the LINEOUT1_FB and LINEOUT2_FB bits as defined in Table 77.
               Ground loop feedback is a benefit to single-ended line outputs only; it is not applicable to differential
               outputs, which already inherently offer common mode noise rejection.

 GENERAL PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT
               The WM8994 provides a number of GPIO functions to enable interfacing and detection of external
               hardware and to provide logic outputs to other devices. The input functions can be polled directly or
               can be used to generate an Interrupt (IRQ) event. The GPIO and Interrupt circuits support the
               following functions:
                         Alternate interface functions (AIF2, AIF3)
                         Button detect (GPIO input)
                         Logic ‘1’ and logic ‘0’ output (GPIO output)
                         SDOUT (4-wire SPI Control Interface data)
                         Interrupt (IRQ) status output
                         Over-Temperature detection
                         Accessory detection (MICBIAS current detection)
                         Frequency Locked Loop (FLL) Lock status output
                         Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) Lock status output
                         Dynamic Range Control (DRC) Signal activity detection
                         Control Write Sequencer status output
                         Digital Core FIFO error status output
                         Clock output (SYSCLK divided by OPCLK_DIV)
                         Frequency Locked Loop (FLL) Clock output

    GPIO CONTROL
    For each GPIO, the selected function is determined by the GPn_FN field, where n identifies the GPIO
    pin (1 to 11). The pin direction, set by GPn_DIR, must be set according to function selected by
    GPn_FN.
    The alternate audio interfaces AIF2 and AIF3 are both supported using GPIO pins; the applicable pin
    functions are selected by setting the corresponding GPn_FN register to 00h. See Table 81 for the
    definition of which AIF function is available on each GPIO pin.
    See “Digital Audio Interface Control” for details of AIF2 and AIF3.
    Note that the GPIO2 pin supports functions MCLK2 and Button Detect / Logic Level Input only.
    Accordingly, GP2_DIR should be set to ‘1’ in all applications.
    When a pin is configured as a GPIO input (GPn_DIR = 1), the logic level at the pin can be read from
    the respective GPn_LVL bit. Note that GPn_LVL is not affected by the GPn_POL bit.
    A de-bounce circuit can be enabled on any GPIO input, to avoid false event triggers. This is enabled
    on each pin by setting the respective GPn_DB bit. Note that TOCLK must be enabled when this input
    de-bouncing is required.
    When a pin is configured as a Logic Level output (GPn_DIR = 0, GPn_FN = 01h), its level can be set
    to logic 0 or logic 1 using the GPn_LVL field.
    When a pin is configured as an output (GPn_DIR = 0), the polarity can be inverted using the
    GPn_POL bit. When GPn_POL = 1, then the selected output function is inverted. In the case of Logic
    Level output (GPn_FN = 01h), the external output will be the opposite logic level to GPn_LVL when
    GPn_POL = 1.
    A GPIO output can be either CMOS driven or Open Drain. This is selected on each pin using the
    respective GPn_OP_CFG bit.
    Internal pull-up and pull-down resistors may be enabled using the GPn_PU and GPn_PD fields; this
    allows greater flexibility to interface with different signals from other devices. (Note that if GPn_PU and
    GPn_PD are both set for any GPIO pin, then the pull-up and pull-down will be disabled.)
    Each of the GPIO pins is an input to the Interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an Interrupt
    event. An interrupt event is triggered on the rising and falling edge of the GPIO input. The associated
    interrupt bit is latched once set; it can be polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal. See
    “Interrupts” for more details of the Interrupt event handling.
    The register fields that control the GPIO pins are described in Table 78, Table 79 and Table 80.

        The available GPIO functions are described in Table 81. The function of each GPIO is set using the
        GPn_FN register, where n identifies the GPIO pin (1 to 11). Note that the respective GPn_DIR must
        also be set according to whether the function is an input or output.
        Note that GPIO2 supports functions MCLK2 and Button Detect / Logic Level Input only.

    BUTTON DETECT (GPIO INPUT)
    Button detect functionality can be selected on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO registers
    as described in “GPIO Control”. The same functionality can be used to support a Jack Detect input
    function.
    It is recommended to enable the GPIO input de-bounce feature when using GPIOs as button input or
    Jack Detect input.
    The GPn_LVL fields may be read to determine the logic levels on a GPIO input, after the selectable
    de-bounce controls. Note that GPn_LVL is not affected by the GPn_POL bit.
    The de-bounced GPIO signals are also inputs to the Interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is
    triggered on the rising and falling edge of the GPIO input. The associated interrupt bits are latched
    once set; it can be polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal. See “Interrupts” for more
    details of the Interrupt event handling.
    LOGIC ‘1’ AND LOGIC ‘0’ OUTPUT (GPIO OUTPUT)
    The WM8994 can be programmed to drive a logic high or logic low level on any GPIO pin by selecting
    the “GPIO Output” function as described in “GPIO Control”. The output logic level is selected using the
    respective GPn_LVL bit.
    Note that the polarity of the GPIO output can be inverted using the GPn_POL registers. If GPn_POL =
    1, then the external output will be the opposite logic level to GPn_LVL.

                                                                                           WM8994
        SDOUT (4-WIRE SPI CONTROL INTERFACE DATA)
        The WM8994 can support a number of different Control Interface protocols. In 4-wire SPI mode, a
        GPIO pin must be configured as SDOUT. See “Control Interface” for further details.
        A GPIO pin configured as SDOUT can be configured as CMOS or Wired ‘OR’ using the SPI_CFG
        register. Note that the GPn_OP_CFG and GPn_POL registers have no effect on a GPIO pin that is
        configured as SDOUT.
        INTERRUPT (IRQ) STATUS OUTPUT
        The WM8994 has an Interrupt Controller which can be used to indicate when any selected Interrupt
        events occur. An interrupt can be generated by any of the events described throughout the GPIO
        function definition above. Individual interrupts may be masked in order to configure the Interrupt as
        required. See “Interrupts” for further details.
        The Interrupt (IRQ) status may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO
        registers as described in “GPIO Control”.
        OVER-TEMPERATURE DETECTION
        The WM8994 incorporates a temperature sensor which detects when the device temperature is within
        normal limits or if the device is approaching a hazardous temperature condition.
        The Temperature status may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO
        registers as described in “GPIO Control”. Any GPIO pin can be used to indicate either a Warning
        Temperature event or the Shutdown Temperature event. De-bounce can be applied to the applicable
        signal using the register bits described in Table 82.
        The Warning Temperature and Shutdown Temperature status are inputs to the Interrupt control circuit,
        after the selectable de-bounce. An interrupt event may be triggered on the rising and falling edges of
        these signals. The associated interrupt bit is latched once set; it can be polled at any time or used to
        control the IRQ signal. See “Interrupts” for more details of the Interrupt event handling.
        Note that the temperature sensor can be configured to automatically disable the audio outputs of the
        WM8994 (see “Thermal Shutdown”). In some applications, it may be preferable to manage the
        temperature sensor event through GPIO or Interrupt functions, allowing a host processor to implement
        a controlled system response to an over-temperature condition.
        The temperature sensor must be enabled by setting the TSHUT_ENA register bit. When the
        TSHUT_OPDIS is also set, then a device over-temperature condition will cause the speaker outputs
        (SPKOUTL and SPKOUTR) of the WM8994 to be disabled.

    ACCESSORY DETECTION (MICBIAS CURRENT DETECTION)
    Current detection is provided on each of the microphone bias sources MICBIAS1 and MICBIAS2.
    These can be configured to detect when an external accessory (such as a microphone) has been
    connected. The output voltage of each of the microphone bias sources is selectable. Two current
    detection threshold levels can be set; these thresholds are applicable to both microphone bias
    sources.
    The logic signals from the current detect circuits may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the
    respective GPIO registers as described in “GPIO Control”. De-bounce can be applied to these signals
    using the register bits described in Table 83.
    The current detection circuits are inputs to the Interrupt control circuit, after the selectable de-bounce.
    An interrupt event is triggered on the rising and falling edges of the current detect signals. The
    associated interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or used to control the
    IRQ signal. See “Interrupts” for more details of the Interrupt event handling.

        FREQUENCY LOCKED LOOP (FLL) LOCK STATUS OUTPUT
        The WM8994 maintains a flag indicating the lock status of each of FLLs, which may be used to control
        other events if required. See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for more details of the FLL.
        The FLL Lock signals may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO registers
        as described in “GPIO Control”.
        The FLL Lock signals are inputs to the Interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered on the
        rising and falling edges of the FLL Lock signals. The associated interrupt bits are latched once set;
        they can be polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal. See “Interrupts” for more details of
        the Interrupt event handling.
        SAMPLE RATE CONVERTER (SRC) LOCK STATUS OUTPUT
        The WM8994 maintains a flag indicating the lock status of each of Sample Rate Converters, which
        may be used to control other events if required. See “Sample Rate Conversion” for more details of the
        Sample Rate Converters.
        The SRC Lock signals may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO
        registers as described in “GPIO Control”.
        The SRC Lock signals are inputs to the Interrupt control circuit, after the selectable de-bounce. An
        interrupt event is triggered on the rising and falling edges of the SRC Lock signals. The associated
        interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal.
        See “Interrupts” for more details of the Interrupt event handling.
        DYNAMIC RANGE CONTROL (DRC) SIGNAL ACTIVITY DETECTION
        Signal activity detection is provided on each of the Dynamic Range Controllers (DRCs). These may be
        configured to indicate when a signal is present on the respective signal path. The signal activity status
        signals may be used to control other events if required. See “Digital Core Architecture” for more
        details of the DRCs and the available digital signal paths.
        When a DRC is enabled, as described in “Dynamic Range Control (DRC)”, then signal activity
        detection can be enabled by setting the respective [DRC]_SIG_DET register bit. The applicable
        threshold can be defined either as a Peak level (Crest Factor) or an RMS level, depending on the
        [DRC]_SIG_DET_MODE register bit. When Peak level is selected, the threshold is determined by
        [DRC]_SIG_DET_PK, which defines the applicable Crest Factor (Peak to RMS ratio) threshold. If
        RMS level is selected, then the threshold is set using [DRC]_SIG_DET_RMS. These register fields
        are set independently for each of the three Dynamic Range Controllers, as described in Table 84.
        The DRC Signal Detect signals may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective
        GPIO registers as described in “GPIO Control”.

        CONTROL WRITE SEQUENCER STATUS DETECTION
        The WM8994 Control Write Sequencer (WSEQ) can be used to execute a sequence of register write
        operations in response to a simple trigger event. When the Control Write Sequencer is executing a
        sequence, normal access to the register map via the Control Interface is restricted. See “Control Write
        Sequencer” for details of the Control Write Sequencer.
        The WM8994 generates a signal indicating the status of the Control Write Sequencer, in order to
        signal to the host processor whether the Control Interface functionality is restricted due to an ongoing
        Control Sequence. The WSEQ_DONE flag indicates that the sequencer has completed the
        commanded sequence.
        The Write Sequencer status may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO
        registers as described in “GPIO Control”.
        The Write Sequencer status is an input to the Interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered
        on completion of a Control Sequence. The associated interrupt bit is latched once set; it can be polled
        at any time or used to control the IRQ signal. See “Interrupts” for more details of the Interrupt event
        handling.

    DIGITAL CORE FIFO ERROR STATUS DETECTION
    The WM8994 monitors the Digital Core for error conditions which may occur if a clock rate mismatch
    is detected. Under these conditions, the digital audio may become corrupted.
    The most likely cause of a Digital Core FIFO Error condition is an incorrect system clocking
    configuration. See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for the WM8994 system clocking requirements.
    The Digital Core FIFO Error function is provided in order that the system configuration can be verified
    during product development.
    The FIFO Error signal may be output directly on any GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO
    registers as described in “GPIO Control”.
    The FIFO Error signal is an input to the Interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered on the
    rising edge of the FIFO Error signal. The associated interrupt bit is latched once set; it can be polled at
    any time or used to control the IRQ signal. See “Interrupts” for more details of the Interrupt event
    handling.
    OPCLK CLOCK OUTPUT
    A clock output (OPCLK) derived from SYSCLK may be output on any GPIO pin by setting the
    respective GPIO registers as described in “GPIO Control”. This clock is enabled by register bit
    OPCLK_ENA, and its frequency is controlled by OPCLK_DIV.
    See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for more details of the System Clock (SYSCLK).

 INTERRUPTS
                               The Interrupt Controller has multiple inputs. These include the GPIO input pins, the MICBIAS current
                               detection circuits, FLL Lock circuits, SRC Lock circuit, Microphone activity detection, Over-
                               temperature indication, Digital FIFO error detection and the Write Sequencer status flag. Any
                               combination of these inputs can be used to trigger an Interrupt Request (IRQ) event.
                               There is an Interrupt register field associated with each of the interrupt inputs. These fields are
                               asserted whenever a logic edge is detected on the respective input. Some inputs are triggered on
                               rising edges only; some are triggered on both edges, as noted in Table 86. The Interrupt register fields
                               are held in Registers R1840 and R1841. The Interrupt flags can be polled at any time from these
                               registers, or else in response to the Interrupt Request (IRQ) output being signalled via a GPIO pin.
                               All of the Interrupts are edge-triggered, as noted above. Many of these are triggered on both the rising
                               and falling edges and, therefore, the Interrupt registers cannot indicate which edge has been
                               detected. The “Raw Status” fields in Register R1842 provide readback of the current value of selected
                               inputs to the Interrupt Controller. Note that the logic levels of any GPIO inputs can be read using the
                               GPn_LVL registers, as described in Table 78 to Table 80.
                               Individual mask bits can select or deselect different functions from the Interrupt controller. These are
                               listed within the Interrupt Status Mask registers, as described in Table 86. Note that the Interrupt
                               register fields remain valid, even when masked, but the masked interrupts will not cause the Interrupt
                               Request (IRQ) output to be asserted.
                               The Interrupt Request (IRQ) output represents the logical ‘OR’ of all the unmasked interrupts. The
                               Interrupt register fields are latching fields and, once they are set, they are not reset until a ‘1’ is written
                               to the respective register bit(s). The Interrupt Request (IRQ) output is not reset until each of the
                               unmasked interrupts has been reset.
                               De-bouncing of the GPIO inputs can be enabled using the register bits described in Table 78 to Table
                               80. De-bouncing is also available on the Temperature and MICBIAS detection inputs to the Interrupt
                               Controller, in order to avoid false detections - see Table 86 for the associated registers.
                               The Interrupt Request (IRQ) output can be globally masked by setting the IM_IRQ register. Under
                               default conditions, the Interrupt Request (IRQ) is not masked.
                               The Interrupt Request (IRQ) flag may be output on a GPIO pin - see “General Purpose Input/Output”.
                               The WM8994 Interrupt Controller circuit is illustrated in Figure 43. (Note that not all interrupt inputs are
                               shown.) The associated control fields are described in Table 86.

 DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE
                  The WM8994 provides digital audio interfaces for inputting DAC data and outputting ADC or Digital
                  Microphone data. Flexible routing options also allow digital audio to be switched or mixed between
                  interfaces without involving any DAC or ADC.
                  The WM8994 provides two full audio interfaces, AIF1 and AIF2. A third interface, AIF3, is partially
                  supported, using multiplexers to re-configure alternate connections to AIF1 or AIF2.
                  The digital audio interfaces provide flexible connectivity with multiple processors (eg. Applications
                  processor, Baseband processor and Wireless transceiver). A typical configuration is illustrated in
                  Figure 44.

                  Figure 44 Typical AIF Connections
                  In the general case, the digital audio interface uses four pins:
                            ADCDAT: ADC data output
                            DACDAT: DAC data input
                            LRCLK: Left/Right data alignment clock
                            BCLK: Bit clock, for synchronisation
                  In master interface mode, the clock signals BCLK and LRCLK are outputs from the WM8994. In slave
                  mode, these signals are inputs, as illustrated below.
                  As an option, a GPIO pin can be configured as the Left/Right clock for the ADC. In this case, the
                  LRCLK pin is dedicated to the DAC, allowing the ADC and DAC to be clocked independently.
                  Four different audio data formats are supported each digital audio interface:
                            Left justified
                            Right justified
                            I2S
                            DSP mode
                  All four of these modes are MSB first. They are described in the following sections. Refer to the
                  “Signal Timing Requirements” section for timing information.

        Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is available in all four data format modes. On AIF1, the WM8994
        can transmit and receive data on two stereo pairs of timeslots simultaneously. On AIF2, the applicable
        timeslot pair is selectable using register control bits.
        Two variants of DSP mode are supported - ‘Mode A’ and ‘Mode B’. Mono operation can be selected
        on either audio interface in both DSP modes. PCM operation is supported using the DSP mode.
        MASTER AND SLAVE MODE OPERATION
        The WM8994 digital audio interfaces can operate as a master or slave as shown in Figure 45 and
        Figure 46. The associated control bits are described in “Digital Audio Interface Control”.

        OPERATION WITH TDM
        Time division multiplexing (TDM) allows multiple devices to transfer data simultaneously on the same
        bus. The WM8994 ADCs and DACs support TDM in master and slave modes for all data formats and
        word lengths. TDM is enabled and configured using register bits defined in the “Digital Audio Interface
        Control” section.

    Note: The WM8994 is a 24-bit device. If the user operates the WM8994 in 32-bit mode then the 8
    LSBs will be ignored on the receiving side and not driven on the transmitting side. It is therefore
    recommended to add a pull-down resistor if necessary to the DACDAT line and the ADCDAT line in
    TDM mode.
    AUDIO DATA FORMATS (NORMAL MODE)
    The audio data modes supported by the WM8994 are described below. Note that the polarity of the
    BCLK and LRCLK signals can be inverted if required; the following descriptions all assume the
    default, non-inverted polarity of these signals.
    In Right Justified mode, the LSB is available on the last rising edge of BCLK before a LRCLK
    transition. All other bits are transmitted before (MSB first). Depending on word length, BCLK frequency
    and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles after each LRCLK transition.

        In DSP mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A) rising edge
        of BCLK (selectable by AIF_LRCLK_INV) following a rising edge of LRCLK. Right channel data
        immediately follows left channel data. Depending on word length, BCLK frequency and sample rate,
        there may be unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of the right channel data and the next sample.
        In device master mode, the LRCLK output will resemble the frame pulse shown in Figure 53 and
        Figure 54. In device slave mode, Figure 55 and Figure 56, it is possible to use any length of frame
        pulse less than 1/fs, providing the falling edge of the frame pulse occurs greater than one BCLK
        period before the rising edge of the next frame pulse.

    Mono mode operation is available in DSP interface mode. When Mono mode is enabled, the audio
    data is transmitted or received starting on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A) rising edge of BCLK
    following a rising edge of LRCLK.
    PCM operation is supported in DSP interface mode. WM8994 ADC data that is output on the Left
    Channel will be read as mono PCM data by the receiving equipment. Mono PCM data received by the
    WM8994 will be treated as Left Channel data. This data may be routed to the Left/Right DACs using
    the control fields described in the “Digital Mixing” and “Digital Audio Interface Control” sections.

        AUDIO DATA FORMATS (TDM MODE)
        TDM is supported in master and slave modes. All audio interface data formats support time division
        multiplexing (TDM) for ADC and DAC data.
        When more than one pair of ADC or DAC data channels is enabled on AIF1, the WM8994 will transmit
        and receive data in both Slot 0 and Slot 1.
        In the case of AIF2, the ADC or DAT data can be transmitted or received in either timeslot; the
        required timeslot is selected using register control bits when TDM is enabled.
        When TDM is enabled, the ADCDAT pin will be tri-stated immediately before and immediately after
        data transmission, to allow another ADC device to drive this signal line for the remainder of the
        sample period. Note that it is important that two ADC devices do not attempt to drive the data pin
        simultaneously. A short circuit may occur if the transmission time of the two ADC devices overlap with
        each other. See “Audio Interface Timing” for details of the ADCDAT output relative to BCLK signal.
        Note that it is possible to ensure a gap exists between transmissions by setting the transmitted word
        length to a value higher than the actual length of the data. For example, if 32-bit word length is
        selected where only 24-bit data is available, then the WM8994 interface will tri-state after transmission
        of the 24-bit data, ensuring a gap after the WM8994 TDM slot.
        On AIF1, TDM can be used to transmit or receive up to four signal paths. Each enabled signal path is
        transmitted (on ADCDAT) or received (on DACDAT) sequentially. If one or more of the signal paths is
        disabled, then the position of remaining data blocks within the LRCLK frame may differ from those
        illustrated in Figure 57 to Figure 61, as the affected channel(s) will revert to the ‘normal’ (non-TDM)
        format. When the AIF1ADC_TDM register is set, then the ADCDAT1 output is tri-stated when not
        outputting data.
        On AIF2, the TDM format is enabled by register control (AIF2ADC_TDM and AIF2DAC_TDM for the
        output and input paths respectively). When TDM is enabled on AIF2, the data formats shown in Figure
        57 to Figure 61 are always selected, and the WM8994 transmits or receives data in one of the two
        available timeslots; the ADCDAT2 output is tri-stated when not outputting data.
        In all cases, the BCLK frequency must be high enough to allow data from the relevant time slots to be
        transferred. The relative timing of Slot 0 and Slot 1 depends upon the selected data format; the TDM
        timing for four input or output channels is shown in Figure 57 to Figure 61.

                                                                                                      WM8994
 DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE CONTROL
                  This section describes the configuration of the WM8994 digital audio interface paths.
                  Interfaces AIF1 and AIF2 can be configured as Master or Slave, or can be tri-stated. Each input and
                  output signal path can be independently enabled or disabled. AIF output (digital record) and AIF input
                  (digital playback) paths can use a common Left/Right clock, or can use separate clocks for mixed
                  sample rates.
                  Interfaces AIF1 and AIF2 each support flexible formats, word-length, TDM configuration, channel
                  swapping and input path digital boost functions. 8-bit companding modes and digital loopback is also
                  possible.
                  A third interface, AIF3, is partially supported, using multiplexers to re-configure alternate connections
                  to AIF1 or AIF2. Note that AIF3 operates in Master mode only.
                  AIF1 - MASTER / SLAVE AND TRI-STATE CONTROL
                  The Digital Audio Interface AIF1 can operate in Master or Slave modes, selected by AIF1_MSTR. In
                  Master mode, the BCLK1 and LRCLK1 signals are generated by the WM8994 when one or more AIF1
                  channels is enabled.
                  When AIF1_LRCLK_FRC or AIF1_CLK_FRC is set in Master mode, then LRCLK1 and ADCLRCLK1
                  are output at all times, including when none of the AIF1 audio channels is enabled. Note that LRCLK1
                  and ADCLRCLK1 are derived from BCLK1, and either an internal or external BCLK1 signal must also
                  be present to generate LRCLK1 or ADCLRCLK1.
                  When AIF1_CLK_FRC is set in Master mode, then BCLK1 is output at all times, including when none
                  of the AIF1 audio channels is enabled.
                  The AIF1 interface can be tri-stated by setting the AIF1_TRI register. When this bit is set, then all of
                  the AIF1 outputs are un-driven (high-impedance). Note that the ADCLRCLK1/GPIO1 pin is a
                  configurable pin which may take different functions independent of AIF1. The AIF1_TRI register only
                  controls the ADCLRCLK1/GPIO1 pin when its function is set to ADCLRCLK1. See “General Purpose
                  Input/Output” to configure the GPIO1 pin.

    The AIF1 interface supports up to four input channels and up to four output channels. All enabled
    channels are transmitted (on ADCDAT) or received (on DACDAT) sequentially, using time division
    multiplexing (TDM).
    Each of the available channels can be enabled or disabled using the register bits defined in Table 88.

    AIF1 - BCLK AND LRCLK CONTROL
    The BCLK1 frequency is controlled relative to AIF1CLK by the AIF1_BCLK_DIV divider. See “Clocking
    and Sample Rates” for details of the AIF1 clock, AIF1CLK.
    The LRCLK1 frequency is controlled relative to BCLK1 by the AIF1DAC_RATE divider.
    In Master mode, the LRCLK1 output is generated by the WM8994 when any of the AIF1 channels is
    enabled. (Note that, when GPIO1 is configured as ADCLRCLK1, then only the AIF1 DAC channels will
    cause LRCLK1 to be output.)
    In Slave mode, the LRCLK1 output is disabled by default to allow another digital audio interface to
    drive this pin. It is also possible to force the LRCLK1 signal to be output, using the
    AIF1DAC_LRCLK_DIR or AIF1ADC_LRCLK_DIR register bits, allowing mixed master and slave
    modes. (Note that, when GPIO1 is configured as ADCLRCLK1, then only the AIF1DAC_LRCLK_DIR
    bit will force the LRCLK1 signal.)

                                                                                                          WM8994
        When the GPIO1 pin is configured as ADCLRCLK1, then the ADCLRCLK1 frequency is controlled
        relative to BCLK1 by the AIF1ADC_RATE divider. In this case, the ADCLRCLK1 is dedicated to AIF1
        output, and the LRCLK1 pin is dedicated to AIF1 input, allowing different sample rates to be supported
        in the two paths.
        In Master mode, with GPIO1 pin configured as ADCLRCLK1, this output is enabled when any of the
        AIF1 ADC channels is enabled. The ADCLRCLK1 signal can also be enabled in Slave mode, using
        the AIF1ADC_LRCLK_DIR bit, allowing mixed master and slave modes.
        When the GPIO1 pin is not configured as ADCLRCLK1, then the LRCLK1 signal applies to the ADC
        and DAC channels, at a rate set by AIF1DAC_RATE.
        See “General Purpose Input/Output” for the configuration of GPIO1. Note that, in Ultrasonic (4FS)
        mode, the GPIO1 pin must be configured as ADCLRCLK1.
        The BCLK1 output can be inverted using the AIF1_BCLK_INV register bit. The LRCLK1 and
        ADCLRCLK1 output (when selected) can be inverted using the AIF1_LRCLK_INV register control.
        Note that in Slave mode, when BCLK1 is an input, the AIF1_BCLK_INV register selects the polarity of
        the received BCLK1 signal. Under default conditions, DACDAT1 input is captured on the rising edge
        of BCLK1, as illustrated in Figure 5. When AIF1_BCLK_INV = 1, DACDAT1 input is captured on the
        falling edge of BCLK1.

        AIF1 - DIGITAL AUDIO DATA CONTROL
        The register bits controlling the audio data format, word length, left/right channel selection and TDM
        control for AIF1 are described in Table 90.
        In DSP mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A) rising edge
        of BCLK following a rising edge of LRCLK (assuming default BCLK polarity). This is selected using the
        AIF1_LRCLK_INV register bit, as described in Table 89.
        A digital gain function is available at the audio interface input path to boost the DAC volume when a
        small signal is received on DACDAT1. This is controlled using the AIF1DAC_BOOST register. To
        prevent clipping, this function should not be used when the boosted data is expected to be greater
        than 0dBFS.

    AIF1 - MONO MODE
    AIF1 can be configured to operate in mono DSP mode by setting AIF1_MONO = 1 as described in
    Table 91. Note that mono mode is only supported in DSP mode, ie when AIF1_FMT = 11.
    In mono mode, the Left channel data or the Right channel data may be selected for output on
    ADCDAT1. The selected channel is determined by the AIF1ADC1L_ENA and AIF1ADC1R_ENA bits.
    (If both bits are set, then the Right channel data is selected.)
    In mono mode, the DACDAT1 input can be enabled on the Left and/or Right signal paths using the
    AIF1DAC1L_ENA and AIF1DAC1R_ENA bits. The mono input can be enabled on both paths at the
    same time if required.
    In mono mode, the number of BCLK cycles per LRCLK frame must be less than double the AIF1 word
    length. This requires AIF1DAC_RATE to be less than double the value selected by the AIF1_WL
    register. When the GPIO1 pin is configured as ADCLRCLK1, then AIF1ADC_RATE must also be less
    than double the value selected by the AIF1_WL register. See Table 89 for details of the
    AIF1DAC_RATE and AIF1ADC_RATE registers.
    Note that AIF1 TDM mode and AIF1 Mono mode cannot be supported simultaneously.

        The WM8994 supports A-law and -law companding on both transmit (ADC) and receive (DAC) sides
        of AIF1. This is configured using the register bits described in Table 92.

        Table 92 AIF1 Companding
        Companding involves using a piecewise linear approximation of the following equations (as set out by
        ITU-T G.711 standard) for data compression:
        -law (where =255 for the U.S. and Japan):
                   F(x) = ln( 1 + |x|) / ln( 1 + )          } for -1 ≤ x ≤ 1
        A-law (where A=87.6 for Europe):
                   F(x) = A|x| / ( 1 + lnA)                    for x ≤ 1/A
                   F(x) = ( 1 + lnA|x|) / (1 + lnA)            for 1/A ≤ x ≤ 1
        The companded data is also inverted as recommended by the G.711 standard (all 8 bits are inverted
        for -law, all even data bits are inverted for A-law). The data will be transmitted as the first 8 MSBs of
        data.
        Companding converts 13 bits (-law) or 12 bits (A-law) to 8 bits using non-linear quantization. This
        provides greater precision for low amplitude signals than for high amplitude signals, resulting in a
        greater usable dynamic range than 8 bit linear quantization. The companded signal is an 8-bit word
        comprising sign (1 bit), exponent (3 bits) and mantissa (4 bits).
        AIF1 8-bit mode is selected whenever AIF1DAC_COMP=1 or AIF1ADC_COMP=1. The use of 8-bit
        data allows samples to be passed using as few as 8 BCLK1 cycles per LRCLK1 frame. When using
        DSP mode B, 8-bit data words may be transferred consecutively every 8 BCLK1 cycles.
        AIF1 8-bit mode (without Companding) may be enabled by setting AIF1DAC_COMPMODE=1 or
        AIF1ADC_COMPMODE=1, when AIF1DAC_COMP=0 and AIF1ADC_COMP=0.

      AIF1 - LOOPBACK
      The AIF1 interface can provide a Loopback option. When the AIF1_LOOPBACK bit is set, then AIF1
      digital audio output is routed to the AIF1 digital audio input. The normal input (DACDAT1) is not used
      when AIF1 Loopback is enabled.

        AIF2 - MASTER / SLAVE AND TRI-STATE CONTROL
        The Digital Audio Interface AIF2 can operate in Master or Slave modes, selected by AIF2_MSTR. In
        Master mode, the BCLK2 and LRCLK2 signals are generated by the WM8994 when one or more AIF2
        channels is enabled.
        When AIF2_LRCLK_FRC or AIF2_CLK_FRC is set in Master mode, then LRCLK2 and ADCLRCLK2
        are output at all times, including when none of the AIF2 audio channels is enabled. Note that LRCLK2
        and ADCLRCLK2 are derived from BCLK2, and either an internal or external BCLK2 signal must also
        be present to generate LRCLK2 or ADCLRCLK2.
        When AIF2_CLK_FRC is set in Master mode, then BCLK2 is output at all times, including when none
        of the AIF2 audio channels is enabled.
        Note that the AIF2 pins are also GPIO pins, whose function is configurable. These pins must be
        configured as AIF functions when used as audio interface pins. See “General Purpose Input/Output”.
        The AIF2 interface can be tri-stated by setting the AIF2_TRI register. When this bit is set, then all of
        the AIF2 outputs are un-driven (high-impedance). The AIF2_TRI register only affects those pins which
        are configured for AIF2 functions; it does not affect pins which are configured for other functions.

    AIF2 - BCLK AND LRCLK CONTROL
    The BCLK2 frequency is controlled relative to AIF2CLK by the AIF2_BCLK_DIV divider. See “Clocking
    and Sample Rates” for details of the AIF2 clock, AIF2CLK.
    The LRCLK2 frequency is controlled relative to BCLK2 by the AIF2DAC_RATE divider.
    In Master mode, the LRCLK2 output is generated by the WM8994 when any of the AIF2 channels is
    enabled. (Note that, when GPIO6 is configured as ADCLRCLK2, then only the AIF2 DAC channels will
    cause LRCLK2 to be output.)
    In Slave mode, the LRCLK2 output is disabled by default to allow another digital audio interface to
    drive this pin. It is also possible to force the LRCLK2 signal to be output, using the
    AIF2DAC_LRCLK_DIR or AIF2ADC_LRCLK_DIR register bits, allowing mixed master and slave
    modes. (Note that, when GPIO6 is configured as ADCLRCLK2, then only the AIF2DAC_LRCLK_DIR
    bit will force the LRCLK2 signal.)
    When the GPIO6 pin is configured as ADCLRCLK2, then the ADCLRCLK2 frequency is controlled
    relative to BCLK2 by the AIF2ADC_RATE divider. In this case, the ADCLRCLK2 is dedicated to AIF2
    output, and the LRCLK2 pin is dedicated to AIF2 input, allowing different sample rates to be supported
    in the two paths.
    In Master mode, with GPIO6 pin configured as ADCLRCLK2, this output is enabled when any of the
    AIF2 ADC channels is enabled. The ADCLRCLK2 signal can also be enabled in Slave mode, using
    the AIF2ADC_LRCLK_DIR bit, allowing mixed master and slave modes.
    See “General Purpose Input/Output” for the configuration of GPIO6.
    The BCLK2 output can be inverted using the AIF2_BCLK_INV register bit. The LRCLK2 and
    ADCLRCLK2 output (when selected) can be inverted using the AIF2_LRCLK_INV register control.
    Note that in Slave mode, when BCLK2 is an input, the AIF2_BCLK_INV register selects the polarity of
    the received BCLK2 signal. Under default conditions, DACDAT2 input is captured on the rising edge
    of BCLK2, as illustrated in Figure 5. When AIF2_BCLK_INV = 1, DACDAT2 input is captured on the
    falling edge of BCLK2.
    The AIF2 clock generators are controlled as illustrated in Figure 65.

        AIF2 - DIGITAL AUDIO DATA CONTROL
        The register bits controlling the audio data format, word length, left/right channel selection and TDM
        control for AIF2 are described in Table 98.
        When TDM mode is enabled on AIF2, the WM8994 can transmit and receive audio data in Slot 0 or
        Slot 1. In this case, the ADCDAT2 output is tri-stated during the unused timeslot, allowing another
        device to transmit data on the same pin. See “Signal Timing Requirements” for the associated timing
        details. (Note that, when TDM is not enabled on AIF2, the ADCDAT2 output is driven logic ‘0’ during
        the unused timeslot.)
        In DSP mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A) rising edge
        of BCLK following a rising edge of LRCLK (assuming default BCLK polarity). This is selected using the
        AIF2_LRCLK_INV register bit, as described in Table 97.
        A digital gain function is available at the audio interface input path to boost the DAC volume when a
        small signal is received on DACDAT2. This is controlled using the AIF2DAC_BOOST register. To
        prevent clipping, this function should not be used when the boosted data is expected to be greater
        than 0dBFS.

    AIF2 - MONO MODE
    AIF2 can be configured to operate in mono DSP mode by setting AIF2_MONO = 1 as described in
    Table 99. Note that mono mode is only supported in DSP mode, ie when AIF2_FMT = 11.
    In mono mode, the Left channel data or the Right channel data may be selected for output on
    ADCDAT2. The selected channel is determined by the AIF2ADCL_ENA and AIF2ADCR_ENA bits. (If
    both bits are set, then the Right channel data is selected.)
    In mono mode, the DACDAT2 input can be enabled on the Left and/or Right signal paths using the
    AIF2DACL_ENA and AIF2DACR_ENA bits. The mono input can be enabled on both paths at the
    same time if required.
    In mono mode, the number of BCLK cycles per LRCLK frame must be less than double the AIF2 word
    length. This requires AIF2DAC_RATE to be less than double the value selected by the AIF2_WL
    register. When the GPIO6 pin is configured as ADCLRCLK2, then AIF2ADC_RATE must also be less
    than double the value selected by the AIF2_WL register. See Table 89 for details of the
    AIF2DAC_RATE and AIF2ADC_RATE registers.

        AIF2 - COMPANDING
        The WM8994 supports A-law and -law companding on both transmit (ADC) and receive (DAC) sides
        of AIF2. This is configured using the register bits described in Table 100.

      AUDIO INTERFACE AIF3 CONFIGURATION
      The WM8994 provides two full audio interfaces, AIF1 and AIF2. A third interface, AIF3, is partially
      supported, using multiplexers to re-configure alternate connections to AIF1 or AIF2. The relevant
      multiplexers are illustrated in Figure 66.
      Note that, in addition to providing alternate input / output pins to the audio interfaces AIF1 and AIF2,
      the multiplexers also provide the capability to link AIF3 pins directly to AIF2 pins, without involving the
      AIF2 interface processing resource.
      All of the AIF3 connections are supported on pins which also provide GPIO functions. These pins
      must be configured as AIF functions when used as audio interface pins. See “General Purpose
      Input/Output”.

      The GPIO8 pin also supports the DACDAT3 function. When configured as DACDAT3, this pin may be
      used as an alternate data input pin to AIF1 or AIF2. The data input source for AIF1 is selected using
      the AIF1_DACDAT_SRC register. The data input source for AIF2 is selected using the
      AIF2_DACDAT_SRC register.
      The GPIO8 pin is configured as DACDAT3 by setting GP8_FN = 00h. Note that it is also necessary to
      set GP3_FN = 00h and GP5_FN = 00h when using the DACDAT3 function on the GPIO8 pin.
      The GPIO9 pin also supports the ADCDAT3 function. When configured as ADCDAT3, this pin may be
      used as an alternate data output pin to AIF1 or AIF2. It is also possible to route the DACDAT2 input
      pin to the ADCDAT3 output. The ADCDAT3 source is selected using the AIF3_ADCDAT_SRC
      register.
      The DACDAT3 input pin referenced above may also be routed to the ADCDAT2 output. The
      ADCDAT2 source is selected using the AIF2_ADCDAT_SRC register.
      The GPIO10 pin also supports the LRCLK3 function. When configured as LRCLK3, this pin outputs
      the DACLRCLK signal from AIF1 or AIF2. The applicable AIF source is determined automatically as
      defined in Table 102. Note that the LRCLK3 signal is also controlled by the logic illustrated in Figure
      62 (AIF1) or Figure 65 (AIF2), depending on the selected AIF source.

        AIF3 interface can be tri-stated by setting the AIF3_TRI register. When this bit is set, then all of the

    DIGITAL PULL-UP AND PULL-DOWN
    The WM8994 provides integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors on each of the DACDAT1, LRCLK1
    and BCLK1 pins. This provides a flexible capability for interfacing with other devices.
    Each of the pull-up and pull-down resistors can be configured independently using the register bits
    described in Table 104. Note that if the Pull-up and Pull-down are both enabled for any pin, then the
    pull-up and pull-down will be disabled.

                                                                                                   WM8994
 CLOCKING AND SAMPLE RATES
                The WM8994 requires a clock for each of the Digital Audio Interfaces (AIF1 and AIF2). These may be
                derived from a common clock reference, or from independent references. Under typical clocking
                configurations, many commonly-used audio sample rates can be derived directly from the external
                reference; for additional flexibility, the WM8994 incorporates two Frequency Locked Loop (FLL)
                circuits to perform frequency conversion and filtering.
                External clock signals may be connected via MCLK1 and MCLK2. (Note that MCLK2 is an alternate
                function of the GPIO2 pin.) In AIF Slave modes, the BCLK or LRCLK signals may be used as a
                reference for the AIF clocks.
                The WM8994 performs stereo full-duplex sample rate conversion between the audio interfaces AIF1
                and AIF2, enabling digital audio to be routed between the interfaces, and asynchronous audio data to
                be mixed together. See “Sample Rate Conversion” for further details.
                In AIF Slave modes, it is important to ensure the applicable AIF clock (AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK) is
                synchronised with the associated external LRCLK. This can be achieved by selecting an MCLK input
                that is derived from the same reference as the LRCLK, or can be achieved by selecting the external
                BCLK or LRCLK signals as a reference input to one of the FLLs, as a source for the AIF clock.
                If the AIF clock is not synchronised with the LRCLK, then clicks arising from dropped or repeated
                audio samples will occur, due to the inherent tolerances of multiple, asynchronous, system clocks.
                See “Applications Information” for further details on valid clocking configurations.
                Clocking for the Audio Interfaces is provided by AIF1CLK and AIF2CLK for AIF1 and AIF2
                respectively. An additional internal clock, SYSCLK is derived from either AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK in
                order to support the DSP core functions, Charge Pump, Class D switching amplifier, DC servo control,
                Control Write Sequencer and other internal functions.
                The following operating limits must be observed when configuring the WM8994 clocks. Failure to
                observe these limits will result in degraded performance and/or incorrect system functionality. Latency
                in the WM8994 signal paths is reduced at high SYSCLK frequencies; power consumption is reduced
                at low SYSCLK frequencies.
                           SYSCLK  12.5MHz
                           SYSCLK  4.096MHz
                           SYSCLK  256 x fs (where fs = fastest audio sample rate in use)
                           AIF1CLK  12.5MHz
                           AIF1CLK  256 x AIF1 sample rate (AIF1_SR)
                           AIF2CLK  12.5MHz
                           AIF2CLK  256 x AIF2 sample rate (AIF2_SR)
                Note that, if DAC_OSR128 = 0 and ADC_OSR128 = 0, then a slower SYSCLK frequency is possible;
                in this case, the requirement is SYSCLK  2.048MHz.
                Note that, under specific operating conditions, clocking ratios of 128 x fs and 192 x fs are possible;
                this is described in the “Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)” section.
                The SYSCLK frequency must be  256 x fs, (where fs is the faster rate of AIF1_SR or AIF2_SR). The
                SYSCLK frequency is derived from AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK, as selected by the SYSCLK_SRC register
                (see Table 109).
                Note that the bandwidth of the digital audio mixing paths will be determined by the sample rate of
                whichever AIF is selected as the SYSCLK source. When using only one audio interface, the active
                interface should be selected as the SYSCLK source. For best audio performance when using AIF1
                and AIF2 simultaneously, the SYSCLK source must select the AIF with the highest sample rate
                (AIFn_SR).

                            The AIFnCLK / fs ratio is the ratio of AIFnCLK to the AIFn sample rate, where ‘n’ identifies the
                            applicable audio interface AIF1 or AIF2. The AIF clocking ratio and sample rate are set by the
                            AIFnCLK_RATE and AIFn_SR register fields, defined in Table 106 and Table 108.
                            Note that, in the case of mixed input/output path sample rates on either interface, then
                            AIFnCLK_RATE and AIFn_SR are set according to the higher of the two sample rates.
                            The clocking configuration for AIF1CLK, AIF2CLK and SYSCLK is illustrated in Figure 67.
                            The WM8994 provides integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors on the MCLK1 pin. This provides a
                            flexible capability for interfacing with other devices. This is configured as described in Table 109. Note
                            that if MCLK1_PU and MCLK1_PD are both set, then the pull-up and pull-down will be disabled.

                            The AIF1CLK_SRC register is used to select the AIF1CLK source. The source may be MCLK1,
                            MCLK2, FLL1 or FLL2. If either of the Frequency Locked Loops is selected as the source, then the
                            FLL(s) must be enabled and configured as described later.
                            The AIF1CLK clock may be adjusted by the AIF1CLK_DIV divider, which provides a divide-by-two
                            option. The selected source may also be inverted by setting the AIF1CLK_INV bit.
                            The maximum AIF1CLK frequency is specified in the “Electrical Characteristics” section. Note that,
                            when AIF1CLK_DIV = 1, the maximum frequency limit applies to the divided-down AIF1CLK
                            frequency.
                            The AIF1CLK is enabled by the register bit AIF1CLK_ENA. This bit should be set to 0 when
                            reconfiguring the clock sources. It is not recommended to change AIF1CLK_SRC while the
                            AIF1CLK_ENA bit is set.

        AIF1 CLOCKING CONFIGURATION
        The WM8994 supports a wide range of standard audio sample rates from 8kHz to 96kHz. The AIF1
        clocking configuration is selected using 4 control fields, which are set according to the required AIF
        digital audio sample rate, and the ADC/DAC clocking rate.
        The AIF1_SR register is set according to the AIF1 sample rate. Note that 88.2kHz and 96kHz modes
        are supported for AIF1 input (DAC playback) only.
        The AIF1CLK_RATE register is set according to the ratio of AIF1CLK to the AIF1 sample rate. Note
        that there a some restrictions on the supported clocking ratios, depending on the selected sample rate
        and operating conditions. The supported configurations are detailed in the “Digital Microphone
        Interface”, “Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC)” and “Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)” sections,
        according to each applicable function.
        The audio interface can support different sample rates for the input data (DAC path) and output data
        (ADC path) simultaneously. In this case, the AIF1_SR and AIF1CLK_RATE fields should be set
        according to the faster of the two sample rates.
        When different sample rates are used for input data (DAC path) and output data (ADC path), the
        clocking of the slower path is set using AIF1DAC_DIV (if the AIF input path has the slower sample
        rate) or AIF1ADC_DIV (if the AIF output path has the slower sample rate). The appropriate divider is
        set according to the ratio of the two sample rates.
        For example, if AIF1 input uses 48kHz sample rate, and AIF1 output uses 8kHz, then AIF1ADC_DIV
        should be set to 110b (divide by 6).
        Note that the audio interface cannot support every possible combination of input and output sample
        rate simultaneously, but only where the ratio of the sample rates matches the available AIF1ADC_DIV
        or AIF1DAC_DIV divider settings.
        Note that the WM8994 performs sample rate conversion, where necessary, to provide digital mixing
        and interconnectivity between the Audio Interfaces and the DSP Core functions. One stereo Sample
        Rate Converter (SRC) is provided for audio input; a second stereo SRC is provided for audio output.
        Each SRC is automatically configured on AIF1 or AIF2, depending on the selected Clocking and
        Sample Rate settings. The WM8994 cannot support configurations that would require SRC on the
        input or output paths of both interfaces simultaneously. See “Sample Rate Conversion” for further
        details.

        AIF2CLK ENABLE
        The AIF2CLK_SRC register is used to select the AIF2CLK source. The source may be MCLK1,
        MCLK2, FLL1 or FLL2. If either of the Frequency Locked Loops is selected as the source, then the
        FLL(s) must be enabled and configured as described later.
        The AIF2CLK clock may be adjusted by the AIF2CLK_DIV divider, which provides a divide-by-two
        option. The selected source may also be inverted by setting the AIF2CLK_INV bit.
        The maximum AIF2CLK frequency is specified in the “Electrical Characteristics” section. Note that,
        when AIF2CLK_DIV = 1, the maximum frequency limit applies to the divided-down AIF2CLK
        frequency.
        The AIF2CLK is enabled by the register bit AIF2CLK_ENA. This bit should be set to 0 when
        reconfiguring the clock sources. It is not recommended to change AIF2CLK_SRC while the
        AIF2CLK_ENA bit is set.

        AIF2 CLOCKING CONFIGURATION
        The WM8994 supports a wide range of standard audio sample rates from 8kHz to 96kHz. The AIF2
        clocking configuration is selected using 4 control fields, which are set according to the required AIF
        digital audio sample rate, and the ADC/DAC clocking rate.
        The AIF2_SR register is set according to the AIF2 sample rate. Note that 88.2kHz and 96kHz modes
        are supported for AIF2 input (DAC playback) only.
        The AIF2CLK_RATE register is set according to the ratio of AIF2CLK to the AIF2 sample rate. Note
        that there a some restrictions on the supported clocking ratios, depending on the selected sample rate
        and operating conditions. The supported configurations are detailed in the “Digital Microphone
        Interface”, “Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC)” and “Digital to Analogue Converter (DAC)” sections,
        according to each applicable function.
        The audio interface can support different sample rates for the input data (DAC path) and output data
        (ADC path) simultaneously. In this case, the AIF2_SR and AIF2CLK_RATE fields should be set
        according to the faster of the two sample rates.
        When different sample rates are used for input data (DAC path) and output data (ADC path), the
        clocking of the slower path is set using AIF2DAC_DIV (if the AIF input path has the slower sample
        rate) or AIF2ADC_DIV (if the AIF output path has the slower sample rate). The appropriate divider is
        set according to the ratio of the two sample rates.
        For example, if AIF2 input uses 48kHz sample rate, and AIF2 output uses 8kHz, then AIF2ADC_DIV
        should be set to 110b (divide by 6).

        Table 108 AIF2 Clocking Configuration
        MISCELLANEOUS CLOCK CONTROLS
        SYSCLK provides clocking for many of the WM8994 functions. SYSCLK clock is required to support
        DSP Core functions and also the Charge Pump, Class D switching amplifier, DC servo control,
        Control Write Sequencer and other internal functions.
        The SYSCLK_SRC register is used to select the SYSCLK source. The source may be AIF1CLK or
        AIF2CLK. Note that the bandwidth of the digital audio mixing paths will be determined by the sample
        rate of whichever AIF is selected as the SYSCLK source. When using only one audio interface, the
        active interface should be selected as the SYSCLK source. For best audio performance when using
        AIF1 and AIF2 simultaneously, the SYSCLK source must select the AIF with the highest sample rate
        (AIFn_SR).
        The AIF1 DSP processing clock is derived from SYSCLK, and enabled by AIF1DSPCLK_ENA.
        The AIF2 DSP processing clock is derived from SYSCLK, and enabled by AIF2DSPCLK_ENA.
        The clocking of the WM8994 ADC, DAC, digital mixer and digital microphone functions is enabled by
        setting SYSDSPCLK_ENA. See “Digital Microphone Interface” for details of the DMICCLK frequency.
        Two modes of ADC / Digital Microphone operation can be selected using the ADC_OSR128 bit. This
        bit is enabled by default, giving best audio performance. De-selecting this bit provides a low power
        alternative setting.
        A high performance mode of DAC operation can be selected by setting the DAC_OSR128 bit. When
        the DAC_OSR128 bit is set, the audio performance is improved, but power consumption is also
        increased.
        A clock is required for the Charge Pump circuit when the ground-referenced headphone outputs
        (HPOUT1L and HPOUT1R) are enabled. The Charge Pump clock is derived from SYSCLK whenever
        the Charge Pump is enabled. The Charge Pump clock division is configured automatically.
        A clock is required for the Class D speaker driver circuit when the speaker outputs (SPKOUTL and
        SPKOUTR) are enabled. The Class D clock is derived from SYSCLK whenever these outputs are
        enabled in Class D mode. The Class D clock division is configured automatically. See “Analogue
        Outputs” for details of the Class D switching frequency.
        A clock output (OPCLK) derived from SYSCLK may be output on a GPIO pin. This clock is enabled by
        register big OPCLK_ENA, and its frequency of this clock is controlled by OPCLK_DIV. See General
        Purpose Input/Output” to configure a GPIO pin for this function.
        A slow clock (TOCLK) is derived internally in order to control volume update timeouts when the zero-
        cross option is selected. This clock is enabled by register bit TOCLK_ENA, and its frequency is
        controlled by TOCLK_DIV.
        A de-bounce control is provided for GPIO inputs and for other functions that may be selected as GPIO
        outputs. The de-bounced clock frequency is controlled by DBCLK_DIV.

    The WM8994 generates a 256kHz clock for internal functions; TOCLK and DBCLK are derived from
    this 256kHz clock. In order to generate this clock correctly when SYSCLK_SRC = 0, valid settings are
    required for AIF1_SR and AIF1CLK_RATE. To generate this clock correctly when SYSCLK_SRC = 1,
    valid settings are required for AIF2_SR and AIF2CLK_RATE.
    The WM8994 Clocking is illustrated in Figure 68.

    BCLK AND LRCLK CONTROL
    The digital audio interfaces (AIF1 and AIF2) use BCLK and LRCLK signals for synchronisation. In
    master mode, these are output signals, generated by the WM8994. In slave mode, these are input
    signals to the WM8994. It is also possible to support mixed master/slave operation.
    The BCLK and LRCLK signals are controlled as illustrated in Figure 69. See the “Digital Audio
    Interface Control” section for further details of the relevant control registers.

                            CONTROL INTERFACE CLOCKING
                            Register map access is possible with or without a system clock. Clocking is provided from SYSCLK;
                            the SYSCLK_SRC register selects either AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK as the applicable SYSCLK source.
                            When AIF1CLK is the SYSCLK source (ie. SYSCLK_SRC = 0), and AIF1CLK_ENA = 1, then an
                            active clock source for AIF1CLK must be present for control interface clocking. If the AIF1CLK source
                            is stopped, then AIF1CLK_ENA must be set to 0 for control register access.
                            When AIF2CLK is the SYSCLK source (ie. SYSCLK_SRC = 1), and AIF2CLK_ENA = 1, then an
                            active clock source for AIF2CLK must be present for control interface clocking. If the AIF2CLK source
                            is stopped, then AIF2CLK_ENA must be set to 0 for control register access.
                            FREQUENCY LOCKED LOOP (FLL)
                            Two integrated FLLs are provided to support the clocking requirements of the WM8994. These can be
                            enabled and configured independently according to the available reference clocks and the application
                            requirements. The reference clock may be a high frequency (eg. 12.288MHz) or low frequency (eg.
                            32.768kHz).
                            The FLL is tolerant of jitter and may be used to generate a stable AIF clock from a less stable input
                            reference. The FLL characteristics are summarised in “Electrical Characteristics”. Note that the FLL
                            can be used to generate a free-running clock in the absence of an external reference source. This is
                            described in the “Free-Running FLL Clock” section below.
                            The input reference for FLL1 is selected using FLL1_REFCLK_SRC. The available options are
                            MCLK1, MCLK2, BCLK1 or LRCLK1. The input reference for FLL2 is selected using
                            FLL2_REFCLK_SRC. The available options are MCLK1, MCLK2, BCLK2 or LRCLK2. The FLL input
                            reference configuration is illustrated in Figure 70.

    The FLL is enabled using the FLLn_ENA register bit (where n = 1 for FLL1 and n = 2 for FLL2). Note
    that the other FLL registers should be configured before enabling the FLL; the FLLn_ENA register bit
    should be set as the final step of the FLLn enable sequence.
    When changing FLL settings, it is recommended that the digital circuit be disabled via FLLn_ENA and
    then re-enabled after the other register settings have been updated. When changing the input
    reference frequency FREF, it is recommended that the FLL be reset by setting FLLn_ENA to 0.
    Note that, for normal operation of the FLLs, the reference voltage VMID and the bias current must
    also be enabled. See “Reference Voltages and Master Bias” for details of the associated controls
    VMID_SEL and BIAS_ENA.
    The field FLLn_REFCLK_DIV provides the option to divide the input reference (MCLK, BCLK or
    LRCLK) by 1, 2, 4 or 8. This field should be set to bring the reference down to 13.5MHz or below. For
    best performance, it is recommended that the highest possible frequency - within the 13.5MHz limit -
    should be selected.
    The FLL output frequency is directly determined from FLLn_FRATIO, FLLn_OUTDIV and the real
    number represented by N.K. The integer portion, N, is held in the FLLn_N register field (LSB = 1); the
    fractional portion of N.K is held in the FLLn_K register field (MSB = 0.5).
    The FLL output frequency is generated according to the following equation:
                FOUT = (FVCO / FLLn_OUTDIV)
    The FLL operating frequency, FVCO is set according to the following equation:
                FVCO = (FREF x N.K x FLLn_FRATIO)
    FREF is the input frequency, as determined by FLLn_REFCLK_DIV.
    FVCO must be in the range 90-100 MHz. Frequencies outside this range cannot be supported.
    Note that the output frequencies that do not lie within the ranges quoted above cannot be guaranteed
    across the full range of device operating conditions.
    In order to follow the above requirements for FVCO, the value of FLLn_OUTDIV should be selected
    according to the desired output FOUT. The divider, FLLn_OUTDIV, must be set so that FVCO is in the
    range 90-100MHz. The available divisions are integers from 4 to 64. Some typical settings of
    FLLn_OUTDIV are noted in Table 110.

        The value of FLLn_FRATIO should be selected as described in Table 111.

        In order to determine the remaining FLL parameters, the FLL operating frequency, FVCO, must be
        calculated, as given by the following equation:
                    FVCO = (FOUT x FLLn_OUTDIV)
        The value of FLLn_N and FLLn_K can then be determined as follows:
                    N.K = FVCO / (FLLn_FRATIO x FREF)
        Note that FREF is the input frequency, after division by FLLn_REFCLK_DIV, where applicable.
        In FLL Fractional Mode, the fractional portion of the N.K multiplier is held in the FLLn_K register field.
        This field is coded as a fixed point quantity, where the MSB has a weighting of 0.5. Note that, if
        desired, the value of this field may be calculated by multiplying K by 216 and treating FLLn_K as an
        integer value, as illustrated in the following example:
                    If N.K = 8.192, then K = 0.192
                    Multiplying K by 216 gives 0.192 x 65536 = 12582.912 (decimal)
                    Apply rounding to the nearest integer = 12583 (decimal) = 3127 (hex)
        Note that, if the required fraction cannot be represented exactly in the FLL_K register, and a rounding
        error is introduced, then a corresponding offset will exist in the FLL output frequency. In a typical
        application, the frequency difference will be negligible. However, if the FLL is used to generate
        AIFnCLK in AIF Slave Mode, then the rounding error may result in clicks arising from dropped or
        repeated audio samples.
        The FLL1 control registers are described in Table 112. The FLL2 control registers are described in
        Table 113. Example settings for a variety of reference frequencies and output frequencies are shown
        in Table 115.

    FREE-RUNNING FLL CLOCK
    The FLL can generate a clock signal even when no external reference is available. However, it should
    be noted that the accuracy of this clock is reduced, and a reference source should always be used
    where possible. Note that, in free-running modes, the FLL is not sufficiently accurate for hi-fi ADC or
    DAC applications. However, the free-running modes are suitable for clocking most other functions,
    including the Write Sequencer, Charge Pump, DC Servo and Class D loudspeaker driver.
    If an accurate reference clock is initially available, then the FLL should be configured as described
    above. The FLL will continue to generate a stable output clock after the reference input is stopped or
    disconnected.
    If no reference clock is available at the time of starting up the FLL, then an internal clock frequency of
    approximately 12MHz can be generated by implementing the following sequence:
                    Enable the FLL Analogue Oscillator (FLLn_OSC_ENA = 1)
                    Set the FOUT clock divider to divide by 8 (FLLn_OUTDIV = 000111)
                    Configure the oscillator frequency by setting FLLn_FRC_NCO = 1 and
                     FLLn_FRC_NCO_VAL = 19h
    Note that the free-running FLL mode is not suitable for hi-fi CODEC applications. In the absence of
    any reference clock, the FLL output is subject to a very wide tolerance; see “Electrical Characteristics”
    for details of the FLL accuracy.
    Note that the free-running FLL clock is selected as SYSCLK using the registers noted in Figure 67.
    The free-running FLL clock may be used to support analogue functions, for which the digital audio
    interface is not used, and there is no applicable Sample Rate (fs). When SYSCLK is required for
    circuits such the Class D, DC Servo, Control Write Sequencer or Charge Pump, then valid Sample
    Rate register settings are still required, even though the digital audio interface is not active.
    For correct functionality when SYSCLK_SRC = 0, valid settings are required for AIF1_SR and
    AIF1CLK_RATE. In the case where SYSCLK_SRC = 1, then valid settings are required for AIF2_SR
    and AIF2CLK_RATE.
    The control registers applicable to FLL free-running modes are described in Table 114.

        GPIO OUTPUTS FROM FLL
        For each FLL, the WM8994 has an internal signal which indicates whether the FLL Lock has been
        achieved. The FLL Lock status is an input to the Interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an
        Interrupt event - see “Interrupts”.
        The FLL Lock signal can be output directly on a GPIO pin as an external indication of FLL Lock. See
        “General Purpose Input/Output” for details of how to configure a GPIO pin to output the FLL Lock
        signal.
        The FLL Clock can be output directly on a GPIO pin as a clock signal for other circuits. Note that the
        FLL Clock may be output even if the FLL is not selected as the WM8994 SYSCLK source. The FLL
        clocking configuration is illustrated in Figure 70. See “General Purpose Input/Output” for details of how
        to configure a GPIO pin to output the FLL Clock.
        EXAMPLE FLL CALCULATION
        The following example illustrates how to derive the FLL1 registers to generate 12.288 MHz output
        (FOUT) from a 12.000 MHz reference clock (FREF):
                  Set FLL1_REFCLK_DIV in order to generate FREF <=13.5MHz:
                   FLL1_REFCLK_DIV = 00 (divide by 1)
                  Set FLL1_OUTDIV for the required output frequency as shown in Table 110:-
                   FOUT = 12.288 MHz, therefore FLL1_OUTDIV = 7h (divide by 8)
                  Set FLL1_FRATIO for the given reference frequency as shown in Table 111:
                   FREF = 12MHz, therefore FLL1_FRATIO = 0h (divide by 1)
                  Calculate FVCO as given by FVCO = FOUT x FLL1_OUTDIV:-
                   FVCO = 12.288 x 8 = 98.304MHz
                  Calculate N.K as given by N.K = FVCO / (FLL1_FRATIO x FREF):
                   N.K = 98.304 / (1 x 12) = 8.192
                  Determine FLL1_N and FLL1_K from the integer and fractional portions of N.K:-
                   FLL1_N is 8. FLL1_K is 0.192
                  Convert FLL1_K into integer format:
                   0.192 x 65536 = 12582.912 (decimal).
                  Round off to 12583 (decimal) and convert to hex:
                   12583 (decimal) = 3127 (hex).
                   FLL1_K = 3127h

                                                                                                  WM8994
 SAMPLE RATE CONVERSION
                The WM8994 supports two main digital audio interfaces, AIF1 and AIF2. These interfaces are
                configured independently and may operate entirely asynchronously to each other. The WM8994
                performs stereo full-duplex sample rate conversion between the audio interfaces, allowing digital
                audio to be routed between the interfaces, and allowing asynchronous audio data to be mixed
                together.
                The Sample Rate Converters (SRCs) are configured automatically within the WM8994, and no user
                settings are required. The SRCs are enabled automatically when required and are disabled at other
                times. Synchronisation between the audio interfaces is not instantaneous when the clocking or sample
                rate configurations are updated; the lock status of the SRCs is signalled via the GPIO or Interrupt
                circuits, as described in “General Purpose Input/Output” and “Interrupts”.
                Separate clocks can be used for AIF1 and AIF2, allowing asynchronous operation on these interfaces.
                The digital mixing core is clocked by SYSCLK, which is linked to either AIF1CLK or AIF2CLK, as
                described in “Clocking and Sample Rates”. The digital mixing core is, therefore, always synchronised
                to AIF1, or to AIF2, or to both interfaces at once.
                SAMPLE RATE CONVERTER 1 (SRC1)
                SRC1 performs sample rate conversion of digital audio data input to the WM8994. Sample Rate
                Conversion is required when digital audio data is received on an audio interface that is not
                synchronised to the digital mixing core.
                SRC1 is automatically configured on AIF1 or AIF2, depending on the selected Clocking and Sample
                Rate configuration. Note that SRC1 cannot convert input data on AIF1 and AIF2 simultaneously.
                Sample Rate conversion on AIF1 is only supported on TDM Timeslot 0.
                The SRC1 Lock status indicates when audio data can be received on the interface channel that is not
                synchronised to the digital mixing core. No audio will be present on this signal path until SRC1 Lock is
                achieved.
                SAMPLE RATE CONVERTER 2 (SRC2)
                SRC2 performs sample rate conversion of digital audio data output from the WM8994. Sample Rate
                Conversion is required when digital audio data is transmitted on an audio interface that is not
                synchronised to the digital mixing core.
                SRC2 is automatically configured on AIF1 or AIF2, depending on the selected Clocking and Sample
                Rate configuration. Note that SRC2 cannot convert output data on AIF1 and AIF2 simultaneously.
                Sample Rate conversion on AIF1 is only supported on TDM Timeslot 0.
                The SRC2 Lock status indicates when audio data can be transmitted on the interface channel that is
                not synchronised to the digital mixing core. No audio will be present on this signal path until SRC2
                Lock is achieved.
                SAMPLE RATE CONVERTER RESTRICTIONS
                The following restrictions apply to the configuration of the WM8994 Sample Rate Converters.
                No SRC on AIF1 Timeslot 1. Sample Rate Conversion on audio interface AIF1 is not supported on
                the TDM Timeslot 1. Therefore, it is not possible to route digital audio between AIF1 Timeslot 1 and
                AIF2, or to mix together audio from these interface paths. Note that this only applies when the SRC is
                applied to AIF1.
                Maximum of three sample rates in the system. The audio sample rate of AIF1 input and AIF1
                output may be different to each other. The audio sample rate of AIF2 input and AIF2 output may be
                different to each other. However, it is not possible to have four different sample rates operating
                simultaneously, as this would require sample rate conversion in too many paths. A maximum of three
                different sample rates can be supported in the system.
                No SRC capability when using 88.2kHz or 96kHz AIF input (DAC playback). If either interface is
                configured for 88.2kHz or 96kHz sample rate, then the digital mixing core must also be configured for
Rev 4.5                                                                                                            209

    this sample rate. Sample Rate Conversion cannot be supported in this mode, therefore AIF output is
    not supported at any sample rate under these conditions.
    Restricted Sample Rate options when AIF1 and AIF2 are synchronised. When the same clock
    source is used for AIF1CLK and AIF2CLK, and mixed sample rates are selected on both interfaces,
    then the DAC sample rate of one interface must be the same as the ADC sample rate of the other.
             If AIF1CLK_SRC = AIF2CLK_SRC
             And AIF1DAC_DIV ≠ AIF1ADC_DIV
             And AIF2DAC_DIV ≠ AIF2ADC_DIV
             Then the DAC sample rate of one interface must be the same as the ADC sample rate of
              the other.
    Restricted Sample Rate options when AIF1 and AIF2 are not synchronised. When a different
    clock source is used for AIF1CLK and AIF2CLK, then the AIF to which the SYSCLK is synchronised
    cannot be mixed sample rates.
             If AIF1CLK_SRC ≠ AIF2CLK_SRC
             And SYSCLK_SRC =0
             Then AIF1DAC_DIV and AIF1ADC_DIV must be set to 000
             If AIF1CLK_SRC ≠ AIF2CLK_SRC
             And SYSCLK_SRC =1

 CONTROL INTERFACE
                The WM8994 is controlled by writing to its control registers. Readback is available for all registers.
                The Control Interface can operate as either a 2-, 3- or 4-wire interface:
                     2-wire (I2C) mode uses pins SCLK and SDA
                     3-wire (SPI) mode uses pins CS¯¯ /ADDR, SCLK and SDA
                     4-wire (SPI) mode uses pins CS¯¯ /ADDR, SCLK, SDA and SDOUT
                Readback is provided on the bi-directional pin SDA in 2-/3-wire modes. In 4-wire mode, the SDOUT
                function must be enabled on one of the GPIO pins (see “General Purpose Input/Output”).
                The WM8994 uses 15-bit register addresses and 16-bit data in all Control Interface modes.
                Note that the Control Interface function can be supported with or without system clocking. Where
                possible, the register map access is synchronised with SYSCLK in order to ensure predictable
                operation of cross-domain functions. See “Clocking and Sample Rates” for further details of Control
                Interface clocking.
                SELECTION OF CONTROL INTERFACE MODE
                The WM8994 Control Interface Mode is determined by the logic level on the CIFMODE pin, as shown
                in Table 117. An internal pull-down resistor is enabled by default on the CIFMODE pin; this can be
                configured using the CIFMODE_PD register bit described in Table 118.
                          CIFMODE                   INTERFACE FORMAT
                             Low                       2 wire (I2C) Mode
                             High                  3- or 4- wire (SPI) Modes
                Table 117 Control Interface Mode Selection
                In 2-wire (I2C) Control Interface mode, Auto-Increment mode may be selected. This enables multiple
                write and multiple read operations to be scheduled faster than is possible with single register
                operations. The auto-increment option is enabled when the AUTO_INC register bit is set. This bit is
                defined in Table 118. Auto-increment is enabled by default.
                In SPI modes, 3-wire or 4-wire operation may be selected using the SPI_4WIRE register bit.
                In SPI modes, the Continuous Read mode may be selected using the SPI_CONTRD bit. This enables
                multiple register read operations to be scheduled faster than is possible with single register
                operations. When SPI_CONTRD is set, the WM8994 will readback from incremental register
                addresses as long as CS¯¯ is held low and SCLK is toggled.
                In 3-wire (SPI) mode, register readback is provided using the bi-directional pin SDA. During data
                output, the SDA pin can be configured as CMOS or Open Drain, using the SPI_CFG register bit.
                In 4-wire (SPI) mode, register readback is provided using SDOUT. The SDOUT pin may be configured
                as CMOS or as ‘Wired OR’ using the SPI_CFG bit. In CMOS mode, SDOUT is driven low when not
                outputting register data. In ‘Wired OR’ mode, SDOUT is undriven (high impedance) when not
                outputting register data bits.
                The Control Interface configuration bits are described in Table 118.

        Table 118 Control Interface Configuration
        2-WIRE (I2C) CONTROL MODE
        In 2-wire (I2C) mode, the WM8994 is a slave device on the control interface; SCLK is a clock input,
        while SDAT is a bi-directional data pin. To allow arbitration of multiple slaves (and/or multiple masters)
        on the same interface, the WM8994 transmits logic 1 by tri-stating the SDAT pin, rather than pulling it
        high. An external pull-up resistor is required to pull the SDAT line high so that the logic 1 can be
        recognised by the master.
        In order to allow many devices to share a single 2-wire control bus, every device on the bus has a
        unique 8-bit device ID (this is not the same as the address of each register in the WM8994). The
        device ID is selectable on the WM8994, using the CS      ¯¯ /ADDR pin as shown in Table 119. The LSB of
        the Device ID is the Read/Write bit; this bit is set to logic 1 for “Read” and logic 0 for “Write”.
        An internal pull-down resistor is enabled by default on the CS   ¯¯ /ADDR pin; this can be configured using
        the CSNADDR_PD register bit described in Table 118.

        Table 119 Control Interface Device ID Selection
        The WM8994 operates as a slave device only. The controller indicates the start of data transfer with a
        high to low transition on SDAT while SCLK remains high. This indicates that a device ID, register
        address and data will follow. The WM8994 responds to the start condition and shifts in the next eight
        bits on SDAT (8-bit device ID, including Read/Write bit, MSB first). If the device ID received matches
        the device ID of the WM8994, then the WM8994 responds by pulling SDAT low on the next clock
        pulse (ACK). If the device ID is not recognised or the R/W bit is set incorrectly, the WM8994 returns to
        the idle condition and waits for a new start condition and valid address.

                                       If the device ID matches the device ID of the WM8994, the data transfer continues as described
                                       below. The controller indicates the end of data transfer with a low to high transition on SDAT while
                                       SCLK remains high. After receiving a complete address and data sequence the WM8994 returns to
                                       the idle state and waits for another start condition. If a start or stop condition is detected out of
                                       sequence at any point during data transfer (i.e. SDAT changes while SCLK is high), the device returns
                                       to the idle condition.
                                       The WM8994 supports the following read and write operations:
                                                      Single write
                                                      Single read
                                                      Multiple write using auto-increment
                                                      Multiple read using auto-increment
                                       The sequence of signals associated with a single register write operation is illustrated in Figure 72.

                                       The Control Interface also supports other register operations, as listed above. The interface protocol
                                       for these operations is summarised below. The terminology used in the following figures is detailed in
                                       Table 120.
                                       Note that, for multiple write and multiple read operations, the auto-increment option must be enabled.
                                       This feature is enabled by default, as noted in Table 118.

 Figure 78 Multiple Register Read from Last Address using Auto-increment
                             Multiple Write and Multiple Read operations enable the host processor to access sequential blocks of
                             the data in the WM8994 register map faster than is possible with single register operations. The auto-
                             increment option is enabled when the AUTO_INC register bit is set. This bit is defined in Table 118.
                             Auto-increment is enabled by default.
                             3-WIRE (SPI) CONTROL MODE
                             The 3-wire control interface uses the CS        ¯¯ , SCLK and SDA pins.
                             In 3-wire control mode, a control word consists of 32 bits. The first bit is the read/write bit (R/W), which
                             is followed by 15 address bits (A14 to A0) that determine which control register is accessed. The
                             remaining 16 bits (B15 to B0) are data bits, corresponding to the 16 bits in each control register.
                             In 3-wire mode, every rising edge of SCLK clocks in one data bit from the SDA pin. A rising edge on
                             CS
                              ¯¯ latches in a complete control word consisting of the last 32 bits.
                             In Write operations (R/W=0), all SDA bits are driven by the controlling device.
                             In Read operations (R/W=1), the SDA pin is driven by the controlling device to clock in the register
                             address, after which the WM8994 drives the SDA pin to output the applicable data bits.
                             During data output, the SDA pin can be configured as CMOS or Open Drain, using the SPI_CFG
                             register bit, as described in Table 118. In Open Drain configuration, an external pull-up resistor is
                             required to pull the SDA line high so that the logic 1 can be recognised by the master.
                             When SPI Continuous Read mode is enabled (SPI_CONTRD = 1), the WM8994 will readback from
                             incremental register addresses as long as CS             ¯¯ is held low and SCLK is toggled. In this mode, the
                             WM8994 will increment the readback address after the first 32 clock cycles, and will output data from
                             the next register address, and successive register addresses, MSB first, for as long as CS                    ¯¯ is held low
                             and SCLK is toggled.
                             An internal pull-down resistor is enabled by default on the CS           ¯¯ /ADDR pin; this can be configured using
                             the CSNADDR_PD register bit described in Table 118.
                             The 3-wire control mode timing is illustrated in Figure 79.

                             4-WIRE (SPI) CONTROL MODE
                             The 4-wire control interface uses the CS       ¯¯ , SCLK, SDA and SDOUT pins.
                             The SDOUT function must be enabled on one of the GPIO pins (see “General Purpose Input/Output”).
                             The Data Output pin, SDOUT, can be configured as CMOS or ‘Wired OR’, as described in Table 118.
                             In CMOS mode, SDOUT is driven low when not outputting register data bits. In ‘Wired OR’ mode,
                             SDOUT is undriven (high impedance) when not outputting register data bits.
                             In Write operations (R/W=0), this mode is the same as 3-wire mode described above.
                             In Read operations (R/W=1), the SDA pin is ignored following receipt of the valid register address.
                             SDOUT is driven by the WM8994.
                             When SPI Continuous Read mode is enabled (SPI_CONTRD = 1), the WM8994 will readback from
                             incremental register addresses as long as CS           ¯¯ is held low and SCLK is toggled. In this mode, the
                             WM8994 will increment the readback address after the first 32 clock cycles, and will output data from
                             the next register address, and successive register addresses, MSB first, for as long as CS                ¯¯ is held low
                             and SCLK is toggled.
                             An internal pull-down resistor is enabled by default on the CS          ¯¯ /ADDR pin; this can be configured using
                             the CSNADDR_PD register bit described in Table 118.
                             The 4-wire control mode timing is illustrated in Figure 80 and Figure 81.

 CONTROL WRITE SEQUENCER
                The Control Write Sequencer is a programmable unit that forms part of the WM8994 control interface
                logic. It provides the ability to perform a sequence of register write operations with the minimum of
                demands on the host processor - the sequence may be initiated by a single operation from the host
                processor and then left to execute independently.
                Default sequences for Start-Up of each output driver and Shut-Down are provided (see “Default
                Sequences” section). It is recommended that these default sequences are used unless changes
                become necessary.
                When a sequence is initiated, the sequencer performs a series of pre-defined register writes. The host
                processor informs the sequencer of the start index of the required sequence within the sequencer’s
                memory. At each step of the sequence, the contents of the selected register fields are read from the
                sequencer’s memory and copied into the WM8994 control registers. This continues sequentially
                through the sequencer’s memory until an “End of Sequence” bit is encountered; at this point, the
                sequencer stops and an Interrupt status flag is asserted. For cases where the timing of the write
                sequence is important, a programmable delay can be set for specific steps within the sequence.
                Note that the Control Write Sequencer’s internal clock is derived from the internal clock SYS_CLK
                which must be enabled as described in “Clocking and Sample Rates”. The clock division from
                SYS_CLK is handled transparently by the WM8994 without user intervention, provided that SYS_CLK
                is configured as specified in “Clocking and Sample Rates”.
                INITIATING A SEQUENCE
                The Register fields associated with running the Control Write Sequencer are described in Table 121.
                Note that the operation of the Control Write Sequencer also requires the internal clock SYS_CLK to
                be configured as described in “Clocking and Sample Rates”.
                The Write Sequencer is enabled by setting the WSEQ_ENA bit. The start index of the required
                sequence must be written to the WSEQ_START_INDEX field.
                The Write Sequencer stores up to 128 register write commands. These are defined in Registers
                R12288 to R12799. There are 4 registers used to define each of the 128 possible commands. The
                value of WSEQ_START_INDEX selects the registers applicable to the first write command in the
                selected sequence.
                Setting the WSEQ_START bit initiates the sequencer at the given start index. The Write Sequencer
                can be interrupted by writing a logic 1 to the WSEQ_ABORT bit.
                The current status of the Write Sequencer can be read using two further register fields - when the
                WSEQ_BUSY bit is asserted, this indicates that the Write Sequencer is busy. Note that, whilst the
                Control Write Sequencer is running a sequence (indicated by the WSEQ_BUSY bit), normal read/write
                operations to the Control Registers cannot be supported. The index of the current step in the Write
                Sequencer can be read from the WSEQ_CURRENT_INDEX field; this is an indicator of the
                sequencer’s progress. On completion of a sequence, this field holds the index of the last step within
                the last commanded sequence.
                When the Write Sequencer reaches the end of a sequence, it asserts the WSEQ_DONE_EINT flag in
                Register R1841 (see Table 86). This flag can be used to generate an Interrupt Event on completion of
                the sequence. Note that the WSEQ_DONE_EINT flag is asserted to indicate that the WSEQ is NOT
                Busy.

        Table 121 Write Sequencer Control - Initiating a Sequence
        PROGRAMMING A SEQUENCE
        A sequence consists of write operations to data bits (or groups of bits) within the control registers.
        Each write operation is defined by a block of 4 registers, which contain 6 fields as described in this
        section.
        The block of 4 registers is the same for up to 128 steps held in the sequencer memory. Multiple
        sequences can be held in the memory at the same time; each sequence occupies its own range within
        the 128 available register blocks.
        The following 6 fields are replicated 128 times - one for each of the sequencer’s 128 steps. In the
        following descriptions, the term ‘n’ is used to denote the step number, from 0 to 127.
        WSEQ_ADDRn is a 14-bit field containing the Control Register Address in which the data should be
        written.
        WSEQ_DATAn is an 8-bit field which contains the data to be written to the selected Control Register.
        The WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn field determines how many of these bits are written to the selected
        register; the most significant bits (above the number indicated by WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn) are
        ignored.
Rev 4.5                                                                                                        219


                                                                                         WM8994
    WSEQ_DATA_STARTn is a 4-bit field which identifies the LSB position within the selected Control
    Register to which the data should be written. For example, setting WSEQ_DATA_STARTn = 0100 will
    select bit 4 as the LSB position; in this case, 4-bit data would be written to bits 7:4.
    WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn is a 3-bit field which identifies the width of the data block to be written. This
    enables selected portions of a Control Register to be updated without any concern for other bits within
    the same register, eliminating the need for read-modify-write procedures. Values of 0 to 7 correspond
    to data widths of 1 to 8 respectively. For example, setting WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn = 010 will cause a
    3-bit data block to be written. Note that the maximum value of this field corresponds to an 8-bit data
    block; writing to register fields greater than 8 bits wide must be performed using two separate
    operations of the Control Write Sequencer.
    WSEQ_DELAYn is a 4-bit field which controls the waiting time between the current step and the next
    step in the sequence i.e. the delay occurs after the write in which it was called. The total delay time
    per step (including execution) is defined below, giving a useful range of execution/delay times from
    562s up to 2.048s per step:
                T = k × (2 WSEQ_DELAY + 8)
                where k = 62.5s (under recommended operating conditions)
    WSEQ_EOSn is a 1-bit field which indicates the End of Sequence. If this bit is set, then the Control
    Write Sequencer will automatically stop after this step has been executed.
    The register definitions for Step 0 are described in Table 122. The equivalent definitions also apply to
    Step 1 through to Step 127, in the subsequent register address locations.

        Table 122 Write Sequencer Control - Programming a Sequence
        Note that a ‘Dummy’ write can be inserted into a control sequence by commanding the sequencer to
        write a value of 0 to bit 0 of Register R255 (00FFh). This is effectively a write to a non-existent register
        location. This can be used in order to create placeholders ready for easy adaptation of a control
        sequence. For example, a sequence could be defined to power-up a mono signal path from DACL to
        headphone, with a ‘dummy’ write included to leave space for easy modification to a stereo signal path
        configuration. Dummy writes can also be used in order to implement additional time delays between
        register writes. Dummy writes are included in both of the Headphone start-up sequences - see Table
        123 and Table 124.
        In summary, the Control Register to be written is set by the WSEQ_ADDRn field. The data bits that
        are written are determined by a combination of WSEQ_DATA_STARTn, WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn and
        WSEQ_DATAn. This is illustrated below for an example case of writing to the VMID_SEL field within
        Register R1 (0001h).
        In this example, the Start Position is bit 01 (WSEQ_DATA_STARTn = 0001b) and the Data width is 2
        bits (WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn = 0001b). With these settings, the Control Write Sequencer would
        update the Control Register R1 [2:1] with the contents of WSEQ_DATAn [1:0].

    DEFAULT SEQUENCES
    When the WM8994 is powered up, a number of Control Write Sequences are available through
    default settings in the sequencer memory locations. The pre-programmed default settings include
    Start-Up and Shut-Down sequences for each of the output drivers. Note that the default sequences do
    not include audio signal path or gain setting configuration; this must be implemented prior to
    scheduling any of the default Start-Up sequences.
    The entire sequencer memory may be programmed to users’ own settings at any time, as described in
    “Programming a Sequence”. Users’ own settings remain in memory regardless of WSEQ_ENA, and
    are not affected by software resets (i.e. writing to Register R0). However, any non-default sequences
    are lost when the device is powered down.
    The following default control sequences are provided:
    1.    Headphone Cold Start-Up - This sequence powers up the headphone driver and charge pump. It
          commands the DC Servo to perform offset correction. It enables the master bias required for
          analogue functions. This sequence is intended for enabling the headphone output after initial
          power-on, when DC offset correction has not previously been run.
    2.    Headphone Warm Start-Up - This sequence is similar to the Headphone Cold Start-Up, but does
          not include the DC Servo operation. This sequence is intended for fast enabling of the
          headphone output when DC offset correction has previously been scheduled and provided the
          analogue gain settings have not been updated since scheduling the DC offset correction.
    3.    Speaker Start-Up - This sequence powers up the stereo speaker driver. It also enables the
          master bias required for analogue functions.
    4.    Earpiece Start-Up - This sequence powers up the earpiece driver. It also enables the master bias
          required for analogue functions. The soft-start VMID option is used in order to suppress pops
          when the driver is enabled. This sequence is intended for enabling the earpiece driver when the
          master bias has not previously been enabled.
    5.    Line Output Start-Up - This sequence powers up the line outputs. Active discharge of the line
          outputs is selected, followed by the soft-start VMID enable, followed by selection of the master
          bias and un-muting of the line outputs. This sequence is intended for enabling the line drivers
          when the master bias has not previously been enabled.
    6.    Speaker and Headphone Fast Shut-Down - This sequence implements a fast shutdown of the
          speaker and headphone drivers. It also disables the DC Servo and charge pump circuits, and
          disables the analogue bias circuits using the soft-start (ramp) feature. This sequence is intended
          as a shut-down sequence when only the speaker or headphone drivers are enabled.
    7.    Generic Shut-Down - This sequence shuts down all of the WM8994 output drivers, DC Servo,
          charge pump and analogue bias circuits. It is similar to the Fast Shut-Down sequence, with the
          additional control of the earpiece and line output drivers. Active discharge of the line outputs is
          included and all drivers are disabled as part of this sequence.
    Specific details of each of these sequences is provided below.
    Headphone Cold Start-Up
    The Headphone Cold Start-Up sequence is initiated by writing 8100h to Register 272 (0110h). This
    single operation starts the Control Write Sequencer at Index Address 0 (00h) and executes the
    sequence defined in Table 123.
    This sequence takes approximately 296ms to run.

 LDO REGULATORS
                          The WM8994 provides two integrated Low Drop-Out Regulators (LDOs). These are provided to
                          generate the appropriate power supplies for internal circuits, simplifying and reducing the
                          requirements for external supplies and associated components. A reference circuit powered by
                          AVDD2 ensures the accuracy of the LDO regulator voltage settings.
                          Note that the integrated LDOs are only intended for generating the AVDD1 and DCVDD supply rails
                          for the WM8994; they are not suitable for powering any additional or external loads.
                          LDO1 is intended for generating AVDD1 - the primary analogue power domain of the WM8994. LDO1
                          is powered by LDO1VDD and is enabled when a logic ‘1’ is applied to the LDO1ENA pin. The logic
                          level is determined with respect to the DBVDD voltage domain. The LDO1 start-up time is dependent
                          on the external AVDD1 and VREFC capacitors; the start-up time is illustrated in Figure 84 and defined
                          in Table 130 for the recommended external component conditions.
                          When LDO1 is enabled, the output voltage is controlled by the LDO1_VSEL register field. Note that
                          the LDO1 voltage difference LDO1VDD - AVDD1 must be higher than the LDO1 Drop-Out voltage
                          (see “Electrical Characteristics”).
                          LDO1 is disabled when a logic ‘0’ is applied to the LDO1ENA pin. After LDO1 has been disabled,
                          there is a minimum delay, defined as the LDO1 Cycle Time, during which LDO1 should not be re-
                          enabled. The LDO1 Cycle Time is illustrated in Figure 84 and defined in Table 130 for the
                          recommended external component conditions.
                          When LDO1 is disabled, the output can be left floating or can be actively discharged, depending on
                          the LDO1_DISCH control bit.
                          It is possible to supply AVDD1 from an external supply. If AVDD1 is supplied externally, then LDO1
                          should be disabled, and the LDO1 output left floating (LDO1DISCH = 0). Note that the LDO1VDD
                          voltage must be greater than or equal to AVDD1; this ensures that there is no leakage path through
                          the LDO for the external supply.
                          Note that the WM8994 can operate with AVDD1 tied to 0V; power consumption may be reduced, but
                          the analogue audio functions will not be supported.
                          LDO2 is intended for generating the DCVDD power domain which supplies the digital core functions
                          on the WM8994. LDO2 is powered by LDO2VDD and is enabled when a logic ‘1’ is applied to the
                          LDO2ENA pin. The logic level is determined with respect to the DBVDD voltage domain. The LDO2
                          start-up time is dependent on the external DCVDD and VREFC capacitors; the start-up time is
                          illustrated in Figure 84 and defined in Table 130 for the recommended external component conditions.
                          When LDO2 is enabled, the output voltage is controlled by the LDO2_VSEL register field.
                          LDO2 is disabled when a logic ‘0’ is applied to the LDO2ENA pin. After LDO2 has been disabled,
                          there is a minimum delay, defined as the LDO2 Cycle Time, during which LDO2 should not be re-

                                                                                                 WM8994
        enabled. The LDO2 Cycle Time is illustrated in Figure 84 and defined in Table 130 for the
        recommended external component conditions.
        When LDO2 is disabled, the output can be left floating or can be actively discharged, depending on
        the LDO2_DISCH control bit.
        It is possible to supply DCVDD from an external supply. If DCVDD is supplied externally, the
        LDO2ENA and LDO2DISCH bits should be set to 0. Note that the DBVDD voltage must be greater
        than or equal to DCVDD; this ensures that there is no leakage path through the LDO for the external
        supply.
        An internal pull-down resistor is enabled by default on the LDO1ENA and LDO2ENA pins. These pull-
        down resistors can be configured using the register bits described in Table 131.
        Decoupling capacitors should be connected to the voltage reference pin, VREFC, and also to the LDO
        outputs, AVDD1 and DCVDD. See “Applications Information” for further details.
        The LDO Regulator connections and controls are illustrated in Figure 83. The register controls are
        defined in Table 131.

                                                                                              WM8994
 POP SUPPRESSION CONTROL
                The WM8994 incorporates a number of features, including SilentSwitch™ technology, designed to
                suppress pops normally associated with Start-Up, Shut-Down or signal path control. To achieve
                maximum benefit from these features, careful attention is required to the sequence and timing of
                these controls. Note that, under the recommended usage conditions of the WM8994, these features
                will be configured by running the default Start-Up and Shut-Down sequences as described in the
                “Control Write Sequencer” section. In these cases, the user does not need to set these register fields
                directly.
                The Pop Suppression controls relating to the Headphone / Line Output drivers are described in the
                “Analogue Output Signal Path” section.
                Additional bias controls, also pre-programmed into Control Write Sequencer, are described in the
                “Reference Voltages and Master Bias” section.
                DISABLED LINE OUTPUT CONTROL
                The line outputs are biased to VMID in normal operation. To avoid audible pops caused by a disabled
                signal path dropping to AGND, the WM8994 can maintain these connections at VMID when the
                relevant output stage is disabled. This is achieved by connecting a buffered VMID reference to the
                output.
                The buffered VMID reference is enabled by setting VMID_BUF_ENA. The output resistance is
                selectable, using the VROI register bit.
                Note that, if LINEOUTn_DISCH=1 (see Table 133), then the respective output will be discharged to
                AGND, and will not be connected to VMID.

    LINE OUTPUT DISCHARGE CONTROL
    The line output paths can be actively discharged to AGND through internal resistors if desired. This is
    desirable at start-up in order to achieve a known output stage condition prior to enabling the soft-start
    VMID reference voltage. This is also desirable in shut-down to prevent the external connections from
    being affected by the internal circuits.
    The line outputs LINEOUT1P and LINEOUT1N are discharged to AGND by setting
    LINEOUT1_DISCH. The line outputs LINEOUT2P and LINEOUT2N are discharged to AGND by
    setting LINEOUT2_DISCH.
    The discharge resistance is dependent upon the respective LINEOUTn_ENA bit, and also according
    to the VROI bit (see Table 132). The discharge resistance is noted in the “Electrical Characteristics”
    section.

 REFERENCE VOLTAGES AND MASTER BIAS
                This section describes the analogue reference voltage and bias current controls. It also describes the
                VMID soft-start circuit for pop suppressed start-up and shut-down.
                The analogue circuits in the WM8994 require a mid-rail analogue reference voltage, VMID. This
                reference is generated from AVDD1 via a programmable resistor chain. Together with the external
                VMID decoupling capacitor, the programmable resistor chain determines the charging characteristic
                on VMID. This is controlled by VMID_SEL[1:0], and can be used to optimise the reference for normal
                operation or low power standby as described in Table 136.
                A buffered mid-rail reference voltage is provided. This is required for the single-ended configuration of
                the Input PGAs, and also for direct signal paths from the input pins to the Input Mixers, Output Mixers
                or Speaker Mixers. These requirements are noted in the relevant “Analogue Input Signal Path” and
                “Analogue Output Signal Path” sections. The buffered mid-rail reference is enabled by setting the
                VMID_BUF_ENA register bit.
                The analogue circuits in the WM8994 require a bias current. The normal bias current is enabled by
                setting BIAS_ENA. Note that the normal bias current source requires VMID to be enabled also.

                A pop-suppressed start-up requires VMID to be enabled smoothly, without the step change normally
                associated with the initial stage of the VMID capacitor charging. A pop-suppressed start-up also
                requires the analogue bias current to be enabled throughout the signal path prior to the VMID
                reference voltage being applied. The WM8994 incorporates pop-suppression circuits which address
                these requirements.
                An alternate bias current source (Start-Up Bias) is provided for pop-free start-up; this is enabled by the
                STARTUP_BIAS_ENA register bit. The start-up bias is selected (in place of the normal bias) using the
                BIAS_SRC bit. It is recommended that the start-up bias is used during start-up, before switching back
                to the higher quality, normal bias.
                A soft-start circuit is provided in order to control the switch-on of the VMID reference. The soft-start
                control circuit offers two slew rates for enabling the VMID reference; these are selected and enabled
                by VMID_RAMP. When the soft-start circuit is enabled prior to enabling VMID_SEL, the reference
                voltage rises smoothly, without the step change that would otherwise occur. It is recommended that
                the soft-start circuit and the output signal path be enabled before VMID is enabled by VMID_SEL.
                A soft shut-down is provided, using the soft-start control circuit and the start-up bias current generator.
                The soft shut-down of VMID is achieved by setting VMID_RAMP, STARTUP_BIAS_ENA and
                BIAS_SRC to select the start-up bias current and soft-start circuit prior to setting VMID_SEL=00.
                Note that, if the VMID_RAMP function is enabled for soft start-up or soft shut-down then, after setting
                VMID_SEL = 00 to disable VMID, the soft-start circuit must be reset before re-enabling VMID. The
                soft-start circuit is reset by setting VMID_RAMP = 00. After resetting the soft-start circuit, the
                VMID_RAMP register may be updated to the required setting for the next VMID transition.
                The VMID soft-start register controls are defined in Table 137.

 POWER MANAGEMENT
               The WM8994 has control registers that allow users to select which functions are active. For minimum
               power consumption, unused functions should be disabled. To minimise pop or click noise, it is
               important to enable or disable functions in the correct order. See “Control Write Sequencer” for details
               of recommended control sequences.

 THERMAL SHUTDOWN
                The WM8994 incorporates a temperature sensor which detects when the device temperature is within
                normal limits or if the device is approaching a hazardous temperature condition. The temperature
                sensor can be configured to automatically disable the audio outputs of the WM8994 in response to an
                overtemperature condition (approximately 150ºC).
                The temperature status can be output directly on a GPIO pin, as described in the “General Purpose
                Input/Output” section. The temperature sensor can also be used to generate Interrupt events, as
                described in the “Interrupts” section. The GPIO and Interrupt functions can be used to indicate either a
                Warning Temperature event or the Shutdown Temperature event.
                The temperature sensor is enabled by setting the TSHUT_ENA register bit. When the TSHUT_OPDIS
                is also set, then a device over-temperature condition will cause the speaker outputs (SPKOUTL and
                SPKOUTR) of the WM8994 to be disabled; this response is likely to prevent any damage to the device
                attributable to the large currents of the output drivers.
                Note that, to prevent pops and clicks, TSHUT_ENA and TSHUT_OPDIS should only be updated
                whilst the speaker and headphone outputs are disabled.

 POWER ON RESET
                The WM8994 includes a Power-On Reset (POR) circuit, which is used to reset the digital logic into a
                default state after power up. The POR circuit derives its output from AVDD2 and DCVDD. The internal
                POR
                 ¯¯¯ signal is asserted low when AVDD2 and DCVDD are below minimum thresholds.
                The specific behaviour of the circuit will vary, depending on relative timing of the supply voltages.
                Typical scenarios are illustrated in Figure 85 and Figure 86.

    The POR¯¯¯ signal is undefined until AVDD2 has exceeded the minimum threshold, Vpora. Once this
    threshold has been exceeded, POR  ¯¯¯ is asserted low and the chip is held in reset. In this condition, all
    writes to the control interface are ignored. Once AVDD2 and DCVDD have reached their respective
    power on thresholds, POR ¯¯¯ is released high, all registers are in their default state, and writes to the
    control interface may take place.
    Note that a power-on reset period, TPOR, applies after AVDD2 and DCVDD have reached their
    respective power on thresholds. This specification is guaranteed by design rather than test.
    On power down, POR   ¯¯¯ is asserted low when either AVDD2 or DCVDD falls below their respective
    power-down thresholds.
    Typical Power-On Reset parameters for the WM8994 are defined in Table 140.

 QUICK START-UP AND SHUTDOWN
                 The default control sequences (see “Control Write Sequencer”) contain only the register writes
                 necessary to enable or disable specific output drivers. It is therefore necessary to configure the signal
                 path and gain settings before commanding any of the default start-up sequences.
                 This section describes minimum control sequences to configure the WM8994 for DAC to Headphone
                 playback. Note that these sequences are provided for guidance only; application software should be
                 verified and tailored to ensure optimum performance.
                 Table 142 describes an example control sequence to enable DAC playback to HPOUT1L and
                 HPOUT1R path. This involves DAC enable, signal path configuration and mute control, together with
                 the default “Headphone Cold Start-Up” sequence. Table 143 describes an example control sequence
                 to disable the direct DAC to Headphone path.

                 Control Write Sequence runs. When this bit returns to 0, the remaining steps of the sequence may be
                 executed.

 SOFTWARE RESET AND DEVICE ID
                The device ID can be read back from register R0. Writing to this register will reset the device.
                The software reset causes most control registers to be reset to their default state. Note that the
                Control Write Sequencer registers R12288 (3000h) through to R12799 (31FFh) are not affected by a
                software reset; the Control Sequences defined in these registers are retained unchanged.
                The status of the WM8994 digital I/O pins following a software reset is described in Table 141.
                The device revision can be read back from register R256.

               AUDIO INPUT PATHS
               The WM8994 provides 8 analogue audio inputs. Each of these inputs is referenced to the internal DC
               reference, VMID. A DC blocking capacitor is required for each input pin used in the target application.
               The choice of capacitor is determined by the filter that is formed between that capacitor and the input
               impedance of the input pin. The circuit is illustrated in Figure 87.

               If the input impedance is known, and the cut-off frequency is known, then the minimum capacitor
               value may be derived easily. However, it can be seen from the representation in Figure 87 that the
               input impedance is not fixed in all applications but can vary with gain and boost amplifier settings.
               The PGA input resistance for every gain setting is detailed in Table 145.

    The appropriate input capacitor may be selected using the PGA input resistance data provided in
    Table 145, depending on the required PGA gain setting(s).
    The choice of capacitor for a 20Hz cut-off frequency is shown in Table 146 for a selection of typical
    input impedance conditions.

    Table 146 Audio Input DC Blocking Capacitors
    Using the figures in Table 146, it follows that a 1F capacitance for all input connections will give good
    results in most cases. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are particularly suitable as they offer high
    stability in a small package size.
    Ceramic equivalents are a cost effective alternative to the superior tantalum packages, but care must
    be taken to ensure the desired capacitance is maintained at the AVDD1 operating voltage. Also,
    ceramic capacitors may show microphonic effects, where vibrations and mechanical conditions give
    rise to electrical signals. This is particularly problematic for microphone input paths where a large
    signal gain is required.
    A single capacitor is required for a line input or single-ended microphone connection. In the case of a
    differential microphone connection, a DC blocking capacitor is required on both input pins.
    HEADPHONE OUTPUT PATH
    The headphone output on WM8994 is ground referenced and therefore does not require the large,
    expensive capacitors necessary for VMID reference solutions. For best audio performance, it is
    recommended to connect a zobel network to the audio output pins. This network should comprise of a
    100nF capacitor and 20ohm resistor in series with each other (see “Analogue Outputs” section).
    These components have the effect of dampening high frequency oscillations or instabilities that can
    arise outside the audio band under certain conditions. Possible sources of these instabilities include
    the inductive load of a headphone coil or an active load in the form of an external line amplifier.

        EARPIECE DRIVER OUTPUT PATH
        The earpiece driver on HPOUT2P and HPOUT2N is designed as a 32ohm BTL speaker driver. The
        outputs are referenced to the internal DC reference VMID, but direct connection to the speaker is
        possible because of the BTL configuration. There is no requirement for DC blocking capacitors.
        LINE OUTPUT PATHS
        The WM8994 provides four line outputs (LINEOUT1P, LINEOUT1N, LINEOUT2P and LINEOUT2N).
        Each of these outputs is referenced to the internal DC reference, VMID. In any case where a line
        output is used in a single-ended configuration (i.e. referenced to AGND), a DC blocking capacitor will
        be required in order to remove the DC bias. In the case where a pair of line outputs is configured as a
        BTL differential pair, then the DC blocking capacitor should be omitted.
        The choice of capacitor is determined from the filter that is formed between the capacitor and the load
        impedance – see Figure 88.

        Using the figures in Table 147, it follows that that a 1F capacitance would be a suitable choice for a
        line load. Tantalum electrolytic capacitors are again particularly suitable but ceramic equivalents are a
        cost effective alternative. Care must be taken to ensure the desired capacitance is maintained at the
        appropriate operating voltage.

    POWER SUPPLY DECOUPLING
    Electrical coupling exists particularly in digital logic systems where switching in one sub-system
    causes fluctuations on the power supply. This effect occurs because the inductance of the power
    supply acts in opposition to the changes in current flow that are caused by the logic switching. The
    resultant variations (or ‘spikes’) in the power supply voltage can cause malfunctions and unintentional
    behavior in other components. A decoupling (or ‘bypass’) capacitor can be used as an energy storage
    component which will provide power to the decoupled circuit for the duration of these power supply
    variations, protecting it from malfunctions that could otherwise arise.
    Coupling also occurs in a lower frequency form when ripple is present on the power supply rail caused
    by changes in the load current or by limitations of the power supply regulation method. In audio
    components such as the WM8994, these variations can alter the performance of the signal path,
    leading to degradation in signal quality. A decoupling (or ‘bypass’) capacitor can be used to filter these
    effects, by presenting the ripple voltage with a low impedance path that does not affect the circuit to
    be decoupled.
    These coupling effects are addressed by placing a capacitor between the supply rail and the
    corresponding ground reference. In the case of systems comprising multiple power supply rails,
    decoupling should be provided on each rail.
    The recommended power supply decoupling capacitors for WM8994 are listed below in Table 148.

    All decoupling capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the WM8994 device. The
    connection between AGND, the AVDD1 decoupling capacitor and the main system ground should be
    made at a single point as close as possible to the AGND ball of the WM8994.
    The VMID capacitor is not, technically, a decoupling capacitor. However, it does serve a similar
    purpose in filtering noise on the VMID reference. The connection between AGND, the VMID
    decoupling capacitor and the main system ground should be made at a single point as close as
    possible to the AGND ball of the WM8994.
    Due to the wide tolerance of many types of ceramic capacitors, care must be taken to ensure that the
    selected components provide the required capacitance across the required temperature and voltage
    ranges in the intended application. For most applications, the use of ceramic capacitors with capacitor
    dielectric X5R is recommended.

          The positioning of the Charge Pump capacitors is important, particularly the fly-back capacitor. These
          capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the WM8994.

          dielectric X5R is recommended.
          MICROPHONE BIAS CIRCUIT
          The WM8994 is designed to interface easily with up to four analogue microphones. These may be
          connected in single-ended or differential configurations, as illustrated in Figure 89. The single-ended
          method allows greater capability for the connection of multiple audio sources simultaneously, whilst
          the differential method provides better performance due to its rejection of common-mode noise.
          In either configuration, the microphone requires a bias current (electret condenser microphones) or voltage
          supply (silicon microphones), which can be provided by MICBIAS1 or MICBIAS2.
          A current-limiting resistor is also required when using an electret condenser microphone (ECM). The
          resistance should be chosen according to the minimum operating impedance of the microphone and
          MICBIAS voltage so that the maximum bias current of the WM8994 is not exceeded. Cirrus Logic
          recommends a 2.2k current limiting resistor as it provides compatibility with a wide range of
          microphone models.

    The MICBIAS generators are identical output-compensated amplifiers, which require an external capacitor in
    order to guarantee accuracy and stability. The recommended capacitance is 4.7F. A ceramic type is a
    suitable choice here, providing that care is taken to choose a component that exhibits this capacitance at the
    intended MICBIAS voltage.
    The maximum output current is noted in the “Electrical Characteristics”. This limit must be observed
    on each MICBIAS output, especially if more than one microphone is connected to a single MICBIAS
    pin. The MICBIAS output voltage can be adjusted using register control to suit the requirements of the
    microphone.
    CLASS D SPEAKER CONNECTIONS
    The WM8994 incorporates two Class D/AB 1W speaker drivers. By default, the speaker drivers
    operate in Class D mode, which offers high amplifier efficiency at large signal levels. As the Class D
    output is a pulse width modulated signal, the choice of speakers and tracking of signals is critical for
    ensuring good performance and reducing EMI in this mode.
    The efficiency of the speaker drivers is affected by the series resistance between the WM8994 and
    the speaker (e.g. PCB track loss and inductor ESR) as shown in Figure 91. This resistance should be
    as low as possible to maximise efficiency.

        The Class D output requires external filtering in order to recreate the audio signal. This may be
        implemented using a 2nd order LC or 1st order RC filter, or else may be achieved by using a
        loudspeaker whose internal inductance provides the required filter response. An LC or RC filter should
        be used if the loudspeaker characteristics are unknown or unsuitable, or if the length of the
        loudspeaker connection is likely to lead to EMI problems.
        In applications where it is necessary to provide Class D filter components, a 2nd order LC filter is the
        recommended solution as it provides more attenuation at higher frequencies and minimises power
        dissipated in the filter when compared to a first order RC filter (lower ESR). This maximises both
        rejection of unwanted switching frequencies and overall speaker efficiency. A suitable implementation
        is illustrated in Figure 92.

        A simple equivalent circuit of a loudspeaker consists of a serially connected resistor and inductor, as
        shown in Figure 93. This circuit provides a low pass filter for the speaker output. If the loudspeaker
        characteristics are suitable, then the loudspeaker itself can be used in place of the filter components
        described earlier. This is known as ‘filterless’ operation.

        Figure 93 Speaker Equivalent Circuit for Filterless Operation
        For filterless Class D operation, it is important to ensure that a speaker with suitable inductance is
        chosen. For example, if we know the speaker impedance is 8Ω and the desired cut-off frequency is
        20kHz, then the optimum speaker inductance may be calculated as:
                     R               8
          L=                 =                     = 64H
                  2 p Fc         2 p * 20kHz
        8 loudspeakers typically have an inductance in the range 20H to 100H, however, it should be
        noted that a loudspeaker inductance will not be constant across the relevant frequencies for Class D
        operation (up to and beyond the Class D switching frequency). Care should be taken to ensure that
        the cut-off frequency of the loudspeaker’s filtering is low enough to suppress the high frequency
        energy of the Class D switching and, in so doing, to prevent speaker damage. The Class D outputs of
        the WM8994 operate at much higher frequencies than is recommended for most speakers and it must
        be ensured that the cut-off frequency is low enough to protect the speaker.

                                           Figure 94 provides a summary of recommended external components for WM8994. Note that this
                                           diagram does not include any components that are specific to the end application e.g. it does not
                                           include filtering on the speaker outputs (assume filterless class D operation), RF decoupling, or RF
                                           filtering for pins which connect to the external world i.e. headphone or speaker outputs.

                                                                                                       WM8994
 DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE CLOCKING CONFIGURATIONS
                  The WM8994 provides 3 digital audio interfaces and supports many different clocking configurations.
                  The asynchronous sample rate converter enables more than one digital audio interface to be
                  supported simultaneously, even when there is no synchronisation between these interfaces. In a
                  typical application, this enables audio mixing between a multimedia applications processor and a
                  baseband voice call processor, for example.
                  The AIF1 and AIF2 audio interfaces can be configured in Master or Slave modes, and can also
                  support defined combinations of mixed sample rates. In all applications, it is important that the system
                  clocking configuration is correctly designed. Incorrect clock configurations will lead to audible clicks
                  arising from dropped or repeated audio samples; this is caused by the inherent tolerances of multiple
                  asynchronous system clocks.
                  To ensure reliable clocking of the audio interface functions, it is a requirement that, for each audio
                  interface, the external interface clocks (eg. BCLK, LRCLK) are derived from the same clock source as
                  the respective AIF clock (AIFnCLK).
                  In AIF Master mode, the external BCLK and LRCLK signals are generated by the WM8994 and
                  synchronisation of these signals with AIFnCLK is guaranteed. In this case, clocking of the AIF is
                  derived from the MCLK1 or MCLK2 inputs, either directly or via one of the Frequency Locked Loop
                  (FLL) circuits.
                  In AIF Slave mode, the external BCLK and LRCLK signals are generated by another device, as inputs
                  to the WM8994. In this case, it must be ensured that the respective AIF clock is generated from a
                  source that is synchronised to the external BCLK and LRCLK inputs. In a typical Slave mode
                  application, the BCLK input is selected as the clock reference, using the FLL to perform frequency
                  shifting. It is also possible to use the MCLK1 or MCLK2 inputs, but only if the selected clock is
                  synchronised externally to the BCLK and LRCLK inputs.
                  The valid AIF clocking configurations are listed in Table 149 for AIF Master and AIF Slave modes.

                    AIF Master Mode                  AIFnCLK_SRC selects FLL1 or FLL2 as AIFnCLK source;
                                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as FLLn source.
                                                     AIFnCLK_SRC selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as AIFnCLK source.
                    AIF Slave Mode                   AIFnCLK_SRC selects FLL1 or FLL2 as AIFnCLK source;
                                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects BCLKn as FLLn source.
                                                     AIFnCLK_SRC selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as AIFnCLK source,
                                                     provided MCLK is externally synchronised to the BCLKn input.
                                                     AIFnCLK_SRC selects FLL1 or FLL2 as AIFnCLK source;
                                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as FLLn source,
                                                     provided MCLK is externally synchronised to the BCLKn input.
                  Table 149 Audio Interface Clocking Confgurations
                  In each case, the AIFnCLK frequency must be a valid ratio to the LRCLKn frequency; the supported
                  clocking ratios are defined by the AIFnCLK_RATE register.
                  The valid AIF clocking configurations are illustrated in Figure 95 to Figure 99 below. Note that, where
                  MCLK1 is illustrated as the clock source, it is equally possible to select MCLK2 as the clock source.
                  Similarly, in cases where FLL1 is illustrated, it is equally possible to select the FLL2.

 PCB LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS
                Poor PCB layout will degrade the performance and be a contributory factor in EMI, ground bounce
                and resistive voltage losses. All external components should be placed as close to the WM8994
                device as possible, with current loop areas kept as small as possible. Specific factors relating to Class
                D loudspeaker connection are detailed below.
                CLASS D LOUDSPEAKER CONNECTION
                Long, exposed PCB tracks or connection wires will emit EMI. The distance between the WM8994 and
                the loudspeaker should therefore be kept as short as possible. Where speakers are connected to the
                PCB via a cable form, it is recommended that a shielded twisted pair cable is used. The shield should
                be connected to the main system, with care taken to ensure ground loops are avoided.
                Further reduction in EMI can be achieved using PCB ground (or VDD) planes and also by using
                passive LC components to filter the Class D switching waveform. When passive filtering is used, low
                ESR components should be chosen in order to minimise the series resistance between the WM8994
                and the speaker, maximising the power efficiency.
                LC passive filtering will usually be effective at reducing EMI at frequencies up to around 30MHz. To
                reduce emissions at higher frequencies, ferrite beads can also be used. These should be positioned
                as close to the device as possible.
                These techniques for EMI reduction are illustrated in Figure 100.
