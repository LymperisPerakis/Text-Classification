       This interface connects to the SD memory card slot to communicate with the SD memory device.
       Supports the SPI mode.
       Supports SD, SDHC memory cards and MMC, mini-SD and micro-SD cards.
       Does not support CPRM.
       Since the SD memory card slot needs to detect the insertion status of the SD memory device and the write-protect status,
       be sure to use the slot having the SD memory card insertion status detection terminal and the WP terminal and connect it
       to the terminals. The SD_CON terminal is pulled up within the device and detects “SD card connect” when L is input.
       The SD_WP terminal is pulled up within the device and detects “SD card no-write-protect” when L is input.
       SD I/F is also used as an external serial flash ROM I/F.

         You can select audio line output from 5 types of equalizers and 2 types of bus boosts, using commands. You can use a
         combination of an equalizer and bus boost 1.
         Even when line output is not selected, the equalizer setting is valid. However, for digital output, the equalizer cannot
         change the sound quality.
         Clipping may occur by the combination of volume and equalizer setting.
         Figures 7 to 12 show frequency characteristics of each filter.

         One sub frame of SPDIF consists of synchronous preambles, 16-bit audio data, V bit (validity flag), U bit (user data), C
         bit (channel status) and P bit (parity bit).
         Output rate is fixed to 1X speed (44.1 kHz).
         SPDIF outputs synchronous preambles (source code 0-3) as they are, and other elements (source code 4-31) as the
         biphase output. While the operation stops, L output is enabled.
         Synchronous preambles and C bit use 32 frames (≈4.4 ms) for one cycle. The data formats are shown in Table 4 and
         Table 5 V bit is fixed to L. U bit uses 98 frames (≈13.3 ms) for one cycle.

        P bit is set to 1 if the number of “1” contained in source codes 4-30 is odd, and set to 0 if the number is even.
        Therefore, the number of source codes to be set to 1 for one data must be even, SPDIF ends with L output, and
        preamble output always starts in the same direction.

       This is an I2C serial interface terminal to communicate with the microcomputer (master).
       It supports slave I2C operations.
       Supports the standard mode (100kbps) and the fast mode (400kbps).
       Supports 7-bit addresses.
       8.1 I2C protocol
          When the I2C bus is in the IDLE state, SDA and SCL are set to H by the external Pull-up resistor.
          To start communications, the master sets SDA to L while SCL set to H (Start condition). To finish communications, the
          master sets SDA to H while SCL set to H (Stop condition). During transfer, the master changes SDA only while SCL is L.
          Figure 23 shows Start condition, Stop condition of I2C.

      8.4 Protocol to read to the master
        When sending the received data from the slave to the master using the I2C bus, be sure to conform to the transfer
        protocol shown in Figure 26. First, transfer the status read command (step1). Then, input SCL clock of required bytes
        in step2 to read the status after BUSY PIN confirms the state of L.
        When BUSY PIN is H, correct data is not transmitted.
        The first byte of the transferred data (step2) outputs the status shown in Table 9. Data is output from the second byte.
        Figure 27 shows the relationship between the transferred data and BUSY.
        * For details on BUSY, see Chapter 9.

         This signal outputs the information which tells that the file within the memory is being played or the file to be played is
         changed.
         Precisely, the signal outputs H during the internal decode sequence operation, and L at stop of the operation.
         Please connect it with the interrupt port of the microcomputer.

    SEARCH                   O     SEARCH status detection output signal           H: SEARCH, L: Not SEARCH
         This is output to indicate that the LSI is in the SEARCH status.
         A SEARCH signal becomes H at the time of memory mount, file search, TAG analysis and TOC analysis.
         The LSI ignores command input during SEARCH.
         However, it can accept only ABORT, STOP and status read commands even during SEARCH and can execute them
         command.

    13. System Operation MODE
      The LSI starts operation by setting up System Operation MODE after download of the program by IPL after a power
      supply and reset release.
      Possible operation changes with each modes of operation.
      Only the one mode can set up mode of operation with a command.
      The mode which is simultaneously different cannot be set up.
      A microcomputer sets up the change in System Operation MODE with a command.
      It must change via the CONFIG mode when you change the operation mode.
      The settlement of the following command is to do a re-setup because it is returned in the initial value when it passes
      through the CONFIG mode.
         REPEAT, RANDOM, SET_EQ, SET_NEXT, SET_REPRAND, SET_TAG, SET_PRM
      Command CHG_SYSTEM_MODE
                                                    Table 14. System Operation MODE
         N         MODE                 Explanation
                                        It is in the state which changes after a power supply and download of the program
                                        by IPL.
                                        It is the mode which performs initial setting of a system.
                                        Please change to the mode of other operation after setting up with an
         0x00      CONFIG
                                        initial-setting command.
                                        In this mode, even if it detects insertion of a memory, mount of a memory is not
                                        performed.
                                        The mount of a memory carried out behind each mode changes.
                                        It is the mode which performs decoding play of the file in a memory.
         0x01      PLAYER
                                        File browsing (structural analysis in a memory) can be performed.
                                        It is the mode which Reading/Writing can perform about the specific file in a
                                        memory.
         0x02      FILE RW
                                        A specific file can be deleted.
                                        File browsing (structural analysis in a memory) can be performed.
         0x03      PLAY LIST            It is the mode which plays according to the specific playlist file in a memory.
                                        It is the mode which encodes the input from CD-DA to MP3 (WAV) file, and writes
         0x04      CD-DA                it in a memory.
                                        *BU94702AKV and BU94705AKV only.
         0x05      CD-ROM               It is the mode which analyzes and play(decoding) the input from CD-ROM.
                                        It is the mode which uploads to outside serial Flash ROM from the specific data in
                                        a memory.

    14. File search
      14.1 Function
         ⋅ The file search function supports file system of FAT32, FAT16 and FAT12. (NTFS is not supported.)
         ⋅ The number of maximum playable files per folder.
                                             Table 15. Maximum Playable Files per Folder
                                                           Root folder              Sub folder
                                           FAT12              512                     65534
                                           FAT16              512                     65534
                                           FAT32             65535                    65534
         The number of files described above includes folders and files other than playable files (WAV/AAC/WMA/MP3). Thus, if
         non-playable files or folders contain in the above folders and the number of total files exceeds the maximum limit, all
         the playable files may not be played.
         ⋅ Less than 100 files in the order of FAT within each folder are sorted according to UNICODE. More than 100 files, if
           any, will be sorted in the FAT order. The same rule is applied when sorting sub-folders. More than 100 sub-folders, if
           any, will be sorted in the FAT order. A sorting function can be selected valid or invalid with a command.
         ⋅ The folder hierarchies up to 16 hierarchies whose full path including the file name is within 260 characters can be
           searched.
         ⋅ Supports the device size up to FAT specification (2T byte).
         ⋅ Supports 512, 1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes per sector.
      14.2 Playable file
         The playable file extension is *.WAV for the WAV file, *.M4A, *.3GP and *.MP4 for the AAC file, *.ASF and *.WMA for
         the WMA file, and *.MP3, *.MP2 and *.MP1 for the MP3 file. (There is no distinction between upper case letters and
         lower case letters.) Note that the file operation differs in the following cases
         ⋅ SET_MP3 : For details, see SET_MP3 command.
         ⋅ Attribute : Files with hidden attributes are also playable. Files with system attributes cannot be played.
         ⋅ File name : The file name, including its size, does not depend on playability.
         ⋅ File size : A file with file size "0" is not recognized as a playable file. Playable file size up to 2G-1 byte. A file over
                         2Gbyte is recognized as a playable file, too. But, it is for 2Gbyte -1byte that it can play.
      14.3 File playing sequence
         The file playing sequence depends on the following rules when sort function valid. See Figure 35.
         [1] Files of 1 to 100, in the order written to FAT (FAT order) in each folder, are sorted in the order of UNICODE.
               Files more than 100 are played in the FAT order. The same rule is applied when sorting sub-folders.
               MP3 files are sorted for MP3 which conforms to SEL_MP3. All the folders including null ones and those to which
               no playable file is written are sorted. If over 100 playable files or sub-folders are contained in the folder, they are
               played in the order written to the FAT directory entries.
               The writing method of directory entries will not help understand the file play order because the method depends
               on the OS operation at writing.
         [2] When a playable file exists in the root folder (the top hierarchy), the file is to be played first.
         [3] After all the playable files within the root folder have been played, playable files in the folder in the lower hierarchy,
               if any, are played.
         [4] If another folder exists in the lower hierarchy, playable files within this folder are played. If not, the LSI searches
               other folders in the same hierarchy. If another folder exists there, the LSI plays that folder.
         [5] After playing all the files, the LSI returns to the root folder as in [2] and play the files starting with the top sorted
               one.

      14.4 Folder/File sort
        The LSI sorts the sub-folders and files in the following sequence:
        [1] Obtain up to 100 sub-folders and files each in the order written to FAT within selected folder.
        [2] Compare the obtained folder/file names for 14 characters (28 bytes) from the beginning in UNICODE (2-byte
               character) and sort them in the ascending order. *
        [3] If there are files/folders with same character strings: follow the order of MP3, WMA, AAC and WAV when the
               extension is different; and, otherwise, follow the order written to FAT.
        [4] 101 or more files or sub-folders follow the order written to FAT.
           * The processing of the file name and the folder name is shown in the following.
           1)      When a LFN (long file name) entry exists, 2 bytes are treated as one character.
           2)      When no LFN entry exists, the SFN (short file name) entry is processed as follows.
              2-a) When the first appeared character code is within the range of 0x00-0x7F (US-ASCII), the LSI treats one byte
                   as one character, and adds '0x00' to the upper of the character to expand the entire character to an
                   UNICODE.
              2-b) For a case other than 2-a), practically, the LSI treats these 2 bytes as one character.
                   *For details on LFN and SFN, see the FAT file system specifications.

      14.5 Search within multi-drive and multi-partition
        If a device is a multi-drive type, the LSI recognizes the drive having the smaller LUN (Logical Unit Number) for the
        supporting FAT.
        Only one drive is recognized and the other drive is not.
        For the multi-partition, the LSI recognizes only the first read FAT-supported partition.
        Files in other partitions cannot be read.
      14.6 External HUB search
        When the USB connector is connected to a HUB, and a FAT-supported drive is connected ahead of the HUB at
        mounting the USB for this LSI, only one drive is recognized.
        The LSI does not support external HUBs, it cannot detect plugging/unplugging of the drive ahead of the HUB after the
        USB is mounted.

    15. Playing files
      15.1 Function
        For the files judged to be playable through the file search function, the LSI automatically switches the decoder using
        the file extension and decodes these files.
        Fast forward play and rewinding play operations are available.
        Also, repeat play and random play are available.
        When the sample rate of the input file is not 44.1 kHz, the sample after the decode is converted into 44.1 kHz with
        sample rate converter (SRC) of building into and output.
      15.2 Playable file formats
        15.2.1 MP3 file format
            This format supports MPEG Audio 1, 2, 2.5 and Layer 1, 2, 3.
            It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz and , 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48
            kHz.
            It supports bit rates of 8 to 320kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
        15.2.2 WMA file format
            This format supports WMA Ver.9 Standard.
            It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz.
            It supports bit rates of 5 to 384kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
            It does not support DRM.
            It supports ASF files including audio streams only.
        15.2.3 AAC file format
            This format supports MPEG4 AAC-LC.
            It conforms to ITunes and 3GPP TS 26.244.
            It supports file types of m4a, mp4 and 3gpX. (X is an arbitrary numeric value.)
            ITunes is validated in the following versions: 4.*, 5.*, 6.* and 7.0-7.5.
            It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48 kHz.
            It supports bit rates of 8 to 320kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
            It does not support DRM. It does not support CD-ROM playing.
        15.2.4 WAV file format
            This format supports RIFF WAVE.
            It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48k Hz.
            It does not support CD-ROM playing.
      15.3 Playing files having damaged data
        Operation to the file of all non-correspondence formats is not warrantable. Operation when abnormality of the file is
        detected with this LSI is as follows.
        If the data section of the MP3 file is damaged, the LSI plays the music data in the possible range instead of ceasing to
        play the entire file. It mutes the unplayable section. However, AMUTE terminal remains H output.
        If the data section of the WAV file is damaged, noises are output.
        The LSI executes other files within the playable range and stops playing. Then, it skips to the next tune.
        If a part of the data header is damaged, the LSI immediately terminates playing and skips to the next tune.
        If the file’s extension is playable but its file’s data does not have a format supporting to the extension, the LSI
        immediately terminates playing and skips to the next tune.
        If the file does not have a file format, the LSI immediately terminates playing and skips to the next tune.
        However, when the file data is structured in a format other than MP3 and its file extension is *.MP3, *.MP2 or *.MP1,
        the LSI plays it in the silence mode basically. However, if the LSI can read any playable data, it plays the file partially.
        In this case, the time information which is output as the serial status also becomes unstable. The time information is
        then partially output but you cannot obtain the correct information.

      15.4 NEXT playing mode and Repeat playing mode
        You can select the operation as shown below depending on the next playing mode, repeat mode and random mode.
        Next playing mode
            [1] PLAY_NEXT                     : Automatically searches the next tune after the tune being played ends and starts
                                                playing the next tune.
            [2] PLAY_ALL_STOP                 : After the last tune being played within the memory ends, stops upon completion of
                                                search for the next tune. Starts playing the next tune by the play command issued
                                                subsequently.
            [3] PLAY_FOL_STOP                 : After the last tune being played within the folder ends, stops upon completion of
                                                search for the next tune.
                                                Starts playing the next tune by the play command issued subsequently.
            [4] PLAY_TUN_STOP                 : After the tune being played ends, stops upon completion of search for the next tune.
                                                Starts playing the next tune by the play command issued subsequently.
        Repeat mode
            [1] REPEAT_ALL                    : After playing all the tunes within the memory in process, starts playing them from
                the                           beginning of the memory.
            [2] REPEAT_FOL                    : Repeats playing tunes within the folder in process.
            [3] REPEAT_TUN                    : Repeats playing the tune in process.
                                                The operation when the FF and FB command is received follows the setting of the
                                                SET_REPRAND command.
            [4] RANDOM_ALL                    : Plays the range of ±128 files from the current tune being played at random within
                the                           memory.
            [5] RANDOM_FOL                    : Plays the range of ±128 files from the current tune being played at random within
                the                           older in process.
        Random operation is a specification that doesn't continuously play the immediately played tune not the shuffle
        operation that doesn't play the played tune before.
        Select one operation from next play mode and repeat mode respectively to determine the operation.
        When repeat mode is REPEAT_FOL, the PLAY_ALL_STOP becomes invalid, and serves as PLAY_NEXT.
        When repeat mode is [3] [4] [5], the PLAY_ALL_STOP and PLAY_FOL_STOP becomes invalid, and serves as
        PLAY_NEXT.

      15.5 Resume playing function
        The LSI can read the resume information to the microcomputer, the resume playing will be enabled using this
        information.
                                   Table 18. Resume information register structure
                     The
        Status       number         NAME                    Contents
        OFFSET       of bytes
                                                            This data shows the information on the file being played and on
                                                            the play position.
                                    Resume
        0x38-0x61 42                                        The data has a LSI-unique structure.
                                    information data
                                                            The resume information data is data of 42 bytes.
                                                            It outputs with a little endian.
        The above resume information has a LSI-unique structure and is used when executing resume play. Therefore, you
        should use the data contents as they are without rewriting.
        The resume function is implemented by writing the resume information read by READ_RESUME_INFO command to
        PLAY_RESUME command. After writing to PLAY_RESUME, the LSI automatically searches the resume file and plays
        it.
        After reading READ_RESUME_INFO command during file play, the LSI resumes the file from the time
        READ_RESUME_INFO has been read.
        The data contents read by READ_RESUME_INFO command cannot assure the operations when executing
        PLAY_RESUME which has been rewritten due to the positional information within the memory. If the resume
        information does not match because of change of memory, the LSI starts playing the first tune.

    16. File browsing within memory
      The LSI can analyzing and reading of the entry information of files and subfolders within a folder which is different from
      the one having the current tune while the current tune is being played or stopped. Since the read information contains
      access data to be used to select tunes, the LSI enables to directly select and play tunes using this data.
      The file browsing in the memory operates the cursor (operated position) that can be operated.
      When sending the command to move the cursor, the LSI can analyze and read the information of 10 entries (files or
      folders) from the move destination. (The number of entries can be changed by the setting of SET_BROWSE_NUM.)
      The cursor movement conforms to the sort order determined by the sort function. If the sort function is enabled, the
      system first reads the files, and then the subfolders, in the sort order. If the sort function is disabled, the LSI reads the
      files and subfolders in the order that they are written to FAT.
      A file browsing function becomes effective after ANALYSE_ROOT command is send, and starts the analysis in a root
      folder.
      When you select music directly by using the access data or cursor position, the following status doesn't return a normal
      value because it doesn't understand the number in the whole in the memory.
        Playing folder number status in memory, Playing file number status in the memory.
      The file information status register structure which can be read by the file browsing function in a memory is shown in
      Table 22.

      Cautions)
      If browsing operation is frequently performed during music plaing, music skipping may occur by the memory with a slow
      access speed.
    17. Play list play
      When PLAY LIST MODE of the system operation mode has been selected, this function is effective.
      The LSI can search the play list in the specified folder within the memory and output the play list information.
      When the microcomputer selects the play list, the LSI plays the selected tunes in the order written to the play list.
      Also, the LSI can output the file information in the selected play list.
      Available playlist file should have an extension of M3U or PLS and be described in full path using ASCII or the
      SET_LANG command setting.
      The full path of a file described in the playlist should be within 256 bytes and within 16 hierarchies.
      If the play list format is other than the above or the path does not match, the LSI skip playing tunes.
      While playing the tunes in the playlist, PLAY, STOP, PAUSE, FF and FB commands can be used to control the list.
      The music file described during the play list is treated as what exists in the flat of one class (only root folder) within a
      memory irrespective of the place (path) where the file exists really. For this reason, it becomes invalid a folder repeat and
      a folder random command, and it becomes effective the repeat in a memory, one music repeat, and random in a memory
      setting up a repeat setup by the SET_REPRAND command.

      19.3 Valid data to be encoded
        When LRCK is switched from Rch to Lch and all of the following conditions are met, input data is written to the internal
        buffer as valid data and encoded to MP3.
        [1] The command to enable the encode function turns ON.
        [2] BFULLO output terminal is set to L. (The internal buffer is not FULL.)
        [3] INREQI input terminal is set to H. (The microcomputer tells that this data is valid.)
        When the internal buffer becomes FULL and cannot receive the data, BFULLO terminal output H. Then, data writing to
        the internal buffer will stop.
        When the internal buffer generates space after processing data and INREQI input terminal is set to L, BFULLO output
        terminal is set to L.

      19.4 Data comparison connection function
        When you assume the comparison connection operation to be effective, the data newly input as the last 3 samples of
        the valid data input before the comparison connection operation is set is compared.
        LSI restarts the input from the following data to an internal buffer when 3 consecutive samples are corresponding
        everything.
        As a result, it becomes consecutive data before and after doing connected operation.
        When you assume the comparison connection operation to be invalid, encode can be restarted by connecting it directly
        by controlling the INREQI input.
      19.5 Encode speed
        The data writing speed to the memory depends on the state of the fragmentation and the usage condition in the
        memory, response time from the memory.
        Therefore, the encode speed that BFULLO doesn't become H for all media cannot be guaranteed.
        BFULLO both becomes H while recording MP3 and WAV, and the memory that cannot be in real time recorded exists.

    20. CD-ROM Decoder
      When CD-ROM MODE of the system operation mode has been selected, this function is effective.
      File system analysis and decoding of data are performed to 3 line serial input data from CD-ROM format.
      CD-ROM ECC and the EDC function are supported.
      20.1 Support File System
         CD-ROM Mode1, Mode2 form1, and Mode2 form2 are supported.
         The file system supports ISO9660 level 1 and 2. Remeo and Joliet extension are supported.
         The folder class which can be searched support by 8 classes.
         A folder name and a file name are acquirable to 48 bytes.
      20.2 File system analysis
         The number of entries that can be maintained in the buffer for the analysis becomes
         3*(File_Number)+ 4*(Folder_Number)=1200.
         It depends on the content of the composition of each CD-ROM.
         It becomes a 266 files when number (Folder_Number) of folders is 100 and it becomes 366 entries in total (file or
         folder).
         The entry which was not able to be held to the buffer domain for analysis cannot be played after file system analysis.
         The result of the file system analysis can be read by the status output.
      20.3 Playable file
         20.3.1 MP3 file format
            This format supports MPEG Audio 1, 2, 2.5 and Layer 1, 2, 3.
            It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz and , 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48
            kHz.
            It supports bit rates of 8 to 320kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
         20.3.2 WMA file format

            It supports bit rates of 5 to 384kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
            It does not support DRM.
            It supports ASF files including audio streams only.
         20.3.3 CD-ROM play
            Data is required for the CD-ROM reproduction operation to be input so that the internal data buffer should not empty.
            Therefore, when the data input from CD is not in time, and the internal data buffer empties, the music skip is
            generated.
            The voice is not output while the microcomputer from the SEEK demand interrupt to the input of the demanded data
            is controlling the CD data input when fast-forwarding, rewinding by the CD-ROM playing.
      20.4 SEEK request
         The status of the LBN of required data is outputted when a file analysis start and file selection.
         Furthermore, SEEK request interruption is outputted from an IRPTO terminal to a microcomputer at this time.
         If a request sector is inputted, it will be automatic, connection operation will be performed and subsequent data will be
         processed.

    23. Process information when a media mount error
      The information on in which stage of media mount it failed with the READ_MOUNT_ERROR command is outputted. After
      being set to ERROR=1, by reading this command shows in detail whether the error has occurred during which process
      execution.
      For example, when ERROR=1 and 1st byte=0x08 or 0x09 of READ_MOUNT_ERROR command, since a response
      mistake is made from the device in the process of TEST UNIT READY or REQUEST SENSE, it becomes a mount error.
      The details of an output value are shown below.
      1st byte (offset=0) of a read value outputs the process state at the time of USB mount.

    24. Watchdog Timer
      The LSI incorporates Watchdog Timer, which monitors the system hang-up and resets whenever it occurs.
      After resetting hang-up, WDT (Watchdog Timer) becomes available. You can disable WDT using DIS_WDT command.
      Once WDT is disabled, it cannot be enabled until reset is input.
      When WDT, in the valid status, detects a hang-up within the LSI regardless of external situations (on the microcomputer),
      the LSI resets the system internally.
      To monitor whether the LSI is reset by WDT from the master microcomputer (external), use SET_WDT command to write
      H to STATUS WDT_RFLG and monitor this status. After reset, this status is read as L. This helps you judge that WDT
      has reset the LSI by reading out L when reading the status regularly after writing H using SET_WDT command.
    25. IPL support to external serial FLASH ROM
      Once reset, the LSI needs to download the program to a part of the internal program area from the external serial FLASH
      ROM.
      However, it is also possible to write in data from a microcomputer without connecting external serial FLASH ROM.
      The download function from the external serial FLASH ROM enables to add and change the system functions simply by
      rewriting the external serial FLASH ROM.
      The program is downloaded automatically after reset. After download is completed, it shifts to CONFIG mode.
      This LSI supports to serial FLASH ROM to 8 bit-Command, 24 bit-ADDRESS, and clock MIN=15MHz by minimum size
      2Mbit. This LSI cannot correspond to serial FLASH ROM that doesn't correspond to Page Program because the data
      writing is done with Page Program (256 bytes). This LSI supports to serial FLASH ROM to Write Status Register cycle
      time MAX. = 500msec, Page Program cycle time MAX. = 500msec and Chip Erase cycle time MAX. = 180sec.
      The download time of the program from serial FLASH ROM is about 0.6 sec. This time changes with contents of the
      program write in serial FLASH ROM.
      The LSI supports a mode which enables to write the program data written to the memory (USB or SD) to the external
      serial FLASH ROM. By executing the command to enable the FLASH ROM write mode, the LSI searches in the
      memory and rewrites the external serial FLASH ROM. After rewriting the FLASH ROM, you should reset the LSI.

FOL-                    4       0x61 0x0A  M    N   ・When receiving the FOL- command during play, pause, or stop, the LSI
                                                      searches the folder N tunes back from the one having the file being
                                                      played or paused in the sort order.
                                                    ・When playing a tune less than N folders from the top in the sort order,
                                                    the LSI returns to the first folder. However, when playing a file within the
                                                    first folder, the LSI searches the folder across the last tune within the
                                                    memory.
                                                    ・Even if REPEAT or RANDOM is set, the LSI searches the file in the

                                                    ・If N=0, the LSI searches the top of the current folder.
                                                    ・If TAG analysis is enabled, the LSI also performs that analysis.
                                                                                                                               rd

          *1 BU94702AKV and BU94705AKV only.
          *2 The access data must analyze the browsing, and use the acquired data.
             Please analyze again when the exchange or the file of media is deleted,
             and the file is written, and acquire the access data.
          *3 The full path of file name is 256 bytes at maximum (including drive letter (A:¥), file name and extension) and less
             than 16 class. Please specify the full path in the language set by the SET_LANG command. Please set N=0x00
             to the SET_LANG2 command.
             If the length is less than 256 bytes, insert 0x00 at the end. Insert ”¥”(0x5C) for the delimiter between folder layers.
             The drive letter is "A:¥" for USB and "B:¥" for SD. You can also specify the path in a format without drive letter. If
             the full path has a drive letter different from the one for the memory being selected, Status1.ERROR=H occurs.
             (For example, "B:¥" is set for the full path when USB is selected.)
             The full path becomes 251 bytes or less when START_ENCODE command.

      26.2 Status output
        The operation information, such as internal statuses, play time, folders, files and Tags, is output using an I2C interface.
        The statuses shown in Table33 Status Register Map are output.
        When reading status via I2C, the OFFSET position is automatically incremented after reading byte data. However, by
        issuing the I2C start condition, the OFFSET position is reset to OFFSET specified by the previous command.
        To read statuses, two methods are available: to specify OFFSET of the status register map and read any bytes
        continuously from the OFFSET position; and to read byte data by a command without specifying the OFFSET position.
        Table 34 shows the status output commands.
        Byte data, when reading via I2C, is output in Little Endian format.
        When read over OFFSET=0x140, OFFSET does not return to 0x00, therefore the read value turns into an unfixed
        value.

●Notes for use
    1)     Power on Reset
         Please keep the terminal RESETX at the Low level when the power supply starts. After completely starting up 3.3V
         system power supply, afterwards, please make the terminal RESETX High level after 100us after the oscillation of the
         system clock is steady. Moreover, please make the terminal RESETX Low level during 100us or more when resetting it
         while operating.
    2)     About compatibility in USB memory device and SD memory card
         According to the file structure and communication speed of an USB memory, SD memory card, this LSI might not play
         back correctly.
    3)     About turning on the power supply
         Current rush might flow momentarily by the order of turning on the power supply and the delay in IC with two or more
         power supplies, and note the capacity of the power supply coupling, the power supply, and width and drawing the GND
         pattern wiring.
    4)     About absolute maximum rating
         When the absolute maximum rating such as the applied voltage and the ranges of the operating temperature is
         exceeded, LSI might be destroyed. Please apply neither voltage nor the temperature that exceeds the absolute
         maximum rating. Please execute physical measures for safety such as fuse when it is thought to exceed the absolute
         maximum rating, and examine it so that the condition to exceed the absolute maximum rating is not applied to LSI.
    5)     About GND Voltage
         In any state of operation must be the lowest voltage about the voltage of the terminal GND. Please actually confirm the
         voltage of each terminal is not a voltage that is lower than the terminal GND including excessive phenomenon.
    6)     About design of overheating malfunction preventive circuit
         Please design overheating malfunction preventive circuit with an enough margin in consideration of a permissible loss
         in the state of using actually.
    7)     About the short between terminals and the mounting by mistake
         Please note the direction and the gap of position of LSI enough about LSI when you mount on the substrate. LSI might
         be destroyed when mounting by mistake and energizing. Moreover, LSI might be destroyed when short-circuited by
         entering of the foreign substances between the terminal and GND, between terminals, between the terminal and the
         power supply of LSI.
    8)     About operation in strong electromagnetic field
         Use in strong electromagnetic field has the possibility of malfunctioning and evaluate it enough, please.
    9)     About recording
         Recording to a memory with slow access speed may require data connection operation.
         Recording to all the memories cannot be guaranteed.
   10)     Power off or memory disconnection under memory writing
         The sudden power off or memory disconnection during recording or file write operation to a memory may break the
         data in a memory.
   11)     Browsing operation
         With a memory with slow access speed, Browsing operation during music playing may generate skipping.
   12)     CD-ROM playing
         CD-ROM playing operation is premised on data being inputted so that an internal data buffer may not become empty.
         When an input does not meet the deadline and internal data buffers become empty, skipping occurs.
   13)     Playing time of MP3 file
         The playing time when MP3 file playing may shift when fast forward playing, rewinding playing, and VBR playing.
   14)     Write-in operation exceeding memory size
         When memory size is exceeded, IC will stop writing to a file and will be in an error condition.
   15)     Write-in operation of the file size exceeding FAT specification
         When file size is exceeded, IC will stop writing to a file and will be in an error condition.
   16)     About WMA
         Windows Media Audio is the music compression technology which Microsoft Corp. developed.
         Windows Media is the registered trademark of U.S. Microsoft Corporation in the U.S., and other countries.

    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used; if flow soldering method is preferred, please consult with the
        ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

Precaution for Electrostatic
    This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper
    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
               [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
               [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
               [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
               [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
         may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton.
    4.   Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of
         which storage time is exceeding the recommended storage time period.
