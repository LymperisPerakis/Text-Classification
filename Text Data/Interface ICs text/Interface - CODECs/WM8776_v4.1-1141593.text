Notes:
1.    Ratio of output level with 1kHz full scale input, to the output level with all zeros into the digital input, measured ‘A’
      weighted.
2.    All performance measurements done with 20kHz low pass filter, and where noted an A-weight filter. Failure to use
      such a filter will result in higher THD+N and lower SNR and Dynamic Range readings than are found in the Electrical
      Characteristics. The low pass filter removes out of band noise; although it is not audible it may affect dynamic
      specification values.
3.    VMID decoupled with 10uF and 0.1uF capacitors (smaller values may result in reduced performance).
4.    Harmonic distortion on the headphone output decreases with output power.
5.    All performance measurement done using certain timings conditions (Please refer to section ‘Digital Audio Interface’).
6.    A full digital MUTE can be achieved if the ADC gain (LAG/RAG) is set to minimum.
TERMINOLOGY
1.    Signal-to-noise ratio (dB) - SNR is a measure of the difference in level between the full scale output and the output
      with no signal applied. (No Auto-zero or Automute function is employed in achieving these results).
2.    Dynamic range (dB) - DNR is a measure of the difference between the highest and lowest portions of a signal.
      Normally a THD+N measurement at 60dB below full scale. The measured signal is then corrected by adding the 60dB
      to it. (e.g. THD+N @ -60dB= -32dB, DR= 92dB).
3.    THD+N (dB) - THD+N is a ratio, of the rms values, of (Noise + Distortion)/Signal.
4.    Stop band attenuation (dB) - Is the degree to which the frequency spectrum is attenuated (outside audio band).

5. Channel Separation (dB) - Also known as Cross-Talk. This is a measure of the amount one channel is isolated from
   the other. Normally measured by sending a full scale signal down one channel and measuring the other.
6. Pass-Band Ripple - Any variation of the frequency response in the pass-band region.

Note:
If MCLK period is longer than maximum specified above, power-saving mode is entered and DACs are powered down with
internal digital audio filters being reset. In this power-saving mode, all registers will retain their values and can be accessed
in the normal manner through the control interface. Once MCLK is restored, the DACs are automatically powered up, but a
write to the volume update register bit is required to restore the correct volume settings.

INTERNAL POWER ON RESET CIRCUIT
                          Figure 8 Internal Power on Reset Circuit Schematic
                          The WM8776 includes an internal Power on Reset Circuit which is used reset the digital logic into a
                          default state after power up.
                          Figure 8 shows a schematic of the internal POR circuit. The POR circuit is powered from AVDD. The
                          circuit monitors DVDD and VMID and asserts PORB low if DVDD or VMID are below the minimum
                          threshold Vpor_off.
                          On power up, the POR circuit requires AVDD to be present to operate. PORB is asserted low until
                          AVDD and DVDD and VMID are established. When AVDD, DVDD, and VMID have been
                          established, PORB is released high, all registers are in their default state and writes to the digital
                          interface may take place.
                          On power down, PORB is asserted low whenever DVDD or VMID drop below the minimum threshold
                          Vpor_off.
                          If AVDD is removed at any time, the internal Power on Reset circuit is powered down and PORB will
                          follow AVDD.
                          In most applications the time required for the device to release PORB high will be determined by the
                          charge time of the VMID node.

                          In a real application the designer is unlikely to have control of the relative power up sequence of
                          AVDD and DVDD. Using the POR circuit to monitor VMID ensures a reasonable delay between
                          applying power to the device and Device Ready.
                          Figure 9 and Figure 10 show typical power up scenarios in a real system. Both AVDD and DVDD
                          must be established and VMID must have reached the threshold Vporr before the device is ready
                          and can be written to. Any writes to the device before Device Ready will be ignored.
                          Figure 9 shows DVDD powering up before AVDD. Figure 10 shows AVDD powering up before
                          DVDD. In both cases, the time from applying power to Device Ready is dominated by the charge
                          time of VMID.
                          A 10uF cap is recommended for decoupling on VMID. The charge time for VMID will dominate the
                          time required for the device to become ready after power is applied. The time required for VMID to
                          reach the threshold is a function of the VMID resistor string and the decoupling capacitor. The
                          Resistor string has an typical equivalent resistance of 50kΩ (+/-20%). Assuming a 10uF capacitor,
                          the time required for VMID to reach threshold of 1V is approx 110ms.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION
               WM8776 is a complete 2-channel DAC, 2-channel ADC audio CODEC, with flexible input multiplexor
               including digital interpolation and decimation filters, multi-bit sigma delta stereo ADC, and switched
               capacitor multi-bit sigma delta DACs with analogue volume controls on each channel and output
               smoothing filters. It is available in a single package and controlled by either a 3-wire or 2-wire
               software interface. The 3-wire interface is compatible with the SPI standard.
               An analogue bypass path option is available, to allow stereo analogue signals from any of the 5
               stereo inputs to be sent to the stereo outputs via the main volume controls. This allows a purely
               analogue input to analogue output high quality signal path to be implemented if required.
               The DAC and ADC have separate left/right clocks, bit clocks, master clocks and data I/Os. The
               Audio Interface may be configured to operate in either master or slave mode. In Slave mode
               ADCLRC, DACLRC, ADCBCLK and DACBCLK are all inputs. In Master mode ADCLRC, DACLRC,
               ADCBCLK and DACBCLK are outputs.
               The input multiplexor to the ADC is configured to allow large signal levels to be input to the ADC,
               using external resistors to reduce the amplitude of larger signals to within the normal operating range
               of the ADC. The ADC has an analogue input PGA and a digital gain control, accessed by one
               register write. The input PGA allows input signals to be gained up to +24dB and attenuated down to
               -21dB in 0.5dB steps. The digital gain control allows attenuation from -21.5dB to -103dB in 0.5dB
               steps. This allows the user maximum flexibility in the use of the ADC.
               The DAC has its own digital volume control, which is adjustable between 0dB and -127.5dB in 0.5dB
               steps. There is also an analogue volume control on the headphone outputs, which is adjustable
               between +6dB and -73dB in 1dB steps. The analogue and digital volume controls may be operated
               independently. In addition a zero cross detect circuit is provided for both analogue and digital volume
               controls. When analogue volume zero-cross detection is enabled the attenuation values are only
               updated when the input signal to the gain stage is close to the analogue ground level. The digital
               volume control detects a transition through the zero point before updating the volume. This
               minimises audible clicks and ‘zipper’ noise as the gain values change.
               The DAC output incorporates an input selector and mixer allowing a signal to be either switched into
               the signal path in place of the DAC signal or mixed with the DAC signal before the volume control.
               Use of external resistors allows larger input levels to be accepted by the device, giving maximum
               user flexibility.
               Internal functionality is controlled by CE, CL, DI and MODE input pins. The MODE pin determines
               which of the two control interface modes is selected.
               Operation using system clock of 128fs, 192fs, 256fs, 384fs, 512fs or 768fs is provided. In Slave
               mode selection between clock rates is automatically controlled. In master mode the master clock to
               sample rate ratio is set by control bits ADCRATE and DACRATE. ADC and DAC may run at different
               rates and have their own bit clocks and master clocks.
               The audio data interface supports right, left and I2S interface formats along with a highly flexible DSP
               serial port interface.

AUDIO DATA SAMPLING RATES
                In a typical digital audio system there is only one central clock source producing a reference clock to
                which all audio data processing is synchronised. This clock is often referred to as the audio system’s
                Master Clock. The WM8776 uses separate master clocks for the ADC and DAC. The external master
                system clocks can be applied directly through the ADCMCLK and DACMCLK input pins with no
                software configuration necessary. In a system where there are a number of possible sources for the
                reference clock it is recommended that the clock source with the lowest jitter be used to optimise the
                performance of the ADC and DAC.
                The master clock for WM8776 supports DAC and ADC audio sampling rates from 256fs to 768fs,
                where fs is the audio sampling frequency (DACLRC or ADCLRC) typically 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz or
                96kHz (the DAC also supports operation at 128fs and 192fs and 192kHz sample rate). The master
                clock is used to operate the digital filters and the noise shaping circuits.
                In Slave mode the WM8776 has a master detection circuit that automatically determines the
                relationship between the master clock frequency and the sampling rate (to within +/- 32 system
                clocks). If there is a greater than 32 clocks error the interface is disabled and maintains the output
                level at the last sample. The master clock should be synchronised with ADCLRC/DACLRC for optical
                performance, although the WM8776 is tolerant of phase variations or jitter on this clock. Table 6
                shows the typical master clock frequency inputs for the WM8776.
                The signal processing for the WM8776 typically operates at an oversampling rate of 128fs for both
                ADC and DAC. The exception to this for the DAC is for operation with a 128/192fs system clock, e.g.
                for 192kHz operation where the oversampling rate is 64fs. For ADC operation at 96kHz it is
                recommended that the user set the ADCOSR bit. This changes the ADC signal processing
                oversample rate to 64fs.

             Table 8 Master Mode ADC/DACLRC Frequency Selection
             ADCBCLK and DACBCLK are also generated by the WM8776. The frequency of ADCBCLK and
             DACBCLK depends on the mode of operation.
             In 128/192fs modes (DACRATE=000 or 001) BCLK = MCLK/2. In 256/384/512fs modes
             (ADCRATE/DACRATE=010 or 011 or 100) BCLK = MCLK/4. However if DSP mode is selected as
             the audio interface mode then BCLK=MCLK. Note that DSP mode cannot be used in 128fs mode for
             word lengths greater than 16 bits or in 192fs mode for word lengths greater than 24 bits.
ZERO DETECT
             The WM8776 has a zero detect circuit for each DAC channel, which detects when 1024 consecutive
             zero samples have been input. The two zero flag outputs (ZFLAGL and ZFLAGR) may be
             programmed to output the zero detect signals (see Table 9) that may then be used to control external
             muting circuits. A ‘1’ on ZFLAGL or ZFLAGR indicates a zero detect. The zero detect may also be
             used to automatically enable the PGA mute by setting IZD. The zero flag output may be disabled by
             setting DZFM to 00. The zero flag signal for each DAC channel will only be enabled if it is enabled as
             an input to the output summing stage.

POWERDOWN MODES
             The WM8776 has powerdown control bits allowing specific parts of the WM8776 to be powered off
             when not being used. The 5-channel input source selector and input buffer may be powered down
             using control bit AINPD. When AINPD is set all inputs to the source selector (AIN1l/R to AIN5L/R)
             are switched to a buffered VMIDADC. Control bit ADCPD powers off the ADC and also the ADC input
             PGAs. The stereo DAC has a separate powerdown control bit, DACPD allowing the DAC and
             analogue output mixer to be powered off when not in use. This also switches the analogue outputs
             VOUTL/R to VMIDDAC to maintain a dc level on the output.
             Setting AINPD, ADCPD and DACPD will powerdown everything except the references VMIDADC,
             ADCREF and VMIDDAC. These may be powered down by setting PDWN. Setting PDWN will
             override all other powerdown control bits. It is recommended that AINPD, HPPD, ADCPD and
             DACPD are set before setting PDWN. The default is for all blocks to be enabled other than HPPD.

DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE
                MASTER AND SLAVE MODES
                The audio interface operates in either Slave or Master mode, selectable using the MS control bit. In
                both Master and Slave modes DIN is always an input to the WM8776 and DOUT is always an output.
                The default is Slave mode.
                In Slave mode (MS=0) ADCLRC, DACLRC, ADCBCLK and DACBCLK are inputs to the WM8776
                (Figure 11). DIN and DACLRC are sampled by the WM8776 on the rising edge of DACBCLK,
                ADCLRC is sampled on the rising edge of ADCBCLK. ADC data is output on DOUT and changes on
                the falling edge of ADCBCLK. By setting control bit BCLKINV the polarity of ADCBCLK and
                DACBCLK may be reversed so that DIN and DACLRC are sampled on the falling edge of DACBCLK,
                ADCLRC is sampled on the falling edge of ADCBCLK and DOUT changes on the rising edge of
                ADCBCLK.

                DIN is sampled by the WM8776 on the rising edge of DACBCLK so the controller must output DAC
                data that changes on the falling edge of DACBCLK. ADC data is output on DOUT and changes on
                the falling edge of ADCBCLK. By setting control bit BCLKINV, the polarity of ADCBCLK and

       AUDIO INTERFACE FORMATS
       Audio data is applied to the internal DAC filters or output from the ADC filters, via the Digital Audio
       Interface. 5 popular interface formats are supported:
       •      Left Justified mode
       •      Right Justified mode
       •      I2S mode
       •      DSP mode A
       •      DSP mode B
       All 5 formats send the MSB first and support word lengths of 16, 20, 24 and 32 bits, with the
       exception of 32 bit right justified mode, which is not supported.
       In left justified, right justified and I2S modes, the digital audio interface receives DAC data on the DIN
       input and outputs ADC data on DOUT. Audio Data for each stereo channel is time multiplexed with
       ADCLRC/DACLRC indicating whether the left or right channel is present. ADCLRC/DACLRC is also
       used as a timing reference to indicate the beginning or end of the data words.
       In left justified, right justified and I2S modes; the minimum number of BCLKs per DACLRC/ADCLRC
       period is 2 times the selected word length. ADCLRC/DACLRC must be high for a minimum of word
       length BCLKs and low for a minimum of word length BCLKs. Any mark to space ratio on
       ADCLRC/DACLRC is acceptable provided the above requirements are met.
       In DSP modes A or B, DACLRC is used as a frame sync signal to identify the MSB of the first word.
       The minimum number of DACBCLKs per DACLRC period is 2 times the selected word length. Any
       mark to space ratio is acceptable on DACLRC provided the rising edge is correctly positioned. The
       ADC data may also be output in DSP modes A or B, with ADCLRC used as a frame sync to identify
       the MSB of the first word. The minimum number of ADCBCLKs per ADCLRC period is 2 times the
       selected word length.
       LEFT JUSTIFIED MODE
       In left justified mode, the MSB of DIN is sampled by the WM8776 on the first rising edge of
       DACBCLK following a DACLRC transition. The MSB of the ADC data is output on DOUT and
       changes on the same falling edge of ADCBCLK as ADCLRC and may be sampled on the rising edge
       of ADCBCLK. ADCLRC and DACLRC are high during the left samples and low during the right
       samples (Figure 13).

                In DSP/PCM mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A)
                rising edge of BCLK (selectable by LRP) following a rising edge of LRC. Right channel data
                immediately follows left channel data. Depending on word length, BCLK frequency and sample rate,
                there may be unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of the right channel data and the next sample.
                In device master mode, the LRC output will resemble the frame pulse shown in Figure 16 and Figure
                17. In device slave mode, Figure 18 and Figure 19, it is possible to use any length of frame pulse
                less than 1/fs, providing the falling edge of the frame pulse occurs greater than one BCLK period

CONTROL INTERFACE OPERATION
                The WM8776 is controlled by writing to registers through a serial control interface. A control word
                consists of 16 bits. The first 7 bits (B15 to B9) are address bits that select which control register is
                accessed. The remaining 9 bits (B8 to B0) are data bits, corresponding to the 9 bits in each control
                register. The control interface can operate as either a 3-wire or 2-wire MPU interface. The MODE pin
                selects the interface format, as shown in Table 10. .

                In 3-wire mode, every rising edge of CL clocks in one data bit from the DI pin. A rising edge on CE
                latches in a complete control word consisting of the last 16 bits. The 3-wire interface protocol is
                shown in Figure 20.

       2-WIRE SERIAL CONTROL MODE
       The WM8776 supports software control via a 2-wire serial bus. Many devices can be controlled by
       the same bus, and each device has a unique 7-bit address (this is not the same as the 7-bit address
       of each register in the WM8776).
       The WM8776 operates as a slave device only. The controller indicates the start of data transfer with
       a high to low transition on DI while CL remains high. This indicates that a device address and data
       will follow. All devices on the 2-wire bus respond to the start condition and shift in the next eight bits
       on DI (7-bit address + Read/Write bit, MSB first). If the device address received matches the address
       of the WM8776 and the R/W bit is ‘0’, indicating a write, then the WM8776 responds by pulling DI low
       on the next clock pulse (ACK). If the address is not recognised or the R/W bit is ‘1’, the WM8776
       returns to the idle condition and wait for a new start condition and valid address.
       Once the WM8776 has acknowledged a correct address, the controller sends the first byte of control
       data (B15 to B8, i.e. the WM8776 register address plus the first bit of register data). The WM8776
       then acknowledges the first data byte by pulling DI low for one clock pulse. The controller then sends
       the second byte of control data (B7 to B0, i.e. the remaining 8 bits of register data), and the WM8776
       acknowledges again by pulling DI low.
       The transfer of data is complete when there is a low to high transition on DI while CL is high. After
       receiving a complete address and data sequence the WM8776 returns to the idle state and waits for
       another start condition. If a start or stop condition is detected out of sequence at any point during
       data transfer (i.e. DI changes while CL is high), the device jumps to the idle condition.

                In left justified, right justified or I2S modes, the LRP register bit controls the polarity of
                ADCLRC/DACLRC. If this bit is set high, the expected polarity of ADCLRC/DACLRC will be the
                opposite of that shown Figure 13, Figure 14, etc. Note that if this feature is used as a means of
                swapping the left and right channels, a 1 sample phase difference will be introduced. In DSP modes,
                the LRP register bit is used to select between early and late modes.

                on the rising edge of ADCBCLK/DACBCLK can be supported by setting the BCP register bit. Setting
                BCP to 1 inverts the polarity of BCLK to the inverse of that shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, etc.

       When operating the ADC digital interface in slave mode, to optimise the performance of the ADC it is
       recommended that the ADCMCLK and ADCBCLK input signals do not have coinciding rising edges.
       The ADCMCLK bit provides the option to internally invert the ADCMCLK input signal when the input
       signals have coinciding rising edges.

                ADC OVERSAMPLING RATE SELECT
                For ADC operation at 96kHz it is recommended that the user set the ADCOSR bit. This changes the
                ADC signal processing oversample rate to 64fs.

                Figure 22 Application and Release of Soft Mute
                Figure 22 shows the application and release of DMUTE whilst a full amplitude sinusoid is being
                played at 48kHz sampling rate. When DMUTE (lower trace) is asserted, the output (upper trace)
                begins to decay exponentially from the DC level of the last input sample. The output will decay
                towards VMID with a time constant of approximately 64 input samples. If DMUTE is applied to both
                channels for 1024 or more input samples the DAC will be muted if IZD is set. When DMUTE is de-
                asserted, the output will restart immediately from the current input sample.
                Note that all other means of muting the DAC: setting the PL[3:0] bits to 0, setting the PDWN bit or
                setting attenuation to 0 will cause much more abrupt muting of the output.

       ADC MUTE
       Each ADC channel also has an individual mute control bit, which mutes the input to the ADC PGA.
       By setting the LRBOTH bit (reg22, bit 8) both channels can be muted simultaneously.

       POWERDOWN MODE AND ADC/DAC DISABLE
       Setting the PDWN register bit immediately powers down the WM8776, including the references,
       overriding all other powerdown control bits. All trace of the previous input samples is removed, but all
       control register settings are preserved. When PDWN is cleared, the digital filters will be re-initialised.
       It is recommended that the 5-channel input mux and buffer, ADC and DAC are powered down before
       setting PDWN.

Table 12 Headphone Attenuation Register Map
                          Each analogue headphone output channel has a PGA which can be used to attenuate the output
                          from that channel. The PGA’s can be powered up or down using the HPPD bit. Attenuation is 0dB by
                          default but can be set between +6dB and –73dB in 1dB steps using the two Attenuation control
                          words. The attenuation registers are double latched allowing them to be updated in pairs. Setting the
                          UPDATE bit on an attenuation write to one channel, for example HPOUTL, will cause the pre-latched
                          value in HPOUTR to be applied to the PGA. A master attenuation register is also included, allowing
                          both volume levels to be set to the same value in a single write.
                          Note: The UPDATE bit is not latched. If UPDATE=0, the Attenuation value will be written to the pre-
                          latch but not applied to the PGA. If UPDATE=1, pre-latched values will be applied from the next input
                          sample. Writing to HPMASTA[6:0] overwrites any values previously sent to HPLA[6:0] and
                          HPRA[6:0].
                           HEADPHONE OUTPUT PGA ATTENUATION
                          The analogue output PGAs are controlled by the HPLA and HPRA registers. Register bits MASTA
                          can be used to control attenuation of both channels.
                          Table 13 shows how the attenuation levels are selected from the 7-bit words.

                       In addition a zero cross detect circuit is provided for the output PGA volume under the control of bit 7
                       (ZCEN) in the each attenuation register. When ZCEN is set the attenuation values are only updated
                       when the input signal to the gain stage is close to the analogue ground level. This minimises audible
                       clicks and ‘zipper’ noise as the gain values change. A timeout clock is also provided which will
                       generate an update after a minimum of 131072 master clocks (= ~10.5ms with a master clock of
                       12.288MHz). The timeout clock may be disabled by setting TOD.

       ADC GAIN CONTROL
       The ADC has an analogue input PGA and digital gain control for each stereo channel. Both the
       analogue and digital gains are adjusted by the same register, LAG for the left and RAG for the right.
       The analogue PGA has a range of +24dB to -21dB in 0.5dB steps. The digital gain control allows
       further attenuation (after the ADC) from -21.5dB to -103dB in 0.5dB steps. Table 15 shows how the
       register maps the analogue and digital gains.

       In addition, a zero cross detect circuit is provided for the input PGA, controlled by bit 8 in each
       attenuation register. This minimises audible clicks and ‘zipper’ noise by updating the gain when the
       signal crosses the zero level.

                      In addition a zero cross detect circuit is provided for the output PGA volume under the control of bit 7
                      (ZCEN) in the each attenuation register. When ZCEN is set the attenuation values are only updated
                      when the input signal to the gain stage is close to the analogue ground level. This minimises audible
                      clicks and ‘zipper’ noise as the gain values change. A timeout clock is also provided which will
                      generate an update after a minimum of 131072 master clocks (= ~10.5ms with a master clock of
                      12.288MHz). The timeout clock may be disabled by setting TOD.
                      Left and right inputs may also be independently muted. The LRBOTH control bit allows the user to
                      write the same attenuation value to both left and right volume control registers, saving on software
                      writes. The ADC volume and mute also applies to the bypass signal path.

LIMITER / AUTOMATIC LEVEL CONTROL (ALC)
                 The WM8776 has an automatic pga gain control circuit, which can function as a peak limiter or as an
                 automatic level control (ALC). In peak limiter mode, a digital peak detector detects when the input
                 signal goes above a predefined level and will ramp the pga gain down to prevent the signal becoming
                 too large for the input range of the ADC. When the signal returns to a level below the threshold, the
                 pga gain is slowly returned to its starting level. The peak limiter cannot increase the pga gain above
                 its static level.

                 In ALC mode, the circuit aims to keep a constant recording volume irrespective of the input signal
                 level. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the PGA gain so that the signal level at the ADC
                 input remains constant. A digital peak detector monitors the ADC output and changes the PGA gain
                 if necessary.

                The limiter function only operates in stereo, which means that the peak detector takes the maximum
                of left and right channel peak values, and any new gain setting is applied to both left and right PGAs,
                so that the stereo image is preserved. However, the ALC function can also be enabled on one
                channel only. In this case, only one PGA is controlled by the ALC mechanism, while the other
                channel runs independently with its PGA gain set through the control register.
                When enabled, the threshold for the limiter or target level for the ALC is programmed using the LCT
                control bits. This allows the threshold/target level to be programmed between -1dB and -16dB in 1dB
                steps.

                ATTACK AND DECAY TIMES
                The limiter and ALC have different attack and decay times which determine their operation. However,
                the attack and decay times are defined slightly differently for the limiter and for the ALC. DCY and
                ATK control the decay and attack times, respectively.
                Decay time (Gain Ramp-Up). When in ALC mode, this is defined as the time that it takes for the
                PGA gain to ramp up across 90% of its range (e.g. from –21dB up to +20 dB). When in limiter mode,
                it is defined as the time it takes for the gain to ramp up by 6dB.
                The decay time can be programmed in power-of-two (2n) steps. For the ALC this gives times from
                33.6ms, 67.2ms, 134.4ms etc. to 34.41s. For the limiter this gives times from 1.2ms, 2.4ms etc., up
                to 1.2288s.
                Attack time (Gain Ramp-Down) When in ALC mode, this is defined as the time that it takes for the
                PGA gain to ramp down across 90% of its range (e.g. from +20dB down to -21dB gain). When in
                limiter mode, it is defined as the time it takes for the gain to ramp down by 6dB.
                The attack time can be programmed in power-of-two (2n) steps, from 8.4ms, 16.8ms, 33.6ms etc. to
                8.6s for the ALC and from 250us, 500us, etc. up to 256ms.
                The time it takes for the recording level to return to its target value or static gain value therefore
                depends on both the attack/decay time and on the gain adjustment required. If the gain adjustment is
                small, it will be shorter than the attack/decay time.

       TRANSIENT WINDOW (LIMITER ONLY)
       To prevent the limiter responding to to short duration high ampitude signals (such as hand-claps in a
       live performance), the limiter has a programmable transient window preventing it responding to
       signals above the threshold until their duration exceeds the window period. The Transient window is
       set in register TRANWIN.

                MAXIMUM GAIN (ALC ONLY) AND MAXIMUM ATTENUATION
                To prevent low level signals being amplified too much by the ALC, the MAXGAIN register sets the
                upper limit for the gain. This prevents low level noise being over-amplified. The MAXGAIN register
                has no effect on the limiter operation.
                The MAXATTEN register has different operation for the limiter and for the ALC. For the limiter it
                defines the maximum attenuation below the static (user programmed) gain. For the ALC, it defines
                the lower limit for the gain.

                2.67ms, 5.33ms, 10.67ms etc. up to 43.7ms. Alternatively, the hold time can also be set to zero. The
                hold time only applies to gain ramp-up, there is no delay before ramping the gain down when the
                signal level is above target.

                ramped down at the maximum attack rate (as when ATK = 0000), until the signal level falls below
                87.5% of full scale. This function is automatically enabled whenever the ALC is enabled.
                (Note: If ATK = 0000, then the overload detector makes no difference to the operation of the ALC. It
                is designed to prevent clipping when long attack times are used).

       NOISE GATE (ALC ONLY)
       When the signal is very quiet and consists mainly of noise, the ALC function may cause “noise
       pumping”, i.e. loud hissing noise during silence periods. The WM8776 has a noise gate function that
       prevents noise pumping by comparing the signal level at the AINL1/2/3/4/5 and/or AINR1/2/3/4/5 pins
       against a noise gate threshold, NGTH. The noise gate cuts in when:
       •     Signal level at ADC [dB] < NGTH [dB] + PGA gain [dB] + Mic Boost gain [dB]
       This is equivalent to:
       •     Signal level at input pin [dB] < NGTH [dB]
       When the noise gate is triggered, the PGA gain is held constant (preventing it from ramping up as it
       would normally when the signal is quiet).
       The table below summarises the noise gate control register. The NGTH control bits set the noise
       gate threshold with respect to the ADC full-scale range. The threshold is adjusted in 6dB steps.
       Levels at the extremes of the range may cause inappropriate operation, so care should be taken with
       set–up of the function. Note that the noise gate only works in conjunction with the ALC function, and
       always operates on the same channel(s) as the ALC (left, right, both, or none).

                being digitised by the ADC. For example, if AMX[4:0] is 00101, the input signal to the ADC will be
                (AIN1L+AIN3L) on the left channel and (AIN1R+AIN3R) on the right channel.
                However if the analogue input buffer is powered down, by setting AINPD, then all 5-channel mixer
                inputs are switched to buffered VMIDADC.

       OUTPUT SELECT AND ENABLE CONTROL
       Register bits MX controls the output selection. The output select block consists of a summing stage
       and an input select switch for each input allowing each signal to be output individually or summed
       with other signals and output on the analogue output. The default for the output is DAC playback
       only. VOUT may be selected to output DAC playback, AUX, analogue bypass or a sum of these
       using the output select controls MX[2:0]. For example, to select sum of DAC and AUX, set MX[2:0] to
       011.
       The output mixer is powered down with DACD.

APPLICATIONS INFORMATION
EXTERNAL CIRCUIT CONFIGURATION
                In order to allow the use of 2V rms and larger inputs to the ADC and AUX inputs, a structure is used
                that uses external resistors to drop these larger voltages. This also increases the robustness of the
                circuit to external abuse such as ESD pulses. Figure 41 shows the ADC input multiplexor circuit with
                external components allowing 2Vrms inputs to be applied.

                It is recommended that a low pass filter be applied to the output from the DAC for hi-fi applications.
                Typically a second order filter is suitable and provides sufficient attenuation of high frequency
                components (the unique low order, high bit count multi-bit sigma delta DAC structure used in
                WM8776 produces much less high frequency output noise). This filter is typically also used to
                provide the 2x gain needed to provide the standard 2Vrms output level from most consumer
                equipment. Figure 44 shows a suitable post DAC filter circuit, with 2x gain. Alternative inverting filter
                architectures might also be used with as good results.
