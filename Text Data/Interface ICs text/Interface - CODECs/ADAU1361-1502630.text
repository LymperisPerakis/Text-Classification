TYPICAL POWER MANAGEMENT MEASUREMENTS
Master clock = 12.288 MHz, integer PLL, input sample rate = 48 kHz, input tone = 1 kHz. Pseudo-differential input to ADCs, DACs to
line output with 10 kΩ load. ADC input @ −1 dBFS, DAC input @ 0 dBFS. In Table 4, the mixer boost and power management conditions
are set for MXBIAS[1:0], ADCBIAS[1:0], HPBIAS[1:0], and DACBIAS[1:0]. RBIAS[1:0] and PBIAS[1:0] do not have an extreme power
saving mode and are therefore set for power saving mode in the extreme power saving rows in Table 4.

Pin No.   Mnemonic             Type1     Description
1         IOVDD                PWR       Supply for Digital Input and Output Pins. The digital output pins are supplied from IOVDD,
                                         which also sets the highest input voltage that should be seen on the digital input pins.
                                         IOVDD should be set between 1.8 V and 3.3 V. The current draw of this pin is variable because
                                         it is dependent on the loads of the digital outputs. IOVDD should be decoupled to DGND
                                         with a 100 nF capacitor and a 10 μF capacitor.
2         MCLK                 D_IN      External Master Clock Input.
3         ADDR0/CLATCH         D_IN      I2C Address Bit 0 (ADDR0).
                                         SPI Latch Signal (CLATCH). Must go low at the beginning of an SPI transaction and high at the
                                         end of a transaction. Each SPI transaction can take a different number of CCLKs to complete,
                                         depending on the address and read/write bit that are sent at the beginning of the SPI
                                         transaction.
4         JACKDET/MICIN        D_IN      Detect Insertion/Removal of Headphone Plug (JACKDET).
                                         Digital Microphone Stereo Input (MICIN).

7         CM                   A_OUT     AVDD/2 V Common-Mode Reference. A 10 μF to 47 μF standard decoupling capacitor should
                                         be connected between this pin and AGND to reduce crosstalk between the ADCs and DACs.
                                         This pin can be used to bias external analog circuits, as long as they are not drawing current
                                         from CM (for example, the noninverting input of an op amp).
8         AVDD                 PWR       1.8 V to 3.65 V Analog Supply for DAC and Microphone Bias. This pin should be decoupled
                                         locally to AGND with a 100 nF capacitor.
9         AGND                 PWR       Analog Ground. The AGND and DGND pins can be tied together on a common ground plane.
                                         AGND should be decoupled locally to AVDD with a 100 nF capacitor.

Integer Mode
Integer mode is used when the MCLK is an integer (R) multiple
of the PLL output (1024 × fS).
For example, if MCLK = 12.288 MHz and fS = 48 kHz, then
      PLL required output = 1024 × 48 kHz = 49.152 MHz
      R = 49.152 MHz/12.288 MHz = 4
In integer mode, the values set for N and M are ignored.

Microphone Bias
The MICBIAS pin provides a voltage reference for electret analog
microphones. The MICBIAS voltage is set in Register R10
(record microphone bias control register, Address 0x4010). In
this register, the MICBIAS output can be enabled or disabled.
Additional options include high performance operation and a
gain boost. The gain boost provides two different voltage biases:
0.65 × AVDD or 0.90 × AVDD. When enabled, the high perfor-
mance bit increases supply current to the microphone bias
circuit to decrease rms input noise.
The MICBIAS pin can also be used to cleanly supply voltage
to digital microphones or analog microphones with separate
power supply pins.

 close rapidly. This causes an unpleasant sound.

 To reduce this effect, the noise gate in the ADAU1361 uses a
 combination of a timeout period and hysteresis. The timeout
 period is set to 250 ms, so the signal must consistently be below

In mobile phone applications, excessive 217 Hz GSM noise on
the analog supply pins can degrade the audio quality. To avoid
this problem, it is recommended that an L-C filter be used in
series with the bypass capacitors for the AVDD pins. This filter
should consist of a 1.2 nH inductor and a 9.1 pF capacitor in
series between AVDD and ground, as shown in Figure 63.

R3: Record Power Management, 16,393 (0x4009)
This register manages the power consumption for the record path. In particular, the current distribution for the mixer boosts, ADCs,
record path mixers, and PGAs can be set to one of four modes. These settings are normal operation, power saving mode, enhanced
performance mode, and extreme power saving mode. Each of these modes draws current from a central bias. Enhanced performance
mode offers the highest performance with the trade-off of higher power consumption.

R67: Dejitter Control, 16,438 (0x4036)
The dejitter control register allows the size of the dejitter window to be set, and also allows all dejitter circuits in the device to be activated or
bypassed. Dejitter circuits protect against duplicate samples or skipped samples due to jitter from the serial ports in slave mode. Disabling
and reenabling certain subsystems in the device—that is, the ADCs, serial ports, and DACs—during operation can cause the associated
dejitter circuits to fail. As a result, audio data fails to be output to the next subsystem in the device.
When the serial ports are in master mode, the dejitter circuit can be bypassed by setting the dejitter window to 0. When the serial ports
are in slave mode, the dejitter circuit can be reinitialized prior to outputting audio from the device, guaranteeing that audio is output
to the next subsystem in the device. Any time that audio must pass through the ADCs, serial port, or DACs, the dejitter circuit can be
bypassed and reset by setting the dejitter window size to 0. In this way, the dejitter circuit can be immediately reactivated, without a wait
period, by setting the dejitter window size to the default value of 3.
