Description
The CS47L90 is a highly integrated, low-power audio and sensor hub system for smartphones, tablets, and other portable
audio devices. It combines an advanced DSP feature set with a flexible, high-performance audio hub codec. The CS47L90
combines seven programmable DSP cores with a variety of power-efficient fixed-function audio processors. Extensive
GPIO and I2C master interfaces enable powerful sensor fusion functions to be integrated.
Three hi-fi quality stereo headphone drivers are provided, supporting stereo ground-referenced or mono bridge-tied load
(BTL) configurations, with noise levels as low as 0.45 VRMS into line or headphone loads. Selectable hi-fi filters support
playback modes at sample rates up to 192 kHz.
The DSP cores support multiple concurrent audio features, including multimic wideband noise reduction,
high-performance acoustic-echo cancelation (AEC), stereo ambient noise cancelation (ANC), speech enhancement,
advanced media enhancement, and many more. Support for third-party DSP programming provides far-reaching
opportunities for product differentiation. The DSP cores are integrated within a fully flexible, all-digital mixing and routing
engine with sample rate converters, for wide use-case flexibility.
A SLIMbus interface supports multichannel audio paths and host control register access. Four further digital audio
interfaces are provided, each supporting a wide range of standard audio sample rates and serial interface formats.
Automatic sample-rate detection enables seamless wideband/narrowband voice-call handover.
The CS47L90 supports up to 7 analog inputs and up to 10 PDM digital inputs. Low-power input modes are available for
always-on (e.g., voice-trigger) functionality using either analog or digital input. A smart accessory interface, with
multipurpose impedance sensing and measurement capability, supports detection of external headsets and push buttons.
Dual headphone connections (e.g., 3.5-mm and USB-C™) can be detected simultaneously.
Two channels of PDM output (one stereo interface) are available, and also an IEC-60958-3–compatible S/PDIF
transmitter. A signal generator for controlling haptics devices is included; vibe actuators can connect directly to the PDM
output interface. All inputs, outputs, and system interfaces can function concurrently.
The CS47L90 is configured using the SLIMbus, SPI™, or IC interfaces. Three integrated FLLs support a wide range of
system-clock frequencies. The device is powered from 1.8- and 1.2-V supplies. The power, clocking, and output driver
architectures are designed to maximize battery life in voice, music, and standby modes. Low-power (10 A) Sleep Mode
is supported, with configurable wake-up events.

3 Characteristics and Specifications
Table 3-1 defines parameters as they are characterized in this section.
Table 3-1. Parameter Definitions
         Parameter                                                                    Definition
Channel separation            Left-to-right and right-to-left channel separation is the difference in level between the active channel (driven to
                              maximum full scale output) and the measured signal level in the idle channel at the test signal frequency. The active
                              channel is configured and supplied with an appropriate input signal to drive a full scale output, with signal measured
                              at the output of the associated idle channel.
Common-mode rejection         The ratio of a specified input signal (applied to both sides of a differential input), relative to the output signal that
ratio (CMRR)                  results from it.
Dynamic range (DR)            A measure of the difference between the maximum full scale output signal and the sum of all harmonic distortion
                              products plus noise, with a low-level input signal applied. Typically, an input signal level 60 dB below full scale is
                              used.
Power-supply rejection        The ratio of a specified power supply variation relative to the output signal that results from it. PSRR is measured
ratio (PSRR)                  under quiescent signal path conditions.
Signal-to-noise ratio         A measure of the difference in level between the maximum full scale output signal and the output with no input signal
(SNR)                         applied.
Total harmonic distortion     The ratio of the RMS sum of the harmonic distortion products in the specified bandwidth 1 relative to the RMS
(THD)                         amplitude of the fundamental (i.e., test frequency) output.
Total harmonic distortion     The ratio of the RMS sum of the harmonic distortion products plus noise in the specified bandwidth 1 relative to the
plus noise (THD+N)            RMS amplitude of the fundamental (i.e., test frequency) output.
1.All performance measurements are specified with a 20-kHz low-pass brick-wall filter and, where noted, an A-weighted filter. The low-pass filter
  removes out-of-band noise.
Table 3-2. Absolute Maximum Ratings
Absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. Permanent damage to the device may be caused by continuously operating at or beyond these limits.
Device functional operating limits and guaranteed performance specifications are given under electrical characteristics at the test conditions specified.

            ESD-sensitive device. The CS47L90 is manufactured on a CMOS process. It is therefore generically susceptible to damage from
            excessive static voltages. Proper ESD precautions must be taken during handling and storage of this device. This device is qualified
            to current JEDEC ESD standards.
1.The DCVDD and FLLVDD pins should be tied to a common supply rail. The associated power domain is referred to as DCVDD.
2.The AVDD1 and AVDD2 pins should be tied together. The associated power domain is referred to as AVDD.
3.The MICDETn and HPOUTFBn functions share common pins. The absolute maximum rating varies according to the applicable function of each pin.
   The HPOUTFBn ratings are applicable if the HP1_GND_SEL or HP2_GND_SEL bits select the respective pin for HPOUT ground feedback.
4.If AVDD > MICVDD (e.g., if LDO2 is disabled), the maximum JACKDET2 voltage is AVDD + 0.3 V.
5.CP1VOUT2N is an internal supply, generated by the CS47L90 charge pump (CP1). Its voltage can vary between CPGND and –CPVDD1.
6.The AGND1 and AGND2 pins should be tied together. The associated ground domain is referred to as AGND.

 Note: There are no power sequencing requirements; the supplies may be enabled and disabled in any order.
1.The DCVDD and FLLVDD pins should be tied to a common supply rail. The associated power domain is referred to as DCVDD.
2.Sleep mode is supported for when DCVDD is below the limits noted, provided that AVDD and DBVDD1 are present.
3.It is recommended to connect a 100- resistor in series with the FLLVDD pin connection. Note that the minimum voltage limit applies at the supply
   end of the 100- resistor in this case.
4.If the SLIMbus interface is enabled, the maximum DBVDD1 voltage is 1.98 V.
5.The AVDD1 and AVDD2 pins should be tied together. The associated power domain is referred to as AVDD.
6.The AGND1 and AGND2 pins should be tied together. The associated ground domain is referred to as AGND.
7.An internal charge pump and LDO (powered by CPVDD1) provide the mic bias supply; the MICVDD pin must not be connected to an external supply.
8.The impedance between DGND, AGND, and SUBGND must not exceed 0.1 .
9.If the DCVDD rise time exceeds 2 ms, RESET must be asserted during the rise and held asserted until after DCVDD is within the recommended
   operating limits.
10.The specified minimum power supply rise times assume a minimum decoupling capacitance of 100 nF per pin. However, Cirrus Logic strongly
   advises that the recommended decoupling capacitors are present on the PCB and that appropriate layout guidelines are observed. The specified
   minimum power supply rise times also assume a maximum PCB inductance of 10 nH between decoupling capacitor and pin.

 Notes:
  • The full-scale input signal level is also the maximum analog input level, before clipping occurs.
  • The full-scale input signal level changes in proportion with AVDD. For differential input, it is calculated as AVDD/1.8.
  • A 1.0VRMS differential signal equates to 0.5VRMS/–6dBV per input.
  • A sinusoidal input signal is assumed.

Note: The DMIC input signal level is measured in dBFS, where 0 dBFS is a signal level equal to the full-scale range (FSR) of the PDM input.
The FSR is defined as the amplitude of a 1 kHz sine wave whose positive and negative peaks are represented by the maximum and
minimum digital codes respectively—this is the largest 1-kHz sine wave that can fit in the digital output range without clipping. Note that,
because the definition of FSR is based on a sine wave, the PDM data format can support signals larger than 0 dBFS.

2.The timing of the AIFnLRCLK signal is selectable. If the LRCLK advance option is enabled, the LRCLK transition is timed relative to the preceding
  BCLK edge. Under the required condition that BCLK is inverted in this case, the LRCLK transition is still timed relative to the falling BCLK edge.

Notes:
 • The signal timing information describes the timing requirements of the SLIMbus interface as a whole, not just the CS47L90 device.
 • TDV is the propagation delay from the rising SLIMCLK edge (at CS47L90 input) to the SLIMDAT output being achieved at the input to all
   devices across the bus.
 • TSETUP is the set-up time for SLIMDAT input (at CS47L90), relative to the falling SLIMCLK edge (at CS47L90).
 • TH is the hold time for SLIMDAT input (at CS47L90) relative to the falling SLIMCLK edge (at CS47L90).
 • For more details of the interface timing, refer to the MIPI Alliance Specification for Serial Low-Power Inter-Chip Media Bus (SLIMbus)

                                                                                                                   CS47L90
                                                                                                                  4.1 Overview
A flexible clocking arrangement supports a wide variety of external clock references, including clocking derived from the
digital audio interface. Three frequency-locked loop (FLL) circuits provide additional flexibility for system clocking,
including low-power always-on operation. Seamless switching between clock sources is supported, and free-running
modes are also available.
Unused circuitry can be disabled under software control to save power; low leakage currents enable extended standby/off
time in portable battery-powered applications. The CS47L90 always-on circuitry can be used in conjunction with the
applications processor to wake up the device following a headphone jack-detection event.
Versatile GPIO functionality is provided, including support for external accessory/push-button detection inputs.
Comprehensive interrupt functions, with status reporting, are also provided.
4.1.1      Hi-Fi Audio Codec
The CS47L90 is a high-performance, low-power audio codec that uses a simple analog architecture. Four ADCs are
incorporated, with multiplexers to support up to seven analog inputs. Six DACs are incorporated, providing a dedicated
DAC for each analog output channel.
The audio codec is controlled directly via register access. The simple analog architecture, combined with the integrated
tone generator, enables straightforward device configuration and testing, minimizing debug time and reducing software
effort.
Seven analog inputs are provided, each supporting single-ended or differential input modes. In differential mode, the input
path SNR is 104 dB (16-kHz sample rate, i.e., wideband voice mode). The ADC input paths can be bypassed, supporting
up to 10 channels of DMIC input. The input paths can be configured for low-power operation, ideal for analog or digital
microphone input in always-on applications.
The analog outputs comprise three 33-mW (127 dB SNR) stereo headphone amplifiers with ground-referenced output.
The output drivers are designed to support as many different system architectures as possible and are compatible with
line or headphone loads in single-ended or differential (BTL) configurations. Each output has a dedicated DAC that allows
mixing, equalization, filtering, gain, and other audio processing to be configured independently for each channel—this
allows each signal path to be individually tailored for the load characteristics. Selectable hi-fi filters support audiophile
playback modes at sample rates up to 192 kHz. All outputs have integrated pop and click suppression features.
The headphone output drivers are ground-referenced, powered from an integrated charge pump, enabling high quality,
power efficient headphone playback without any requirement for DC blocking capacitors. Ground loop feedback is
incorporated, providing rejection of noise on the ground connections.
The CS47L90 is cost optimized for a wide range of mobile phone applications. External speaker amplifiers can be
connected using the stereo PDM outputs; this can ease layout and electromagnetic compatibility by avoiding the need to
run high-power speaker outputs over a long distance and across interconnects.
4.1.2      Digital Audio Core
The CS47L90 uses a core architecture based on all-digital signal routing, making digital audio effects available on all signal
paths, regardless of whether the source data input is analog or digital. The digital mixing desk allows different audio effects
to be applied simultaneously on many independent paths, while supporting a variety of sample rates. This helps support
many new audio use cases. Soft mute and unmute control allows smooth transitions between use cases without
interrupting existing audio streams elsewhere.
The CS47L90 digital core provides an extensive capability for programmable signal-processing algorithms. The
SoundClear suite of software algorithms enable advanced multimic audio features, such as transmit (TX) path noise
reduction, AEC, wind-noise reduction, and other programmable filters. Enhancements such as DRC and MBC are also
provided.
The digital core also provides signal-processing capability for sensor hub functions of the CS47L90. Sensors and
accessories can be connected through three master I2C interfaces; the programmable DSP, together with peripheral timer
and event-logging functions, enables applications to use these inputs to support increased contextual awareness,
including advanced motion sensing and navigation functionality.

                                                                                                                   4.1 Overview
The ANC processor within the CS47L90 provides the capability to improve the intelligibility of a voice call by using
destructive interference to reduce the acoustic energy of the ambient sound. Transmit (TX) path noise reduction and
multimic AEC algorithms are also supported. The CS47L90 is ideal for mobile telephony, providing enhanced voice
communication quality for both near-end and far-end users in a wide variety of applications. The SoundClear Control voice
command recognition software is supported, for low-power always-on features.
Highly flexible digital mixing, including mixing between audio interfaces, is possible. The CS47L90 performs multichannel
full-duplex asynchronous sample-rate conversion, providing use-case flexibility across a broad range of system
architectures. Automatic sample-rate detection is provided, enabling seamless wideband/narrowband voice call handover.
DRC functions are available for optimizing audio signal levels. In playback modes, the DRC can be used to maximize
loudness, while limiting the signal level to avoid distortion, clipping, or battery droop, for high-power output drivers such as
speaker amplifiers. In record modes, the DRC assists in applications where the signal level is unpredictable.
The five-band parametric EQ functions can be used to compensate for the frequency characteristics of the output
transducers. EQ functions can be cascaded to provide additional frequency control. Programmable high-pass and
low-pass filters are also available for general filtering applications, such as removal of wind and other low-frequency noise.
4.1.3       Digital Interfaces
Four serial digital audio interfaces (AIFs) each support PCM, TDM, and I2S data formats for compatibility with most
industry-standard chipsets. AIF1 and AIF2 support eight input/output channels; AIF3 and AIF4 support two input/output
channels each. Bidirectional operation at sample rates up to 192 kHz is supported. Data words of up to 32 bits can be
routed through AIF1 and AIF3. Data-format conversion (DFC) functions are available to support different interface
standards on the input and output signal paths.
Ten digital PDM input channels are available (five stereo interfaces); these are typically used for digital microphones,
powered from the integrated MICBIAS power-supply regulators. Two PDM output channels are also available (one stereo
interface); these are typically used for external power amplifiers. Embedded mute codes provide a control mechanism for
external PDM-input devices.
The CS47L90 features a SLIMbus interface, compliant with the MIPI® SLIMbus specification, providing eight channels of
audio input/output. Mixed audio sample rates are supported on the SLIMbus interface. The SLIMbus interface also
supports read/write access to the CS47L90 control registers.
An IEC-60958-3–compatible S/PDIF transmitter is incorporated, enabling stereo S/PDIF output on a GPIO pin. Standard
S/PDIF sample rates of 32–192 kHz are supported.
Control register access and high bandwidth data transfer are supported by two slave SPI interfaces and a slave I2C control
interface. The SPI interfaces operate up to 26 MHz; the I2C slave interface operates up to 3.4 MHz. Full access to the
register map is also provided via the SLIMbus port.
The CS47L90 incorporates three master I2C interfaces, offering capability for additional sensor/accessory input. Typical
sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers for motion sensing and navigation applications. Other
example accessories include barometers, or ambient light sensors, for environmental awareness.
4.1.4       Other Features
The CS47L90 incorporates a tone generator that can be used for beep functions through any of the audio signal paths.
The tone generator provides two 1-kHz outputs, with configurable phase relationship, offering flexibility to create
differential signals or test scenarios.
A white-noise generator is provided that can be routed within the digital core. The noise generator can provide comfort
noise in cases where silence (digital mute) is not desirable.
Two pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal generators are incorporated. The duty cycle of each PWM signal can be
modulated by an audio source or can be set to a fixed value using a control register setting. The PWM signal generators
can be output directly on a GPIO pin.

The CS47L90 supports up to 38 GPIO pins, offering a range of input/output functions for interfacing, for detection of
external hardware, and for providing logic outputs to other devices. The CS47L90 provides 8 dedicated GPIO pins; a
further 30 GPIOs are multiplexed with other functions. Comprehensive interrupt functionality is also provided for monitoring
internal and external event conditions.
A signal generator for controlling haptics devices is included, compatible with both eccentric rotating mass (ERM) and
linear resonant actuator (LRA) haptics devices. The haptics signal generator is highly configurable and can execute
programmable drive event profiles, including reverse drive control. An external vibe actuator can be driven using the PDM
digital output path.
The CS47L90 incorporates eight general-purpose timers, providing support for the sensor-hub connectivity. Sensor event
logging, and other real time application functions, allows many advanced functions to be implemented with a high degree
of autonomy from a host processor.
A smart accessory interface is included, supporting a wide variety of system configurations. Jack detection, accessory
sensing, and impedance measurement is provided, for external headset and push-button detection. Dual headphone
connections (e.g., 3.5 mm and USB-C) can be detected simultaneously. Accessory detection can be used as a wake-up
trigger from low-power standby. Microphone activity detection with interrupt is also available.
System clocking can be derived from the MCLK1 or MCLK2 input pins. Alternatively, the SLIMbus interface, or the audio
interfaces (configured in Slave Mode), can be used to provide a clock reference. The CS47L90 also provides three
integrated FLL circuits for clock frequency conversion and stability. The flexible clocking architecture supports low-power
always-on operation, with reference frequencies down to 32 kHz. Seamless switching between clock sources is
supported; free-running FLL modes are also available.
The CS47L90 is powered from 1.8- and 1.2-V external supplies. Integrated charge-pump and LDO-regulator circuits are
used to generate supply rails for internal functions and to support powering or biasing of external microphones. Power
consumption is optimized across a wide variety of voice and multimedia use cases.
4.2 Input Signal Path
The CS47L90 provides flexible input channels, supporting up to 7 analog inputs or up to 10 digital inputs. Selectable
combinations of analog (mic or line) and digital inputs are multiplexed into five stereo input signal paths. Input paths IN1
and IN2 support analog and digital inputs; Input paths IN3, IN4, and IN5 support digital inputs only.
The analog input paths support single-ended and differential configurations, programmable gain control, and are digitized
using a high performance sigma-delta ADC. The IN2 analog input paths can be configured for low-power operation, ideal
for always-on applications.
The digital input paths interface directly with external digital microphones; a separate microphone interface clock is
provided for five separate stereo pairs of digital microphones.
Two microphone bias (MICBIAS) generators provide a low-noise reference for biasing electret condenser microphones
(ECMs) or for use as a low-noise supply for MEMS microphones and digital microphones. Switchable outputs from the
MICBIAS generators allow eight separate reference/supply outputs to be independently controlled.
Digital volume control is available on all inputs (analog and digital), with programmable ramp control for smooth, glitch-free
operation. A configurable signal-detect function is available on each input signal path.
The IN1 and IN2 signal paths and control fields are shown in Fig. 4-2. The IN3, IN4, and IN5 signal paths support digital
microphone input only.

4.2.1     Analog Microphone Input
Up to seven analog microphones can be connected to the CS47L90, either in single-ended or differential configuration.
The input configuration and pin selection is controlled using INnx_SRC, as described in Section 4.2.6.
The CS47L90 includes external accessory-detection circuits that can report the presence of a microphone and the status
of a hook switch or other push buttons. When using this function, it is recommended to use the IN1B or IN2B analog
microphone input paths to ensure best immunity to electrical transients arising from the push buttons.

For single-ended input, the microphone signal is connected to the noninverting input of the PGAs (INnLP or INnRP). The
inverting inputs of the PGAs are connected to an internal reference in this configuration.
For differential input, the noninverted microphone signal is connected to the noninverting input of the PGAs (INnLP or
INnRP), while the inverted (or noisy ground) signal is connected to the inverting input pins (INnLN or INnRN).
Note:    Pseudodifferential connection is also possible—this is similar to the configuration shown in Fig. 4-4, but the GND
         connection is directly to the microphone (and INnxN capacitor), instead of via a resistor. This is the recommended
         configuration if the external accessory detection functions on the CS47L90 are used. The INnx_SRC field settings
         are the same for pseudodifferential connection as for differential.
The gain of the input PGAs is controlled via register settings, as defined in Section 4.2.6. Note that the input impedance
of the analog input paths is fixed across all PGA gain settings.
The ECM analog input configurations are shown in Fig. 4-3 and Fig. 4-4. The integrated MICBIAS generators provide a
low noise reference for biasing the ECMs.

Note:    The MICVDD pin can also be used (instead of MICBIAS) as a reference or power supply for external microphones.
         The MICBIAS outputs are recommended, because they offer better noise performance and independent enable/
         disable control.
4.2.2      Analog Line Input
Line inputs can be connected to the CS47L90 in a similar manner to the mic inputs. Single-ended and differential
configurations are supported on each analog input path, using the INnx_SRC bits as described in Section 4.2.6.

4.2.3       DMIC Input
As many as 10 digital microphones can be connected to the CS47L90. DMIC operation on input paths IN1 and IN2 is
selected using INn_MODE, as described in Section 4.2.6. DMIC operation on input paths IN3, IN4, and IN5 is implemented
on multifunction GPIO pins, which must be configured for the respective DMIC functions when required; see Section 4.15
to configure the GPIO pins for DMIC operation.
In DMIC mode, two channels of audio data are multiplexed on the associated DMICDATn pin. The clock signal for each
DMIC interface is selected using the INn_DMICCLK_SRC bit. By default, and for typical use cases, each interface is
clocked using the respective DMICCLKn pin output.
    •  If DMIC input is enabled, and DMICCLK is selected as the timing clock, the CS47L90 outputs the DMIC clock on
       the applicable DMICCLKn pins. The DMICCLKn frequency is controlled by the respective INn_OSR field, as
       described in Table 4-1 and Table 4-3.
       If the 384- or 768-kHz DMICCLKn frequency is selected, the maximum valid sample rate for the respective paths is
       restricted as described in Table 4-1. If the input sample rates are set globally using IN_RATE (i.e., IN_RATE_
       MODE = 0), all input paths are affected similarly.
    •  If SPKCLK is selected as the DMIC clock, the DMICDATn signals are timed with respect to the PDM output interface
       (see Section 4.12.9). This allows a two-way audio interface to be supported, using a shared clock signal. In this
       configuration, INn_OSR must select the same DMIC clock frequency as the SPKCLK output (3.072 MHz or
       6.144 MHz).
Note that SYSCLK must be present and enabled when using the DMIC inputs; see Section 4.17 for details of SYSCLK
and the associated registers.
The DMIC clock frequencies in Table 4-1 assume that the SYSCLK frequency is a multiple of 6.144 MHz (SYSCLK_
FRAC = 0). If the SYSCLK frequency is a multiple of 5.6448 MHz (SYSCLK_FRAC = 1), the DMIC clock frequencies are
scaled accordingly.

The voltage reference for the IN1 and IN2 DMIC interfaces is selectable, using INn_DMIC_SUP; each interface may be
referenced to MICVDD, MICBIAS1, or MICBIAS2. The voltage reference for each digital input path should be set equal to
the applicable power supply of the respective microphones.

The voltage reference for the IN3, IN4, and IN5 digital microphone interfaces is DBVDD3. The power supply for digital
microphones on these input paths should be set equal to the DBVDD3 voltage.
The voltage reference for the PDM output interface is DBVDD2. If SPKCLK is selected as the DMIC clock, it is advised to
take care to ensure compatibility of the respective power domains.
A pair of digital microphones is connected as shown in Fig. 4-9—assuming DMICCLK is the selected clock source. The
microphones must be configured to ensure that the left mic transmits a data bit when DMICCLK is high and the right mic
transmits a data bit when DMICCLK is low. The CS47L90 samples the DMIC data at the end of each DMICCLK phase.
Each microphone must tristate its data output when the other microphone is transmitting.
Note that the CS47L90 provides integrated pull-down resistors on the DMICDATn pins. This provides a flexible capability
for interfacing with other devices.

4.2.4       Input Signal Path Enable
The input signal paths are enabled using the bits described in Table 4-2. The respective bits must be enabled for analog
or digital input on the respective input paths.
The input signal paths are muted by default. It is recommended that deselecting the mute should be the final step of the
path enable control sequence. Similarly, the mute should be selected as the first step of the path-disable control sequence.
The input signal path mute functions are controlled using the bits described in Table 4-6.
The MICVDD power domain must be enabled when using the analog input signal paths. This power domain is provided
using an internal charge pump (CP2) and LDO regulator (LDO2). See Section 4.20 for details of these circuits.
The system clock, SYSCLK, must be configured and enabled before any audio path is enabled. The ASYNCCLK and
32-kHz clock may also be required, depending on the path configuration. See Section 4.17 for details of the system clocks.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the input signal
paths and associated ADCs. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an input signal path fails. Note that active
signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in Register R769 indicate the status of each input signal path. If an underclocked error condition occurs,
these bits indicate which input signal paths have been enabled.

4.2.5       Input Signal Path Sample-Rate Control
The input signal paths may be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within the CS47L90
digital core. The sample rate for the input signal paths can be set globally, or can be configured independently for each
input channel.
The IN_RATE_MODE bit (defined in Table 4-3) controls whether the input sample rates are set globally using IN_RATE,
or independently for each input channel using the INnx_RATE fields (where n is 1–5 and x is L or R for the left/right
channels respectively). The IN_RATE and INnx_RATE fields are defined in Table 4-26.
Note that sample-rate conversion is required when routing the input signal paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous
or configured for a different sample rate.
4.2.6       Input Signal Path Configuration
The CS47L90 supports up to 7 analog inputs or up to 10 digital inputs. Selectable combinations of analog (mic or line) and
digital inputs are multiplexed into two stereo input signal paths.
Input paths IN1 and IN2 can be configured for single-ended, differential, or DMIC operation. The analog input configuration
and pin selection is controlled using the INnx_SRC bits; digital input mode is selected by setting INn_MODE. Note that
input paths IN3, IN4, and IN5 support digital inputs only.
A configurable high-pass filter (HPF) is provided on the left and right channels of each input path. The applicable cut-off
frequency is selected using IN_HPF_CUT. The filter can be enabled on each path independently using the INnx_HPF bits.

                                                                                                                            CS47L90
                                                                                                                  4.2 Input Signal Path
The analog input signal paths (single-ended or differential) each incorporate a PGA to provide gain in the range 0 dB to
+31 dB in 1-dB steps. Note that these PGAs do not provide pop suppression functions; it is recommended that the gain
should not be adjusted while the respective signal path is enabled.
The analog input PGA gain is controlled using INnL_PGA_VOL and INnR_PGA_VOL. Note that separate volume control
is provided for the left and right channels of each stereo pair.
If DMIC input is selected, the respective interface timing clock can be selected using INn_DMICCLK_SRC. If DMICCLKn
is selected, the clock frequency is controlled by the respective INn_OSR field. If SPKCLK is selected as the DMIC interface
clock, INn_OSR must be set to the same frequency as the SPKCLK output.
If the IN1 or IN2 input signal path is configured for DMIC input, the voltage reference for the associated input/output pins
is selectable using the INn_DMIC_SUP fields—each interface may be referenced to MICVDD, MICBIAS1, or MICBIAS2.
The voltage reference for each digital input path should be set equal to the applicable power supply of the respective
microphones.
The voltage reference for the IN3, IN4, and IN5 digital microphone interfaces is DBVDD3. The power supply for digital
microphones on these input paths should be set equal to the DBVDD3 voltage.
The voltage reference for the PDM output interface is DBVDD2. If SPKCLK is selected as the DMIC clock, it is advised to
take care to ensure compatibility of the respective power domains.
The CS47L90 input paths can be configured for power-saving operation, ideal for always-on applications. A number of
different options are supported, allowing the power consumption to be optimized with respect to the required audio
performance characteristics. For analog input, a low-power option is available on the IN2 signal paths. For digital input,
low-power options are supported on all input paths.
     •  If the input signal path is configured for analog input, low-power operation can be selected using the control
        sequences described in Section 4.2.6.1. Note that, for analog inputs, Low-Power Mode is only available on the IN2
        signal paths.
     •  If the input signal path is configured for digital input, the respective DMICCLKn frequency can be configured using
        the INn_OSR bits. Reducing the DMICCLKn frequency reduces power consumption at the expense of audio
        performance. The INn_OSR field also supports high performance DMIC mode, when 6.144 MHz DMICCLK is
        selected.
        If 384- or 768-kHz DMICCLKn frequency is selected, the maximum sample rate for the respective paths is restricted
        as described in Table 4-1. If the input sample rates are set globally using IN_RATE (i.e., IN_RATE_MODE = 0), all
        input paths are affected similarly.
        Note that, if a digital microphone path is selected as a source for the Rx ANC function (see Section 4.2.9), the
        respective DMICCLKn frequency is 3.072 MHz, regardless of the INn_OSR setting.
The MICVDD voltage is generated by an internal charge pump and LDO regulator. The MICBIASn outputs are derived
from MICVDD; see Section 4.20.
The input signal paths are configured using the fields described in Table 4-3.

4.2.6.1     IN2 Low-Power Mode Configuration
The IN2 input path supports low-power operation for analog input configurations. Note that, although the IN2L and IN2R
signal paths can be enabled/disabled independently, the selection of Low-Power Mode is common to both channels.
The required control sequences for Low-Power Mode are described in the following paragraphs.
   •   Low-Power Mode enable sequence is described in Table 4-4. This sequence is applicable when enabling the IN2
       path for low-power operation.
       The same control sequence applies if selecting Low-Power Mode for input channels that are already enabled.
       Writing to IN2L_ENA or IN2R_ENA bits is optional in this case, as these bits are already set.
       The Low-Power Mode enable sequence must be repeated in full each time the channel is enabled in Low-Power
       Mode—the previous configuration is not valid after the channel has been disabled.
       Note that 32-bit register addressing is used from R12888 (0x3000) upwards; 16-bit format is used otherwise. The
       registers noted in Table 4-4 contain a mixture of 16- and 32-bit register addresses.

4.2.7        Input Signal Path Digital Volume Control
A digital volume control is provided on each input signal path, providing –64 dB to +31.5 dB gain control in 0.5-dB steps.
An independent mute control is also provided for each input signal path.
Whenever the gain or mute setting is changed, the signal path gain is ramped up or down to the new settings at a
programmable rate. For increasing gain (or unmute), the rate is controlled by IN_VI_RAMP. For decreasing gain (or mute),
the rate is controlled by IN_VD_RAMP.
Note:      The IN_VI_RAMP and IN_VD_RAMP fields should not be changed while a volume ramp is in progress.
The IN_VU bits control the loading of the input signal path digital volume and mute controls. When IN_VU is cleared, the
digital volume and mute settings are loaded into the respective control register, but do not change the signal path gain.
The digital volume and mute settings on all of the input signal paths are updated when a 1 is written to IN_VU. This makes
it possible to update the gain of multiple signal paths simultaneously.
Note that, although the digital-volume controls provide 0.5-dB steps, the internal circuits provide signal gain adjustment in
0.125-dB steps. This allows a very high degree of gain control and smooth volume ramping under all operating conditions.
The digital volume control registers are described in Table 4-6 and Table 4-7.

4.2.8        Input Signal Path Signal-Detect Control
The CS47L90 provides a digital signal-detect function for the input signal path. This enables system actions to be triggered
by signal detection and allows the device to remain in a low-power state until a valid audio signal is detected. A mute
function is integrated with the signal-detect circuit, ensuring the respective digital audio path remains at zero until the
detection threshold level is reached. Signal detection is also indicated via the interrupt controller.
The signal-detect function is supported on input paths IN1–IN5 in analog and digital configurations. (For input paths IN1
and IN2, digital input is selected by setting the respective INn_MODE bit.) Note that the valid operating conditions for this
function vary, depending on the applicable signal-path configuration.
     •   The signal-detect function is supported on analog input paths for sample rates up to 16 kHz.
     •   The signal-detect function is supported on digital input paths for sample rates up to 16 kHz (if DMICCLKn  768kHz)
         and up to 48 kHz (if DMICCLKn  2.8224 MHz).
For each input path, the signal-detect function is enabled by setting the respective INnx_SIG_DET_ENA bit. The detection
threshold level is set using IN_SIG_DET_THR—this applies to all input paths.
If the signal-detect function is enabled, the respective input channel is muted if the signal level is below the configured
threshold. If the input signal exceeds the threshold level, the respective channel is immediately unmuted.
If the input signal falls below the threshold level, the mute is applied. To prevent erroneous behavior, a time delay is applied
before muting the input signal—the channel is only muted if the signal level remains below the threshold level for longer
than the hold time. The hold time is set using IN_SIG_DET_HOLD.
Note that the signal-level detection is performed in the digital domain, after the ADC, PGA, digital mute and digital volume
controls—the respective input channel must be enabled and unmuted when using the signal-detect function.
The signal-detect function is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event; see
Section 4.16. Note that the respective interrupt event represents the logic OR of the signal detection on all input channels
and does not provide indication of which input channel caused the interrupt. To avoid multiple interrupts, the signal-detect
interrupt can be reasserted only after all input channels have fallen below the trigger threshold level.
The input path signal-detection control registers are described in Table 4-8.

4.2.10 DMIC Pin Configuration
DMIC operation on input paths IN1 and IN2 is selected using INn_MODE, as described in Table 4-3. If DMIC is selected,
the respective DMICCLKn and DMICDATn pins are configured as digital outputs and inputs, respectively.
DMIC operation on input paths IN3, IN4, and IN5 is implemented on multifunction GPIO pins, which must be configured
for the respective DMIC functions when required. The DMIC connections are pin-specific alternative functions on specific
GPIO pins. See Section 4.15 to configure the GPIO pins for DMIC operation.
The CS47L90 provides integrated pull-down resistors on each DMICDATn pin. This provides a flexible capability for
interfacing with other devices.
The DMICDAT1 and DMICDAT2 pull-down resistors can be configured independently using the bits described in
Table 4-10. Note that, if the DMICDATn DMIC input paths are disabled, the pull-down is disabled on the respective pin.

The DMICDAT3, DMICDAT4, and DMICDAT5 pull-up and pull-down resistors are provided as part of the GPIO
functionality; these can be configured independently using the fields described in Table 4-99. If the pull-up and pull-down
resistors are both enabled, the CS47L90 provides a bus keeper function on the respective pin. The bus-keeper function
holds the logic level unchanged whenever the pin is undriven (e.g., if the signal is tristated).
4.3 Digital Core
The CS47L90 digital core provides extensive mixing and processing capabilities for multiple signal paths. The
configuration is highly flexible and supports virtually every conceivable input/output connection between the available
processing blocks.
The digital core provides parametric equalization (EQ) functions, DRC, low-/high-pass filters (LHPF), and programmable
DSP capability. The DSP can support functions such as wind-noise, side-tone, or other programmable filters, also dynamic
range control and compression, or virtual surround sound and other audio enhancements.

                                                                                                               4.3 Digital Core
The CS47L90 supports multiple signal paths through the digital core. Stereo full-duplex sample-rate conversion is provided
to allow digital audio to be routed between input (ADC) paths, output (DAC) paths, digital audio interfaces (AIF1–AIF4)
and SLIMbus paths operating at different sample rates or referenced to asynchronous clock domains. Data-format
conversion (DFC) functions are available to support different interface standards on the input and output signal paths.
The DSP functions are highly programmable, using application-specific control sequences. Note that the DSP
configuration data is lost whenever the DCVDD power domain is removed; the DSP configuration data must be
downloaded to the CS47L90 each time the device is powered up.
The procedure for configuring the CS47L90 DSP functions is tailored to each customer’s application; please contact your
Cirrus Logic representative for more details.
The digital core incorporates a S/PDIF transmitter that can provide a stereo S/PDIF output on a GPIO pin. Standard
sample rates of 32–192 kHz can be supported. The CS47L90 incorporates a tone generator that can be used for beep
functions through any of the audio signal paths. A white-noise generator is incorporated, to provide comfort noise in cases
where silence (digital mute) is not desirable.
A haptic signal generator is provided, for use with external haptic devices (e.g., mechanical vibration actuators). Two
pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal generators are also provided; the PWM waveforms can be modulated by an audio
source within the digital core and can be output on a GPIO pin.
The CS47L90 also incorporates the Cirrus Logic ANC functionality, described in Section 4.6.
An overview of the digital-core mixing and signal-processing functions is provided in Fig. 4-11. The control registers
associated with the digital-core signal paths are shown in Fig. 4-12 through Fig. 4-29. The full list of digital mixer control
registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are provided in Table 4-11.
The digital audio core is predominantly a 24-bit architecture, but also provides limited support for 32-bit signal paths. Audio
data samples of up to 32 bits can be received via the AIF1, AIF3, and SLIMbus input channels and routed to the AIF1,
AIF3, SLIMbus, and S/PDIF output paths. The respective output mixers provide full support for 32-bit data words.
Note that all other signal paths and signal-processing blocks within the digital core are limited to 24-bit data length; data
samples are truncated to 24-bit length if they are routed through any function that does not support 32-bit data words.

4.3.1       Digital-Core Mixers
The CS47L90 provides an extensive digital mixing capability. The digital-core mixing and signal-processing blocks are
shown in Fig. 4-11. A four-input digital mixer is associated with many of these functions, as shown. The digital mixer circuit
is identical in each instance, providing up to four selectable input sources, with independent volume control on each input.
The control registers associated with the digital-core signal paths are shown in Fig. 4-12–Fig. 4-29. The full list of digital
mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6.
Further description of the associated control registers is provided throughout Section 4.3. Generic register field definitions
are provided in Table 4-11.
The digital mixer input sources are selected using the associated x_SRCn fields; the volume control is implemented via
the associated x_VOLn fields.
The ASRC, ISRC, DFC, and DSP auxiliary input functions support selectable input sources, but do not incorporate any
digital mixing. The respective input source (x_SRCn) fields are identical to those of the digital mixers.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective mixer or signal-processing block. Note that the selected input
sources must be configured for the same sample rate as the blocks to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion
functions are available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16. The DFCs provide
support for different data types, including floating point formats. Note that, if unsigned or floating point data is present within
the digital core, some restrictions on the valid signal routing options apply—see Section 4.3.13.
A status bit is associated with each configurable input source. If an underclocked error condition occurs, these bits indicate
which signal paths have been enabled.
The generic register field definition for the digital mixers is provided in Table 4-11.

4.3.2       Digital-Core Inputs
The digital core comprises multiple input paths, as shown in Fig. 4-12. Any of these inputs may be selected as a source
to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within the CS47L90 digital core.
Note that the outputs from other blocks within the digital core may also be selected as input to the digital mixers or
signal-processing functions within the CS47L90 digital core. Those input sources, which are not shown in Fig. 4-12, are
described separately throughout Section 4.3.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-12 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for the input signal paths is configured by using the applicable IN_RATE, AIFn_RATE, or SLIMRXn_
RATE field; see Table 4-26. Note that sample-rate conversion is required when routing the input signal paths to any signal
chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.

4.3.3       Digital-Core Output Mixers
The digital core comprises multiple output paths. The output paths associated with AIF1–AIF4 are shown in Fig. 4-13. The
output paths associated with OUT1–OUT5 are shown in Fig. 4-14. The output paths associated with the SLIMbus interface
are shown in Fig. 4-15.
A four-input mixer is associated with each output. The four input sources are selectable in each case, and independent
volume control is provided for each path.
The AIF1–AIF4 output mixer control fields (see Fig. 4-13) are located at register addresses R1792–R1967
(0x0700–0x07AF). The OUT1–OUT5 output mixer control fields (see Fig. 4-14) are located at addresses R1664–R1743
(0x0680–0x06CF). The SLIMbus output mixer control fields (see Fig. 4-15) are located at addresses R1984–R2047
(0x07C0–0x07FF).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective mixers. Note that the selected input sources must be
configured for the same sample rate as the mixer to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion functions are
available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.
The sample rate for the output signal paths is configured using the applicable OUT_RATE, AIFn_RATE, or SLIMTXn_
RATE fields; see Table 4-26. Note that sample-rate conversion is required when routing the output signal paths to any
signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.
The OUT_RATE, AIFn_RATE, or SLIMTXn_RATE fields must not be changed if any of the respective x_SRCn fields is
nonzero. The associated x_SRCn fields must be cleared before writing new values to OUT_RATE, AIFn_RATE, or
SLIMTXn_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to the
associated OUT_RATE, AIFn_RATE, or SLIMTXn_RATE fields. See Table 4-26 for details.
The AIF1, AIF3, and SLIMbus output mixers provide full support for 32-bit data words. Audio data samples up to 32 bits
are supported on the AIF1, AIF3, and SLIMbus input channels, which can be routed to the AIF1, AIF3, and SLIMbus output
paths. Note that other signal paths and signal-processing blocks within the digital core are limited to 24-bit data length;
data samples are truncated to 24-bit length if they are routed through any function that does not support 32-bit data words.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the output
mixer paths. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an output mixer path fails. Note that active signal paths are
not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.

4.3.4      Five-Band Parametric Equalizer (EQ)
The digital core provides four EQ processing blocks as shown in Fig. 4-16. A four-input mixer is associated with each EQ.
The four input sources are selectable in each case, and independent volume control is provided for each path. Each EQ
block supports one output.
The EQ provides selective control of five frequency bands as follows:
   •   The low-frequency band (Band 1) filter can be configured as a peak filter or as a shelving filter. If configured as a
       shelving filter, it provides adjustable gain below the Band 1 cut-off frequency. As a peak filter, it provides adjustable
       gain within a defined frequency band that is centered on the Band 1 frequency.

    •  The midfrequency bands (Band 2–Band 4) filters are peak filters that provide adjustable gain around the respective
       center frequency.
    •  The high-frequency band (Band 5) filter is a shelving filter that provides adjustable gain above the Band 5 cut-off
       frequency.

                                                  Figure 4-16. Digital-Core EQ Blocks
The EQ1–EQ4 mixer control fields (see Fig. 4-16) are located at register addresses R2176–R2207 (0x0880–0x089F).
The full list of digital-mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective EQ processing blocks. Note that the selected input sources
must be configured for the same sample rate as the EQ to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion functions
are available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-16 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for the EQ function is configured using FX_RATE; see Table 4-26. Note that the EQ, DRC, and LHPF
functions must be configured for the same sample rate. Sample-rate conversion is required when routing the EQ signal
paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.
The FX_RATE field must not be changed if any of the associated x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn fields
must be cleared before writing a new value to FX_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between clearing
the x_SRCn fields and writing to FX_RATE. See Table 4-26 for details.
The cut-off or center frequencies for the five-band EQ are set by using the coefficients held in the registers identified in
Table 4-12. These coefficients are derived using tools provided in Cirrus Logic’s WISCE™ evaluation-board control
software; please contact your Cirrus Logic representative for details.

The CS47L90 automatically checks to confirm whether the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the commanded
EQ and digital mixing functions. If an attempt is made to enable an EQ signal path, and there are insufficient SYSCLK
cycles to support it, the attempt does not succeed. Note that any signal paths that are already active are not affected under
such circumstances.
The FX_STS field in register R3585 indicates the status of each EQ, DRC, and LHPF signal path. If an underclocked error
condition occurs, this field indicates which EQ, DRC, or LHPF signal paths have been enabled.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.

4.3.5       Dynamic Range Control (DRC)
The digital core provides two stereo DRC processing blocks, as shown in Fig. 4-17. A four-input mixer is associated with
each DRC input channel. The input sources are selectable in each case, and independent volume control is provided for
each path. The stereo DRC blocks support two outputs each.
The function of the DRC is to adjust the signal gain in conditions where the input amplitude is unknown or varies over a
wide range, for example, when recording from microphones built into a handheld system or to restrict the dynamic range
of an output signal path.
To improve intelligibility in the presence of loud impulsive noises, the DRC can apply compression and automatic level
control to the signal path. It incorporates anticlip and quick-release features for handling transients.
The DRC also incorporates a noise-gate function that provides additional attenuation of very low-level input signals. This
means that the signal path is quiet when no signal is present, giving an improvement in background noise level under these
conditions.
A signal-detect function is provided within the DRC; this can be used to detect the presence of an audio signal and to
trigger other events. It can also be used as an interrupt event or to trigger the control-write sequencer. Note that DRC
triggering of the control-write sequencer is supported for DRC1 only.

The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective DRC processing blocks. Note that the selected input sources
must be configured for the same sample rate as the DRC to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion functions
are available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.

The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-17 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for the DRC function is configured using FX_RATE; see Table 4-26. Note that the EQ, DRC, and LHPF
functions must all be configured for the same sample rate. Sample-rate conversion is required when routing the DRC
signal paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.
The FX_RATE field must not be changed if any of the associated x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn fields
must be cleared before writing a new value to FX_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between clearing
the x_SRCn fields and writing to FX_RATE. See Table 4-26 for details.
The DRC functions are enabled using the control registers described in Table 4-15.

The following description of the DRC is applicable to each DRC. The associated control fields are described in Table 4-17
and Table 4-18 for DRC1 and DRC2 respectively.
4.3.5.1     DRC Compression, Expansion, and Limiting
The DRC supports two different compression regions, separated by a knee at a specific input amplitude. In the region
above the knee, the compression slope DRCn_HI_COMP applies; in the region below the knee, the compression slope
DRCn_LO_COMP applies. Note that n identifies the applicable DRC 1 or 2.
The DRC also supports a noise-gate region, where low-level input signals are heavily attenuated. This function can be
enabled or disabled according to the application requirements. The DRC response in this region is defined by the
expansion slope DRCn_NG_EXP.
For additional attenuation of signals in the noise-gate region, an additional knee can be defined (shown as Knee 2 in
Fig. 4-18). When this knee is enabled, this introduces an infinitely steep drop-off in the DRC response pattern between the
DRCn_LO_COMP and DRCn_NG_EXP regions.

                                          Figure 4-18. DRC Response Characteristic
The slope of the DRC response is determined by DRCn_HI_COMP and DRCn_LO_COMP. A slope of 1 indicates constant
gain in this region. A slope less than 1 represents compression (i.e., a change in input amplitude produces only a smaller
change in output amplitude). A slope of 0 indicates that the target output amplitude is the same across a range of input
amplitudes; this is infinite compression.
When the noise gate is enabled, the DRC response in this region is determined by DRCn_NG_EXP. A slope of 1 indicates
constant gain in this region. A slope greater than 1 represents expansion (i.e., a change in input amplitude produces a
larger change in output amplitude).
When the DRCn_KNEE2_OP knee is enabled (Knee 2 in Fig. 4-18), this introduces the vertical line in the response pattern
shown, resulting in infinitely steep attenuation at this point in the response.
The DRC parameters are listed in Table 4-16.

                      7        DRCn_KNEE2_OP           Output level at Knee 2 (dB)
The noise gate is enabled by setting DRCn_NG_ENA. When the noise gate is not enabled, Parameters 5–7 (see
Table 4-16) are ignored, and the DRCn_LO_COMP slope applies to all input signal levels below Knee 1.
The DRCn_KNEE2_OP knee is enabled by setting DRCn_KNEE2_OP_ENA. If this bit is not set, Parameter 7 is ignored
and the Knee 2 position always coincides with the low end of the DRCn_LO_COMP region.
The Knee 1 point in Fig. 4-18 is determined by DRCn_KNEE_IP and DRCn_KNEE_OP.

Parameter Y0, the output level for a 0 dB input, is not specified directly but can be calculated from the other parameters

4.3.5.2     Gain Limits
The minimum and maximum gain applied by the DRC is set by DRCn_MINGAIN, DRCn_MAXGAIN, and DRCn_NG_
MINGAIN. These limits can be used to alter the DRC response from that shown in Fig. 4-18. If the range between
maximum and minimum gain is reduced, the extent of the dynamic range control is reduced.
The minimum gain in the compression regions of the DRC response is set by DRCn_MINGAIN. The minimum gain in the
noise-gate region is set by DRCn_NG_MINGAIN. The minimum gain limit prevents excessive attenuation of the signal
path.
The maximum gain limit set by DRCn_MAXGAIN prevents quiet signals (or silence) from being excessively amplified.
4.3.5.3     Dynamic Characteristics
The dynamic behavior determines how quickly the DRC responds to changing signal levels. Note that the DRC responds
to the average (RMS) signal amplitude over a period of time.
The DRCn_ATK determines how quickly the DRC gain decreases when the signal amplitude is high. The DRCn_DCY
determines how quickly the DRC gain increases when the signal amplitude is low.
These fields are described in Table 4-17 and Table 4-18. The register defaults are suitable for general-purpose
microphone use.
4.3.5.4     Anticlip Control
The DRC includes an anticlip function to avoid signal clipping when the input amplitude rises very quickly. This function
uses a feed-forward technique for early detection of a rising signal level. Signal clipping is avoided by dynamically
increasing the gain attack rate when required.
The anticlip function is enabled using the DRCn_ANTICLIP bit. Note that the feed-forward processing increases the
latency in the input signal path.
The anticlip feature operates entirely in the digital domain; it cannot be used to prevent signal clipping in the analog domain
nor in the source signal. Analog clipping can only be prevented by reducing the analog signal gain or by adjusting the
source signal.
It is recommended to disable the anticlip function if the quick-release function (see Section 4.3.5.5) is enabled.
4.3.5.5     Quick Release Control
The DRC includes a quick-release function to handle short transient peaks that are not related to the intended source
signal. For example, in handheld microphone recording, transient signal peaks sometimes occur due to user handling, key
presses or accidental tapping against the microphone. The quick-release function ensures that these transients do not
cause the intended signal to be masked by the longer time constant of DRCn_DCY.
The quick-release function is enabled by setting the DRCn_QR bit. When this bit is enabled, the DRC measures the crest
factor (peak to RMS ratio) of the input signal. A high crest factor is indicative of a transient peak that may not be related
to the intended source signal. If the crest factor exceeds the level set by DRCn_QR_THR, the normal decay rate (DRCn_
DCY) is ignored and a faster decay rate (DRCn_QR_DCY) is used instead.
It is recommended to disable the quick-release function if the anticlip function (see Section 4.3.5.4) is enabled.

4.3.5.6     Signal Activity Detect
The DRC incorporates a configurable signal-detect function, allowing the signal level at the DRC input to be monitored
and to be used to trigger other events. This can be used to detect the presence of a microphone signal on an ADC or DMIC
channel or to detect an audio signal received over the digital audio interface.
The DRC signal-detect function is enabled by setting DRCn_SIG_DET. Note that the respective DRCn must also be
enabled. The detection threshold is either a peak level (crest factor) or an RMS level, depending on DRCn_SIG_DET_
MODE. When peak level is selected, the threshold is determined by DRCn_SIG_DET_PK, which defines the applicable
crest factor (peak-to-RMS ratio) threshold. If RMS level is selected, the threshold is set using DRCn_SIG_DET_RMS.
The DRC signal-detect function is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event; see
Section 4.16.
The control-write sequencer can be triggered by the DRC1 signal-detect function. This is enabled by setting DRC1_
WSEQ_SIG_DET_ENA. See Section 4.19.
Note that signal detection is supported on DRC1 and DRC2, but the triggering of the control-write sequencer is available
on DRC1 only.

The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the
commanded DRC and digital mixing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable a DRC signal path fails.
Note that active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The FX_STS field in register R3585 indicates the status of each EQ, DRC, and LHPF signal path. If an underclocked error
condition occurs, this field indicates which EQ, DRC, or LHPF signal paths have been enabled.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
4.3.6       Low-/High-Pass Digital Filter (LHPF)
The digital core provides four LHPF processing blocks as shown in Fig. 4-19. A four-input mixer is associated with each
filter. The four input sources are selectable in each case, and independent volume control is provided for each path. Each
LHPF block supports one output.
The LHPF /HPF can be used to remove unwanted out-of-band noise from a signal path. Each filter can be configured either
as a low-pass filter (LPF) or a high-pass filter (HPF).

                                              Figure 4-19. Digital-Core LPF/HPF Blocks
The LHPF1–LHPF4 mixer control fields, shown in Fig. 4-19, are located at register addresses R2304–R2335
(0x0900–0x091F).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective LHPF processing blocks. Note that the selected input
sources must be configured for the same sample rate as the LHPF to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion
functions are available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-19 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for the LHPF function is configured using FX_RATE; see Table 4-26. Note that the EQ, DRC, and LHPF
functions must all be configured for the same sample rate. Sample-rate conversion is required when routing the LHPF
signal paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.
The FX_RATE field must not be changed if any of the associated x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn fields
must be cleared before writing a new value to FX_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between clearing
the x_SRCn fields and writing to FX_RATE. See Table 4-26 for details.
The control registers associated with the LHPF functions are described in Table 4-19.
The cut-off frequencies for the LHPF blocks are set by using the coefficients held in registers R3777, R3781, R3785, and
R3789 for LHPF1, LHPF2, LHPF3 and LHPF4 respectively. These coefficients are derived using tools provided in Cirrus
Logic’s WISCE evaluation board control software; please contact your Cirrus Logic representative for details.

The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm whether the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the
commanded LHPF and digital mixing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an LHPF signal path fails.
Note that active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The FX_STS field in register R3585 indicates the status of each EQ, DRC, and LHPF signal path. If an underclocked error
condition occurs, this field indicates which EQ, DRC, or LHPF signal paths have been enabled.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
4.3.7       Digital-Core DSP
The digital core provides seven programmable DSP processing blocks as shown in Fig. 4-20. Each block supports eight
inputs (Left, Right, Aux1, Aux2, … Aux6). A four-input mixer is associated with the left and right inputs, providing further
expansion of the number of input paths. Each input source is selectable, and independent volume control is provided for
left and right input mixer channels. Each DSP block supports six outputs.
The functionality of the DSP processing blocks is not fixed, and a wide range of audio enhancements algorithms may be
performed. The procedure for configuring the CS47L90 DSP functions is tailored to each customer’s application; please
contact your Cirrus Logic representative for details.

and R3072–R3192 (0x0C00–0x0C78).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective DSP processing blocks. Note that the selected input sources
must be configured for the same sample rate as the DSP to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion functions
are available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-20 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for each DSP function is configured using the respective DSPn_RATE field; see Table 4-26. Sample-rate
conversion is required when routing the DSPn signal paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a
different sample rate.
The DSPn_RATE fields must not be changed if any of the respective x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn
fields must be cleared before writing new values to DSPn_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between
clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to the associated DSPn_RATE fields. See Table 4-26 for details.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the required
DSP mixing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable a DSP mixer path fails. Note that active signal paths
are not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.

4.3.8       S/PDIF Output Generator
The CS47L90 incorporates an IEC-60958-3–compatible S/PDIF output generator, as shown in Fig. 4-21; this provides a
stereo S/PDIF output on a GPIO pin. The S/PDIF transmitter allows full control over the S/PDIF validity bits and channel
status information.
The input sources to the S/PDIF transmitter are selectable for each channel, and independent volume control is provided
for each path. The *TX1 and *TX2 fields control Channels A and B (respectively) of the S/PDIF output.
The S/PDIF signal can be output directly on a GPIO pin. See Section 4.15 to configure a GPIO pin for this function.
Note that the S/PDIF signal cannot be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within the
CS47L90 digital core.

The S/PDIF input control fields (see Fig. 4-21) are located at register addresses R2048–R2057 (0x0800–0x0809).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the two S/PDIF channels. Note that the selected input sources must be
synchronized to the SYSCLK clocking domain, and configured for the same sample rate as the S/PDIF generator.
Sample-rate conversion functions are available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and
Section 4.3.16.
The sample rate of the S/PDIF generator is configured using SPD1_RATE; see Table 4-26. The S/PDIF transmitter
supports sample rates in the range 32–192 kHz. Note that sample-rate conversion is required when linking the S/PDIF
generator to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.
The SPD1_RATE field must not be changed if any of the associated x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn
fields must be cleared before writing a new value to SPD1_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between
clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to SPD1_RATE. See Table 4-26 for details.
The S/PDIF generator is enabled by setting SPD1_ENA, as described in Table 4-20.
The S/PDIF output contains audio data derived from the selected sources. Audio samples up to 24-bit width can be
accommodated. The validity bits and the channel status bits in the S/PDIF data are configured using the corresponding
fields in registers R1474 (0x5C2) to R1477 (0x5C5).
Refer to the S/PDIF specification (IEC60958-3 Digital Audio Interface - Consumer) for full details of the S/PDIF protocol
and configuration parameters.

The S/PDIF output generator provides full support for 32-bit data words. Audio data samples up to 32 bits are supported
on the AIF1, AIF3, and SLIMbus input channels, which can be routed to the S/PDIF output. Note that other signal paths
and signal-processing blocks within the digital core are limited to 24-bit data length; data samples are truncated to 24-bit
length if they are routed through any function that does not support 32-bit data words.
The CS47L90 automatically checks to confirm whether the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the digital mixer
paths. If an attempt is made to enable the S/PDIF generator, and there are insufficient SYSCLK cycles to support it, the
attempt does not succeed. Note that any active signal paths are unaffected under such circumstances.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
4.3.9       Tone Generator
The CS47L90 incorporates a tone generator that can be used for beep functions through any of the audio signal paths.
The tone generator provides two 1-kHz outputs, with configurable phase relationship, offering flexibility to create
differential signals or test scenarios.

The sample rate for the tone generator is configured using TONE_RATE. See Table 4-26. Note that sample-rate
conversion is required when routing the tone generator outputs to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for
a different sample rate.
The tone generator outputs are enabled by setting the TONE1_ENA and TONE2_ENA bits as described in Table 4-21.
The phase relationship is configured using TONE_OFFSET.
The tone generator outputs can also provide a configurable DC signal level, for use as a test signal. The DC output is
selected using the TONEn_OVD bits, and the DC signal amplitude is configured using the TONEn_LVL fields, as
described in Table 4-21.

noise generator as an input to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for the noise generator is configured using NOISE_GEN_RATE. See Table 4-26. Note that sample-rate
conversion is required when routing the noise generator output to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for
a different sample rate.
The noise generator is enabled by setting NOISE_GEN_ENA, described in Table 4-22. The signal level is configured using
NOISE_GEN_GAIN.

4.3.11 Haptic Signal Generator
The CS47L90 incorporates a signal generator for use with haptic devices (e.g., mechanical vibration actuators). The haptic
signal generator is compatible with both eccentric rotating mass (ERM) and linear resonant actuator (LRA) haptic devices.
The haptic signal generator is highly configurable, and includes the capability to execute a programmable event profile
comprising three distinct operating phases.
The resonant frequency of the haptic signal output (for LRA devices) is selectable, providing support for many different
actuator components.
The haptic signal generator is a digital signal generator, which is incorporated within the digital core of the CS47L90. In a
typical use case the haptic signal may be routed, via one of the digital-core output mixers, to the digital PDM output. An
external amplifier can be used to drive the haptic device, as shown in Fig. 4-24.

The hexadecimal number (0x06) in Fig. 4-24 indicates the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of the haptic signal
generator as an input to another digital-core function.
The haptic signal generator is selected as input to one of the digital-core output mixers by setting the x_SRCn field of the
applicable output mixer to 0x06.
The sample rate for the haptic signal generator is configured using the HAP_RATE field. See Table 4-26. Note that
sample-rate conversion is required when routing the haptic signal generator output to any signal chain that is
asynchronous or configured for a different sample rate.
The haptic signal generator is configured for an ERM or LRA actuator using the HAP_ACT bit. The required resonant
frequency is configured using the LRA_FREQ field. Note that the resonant frequency is only applicable to LRA actuators.
The signal generator can be enabled in continuous mode or configured for one-shot mode using the HAP_CTRL field, as
described in Table 4-23. In one-shot mode, the output is triggered by writing to the ONESHOT_TRIG bit.
In one-shot mode, the signal generator profile comprises the distinct phases (1, 2, 3). The duration and intensity of each
output phase is programmable.
In continuous mode, the signal intensity is controlled using the PHASE2_INTENSITY field only.
In the case of an ERM actuator (HAP_ACT = 0), the haptic output is a DC signal level, which may be positive or negative,
as selected by the x_INTENSITY fields.
For an LRA actuator (HAP_ACT = 1), the haptic output is an AC signal; selecting a negative signal level corresponds to a
180° phase inversion. In some applications, phase inversion may be desirable during the final phase, to halt the physical
motion of the haptic device.

4.3.12 PWM Generator
The CS47L90 incorporates two PWM signal generators as shown in Fig. 4-25. The duty cycle of each PWM signal can be
modulated by an audio source, or can be set to a fixed value using a control register setting.
A four-input mixer is associated with each PWM generator. The four input sources are selectable in each case, and
independent volume control is provided for each path.
PWM signal generators can be output directly on a GPIO pin. See Section 4.15 to configure a GPIO pin for this function.
Note that the PWM signal generators cannot be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within
the CS47L90 digital core.

                          When PWMn_OVD = 0, the PWM duty cycle is controlled by the respective digital audio mixer .
                          When PWMn_OVD = 1, the PWM duty cycle is set by PWMn _LVL.
                          PWM sample rate and clocking frequency are selected using PWM _RATE and PWM_CLK_SEL.

                                              Figure 4-25. Digital-Core PWM Generator
The PWM1 and PWM2 mixer control fields (see Fig. 4-25) are located at register addresses R1600–R1615
(0x0640–0x064F).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective mixers. Note that the selected input sources must be
configured for the same sample rate as the mixer to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion functions are
available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.
The PWM sample rate (cycle time) is configured using PWM_RATE. See Table 4-26. Note that sample-rate conversion is
required when linking the PWM generators to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for a different sample
rate.
The PWM_RATE field must not be changed if any of the associated x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn
fields must be cleared before writing a new value to PWM_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between
clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to PWM_RATE. See Table 4-26 for details.
The PWM generators are enabled by setting PWM1_ENA and PWM2_ENA, respectively, as described in Table 4-24.
Under default conditions (PWMn_OVD = 0), the duty cycle of the PWM generators is controlled by an audio signal path;
a 4-input mixer is associated with each PWM generator, as shown in Fig. 4-25.
When the PWMn_OVD bit is set, the duty cycle of the respective PWM generator is set to a fixed ratio; in this case, the
duty cycle ratio is configurable using the PWMn_LVL fields.
The PWM generator clock frequency is selected using PWM_CLK_SEL. For best performance, the highest available
setting should be used. Note that the PWM generator clock must not be set to a higher frequency than SYSCLK (if PWM_
RATE < 1000) or ASYNCCLK (if PWM_RATE  1000).

The CS47L90 automatically checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the digital mixer
paths. If an attempt is made to enable a PWM signal mixer path, without sufficient SYSCLK cycles to support it, the attempt
fails. Note that any signal paths that are already active are not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
4.3.13 Data Format Conversion
The digital mixing and signal-processing functions on the CS47L90 are designed to route audio data in signed fixed point
format. Data format converter (DFC) blocks are incorporated in the digital core, with the capability to convert audio data
between signed, unsigned, and floating-point formats. The DFCs enable the flexibility to support many different interface
standards on the input and output signal paths. They can also be used to apply dithering to digital audio data.
The digital core provides eight DFC blocks as shown in Fig. 4-26. Each DFC supports one input and one output path only.

The DFC1–DFC8 input control fields (see Fig. 4-26) are located at register addresses R3520–R3576 (0x0DC0–0x0DF8).
The full list of digital-mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective DFCs. Note that the selected input sources must be
configured for the same sample rate as the DFC to which they are connected. Sample-rate conversion functions are
available to support flexible interconnectivity; see Section 4.3.15 and Section 4.3.16.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-26 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The sample rate for each converter DFCn is configured using the respective DFCn_RATE field; see Table 4-26. Note that
sample-rate conversion is required when routing the DFC paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured for
a different sample rate.
The DFCn_RATE fields must not be changed if the associated x_SRCn field is nonzero. The associated x_SRCn field
must be cleared before writing a new value to DFCn_RATE. A minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between clearing
the x_SRCn field and writing to the associated DFCn_RATE field. See Table 4-26 for details.
The DFC is enabled by setting DFCn_ENA.
The input data format is configured using the DFCn_RX_DATA_TYPE and DFCn_RX_DATA_WIDTH fields. Valid data
types are signed fixed point, unsigned fixed point, and three different floating point configurations. If a fixed point data type
is selected, the data width (number of data bits) is selected using DFCn_RX_DATA_WIDTH.
The DFC input can be any of the digital core inputs or signal processing blocks. If the input data type is unsigned or floating
point format, one of the AIF or SLIMbus RX channels must be selected as the DFC input source—unsigned and floating
point data types are not valid selections with any other source within the digital core.
The output data format is configured using the DFCn_TX_DATA_TYPE and DFCn_TX_DATA_WIDTH fields. Valid data
types are signed fixed point, or unsigned fixed point. The data width (number of data bits) is selected using DFCn_TX_
DATA_WIDTH.
The DFC output can be selected as input to any of the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within the CS47L90
digital core. If the DFC output data type is unsigned fixed point format, it must be routed directly to the AIF or SLIMbus TX
channels using the respective digital-core output mixers—unsigned fixed point data is not valid as input to any other digital
core functions.
Note:    If unsigned data is routed from a DFC output to an AIF or SLIMbus TX channel, the DFC must be the only enabled
         signal path in the respective output mixer, and the associated volume selection must be 0 dB.
The DFC can apply dithering to its output data; this is enabled by setting DFCn_DITH_ENA.

The dither function can be used to improve the noise characteristics of signals routed in the digital core. Dithering is
particularly recommended if truncating audio data (e.g., from 32- to 24-bit format) as it converts the truncation/quantization
errors into benign background noise.
The control registers associated with the DFCs are described in Table 4-25.

The CS47L90 automatically checks to confirm whether the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the commanded
DFC and digital mixing functions. If an attempt is made to enable DFC signal path, and there are insufficient SYSCLK
cycles to support it, the attempt does not succeed. Note that any signal paths that are already active are not affected under
such circumstances.

The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
4.3.14 Sample-Rate Control
The CS47L90 supports multiple signal paths through the digital core. Stereo full-duplex sample-rate conversion is provided
to allow digital audio to be routed between interfaces operating at different sample rates and/or referenced to
asynchronous clock domains.
Two independent clock domains are supported for the audio signal paths, referenced to SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK
respectively, as described in Section 4.17. Every digital signal path must be synchronized either to SYSCLK or to
ASYNCCLK.
Up to five different sample rates may be in use at any time on the CS47L90. Three of these sample rates must be
synchronized to SYSCLK; the remaining two, where required, must be synchronized to ASYNCCLK.
Sample-rate conversion is required when routing any audio path between digital functions that are asynchronous or
configured for different sample rates.
There are two asynchronous sample-rate converters (ASRCs). Each ASRC supports two-way stereo conversion paths
between the SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK domains. The ASRCs are described in Section 4.3.15.
There are four isochronous sample-rate converters (ISRCs). ISRC1 and ISRC2 support two-way, four-channel conversion
paths between sample rates on the SYSCLK domain, or between sample rates on the ASYNCCLK domain. ISRC3 and
ISRC4 provide similar functionality for up to two channels each. The ISRCs are described in Section 4.3.16.
The sample rate of different blocks within the CS47L90 digital core are controlled as shown in Fig. 4-27. The x_RATE fields
select the applicable sample rate for each respective group of digital functions.
The x_RATE fields must not be changed if any of the x_SRCn fields associated with the respective functions is nonzero.
The associated x_SRCn fields must be cleared before writing new values to the x_RATE fields. A minimum delay of 125 s
must be allowed between clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to the associated x_RATE fields. See Table 4-26 for
details.

The input signal paths may be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions. The sample rate for
the input signal paths can either be set globally (using IN_RATE), or can be configured independently for each input
channel (using the respective INnx_RATE fields). The applicable mode depends on IN_RATE_MODE, as described in
Table 4-3.
The output signal paths are derived from the respective output mixers. The sample rate for the output signal paths is
configured using OUT_RATE. The sample rate of the AEC loop-back path is also set by OUT_RATE.
The AIFn RX inputs may be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions. The AIFn TX outputs are
derived from the respective output mixers. The sample rates for digital audio interfaces (AIF1–AIF4) are configured using
the AIFn_RATE fields (where n identifies the applicable AIF 1, 2, 3, or 4) respectively.
The SLIMbus interface supports up to eight input channels and eight output channels. The sample rate of each channel
can be configured independently, using SLIMTXn_RATE and SLIMRXn_RATE.
Note that the SLIMbus interface provides simultaneous support for SYSCLK-referenced and ASYNCCLK-referenced
sample rates on different channels. For example, 48-kHz and 44.1-kHz SLIMbus audio paths can be simultaneously
supported.
The EQ, DRC, and LHPF functions can be enabled in any signal path within the digital core. The sample rate for these
functions is configured using FX_RATE. Note that the EQ, DRC, and LHPF functions must all be configured for the same
sample rate.
The DSPn functions can be enabled in any signal path within the digital core. The applicable sample rates are configured
using the DSPn_RATE fields (where n identifies the applicable DSP block, 1 through 7) respectively.
The S/PDIF transmitter can be enabled on a GPIO pin. Stereo inputs to this function can be configured from any of the
digital-core inputs, mixers, or signal-processing functions. The sample rate of the S/PDIF transmitter is configured using
SPD1_RATE.
The tone generator and noise generator can be selected as input to any of the digital mixers or signal-processing functions.
The sample rates for these sources are configured using the TONE_RATE and NOISE_GEN_RATE fields, respectively.
The haptic signal generator can be used to control an external vibe actuator. In a typical use case the haptic signal may
be routed, via one of the digital-core output mixers, to the digital PDM output (OUT5). The sample rate for the haptic signal
generator is configured using HAP_RATE.
The PWM signal generators can be modulated by an audio source, derived from the associated signal mixers. The sample
rate (cycle time) for the PWM signal generators is configured using PWM_RATE.
The DFCn blocks can be enabled in signal paths within the digital core. The applicable sample rates are configured using
the DFCn_RATE fields (where n identifies the applicable DFC block).
The sample-rate control registers are described in Table 4-26. Refer to the field descriptions for details of the valid
selections in each case—note that the input (ADC) and output (DAC) signal paths must always be associated with the
SYSCLK clocking domain; different sample rates may be selected concurrently, but both these rates must be synchronized
to SYSCLK.
The control registers associated with the ASRCs and ISRCs are described in Table 4-27 and Table 4-28.
Note that 32-bit register addressing is used from R12888 (0x3000) upwards; 16-bit format is used otherwise. The registers
noted in Table 4-26 contain a mixture of 16-bit and 32-bit register addresses.

4.3.15 Asynchronous Sample-Rate Converter (ASRC)
The CS47L90 supports multiple signal paths through the digital core. Two independent clock domains are supported for
the audio signal paths, referenced to SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK respectively, as described in Section 4.17. Every digital
signal path must be synchronized either to SYSCLK or to ASYNCCLK.
There are two ASRCs. Each provides two stereo signal paths between the SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK domains, as shown
in Fig. 4-28.
    •   The sample rate on the SYSCLK domain is selected using the ASRCn_RATE1 fields; the rate can be set equal to
        SAMPLE_RATE_1, SAMPLE_RATE_2, or SAMPLE_RATE_3.
    •   The sample rate on the ASYNCCLK domain is selected using the ASRCn_RATE2 fields; the rate can be set equal
        to ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_1 or ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_2.
See Section 4.17 for details of the sample-rate control registers.
Each ASRC supports sample rates from 8–192 kHz. For each ASRC, the ratio of the applicable SAMPLE_RATE_n and
ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n fields must not exceed 6.
The ASRCn_RATE1 and ASRCn_RATE2 fields must not be changed if any of the respective x_SRCn fields is nonzero.
The associated x_SRCn fields must be cleared before writing new values to ASRCn_RATE1 or ASRCn_RATE2. A
minimum delay of 125 s must be allowed between clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to the associated ASRCn_
RATE1 or ASRCn_RATE2 fields. See Table 4-27 for details.
The ASRC signal paths are enabled using the ASRCn_INmx_ENA bits, as follows:
    •   The ASRCn IN1 (left and right) paths convert from the SYSCLK domain to the ASYNCCLK domain. These paths
        are enabled by setting the ASRCn_IN1L_ENA and ASRCn_IN1R_ENA bits, respectively.
    •   The ASRCn IN2 (left and right) paths convert from the ASYNCCLK domain to the SYSCLK domain. These paths
        are enabled by setting the ASRCn_IN2L_ENA and ASRCn_IN2R_ENA bits, respectively.
Synchronization (lock) between different clock domains is not instantaneous when the clocking or sample rate
configurations are updated. The lock status of each ASRC path is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used
to trigger an interrupt event; see Section 4.16.
The ASRC lock status of each ASRC path can be output directly on a GPIO pin as an external indication of ASRC lock.
See Section 4.15 to configure a GPIO pin for this function.

                                                                                                                        CS47L90

The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK frequency is high enough to support
the commanded ASRC and digital mixing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an ASRC signal path
fails. Note that active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in register R3809 indicate the status of each ASRC signal path. If an underclocked error condition occurs,
these bits indicate which ASRC signal paths have been enabled.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
The ASRC signal paths and control registers are shown in Fig. 4-28.
                    The ASRC provides asynchronous conversion between the SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK clock domains.
                    ASRCn_RATE1 identifies the SYSCLK-related sample rate (SAMPLE_RATE_n).
                    ASRCn_RATE2 identifies the ASYNCCLK-related sample rate (ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n).

The ASRC1 and ASRC2 input control fields (see Fig. 4-28) are located at register addresses R2688–R2744
(0x0A80–0x0AB8).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRCn fields select the input sources for the respective ASRC processing blocks. Note that the selected input
sources must be configured for the same sample rate as the ASRC to which they are connected.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-28 indicate the corresponding x_SRCn setting for selection of that signal as an input
to another digital-core function.
The fields associated with the ASRCs are described in Table 4-27.

4.3.16 Isochronous Sample-Rate Converter (ISRC)
The CS47L90 supports multiple signal paths through the digital core. The ISRCs provide sample-rate conversion between
synchronized sample rates on the SYSCLK clock domain, or between synchronized sample rates on the ASYNCCLK clock
domain.
There are four ISRCs on the CS47L90. ISRC1 and ISRC2 provide four signal paths between two different sample rates;
ISRC3 and ISRC4 provide two signal paths between two different sample rates, as shown in Fig. 4-29.
The sample rates associated with each ISRC can be set independently. Note that the two sample rates associated with
any single ISRC must both be referenced to the same clock domain (SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK).

                                                                                                              4.3 Digital Core
    •   When an ISRC is used on the SYSCLK domain, the associated sample rates may be selected from SAMPLE_
        RATE_1, SAMPLE_RATE_2, or SAMPLE_RATE_3.
    •   When an ISRC is used on the ASYNCCLK domain, the associated sample rates are ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_1
        and ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_2.
See Section 4.17 for details of the sample-rate control registers.
Each ISRC supports sample rates in the range 8–192 kHz. The higher of the sample rates associated with each ISRC
must be an integer multiple of the lower sample rate; all possible integer ratios are supported (i.e., up to 24).
Each ISRC converts between a sample rate selected by ISRCn_FSL and a sample rate selected by ISRCn_FSH, (where
n identifies the applicable ISRC 1, 2, 3, or 4). Note that, in each case, the higher of the two sample rates must be selected
by ISRCn_FSH.
The ISRCn_FSL and ISRCn_FSH fields must not be changed if any of the respective x_SRCn fields is nonzero. The
associated x_SRCn fields must be cleared before writing new values to ISRCn_FSL or ISRCn_FSH. A minimum delay of
125 s must be allowed between clearing the x_SRCn fields and writing to the associated ISRCn_FSL or ISRCn_FSH
fields. See Table 4-28 for details.
The ISRC signal paths are enabled using the ISRCn_INTm_ENA and ISRCn_DECm_ENA bits, as follows:
    •   The ISRCn interpolation paths (increasing sample rate) are enabled by setting the ISRCn_INTm_ENA bits, (where
        m identifies the applicable channel).
    •   The ISRCn decimation paths (decreasing sample rate) are enabled by setting the ISRCn_DECm_ENA bits.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK frequency is high enough to support
the commanded ISRC and digital mixing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an ISRC signal path
fails. Note that active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in registers R1600–R3576 indicate the status of each digital mixer. If an underclocked error condition
occurs, these bits indicate which mixers have been enabled.
The ISRC signal paths and control registers are shown in Fig. 4-29.

The ISRC input control fields (see Fig. 4-29) are located at register addresses R2816–R3015 (0x0B00–0x0BC7).
The full list of digital mixer control registers (R1600–R3576) is provided in Section 6. Generic register field definitions are
provided in Table 4-11.
The x_SRC fields select the input sources for the respective ISRC processing blocks. Note that the selected input sources
must be configured for the same sample rate as the ISRC to which they are connected.
The hexadecimal numbers in Fig. 4-29 indicate the corresponding x_SRC setting for selection of that signal as an input to
another digital-core function.
The fields associated with the ISRCs are described in Table 4-28.

4.4 DSP Firmware Control
The CS47L90 digital core incorporates seven DSP processing blocks, capable of running a wide range of
audio-enhancement functions. Different firmware configurations can be loaded onto each DSP, enabling the CS47L90 to
be highly customized for specific application requirements. Full read/write access to the device register map is supported
from each DSP core, including access to the firmware registers of the other DSPs. Synchronization of different DSPs is
supported, and shared data memory space is provided for the DSP2 and DSP3 blocks; these features enable enhanced
processing capabilities for the associated DSPs.
Examples of the DSP functions include multiband compressor (MBC) and the SoundClear suite of audio processing
algorithms. Note that it is possible to implement more than one type of audio enhancement function on a single DSP; the
precise combinations of functions vary from one firmware configuration to another.
The DSP blocks each employ the same internal architecture and provide an equivalent processing capability. Note that
the DSPs differ in terms of the firmware memory sizes associated with each. DSPs 1–6 can be clocked at up to 150 MHz,
corresponding to 150 MIPS each. DSP7 is designed for low-power operation, clocked at up to 75 MHz. The CS47L90
supports always-on clocking modes, including event-triggered DSP clocking.
DSP firmware can be configured using software packages provided by Cirrus Logic. A software programming guide can
also be provided to assist users in developing their own software algorithms—please contact your Cirrus Logic
representative for further information.
To use the DSP blocks, the required firmware configuration must first be loaded onto the device by writing the appropriate
files to the CS47L90 register map. The firmware configuration comprises program, data, and coefficient content. In some
cases, the coefficient content must be derived using tools provided in the WISCE evaluation board control software.

Details of the DSP firmware memory registers are provided in Section 4.4.1. Note that the WISCE evaluation board control
software provides support for easy loading of program, data, and coefficient content onto the CS47L90. Please contact
your Cirrus Logic representative for more details of the WISCE evaluation board control software.
After loading the DSP firmware, the DSP functions must be enabled using the associated control fields.
The audio signal paths connecting to and from the DSP processing blocks are configured as described in Section 4.3. Note
that the DSP firmware must be loaded and enabled before audio signal paths can be enabled.
4.4.1       DSP Firmware Memory and Register Mapping
The DSP firmware memory is programmed by writing to the registers referenced in Table 4-29. Note that clocking is not
required for access to the firmware registers by the host processor.
The CS47L90 program, data, and coefficient register memory space is described in Table 4-29. The full register map
listing is provided in Section 6. The shared DSP2/DSP3 memory space is implemented at two different register address
locations; reading or writing at either address accesses the same memory data.
If multiple DSPs write to a shared memory address at the same time, the address at which the collision occurred is reported
in the DSP3_DUALMEM_COLLISION_ADDR field. Note that this field is coded in 24-bit DSP data word units, and is
defined relative to the base address of the applicable shared memory area.
The DSP memory controller provides an input to the interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered if a memory
collision occurs. Note that the DSP software should be written to ensure this never happens; the interrupt is intended for
development purposes only. See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt-event handling.
The program firmware parameters are formatted as 40-bit words. For this reason, 3 x 32-bit register addresses are
required for every 2 x 40-bit words.

The X-memory on each DSP supports read/write access to all register fields throughout the device, including the codec
control registers, and the firmware memory of all of the integrated DSP cores. Access to the register address space is
supported using a number of register windows within the X-memory on each DSP.
The register window space is additional to the X-data memory sizes described in Table 4-29. Note that the X-memory
addresses of these register windows are the same for all DSP cores, regardless of the different X-memory sizes.
Addresses 0xC000 to 0xDFFF in X-memory map directly to addresses 0x0000 to 0x1FFF in the device register space.
This fixed register window contains primarily the codec control registers; it also includes the virtual DSP control registers
(described in Section 4.4.7). Each X-memory address within this window maps onto one 16-bit register in the codec
memory space.
Four movable register windows are also provided, starting at X-memory addresses 0xF000, 0xF400, 0xF800, and 0xFC00
respectively. Each window represents 1024 addresses in the X-memory space. The start address, within the
corresponding device register space, for each window is configured using DSPn_EXT_[A/B/C/D]_PAGE (where A defines
the first window, B defines the second window, etc.).
Two mapping modes are supported and are selected using the DSPn_EXT_[A/B/C/D]_PSIZE16 bits for the respective
window. In 16-Bit Mode, each address within the window maps onto one 16-bit register in the device memory space; the
window equates to 1024 x 16-bit registers. In 32-Bit Mode, each address within the window maps onto two 16-bit registers
in the device memory space; the window equates to 1024 x 32-bit registers.
Note that the X-memory is only 24-bits wide; as a result, the upper 8 bits of the odd-numbered register addresses are not
mapped, and cannot be accessed, in 32-Bit Mode.
The DSPn_EXT_[A/B/C/D]_PAGE fields are defined with an LSB = 512. Accordingly, the base address of each window
must be aligned with 512-word boundaries. Note that the base addresses are entirely independent of each other; for
example, overlapping windows are permissible if required, and there is no requirement for the A/B/C/D windows to be at
incremental locations.
The register map window functions are shown in Fig. 4-30. Further information on the definition and usage of the DSP
firmware memories is provided in the software programming guide; contact your Cirrus Logic representative if required.

Note that the full CS47L90 register space is shown here as 16-bit width. (SPI/I2C/SLIMbus register access uses 32-bit
data width at 0x3000 and above.) However, the window base address fields (DSPn_EXT_[A/B/C/D]_PAGE) are
referenced to 16-bit width, and 16-bit register mapping is shown. Hence, the device register map is shown here entirely
as 16-bit width for ease of explanation.
The control registers associated with the register map window functions are described in Table 4-30.

4.4.2       DSP Memory Locking
Each DSP has the capability for read/write access to the codec registers and to the firmware memory space of other DSPs.
Access to these registers and memories is supported via the X-memory on each DSP (using the register windows), as
described in Section 4.4.1.
The CS47L90 provides a register-locking feature that blocks DSP register-write attempts to invalid register regions,
preventing the firmware from making unintentional changes to register and memory contents. An interrupt event and
associated debug information are generated if any write-access attempt is blocked; this can be used to assist software
development and debug.
The register map and DSP firmware memories are partitioned into 10 regions; each region can be locked independently
with respect to each DSP core. This allows full flexibility to lock different register/memory regions according to the specific
firmware running on each DSP.
Each DSP has direct access to its own X-, Y-, Z-, and P- memories; this is always enabled and cannot be locked. Access
to the codec registers, DSP peripheral registers, and the firmware memory space of other DSPs is effected using the
X-memory register windows (fixed codec window, and four configurable windows)—write access to these locations is
governed by the locking mechanism that has been configured in respect of the DSP.
The virtual DSP registers occupy addresses within the codec register space; these registers represent one of the lockable
regions within the register map—two independent locks are provided for the codec and virtual DSP registers.

Note:     A DSPn register window can be mapped onto a memory region of the same DSPn. In this event, write access via
          that window is governed by the register locks, potentially blocking the DSP from accessing its own memory. This
          is not the intended use of the register lock, however.
The lockable register/memory regions are defined in Table 4-31.

The register locks are controlled using the DSPn_CTRL_REGIONm_LOCK fields (where n identifies the DSP core, and m
identifies the register/memory region). The associated lock determines whether DSPn is granted write access to region m.
To change the lock status, two writes must be made to the respective register field:
    •   Writing 0x5555, followed by 0xAAAA, sets the respective lock
    •   Writing 0xCCCC, followed by 0x3333, clears the respective lock
The status of each lock can be read from the DSPn_CTRL_REGIONm_LOCK_STS bits.
Write access to the DSPn_CTRL_REGIONm_LOCK fields is always possible if they are accessed by the same DSPn.
This means that each DSP core always has write access for configuring the locks affecting register access by that DSP.
However, if one DSP attempts to configure the locks on another DSP, this would be conditional upon the status of the
applicable lock. For example, if DSP2 attempts to configure the DSP3 lock settings, the effect would depend on the DSP2_
CTRL_REGION5_LOCK status (Region 5 corresponds to DSP3 locks).
The DSP memory locking function is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event
if an invalid register write is attempted—see Section 4.4.5. Additional status and control fields are provided for debug
purposes, as described in Section 4.4.6.
The control registers associated with the DSP memory locking functions are described in Table 4-32.

4.4.3        DSP Firmware Control
The configuration and control of the DSP firmware is described in the following subsections.
4.4.3.1        DSP Memory
The DSP memory (program, X-data, Y-data, and coefficient) is enabled by setting DSPn_MEM_ENA for the respective
DSP. This memory must be enabled (DSPn_MEM_ENA = 1) for read/write access, code execution, and DMA functions.
The DSP memory is disabled, and the contents lost, whenever the respective DSPn_MEM_ENA bit is cleared.
The DSPn_MEM_ENA bits are not affected by software reset; these bits remain in their previous state under software
reset conditions. Accordingly, the DSP memory contents are maintained through software reset, provided DCVDD is held
above its reset threshold.
The DSP firmware memory is always cleared under power-on reset, hardware reset, and Sleep Mode conditions. See
Section 5.2 for a summary of the CS47L90 reset behavior.
4.4.3.2        DSP Clocking
Clocking is required for each DSP processing block, when executing software or when supporting DMA functions. (Note
that clocking is not required for access to the firmware registers by the host processor.)
Clocking within each DSP is enabled and disabled automatically, as required by the respective DSP core and DMA
channel status.
In normal operating conditions, the clock source for each DSP is derived from DSPCLK. See Section 4.17 for details of
how to configure DSPCLK. See Section 4.4.3.4 for supported clocking configurations when DSPCLK is not enabled.
The clock frequency for each DSP is selected using the DSPn_CLK_FREQ_SEL field (where n identifies the applicable
DSP block, 1 to 7). The selected DSP clock frequency must be less than or equal to the DSPCLK frequency. For DSP7,
the maximum DSP clock frequency is 75 MHz.
The DSPn_CLK_FREQ_STS fields indicate the clock frequency for the respective DSP cores. These can be used to
confirm the clock frequency, in cases where code execution has a minimum clock frequency requirement. The DSPn_
CLK_FREQ_STS field is only valid when the respective core is running code; typical usage of this field would be for the
DSP core itself to read the clock status and to take action as applicable, in particular, if the available clock does not meet
the application requirements.

                                                                                                                     CS47L90
                                                                                                     4.4 DSP Firmware Control
Note that, depending on the DSPCLK frequency and the available clock dividers, the DSPn clock frequency may differ
from the selected clock. In most cases, the DSPn clock frequency equals or exceeds the requested frequency. A lower
frequency is implemented if limited by either the DSPCLK frequency or the maximum DSPn clocking frequency.
The DSPCLK configuration provides input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event when
the DSPn clock frequency is less than the requested frequency; see Section 4.16.
4.4.3.3      DSP Code Execution
After the DSP firmware has been loaded, and the clocks configured, the DSP blocks are enabled by setting the DSPn_
CORE_ENA bits. When the DSP is configured and enabled, the firmware execution can be started by writing 1 to the
respective DSPn_START bit.
Alternative methods to trigger the firmware execution can also be configured using the DSPn_START_IN_SEL fields. Note
that this provides the capability to synchronously trigger multiple DSP blocks.
Using the DSPn_START_IN_SEL fields, the DSP firmware execution can be linked to the respective DMA function, the
IRQ2 status, DSPn start signals from another DSP, or to the FIFO status in one of the event loggers:
    •  DMA function: firmware execution commences when all enabled DSP input (WDMA) channel buffers have been
       filled, and all enabled DSP output (RDMA) channel buffers have been emptied
    •  DSPn start signals: firmware execution commences when the respective start signal is triggered in the selected
       DSP core (1 to 4 only)
    •  IRQ2: firmware execution commences when one or more of the unmasked IRQ2 events has occurred
    •  Event logger status: firmware execution commences when the FIFO not-empty status is asserted within the
       respective event logger
To enable firmware execution on the respective DSP block, the DSPn_CORE_ENA bit must be set. Note that the usage
of the DSPn_START bit may vary depending on the particular firmware that is being executed: in some applications (e.g.,
when an alternative trigger is selected using DSPn_START_IN_SEL), writing to the DSPn_START bit is not required.
4.4.3.4      DSP Operation without DSPCLK
In normal operating conditions, the clock source for each DSP block is derived from DSPCLK. The CS47L90 also supports
DSP operation when DSPCLK is not enabled; this provides capability for always-on DSP applications.
The alternative clock source, for DSP clocking without DSPCLK, is the always-on FLL (FLL_AO). The FLL_AO output
frequency range is approximately 45–50 MHz and is suitable for low-speed DSP clocking requirements.
The default FLL_AO settings are configured to provide a 49.152-MHz output, suitable for use as the always-on DSP clock
source. Note that the FLL_AO control registers must always hold valid settings—either enabled and locked to an input
reference clock, or else configured in FLL Hold Mode. See Section 4.17.9 for details of FLL_AO.
The always-on DSP clocking options are configured using the DSPn_FLL_AO_CLKENA and EVENTLOGn_FLL_AO_
CLKENA bits:
    •  Setting DSPn_FLL_AO_CLKENA causes the respective DSP to be clocked directly from FLL_AO if DSP_CLK_
       ENA = 0. This allows the DSP core to execute firmware code while DSPCLK is absent.
    •  Setting EVENTLOGn_FLL_AO_CLKENA enables the DSP cores to be clocked directly from FLL_AO if DSP_CLK_
       ENA = 0 and the FIFO not-empty status is asserted for the respective event logger. This allows the DSP cores to
       execute firmware code while DSPCLK is absent, triggered by an event detected on one of the event loggers. Note
       that a DSP core is only clocked in this case if the start trigger for that DSP is derived from the status of the respective
       event logger (i.e., DSPn_START_IN_SEL selects the event logger as the start signal). See Section 4.5.2 for details
       of the event loggers; the EVENTLOGn_FLL_AO_CLKENA bits are defined in Table 4-38.
Note that these control bits do not automatically start DSP firmware execution—the applicable DSP blocks must also be
enabled using DSPn_CORE_ENA, and the start signals must be configured, as applicable.

                                                                                                                CS47L90
                                                                                                  4.4 DSP Firmware Control
The intended use case of the EVENTLOGn_FLL_AO_CLKENA bit is where one of the DSP cores is configured to use an
event logger status bit as its start condition. Note that, to support continued operation of the DSP core after the event log
status is cleared (i.e., the FIFO buffer has been emptied), clocking of the respective DSP core must be enabled using
DSPn_FLL_AO_CLKENA, or else by enabling DSPCLK as per the normal system clocking operation. One or other of
these actions could be effected via the DSP firmware code.
The clock frequency for each DSP in these always-on clocking modes is selected using the DSPn_CLK_FREQ_SEL field
(same as normal DSP clocking). Note that, depending on the FLL_AO output frequency and the available clock dividers,
the DSPn clock frequency may differ from the selected frequency. In most cases, the DSPn clock frequency equals or
exceeds the requested frequency. A lower frequency is implemented if limited by the FLL_AO frequency.
The DSP_CLK_SRC field is ignored in the always-on clocking modes. The DSP cores revert to the normal (DSPCLK)
clocking configuration if DSP_CLK_ENA = 1.
4.4.3.5      DSP Watchdog Timer
A watchdog timer is provided for each DSP, which can be used to detect software lock-ups, and other conditions that
require corrective action in order to resume the intended DSP behavior.
The DSPn watchdog is enabled using DSPn_WDT_ENA. The timeout period is configured using DSPn_WDT_MAX_
COUNT.
In normal operation, the watchdog should be reset regularly—this action is used to confirm that the DSP code is running
correctly. The watchdog is reset by writing 0x5555, followed by 0xAAAA, to the DSPn_WDT_RESET field.
The watchdog status bit, DSPn_WDT_TIMEOUT_STS, is set if the timeout period elapses before the watchdog is reset;
this event typically signals that a lock-up or other error condition has occurred.
The DSP watchdog is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event if the timeout
period elapses—see Section 4.4.5.
Note that write access to the DSPn_WDT_RESET field is not affected by the register locking mechanism (see
Section 4.4.2), if written by the same DSPn. This means that each DSPn core always has write access to reset the
watchdog for the same DSPn. However, if one DSP attempts to reset the watchdog on another DSP, this would be
conditional upon the status of the applicable lock. For example, if DSP2 attempts to reset the DSP3 watchdog, the effect
would depend upon the DSP2_CTRL_REGION5_LOCK status (Region 5 corresponds to DSP3 locks).
4.4.3.6      DSP Control Registers
The DSP memory, clocking, code-execution, and watchdog control registers are described in Table 4-33.
The audio signal paths connecting to/from the DSP processing blocks are configured as described in Section 4.3. Note

4.4.4       DSP Direct Memory Access (DMA) Control
Each DSP provides a multichannel DMA function; this is configured using the registers described in Table 4-34.
There are eight WDMA (DSP input) and six RDMA (DSP output) channels for each DSP; these are enabled using the
DSPn_WDMA_CHANNEL_ENABLE and DSPn_RDMA_CHANNEL_ENABLE fields. The status of each WDMA channel
is indicated in DSPn_WDMA_ACTIVE_CHANNELS.
The DMA can access the X-data memory or Y-data memory associated with the respective DSP. The applicable memory
is selected using bit [15] of the respective x_START_ADDRESS field for each DMA channel.
The start address of each DMA channel is configured as described in Table 4-34. Note that the required address is defined
relative to the base address of the selected (X-data or Y-data) memory.
The buffer length of the DMA channels is configured using the DSPn_DMA_BUFFER_LENGTH field. The selected buffer
length applies to all enabled DMA channels.
Note that the start-address fields and buffer-length fields are defined in 24-bit DSP data word units. This means that the
LSB of these fields represents one 24-bit DSP memory word. This differs from the CS47L90 register map layout described
in Table 4-29.
The parameters of a DMA channel (i.e., start address or offset address) must not be changed while the respective DMA
is enabled. All of the DMA channels must be disabled before changing the DMA buffer length.
Each DMA channel uses a twin buffer mechanism to support uninterrupted data flow through the DSP. The buffers are
called ping and pong, and are of configurable size, as noted above. Data is transferred to/from each buffer in turn.
When the ping input data buffer is full, the DSPn_PING_FULL bit is set, and a DSP start signal is generated. The start
signal from the DMA is typically used to start firmware execution, as noted in Table 4-33. Meanwhile, further DSP input
data fills up the pong buffer.
When the pong input buffer is full, the DSPn_PONG_FULL bit is set, and another DSP start signal is generated. The DSP
firmware must take care to read the input data from the applicable buffer, in accordance with the DSPn_PING_FULL and
DSPn_PONG_FULL status bits.
Twin buffers are also used on the DSP output (RDMA) channels. The output ping buffers are emptied at the same time as
the input ping buffers are filled; the output pong buffers are emptied at the same time that the input pong buffers are filled.
The DSP cores support 24-bit signal processing. Under default conditions, the DSP audio data is in 2’s complement Q3.20
format (i.e., 0xF00000 corresponds to the –1.0 level, and 0x100000 corresponds to the +1.0 level; a sine wave with peak
values of ±1.0 corresponds to the 0 dBFS level). If DSPn_DMA_WORD_SEL is set, audio data is transferred to and from
DSPn in Q0.23 format. The applicable format should be set according to the requirements of the specific DSP firmware.

Note that the DSP cores are optimized for Q3.20 audio data processing; Q0.23 data can be supported, but the firmware
implementation may incur a reduction in power efficiency due to the higher MIPS required for arithmetic operations in
non-native data word format.
The DMA function is an input to the interrupt control circuit—see Section 4.4.5. The respective interrupt event is triggered
if all enabled input (WDMA) channel buffers have been filled and all enabled output (RDMA) channel buffers have been
emptied.
Further details of the DMA are provided in the software programming guide; contact your Cirrus Logic representative if
required.

    •   DMA interrupt—Asserted when all enabled DSP input (WDMA) channel buffers have been filled, and all enabled
        DSP output (RDMA) channel buffers have been emptied
    •   DSP Start 1, DSP Start 2 interrupts—Asserted when the respective start signal is triggered

    •   DSP Bus Error interrupt—Asserted when a locked register address, invalid memory address, or watchdog timeout
        error is detected
The CS47L90 also provides 16 control bits that allow the DSP cores to generate programmable interrupt events. When a
1 is written to these bits (see Table 4-35), the respective DSP interrupt (DSP_IRQn_EINTx) is triggered. The associated
interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal.
See Section 4.16 for further details.

4.4.6        DSP Debug Support
General-purpose registers are provided for each DSP. These have no assigned function and can be used to assist in
algorithm development.
The JTAG interface provides test and debug access to the CS47L90, as described in Section 4.21. The JTAG interface
clock can be enabled independently for each DSP core using the DSPn_DBG_CLK_ENA bits. Note that, when the JTAG
interface is used to access any DSP core, the respective DSPn_CORE_ENA bit must also be set.
The DSPn_LOCK_ERR_STS bit indicates that DSPn attempted to write to a locked register address. The DSPn_ADDR_
ERR_STS bit indicates that DSPn attempted to access an invalid memory address (i.e., an address whose contents are
undefined). Once set, these bits remain set until a 1 is written to DSPn_ERR_CLEAR.
The DSPn_PMEM_ERR_ADDR and DSPn_XMEM_ERR_ADDR fields contain the program memory and X-data memory
addresses associated with a locked register address error condition. If DSPn_LOCK_ERR_STS is set, these fields
correspond to the first-detected locked register address error. Note that no subsequent error event can be reported in
these fields until the DSPn_LOCK_ERR_STS is cleared.
Note:      The DSPn_PMEM_ERR_ADDR value is the prefetched address of a code instruction that has not yet been
           executed; it does not point directly to the instruction that caused the error.
The DSPn_BUS_ERR_ADDR field indicates the register/memory address that resulted in a register-access error. The
field relates either to a locked register address error or to an invalid memory address error, as follows:
    •   If DSPn_LOCK_ERR_STS is set, the DSPn_BUS_ERR_ADDR value corresponds to the first-detected locked
        register address error. Note that no subsequent error event can be reported in this field until DSPn_LOCK_ERR_
        STS is cleared.

     •  If DSPn_ADDR_ERR_STS is set, and DSPn_LOCK_ERR_STS is clear, the DSPn_BUS_ERR_ADDR field
        corresponds to the most recent invalid memory address error.
     •  If the DSPn_LOCK_ERR_STS and DSPn_ADDR_ERR_STS are both clear, the DSPn_BUS_ERR_ADDR field is
        undefined.
Note:      The DSPn_BUS_ERR_ADDR value is coded using a byte-referenced address, so the actual register address is
           equal to DSPn_BUS_ERR_ADDR / 2. If the register-access error is the result of an attempt to access the virtual
           DSP registers, a register address of 0 is reported.
If the DSPn_ERR_PAUSE bit is set, the DSPn code execution stops immediately on detection of a locked register address
error. This enables debug information to be retrieved from the DSP core during code development. In this event, code
execution can be restarted by clearing the DSPn_ERR_PAUSE bit. Alternatively, the DSP core can restarted by clearing
and setting DSPn_CORE_ENA (described in Section 4.4.3.3).

4.4.7       Virtual DSP Registers
The DSP control registers, described throughout Section 4.4, are implemented for each DSP core. Each control register
has a unique location within the CS47L90 register map.
An additional set of DSP control registers is also defined, which can be used in firmware to access any of the DSPs: The
virtual DSP (or DSP 0) registers are defined at address R4096 (0x1000) in the device register map. The full register map
listing is provided in Section 6.
Note that read/write access to the virtual DSP registers is only possible via firmware running on the integrated DSP cores.
When DSP firmware accesses the virtual registers, the registers are automatically mapped onto the control registers
corresponding to whichever DSP core is making the read/write access. For example, if DSP1 accesses these registers,
they are mapped onto the DSP1 control registers. If DSP2 accesses the virtual registers, they are mapped onto the DSP2
control registers.
The virtual DSP registers are designed to allow software to be transferable to any of the DSPs without modification to the
software code.
The virtual DSP registers are defined at register addresses R4096–R4192 (0x1000–0x1060) in the device register map.
Note that these registers cannot be accessed directly at the addresses shown; they can be only accessed through DSP
firmware code, using the register window function shown in Fig. 4-30. The virtual DSP registers are located at address
0xD000 in the X-data memory map.
4.5 DSP Peripheral Control
The CS47L90 incorporates a suite of DSP peripheral functions that can be integrated together to support the sensor-hub
capability. A master I2C interface is provided for external sensor connectivity. Configurable event log functions provide
multichannel monitoring of internal and external signals. The general-purpose timers provide time-stamp data for the event
logs and support watchdog and other miscellaneous time-based functions. Maskable GPIO provides an efficient
mechanism for multiple DSPs to access the respective input and output signals.
The DSP peripherals are designed to provide a comprehensive sensor-hub capability, operating with a high degree of
autonomy from the host processor.
4.5.1       Master Interfaces (MIF1, MIF2, MIF3)
The CS47L90 incorporates three I2C master interfaces, offering a flexible capability for additional sensor/accessory input.
4.5.1.1       Overview
The master interfaces (MIF1, MIF2, MIF3) can support single- and multiple-master I2C operation up to 1 MHz. The master
interfaces support 7- and 10-bit slave addressing modes. Master device arbitration algorithms are implemented, in
accordance with the standard I2C protocol. A watchdog timer is provided for detecting interface error conditions.
The master interfaces are ideally suited for connection to external sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
magnetometers for motion-sensing and navigation applications. Other example accessories include barometers and
ambient light sensors, for environmental awareness. Flow-control bits for the TX and RX data buffers enable easy
integration with external devices and with internal DSP functions.
Clocking for the master interfaces is derived from DSPCLK, which must be enabled and present when using any of these
interfaces. Standard I2C bus rates are configured automatically from the DSPCLK frequency (see Section 4.17).
4.5.1.2       Transmit and Receive Data Buffers
The transmit (master write) and receive (master read) actions are each supported by 16-byte data buffers, allowing I2C
transfers of up to 2,097,152 data bytes (2 MB). The number of data bytes transferred in each I2C operation is selected
using MIFn_TX_LENGTH or MIFn_RX_LENGTH.

                                                                                                                CS47L90
                                                                                                 4.5 DSP Peripheral Control
Data to be transmitted is managed using the TX data buffers; the application software must load data into the buffer
registers (MIFn_TX_BYTEx) and then write 1 to the MIFn_TX_DONE bit to commit that data for transmission. The MIFn_
TX_REQUEST bit indicates when the buffer registers are ready for loading new data. Internal buffering of the TX data
enables uninterrupted I2C writes. If new data is not ready for transmission, SCLK halts until the buffer registers have been
filled.
Data received on the interface is managed using the RX data buffers; the MIFn_RX_REQUEST bit indicates when the
buffer registers contain new data. The application software must read the buffer registers (MIFn_RX_BYTEm), and then
write 1 to the MIFn_RX_DONE bit to confirm the data has been read. Internal buffering of the RX data enables
uninterrupted I2C reads. If the buffers are not ready to receive new data, SCLK halts until the buffer registers have been
read.
The master interface divides each I2C transaction into one or more data blocks. The block length is configurable using the
MIFn_TX_BLOCK_LENGTH and MIFn_RX_BLOCK_LENGTH fields. The block length is equal to the number of bytes
transmitted/received for each TX_DONE/RX_DONE action. The maximum block length is 16 bytes, corresponding to the
size of the TX and RX data buffers.
Note:    The order in which the data bytes in the TX/RX buffers are transferred depends on the selected MIFn_WORD_
         SIZE setting. Correct setting of the word size ensures that each data word is transmitted/received most-significant
         byte first.
The Master Interface is configured for Read (RX) or Write (TX) operation using the MIF1_READ_WRITE_SEL bit. Each
I2C transfer is started by writing 1 to the MIF1_START bit. In the case of a Master Write, data must be committed to the
TX data buffers using the TX_DONE bit, to enable the transfer to proceed—note that the first block of transmit data can
be committed to the TX buffers before or after writing to the START bit for the respective transfer.
4.5.1.3      Interrupts and Status Bits
The MIFn_BUSY_STS bit indicates when the master interface is executing an I2C transaction. This bit is set during each
I2C transaction, and cleared on completion. An interrupt event is also triggered on completion of the I2C transfer, if the
corresponding MIF1_DONE_EINTx is unmasked as an input to the IRQ circuit.
Additional status bits are provided to indicate watchdog timeout, loss of bus arbitration, or a NACK error signal received.
Table 4-37 describes these bits.
Note that the MIF done indication is asserted each time an I2C transfer completes, including when an error condition has
occurred. It is recommended that the master interface status bits be checked after each I2C transaction, so corrective
action can be taken when necessary.
The master interface provides inputs to the interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered on completion of each
TX/RX block, and on completion of the I2C transaction; see Section 4.16.
4.5.1.4      External Connections
The external connections associated with each I2C master interface (MIF) are implemented on multifunction GPIO pins,
which must be configured for the respective MIF functions when required. The MIFnSCLK and MIFnSDA connections are
pin-specific alternative functions available on specific GPIO pins only. See Section 4.15 to configure the GPIO pins for the
MIF operation.

4.5.2       Event Loggers
The CS47L90 provides eight event log functions, supporting multichannel, edge-sensitive monitoring and recording of
internal or external signals.
4.5.2.1      Overview
The event loggers allow status information to be captured from a large number of sources, to be prioritized and acted upon
as required. For the purposes of the event loggers, an event is recorded when a logic transition (edge) is detected on a
selected signal source.
The logged events are held in a FIFO buffer, which is managed by the application software. A 32-bit time stamp, derived
from one of the general-purpose timers, is associated and recorded with each FIFO index, to provide a comprehensive
record of the detected events.
Each event logger must be associated with one of the general-purpose timers. The selected timer is the source of time
stamp data for any logged events. If DSPCLK is disabled, the timer also provides the clock source for the event logger. (If
DSPCLK is enabled, DSPCLK is used as the clock source instead.)
A maximum of one event per cycle of the clock source can be logged. If more than one event occurs within the cycle time,
the highest priority (lowest channel number) event is logged at the rising edge of the clock. In this case, any lower priority
events is queued, and is logged as soon as no higher priority events are pending. It is possible for recurring events on a
high-priority channel to be logged, while low-priority ones remain queued. Note that recurring instances of events that are
queued would not be logged.
The event logger can use a slow clock (e.g., 32 kHz), but higher clock frequencies may also be commonly used, depending
on the application and use case. The clock frequency determines the maximum possible event logging rate.
4.5.2.2      Event Logger Control
The event logger is enabled by setting EVENTLOGn_ENA (where n identifies the respective event logger, 1–8).
The event logger can be reset by writing 1 to EVENTLOGn_RST. Executing this function clears all the event logger status
flags and clears the contents of the FIFO buffer.
The associated timer (and time-stamp source) is selected using EVENTLOGn_TIME_SEL. Note that the event logger
must be disabled (EVENTLOGn_ENA = 0) when selecting the timer source.
4.5.2.3      Input Channel Configuration
The event logger allows up to 16 input channels to be configured for detection and logging. The EVENTLOGn_CHx_SEL
field selects the applicable input source for each channel (where x identifies the channel number, 1 to 16). The polarity
selection and debounce options are configured using the EVENTLOGn_CHx_POL and EVENTLOGn_CHx_DB bits
respectively.
The input channels can be enabled or disabled freely, using EVENTLOGn_CHx_ENA, without having to disable the event
logger entirely. An input channel must be disabled whenever the associated x_SEL, x_POL, or x_DB fields are written. It
is possible to reconfigure input channels while the event logger is enabled, provided the channels being reconfigured are
disabled when doing so.
The available input sources include GPIO inputs, external accessory status (jack, mic, sensors), and signals generated by
the integrated DSP cores. A list of the valid input sources for the event loggers is provided in Table 4-39. Note that, to log
both rising and falling events from any source, two separate input channels must be configured—one for each polarity.

                                                                                                                      CS47L90
                                                                                                    4.5 DSP Peripheral Control
If an input channel is configured for rising edge detection (EVENTLOGn_CHx_POL = 0), and the corresponding input
signal is asserted (Logic 1) at the time when the event logger is enabled, an event is logged in respect of this initial state.
Similarly, if an input channel is configured for falling edge detection, and is deasserted (Logic 0) when the event logger is
enabled, a corresponding event is logged. If rising and falling edges are both configured for detection, an event is always
logged in respect of the initial condition.
4.5.2.4        FIFO Buffer
Each event (signal transition) that meets the criteria of an enabled channel is written to the 16-stage FIFO buffer. The
buffer is filled cyclically, but does not overwrite unread data when full. An error condition occurs if the buffer fills up
completely.
Note that the FIFO behavior is not enforced or fully implemented in the device hardware, but assumes that a compatible
software implementation is in place. New events are written to the buffer in a cyclic manner, but the data can be read out
in any order, if desired. The designed FIFO behavior requires the software to update the read pointer (RPTR) in the
intended manner for smooth operation.
The entire contents of the 16-stage FIFO buffer can be accessed directly in the register map. Each FIFO index (y = 0 to
15) comprises the EVENTLOGn_FIFOy_ID (identifying the source signal of the associated log event), the EVENTLOGn_
FIFOy_POL (the polarity of the respective event transition), and the EVENTLOGn_FIFOy_TIME field (containing the 32-bit
time stamp from the associated timer).
The FIFO buffer is managed using EVENTLOGn_FIFO_WPTR and EVENTLOGn_FIFO_RPTR. The write pointer
(WPTR) field identifies the index location (0 to 15) in which the next event is logged. The read pointer (RPTR) field
identifies the index location of the first set of unread data, if any exists. Both of these fields are initialized to 0 when the
event logger is reset.
    •   If RPTR  WPTR, the buffer contains new data. The number of new events is equal to the difference between the
        two pointer values (WPTR – RPTR, allowing for wraparound beyond Index 15). For example, if WPTR = 12 and
        RPTR = 8, this means that there are four unread data sets in the buffer, at index locations 8, 9, 10, and 11.
        After reading the new data from the buffer, the RPTR value should be incremented by the corresponding amount
        (e.g., increment by 4, in the example described above). Note that the RPTR value can either be incremented once
        for each read, or can be incremented in larger steps after a batch read.
    •   If RPTR = WPTR, the buffer is either empty (0 events) or full (16 events). In this case, the status bits described in
        Section 4.5.2.5 confirm the current status of the buffer.
4.5.2.5        Status Bits
The EVENTLOGn_NOT_EMPTY bit indicates whether the FIFO buffer is empty. When this bit is set, it indicates one or
more new sets of data in the FIFO.
The EVENTLOGn_WMARK_STS bit indicates when the number of FIFO index locations available for new events reaches
a configurable threshold, known as the watermark level. The watermark level is held in the EVENTLOGn_FIFO_WMARK
field.
The EVENTLOGn_FULL bit indicates when the FIFO buffer is full. When this bit is set, it indicates that there are 16 sets
of new event data in the FIFO. Note that this does not mean that a buffer overflow condition has occurred, but further
events are not logged or indicated until the buffer has been cleared.
Note:      Following a buffer full condition, the FIFO operation resumes as soon as the RPTR field has been updated to a
           new value. Writing the same value to RPTR does not restart the FIFO operation, even if the entire buffer contents
           have been read. After all of the required data has been read from the buffer, the RPTR value should be set equal
           to the WPTR value; an intermediate (different) value must also be written to the RPTR field in order to clear the
           buffer full status and restart the FIFO operation.
4.5.2.6        Interrupts, GPIO, Write Sequencer, and DSP Firmware Control
The control-write sequencer is automatically triggered whenever the NOT_EMPTY status of the event log buffer is
asserted. A different control sequence may be configured for each event logger; see Section 4.19 for further details.

The event log status flags are inputs to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event when the
respective FIFO condition (full, not empty, or watermark level) occurs; see Section 4.16.
The event log status can be output directly on a GPIO pin as an external indication of the event logger; see Section 4.15
to configure a GPIO pin for this function.
The event log NOT_EMPTY status can also be selected as a start trigger for DSP firmware execution; see Section 4.4.
The NOT_EMPTY status can be used to configure a clock source for the DSP cores when DSPCLK is not enabled. This
allows the DSP cores to execute firmware code while DSPCLK is absent, triggered by an event detected on one of the
event loggers. See Section 4.4.3.4 for further details.

1.See Table 4-39 for valid channel source selections
4.5.2.8        Event Logger Input Sources
A list of the valid input sources for the event loggers is provided in Table 4-39.
The EDGE type noted is coded as S (single edge) or D (dual edge). Note that a single-edge input source only provides
valid input to the event logger in the default (rising edge triggered) polarity.
Take care when enabling IRQ1 or IRQ2 as an input source for the event loggers; a recursive loop, where the IRQn signal
is also an output from the same event logger, must be avoided.

4.5.3     General-Purpose Timers
The CS47L90 incorporates eight general-purpose timers, which support a wide variety of uses. In particular, these timers
provide essential support for the sensor-hub capability.

                                                                                                                   CS47L90
                                                                                                  4.5 DSP Peripheral Control
4.5.3.1      Overview
The timers allow time-stamp information to be associated with external sensor activity, and other system events, enabling
real-time data to be more easily integrated into user applications. The timers allow many advanced functions to be
implemented with a high degree of autonomy from a host processor.
The timers can use either internal system clocks, or external clock signals, as a reference. The selected reference is scaled
down, using configurable dividers, to the required clock count frequency.
4.5.3.2      Timer Control
The reference clock for each timer is selected using TIMERn_REFCLK_SRC, (where n identifies the applicable timer,
1–8).
If SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, or DSPCLK is selected, a lower clock frequency, derived from the applicable system clock, can
be selected using the TIMERn_REFCLK_FREQ_SEL field (for SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK source) or the TIMERn_
DSPCLK_FREQ_SEL field (for DSPCLK source). The applicable division ratio is determined automatically, assuming the
respective clock source has been correctly configured as described in Section 4.17.
Note that, depending on the DSPCLK frequency and the available clock dividers, the timer reference clock may differ from
the selected clock if DSPCLK is the selected source. In most cases, the reference clock frequency equals or exceeds the
requested frequency. A lower frequency is implemented if limited by either the DSPCLK frequency or the maximum
TIMERn clocking frequency.
If any source other than DSPCLK is selected, the clock can be further divided using TIMERn_REFCLK_DIV. Division ratios
in the range 1 to 128 can be selected.
Note that, if DSPCLK is enabled, the CS47L90 synchronizes the selected reference clock to DSPCLK. As a result of this,
if a non-DSPCLK is selected as source, the following additional constraints must be observed: the reference clock
frequency (after TIMERn_REFCLK_FREQ_SEL and after TIMERn_REFCLK_DIV) must be less than DSPCLK / 3, and
must be less than 12 MHz; it must also be close to 50% duty cycle. The TIMERn_REFCLK_DIV field can be used to ensure
that these criteria are met.
One final division, controlled by TIMERn_PRESCALE, determines the timer count frequency. This field is valid for all clock
reference sources; division ratios in the range 1 to 128 can be selected. The output from this division corresponds to the
frequency at which the TIMERn_COUNT fields are incremented (or decremented).
The maximum count value of the timer is determined by the TIMERn_MAX_COUNT field. This is the final count value
(when counting up), or the initial count value (when counting down). The current value of the timer counter can be read
from the TIMERn_CUR_COUNT field.
The timer is started by writing 1 to TIMERn_START. Note that, if the timer is already running, it restarts from its initial value.
The timer is stopped by writing 1 to TIMERn_STOP. The count direction (up or down) is selected using the TIMERn_DIR
bit.
The TIMERn_CONTINUOUS bit selects whether the timer automatically restarts after the end-of-count condition has been
reached. The TIMERn_RUNNING_STS indicates whether the timer is running, or if it has stopped.
Note that the timers should be stopped before making any changes to the respective configuration registers. The timer
configuration should only be changed if TIMERn_RUNNING_STS = 0.
4.5.3.3      Interrupts and GPIO Output
The timer status is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event after the final count
value is reached; see Section 4.16. Note that the interrupt does not occur immediately when the final count value is
reached; the interrupt is triggered at the point when the next update to the timer count value would be due.
The timer status can be output directly on a GPIO pin as an external indication of the timer activity. See Section 4.15 to
configure a GPIO pin for this function.

4.5.4       DSP GPIO
The DSP GPIO function provides an advanced I/O capability, supporting the requirements of the CS47L90 as a
multipurpose sensor hub.
4.5.4.1      Overview
The CS47L90 supports up to 38 GPIO pins, which can be assigned to application-specific functions. There are 8 dedicated
GPIO pins; the remaining 30 GPIOs are implemented as alternate functions to a pin-specific capability.
The GPIOs can be used to provide status outputs and control signals to external hardware; the supported functions include
interrupt output, FLL clock output, accessory detection status, and S/PDIF or PWM-coded audio channels; see
Section 4.15.
The GPIOs can support miscellaneous logic input and output, interfacing directly with the integrated DSPs, or with the host
application software. A basic level of I/O functionality is described in Section 4.15, under the configuration where GPn_
FN = 0x001. The GPn_FN field selects the functionality for the respective pin, GPIOn.
The DSP GPIO pins are accessed using maskable sets of I/O control registers; this allows the selected combinations of
GPIOs to be controlled with ease, regardless of how the allocation of GPIO pins has been implemented in hardware. In a
typical use case, one GPIO mask is defined for each DSP, or for each functional process; this provides a highly efficient
mechanism for each DSP to independently access the respective input and output signals.
4.5.4.2      DSP GPIO Control
The DSP GPIO function is selected by setting GPn_FN = 0x002 for the respective GPIO pin (where n identifies the
applicable GPIOn pin).
Each DSP GPIO is controlled using bits that determine the direction (input/output) and the logic state (0/1) of the pin. These
bits are replicated in eight control sets; each which can determine the logic level of any DSP GPIO.
Mask bits are provided within each control set, to determine which of the control sets has control of each DSP GPIO. To
avoid logic contention, a DSP GPIO output must be controlled (unmasked) in a maximum of one control set at any time.
Note that write access to the direction control bits (DSPGPn_SETx_DIR) and level control bits (DSPGPn_SETx_LVL) is
only valid when the channel (DSPGPn) is unmasked in the respective control set. Writes to these fields are implemented
for the unmasked DSP GPIOs, and are ignored in respect of the masked DSP GPIOs. Note that the level control bits
(DSPGPn_SETx_LVL) provide output level control only—they cannot be used to read the status of DSP GPIO inputs.

                                                                                                                 CS47L90
                                                                                                 4.5 DSP Peripheral Control
The logic level of the unmasked DSP GPIO outputs in any control set can be configured using a single register write.
(GPIOs 1 to 32 are set in a single operation; a separate write is required for GPIOs 33 to 38.) Writing to the output level
control registers determines the logic level of the unmasked DSP GPIOs in that set only; all other outputs are unaffected.
DSP GPIO status bits are provided, indicating the logic level of every input or output pin that is configured as a DSP GPIO.
The DSPGPn_STS bits also provide logic-level indication for any pin that is configured as a GPIO input, with GPn_
FN = 0x001.Note that there is only one set of DSP GPIO status bits.
The status bits indicate the logic level of the DSP GPIO outputs. The respective pins are driven as outputs if configured
as a DSP GPIO output, and unmasked in one of the control sets. Note that a DSP GPIO continues to be driven as an
output, even if the mask bit is subsequently asserted in that set. The pin only ceases to be driven if it is configured as a
DSP GPIO input and is unmasked in one of the control sets, or if the pin is configured as an input under a different GPn_
FN field selection.
4.5.4.3      Common Functions to Standard GPIOs
The DSP GPIO functions are implemented alongside the standard GPIO capability, providing an alternative method of
maskable I/O control for all of the GPIO pins. The DSP GPIO control bits in the register map are implemented in a manner
that supports efficient read/write access for multiple GPIOs at once.
The DSP GPIO logic is shown in Fig. 4-35, which also shows the control fields relating to the standard GPIO.
The DSP GPIO function is selected by setting GPn_FN = 0x002 for the respective GPIO pin. Integrated pull-up and
pull-down resistors are provided on each GPIO pin, which are also valid for DSP GPIO function. A bus keeper function is
supported on the GPIO pins; this is enabled using the respective pull-up and pull-down control bits. The bus keeper
function holds the logic level unchanged whenever the pin is undriven (e.g., if the signal is tristated). See Table 4-99 for
details of the GPIO pull-up and pull-down control bits.

4.6 Ambient Noise Cancelation
The ANC processor within the CS47L90 provides the capability to improve the intelligibility of a voice call by using
destructive interference to reduce the acoustic energy of the ambient sound. The stereo ANC capability supports a wide
variety of headset/handset applications.

                                                                                                                 CS47L90
                                                                                                  4.7 Digital Audio Interface
The ANC processor is configured using parameters that are determined during product development and downloaded to
the CS47L90. The configuration settings are specific to the acoustic properties of the target application. The primary
acoustic elements in an application are typically the microphones and the speaker, but other components such as the
plastics and the PCBs also have significant importance to the acoustic coefficient data.
Note that the ANC configuration parameters are application-specific, and must be recalculated following any change in the
design of the acoustic elements of that application. Any mismatch between the acoustic coefficient data and the target
application gives inferior ANC performance.
The signal path configuration settings are adjusted during product calibration to compensate for component tolerances.
Also, calibration allows DC offsets in the earpiece output path to be measured and compensated, thus reducing power
consumption and minimizing any pops and clicks in the output signal path.
The ANC processor employs stereo digital circuits to process the ambient noise (microphone) signals; the noise input
paths (analog or digital) are selected as described in Table 4-9. The selected sources are filtered and processed in
accordance with the acoustic parameters programmed into the CS47L90. The resulting noise cancelation signals can be
mixed with the output signal paths using the fields described in Table 4-80.
Noise cancelation is applied selectively to different audio-frequency bands; a low-frequency limiter ensures that the ANC
algorithms deliver noise reduction in the most sensitive frequency bands, without introducing distortion in other frequency
bands.
The ANC processor is adaptive to different ambient noise levels in order to provide the most natural sound at the
headphone audio output. The stereo ANC signal processing supports a very high level of noise cancelation capability for
a wide variety of headset/handset applications. It also incorporates a noise gating function, which ensures that the noise
cancelation performance is optimized across a wide range of input signal conditions.
Note that the ANC configuration data is lost whenever the DCVDD power domain is removed; the ANC configuration data
must be downloaded to the CS47L90 each time the device is powered up.
The procedure for configuring the CS47L90 ANC functions is tailored to each customer’s application; please contact your
Cirrus Logic representative for more details.
4.7 Digital Audio Interface
The CS47L90 provides four audio interfaces, AIF1–AIF4. Each interface is independently configurable on the respective
transmit (TX) and receive (RX) paths. AIF1 and AIF2 support up to eight channels of input and output signal paths; AIF3
and AIF4 support up to two channels of input and output signal paths.
The data sources for the audio interface transmit (TX) paths can be selected from any of the CS47L90 input signal paths,
or from the digital-core processing functions. The audio interface receive (RX) paths can be selected as inputs to any of
the digital-core processing functions or digital-core outputs. See Section 4.3 for details of the digital-core routing options.
The digital audio interfaces provide flexible connectivity for multiple processors and other audio devices. Typical
connections include applications processor, baseband processor, and wireless transceiver. Note that the SLIMbus
interface also provides digital audio input/output paths, providing options for additional interfaces. A typical configuration
is shown in Fig. 4-36.
The audio interface AIF1 and AIF2 are referenced to DBVDD1 and DBVDD2 respectively; interfaces AIF3 and AIF4 are
referenced to DBVDD3. This enables the CS47L90 to connect easily between application subsystems on different voltage
domains.

                                                Figure 4-36. Typical AIF Connections
In the general case, the digital audio interface uses four pins:
    •    TXDAT: data output
    •    RXDAT: data input
    •    BCLK: bit clock, for synchronization
    •    LRCLK: left/right data-alignment clock
In Master Mode, the clock signals BCLK and LRCLK are outputs from the CS47L90. In Slave Mode, these signals are
inputs, as shown in Section 4.7.1.
The following interface formats are supported on AIF1–AIF4:
    •    DSP Mode A.
    •    DSP Mode B
    •    I2S
    •    Left-justified
The left-justified and DSP-B formats are valid in Master Mode only (i.e., BCLK and LRCLK are outputs from the CS47L90).
These modes cannot be supported in Slave Mode.
The audio interface formats are described in Section 4.7.2. The bit order is MSB-first in each case. Mono PCM operation
can be supported using the DSP modes. Refer to Table 3-16 through Table 3-18 for signal timing information.
For typical applications, AIF data is encoded in 2’s complement (signed, fixed-point) format. This format is compatible with
all of the digital mixing and signal-processing functions on the CS47L90. Other data types, including floating point formats,
can be supported using the DFCs. Note that, if unsigned or floating point data is present within the digital core, some
restrictions on the valid signal routing options apply—see Section 4.3.13.

4.7.2        Audio Data Formats
The CS47L90 digital audio interfaces can be configured to operate in I2S, left-justified, DSP-A, or DSP-B interface modes.
Note that left-justified and DSP-B modes are valid in Master Mode only (i.e., BCLK and LRCLK are outputs from the
CS47L90).
The digital audio interfaces also provide flexibility to support multiple slots of audio data within each LRCLK frame. This
flexibility allows multiple audio channels to be supported within a single LRCLK frame.
The data formats described in this section are generic descriptions, assuming only one stereo pair of audio samples per
LRCLK frame. In these cases, the AIF is configured to transmit (or receive) in the first available position in each frame (i.e.,
the Slot 0 position).
The options for multichannel operation are described in Section 4.7.3.
The audio data modes supported by the CS47L90 are described as follows. Note that the polarity of the BCLK and LRCLK
signals can be inverted if required; the following descriptions all assume the default, noninverted polarity of these signals.
    •   In DSP modes, the left channel MSB is available on either the first (Mode B) or second (Mode A) rising edge of
        BCLK following a rising edge of LRCLK. Right-channel data immediately follows left channel data. Depending on
        word length, BCLK frequency, and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of the right
        channel data and the next sample.
        In Master Mode, the LRCLK output resembles the frame pulse shown in Fig. 4-39 and Fig. 4-40. In Slave Mode, it
        is possible to use any length of frame pulse less than 1/Fs, providing the falling edge of the frame pulse occurs at
        least one BCLK period before the rising edge of the next frame pulse.
        PCM operation is supported in DSP interface mode. CS47L90 data that is output on the left channel is read as mono
        data by the receiving equipment. Mono PCM data received by the CS47L90 is treated as left-channel data. This
        may be routed to the left/right playback paths using the control fields described in Section 4.3.

   • In Left-Justified Mode, the MSB is available on the first rising edge of BCLK following a LRCLK transition. The other
     bits up to the LSB are then transmitted in order. Depending on word length, BCLK frequency, and sample rate, there
     may be unused BCLK cycles before each LRCLK transition.

4.7.3      AIF Time-Slot Configuration
Digital audio interfaces AIF1 and AIF2 support multichannel operation, with up to eight channels of input and output in
each case. A high degree of flexibility is provided to define the position of the audio samples within each LRCLK frame;
the audio channel samples may be arranged in any order within the frame.
AIF3 and AIF4 also provide flexible configuration options, but these interfaces support only one stereo input and one
stereo output path.
Note that, on each interface, all input and output channels must operate at the same sample rate (Fs).
Each audio channel can be enabled or disabled independently on the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) signal paths. For
each enabled channel, the audio samples are assigned to one time slot within the LRCLK frame.
In DSP modes, the time slots are ordered consecutively from the start of the LRCLK frame. In I2S and left-justified modes,
the even-numbered time slots are arranged in the first half of the LRCLK frame, and the odd-numbered time slots are
arranged in the second half of the frame.
The time slots are assigned independently for the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) signal paths. There is no requirement to
assign every available time slot to an audio sample; slots may be left unused, if desired. Care is required, however, to
ensure that no time slot is allocated to more than one audio channel.
The number of BCLK cycles within a slot is configurable; this is the slot length. The number of valid data bits within a slot
is also configurable; this is the word length. The number of BCLK cycles per LRCLK frame must be configured; it must be
ensured that there are enough BCLK cycles within each LRCLK frame to transmit or receive all of the enabled audio
channels.
Examples of the AIF time-slot configurations are shown in Fig. 4-43 through Fig. 4-46. One example is shown for each of
the four possible data formats.
Fig. 4-43 shows an example of DSP Mode A format. Four enabled audio channels are shown, allocated to time slots 0
through 3.

4.7.4        TDM Operation Between Three or More Devices
The AIF operation described in Section 4.7.3 illustrates how multiple audio channels can be interleaved on a single TXDAT
or RXDAT pin. The interface uses TDM to allocate time periods to each audio channel in turn.
This form of TDM is implemented between two devices, using the electrical connections shown Fig. 4-37 or Fig. 4-38.
It is also possible to implement TDM between three or more devices. This allows one codec to receive audio data from
two other devices simultaneously on a single audio interface, as shown in Fig. 4-47, Fig. 4-48, and Fig. 4-49.
The CS47L90 provides full support for TDM operation. The TXDAT pin can be tristated when not transmitting data, in order
to allow other devices to transmit on the same wire. The behavior of the TXDAT pin is configurable, to allow maximum
flexibility to interface with other devices in this way.
Typical configurations of TDM operation between three devices are shown in Fig. 4-47, Fig. 4-48, and Fig. 4-49.

Note:    The CS47L90 is a 24-bit device. If the user operates the CS47L90 in 32-Bit Mode, the 8 LSBs are ignored on the
         receiving side and not driven on the transmitting side. It is therefore recommended to add a pull-down resistor if
         necessary to the RXDAT line and the TXDAT line in TDM mode.
4.8 Digital Audio Interface Control
This section describes the configuration of the CS47L90 digital audio interface paths.
AIF1 and AIF2 support up to eight input signal paths and up to eight output signal paths; AIF3 and AIF4 support up to two
channels of input and output signal paths. The digital audio interfaces can be configured as master or slave interfaces;
mixed master/slave configurations are also possible.
Each input and output signal path can be independently enabled or disabled. The AIF output (TX) and AIF input (RX) paths
use shared BCLK and LRCLK control signals.
The digital audio interface supports flexible data formats, selectable word length, configurable time-slot allocations, and
TDM tristate control.
The AIF1 and AIF3 interfaces provide full support for 32-bit data words (input and output). Audio data samples up to 32 bits
can be routed to the AIF1, AIF3, SLIMbus, and S/PDIF outputs. Note that other signal paths and signal-processing blocks
within the digital core are limited to 24-bit data length; data samples are truncated to 24-bit length if they are routed through
any function that does not support 32-bit data words.
The audio interfaces can be reconfigured while enabled, including changes to the LRCLK frame length and the channel
time-slot configurations. Care is required to ensure that any on-the-fly reconfiguration does not cause corruption to the
active signal paths. Wherever possible, it is recommended to disable all channels before changing the AIF configuration.
4.8.1       AIF Sample-Rate Control
The AIF RX inputs may be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within the CS47L90 digital
core. The AIF TX outputs are derived from the respective output mixers.
The sample rate for each digital audio interface AIFn is configured using the respective AIFn_RATE field—see Table 4-26.

Note that sample-rate conversion is required when routing the AIF paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or
configured for a different sample rate.

The external connections associated with each digital audio interface (AIF) are implemented on multifunction GPIO pins,
which must be configured for the respective AIF functions when required. The AIF connections are pin-specific alternative
functions available on specific GPIO pins. See Section 4.15 to configure the GPIO pins for AIF operation.
Integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors can be enabled on the AIFnLRCLK, AIFnBCLK and AIFnRXDAT pins. This is
provided as part of the GPIO functionality, and provides a flexible capability for interfacing with other devices. Each pull-up
and pull-down resistor can be configured independently using the fields described in Table 4-99.
If the pull-up and pull-down resistors are both enabled, the CS47L90 provides a bus keeper function on the respective pin.
The bus-keeper function holds the logic level unchanged whenever the pin is undriven (e.g., if the signal is tristated).
4.8.3       AIF Master/Slave Control
The digital audio interfaces can operate in master or slave modes and also in mixed master/slave configurations. In Master
Mode, the BCLK and LRCLK signals are generated by the CS47L90 when any of the respective digital audio interface
channels is enabled. In Slave Mode, these outputs are disabled by default to allow another device to drive these pins.
Master Mode is selected on the AIFnBCLK pin by setting AIFn_BCLK_MSTR. In Master Mode, the AIFnBCLK signal is
generated by the CS47L90 when one or more AIFn channels is enabled.
If the AIFn_BCLK_FRC bit is set in BCLK Master Mode, the AIFnBCLK signal is output at all times, including when none
of the AIFn channels is enabled.
The AIFnBCLK signal can be inverted in master or slave modes using the AIFn_BCLK_INV bit.
Master Mode is selected on the AIFnLRCLK pin by setting AIFn_LRCLK_MSTR. In Master Mode, the AIFnLRCLK signal
is generated by the CS47L90 when one or more AIFn channels is enabled.
If AIFn_LRCLK_FRC is set in LRCLK Master Mode, the AIFnLRCLK signal is output at all times, including when none of
the AIFn channels is enabled. Note that AIFnLRCLK is derived from AIFnBCLK, and an internal or external AIFnBCLK
signal must be present to generate AIFnLRCLK.
The AIFnLRCLK signal can be inverted in master or slave modes using the AIFn_LRCLK_INV bit.
The timing of the AIFnLRCLK signal is selectable using AIFn_LRCLK_ADV. If this bit is set, the LRCLK signal transition
is advanced to the previous BCLK phase (as compared with the default behavior). Further details of this option, and
conditions for valid use cases, are described in Section 4.8.3.1.

4.8.3.1 LRCLK Advance
The timing of the AIFnLRCLK signal can be adjusted using AIFn_LRCLK_ADV. If this bit is set, the LRCLK signal transition
is advanced to the previous BCLK phase (as compared with the default behavior).
The LRCLK-advance option (AIFn_LRCLK_ADV = 1) is valid for DSP-A mode only, operating in Master Mode.
Note:    BCLK inversion must be enabled (AIFn_BCLK_INV = 1) if the LRCLK-advance option is enabled.
The adjusted interface timing (AIFn_LRCLK_ADV = 1), is shown in Fig. 4-50. The left-channel MSB is available on the
second rising edge of BCLK, 1.5 BCLK cycles after the LRCLK rising edge—assuming the BCLK output is inverted.

4.8.4      AIF Signal Path Enable
The AIF1 and AIF2 interfaces support up to eight input (RX) channels and up to eight output (TX) channels. Each channel
is enabled or disabled using the bits defined in Table 4-46 and Table 4-47.
The AIF3 and AIF4 interfaces support up to two input (RX) channels and up to two output (TX) channels. Each channel is
enabled or disabled using the bits defined in Table 4-48 and Table 4-49.
The system clock, SYSCLK, must be configured and enabled before any audio path is enabled. The ASYNCCLK may also
be required, depending on the path configuration. See Section 4.17 for details of the system clocks.
The audio interfaces can be reconfigured if enabled, including changes to the LRCLK frame length and the channel
time-slot configurations. Care is required to ensure that this on-the-fly reconfiguration does not cause corruption to the
active signal paths. Wherever possible, it is recommended to disable all channels before changing the AIF configuration.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK frequencies are high enough to
support the commanded signal paths and processing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an AIF
signal path fails. Note that active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The AIF1 signal-path-enable bits are described in Table 4-46.

4.8.5       AIF BCLK and LRCLK Control
The AIFnBCLK frequency is selected using the AIFn_BCLK_FREQ field. For each setting of this field, the actual frequency
depends on whether AIFn is configured for a 48-kHz-related sample rate, as described in Table 4-50 through Table 4-53.
    •   If AIFn_RATE < 1000 (Table 4-26), AIFn is referenced to the SYSCLK clocking domain and the applicable
        frequency depends upon the SAMPLE_RATE_1, SAMPLE_RATE_2 or SAMPLE_RATE_3 fields.
    •   If AIFn_RATE  1000, AIFn is referenced to the ASYNCCLK clocking domain and the applicable frequency
        depends upon the ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_1 or ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_2 fields.
The selected AIFnBCLK rate must be less than or equal to SYSCLK/2, or ASYNCCLK/2, as applicable. See Section 4.17
for details of SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK clock domains, and the associated control registers.
The AIFnLRCLK frequency is controlled relative to AIFnBCLK by the AIFn_BCPF divider.
Note that the BCLK rate must be configured in master or slave modes, using the AIFn_BCLK_FREQ fields. The LRCLK
rates only require to be configured in Master Mode.
The AIF1 BCLK/LRCLK control fields are described in Table 4-50.

4.8.6        AIF Digital Audio Data Control
The fields controlling the audio data format, word length, and slot configurations for AIF1–AIF4 are described in Table 4-54
through Table 4-57 respectively.
Note that left-justified and DSP-B modes are valid in Master Mode only (i.e., BCLK and LRCLK are outputs from the
CS47L90).
The AIFn slot length is the number of BCLK cycles in one time slot within the overall LRCLK frame. The word length is the
number of valid data bits within each time slot. If the word length is less than the slot length, there are unused BCLK cycles
at the end of each time slot. The AIFn word length and slot length are independently selectable for the input (RX) and
output (TX) paths.
For each AIF input (RX) and AIF output (TX) channel, the position of the audio data sample within the LRCLK frame is
configurable. The x_SLOT fields define the time-slot position of the audio sample for the associated audio channel. Valid
selections are Slot 0 upwards. The time slots are numbered as shown in Fig. 4-43 through Fig. 4-46.
Note that, in DSP modes, the time slots are ordered consecutively from the start of the LRCLK frame. In I2S and
left-justified modes, the even-numbered time slots are arranged in the first half of the LRCLK frame, and the odd-numbered
time slots are arranged in the second half of the frame.
The AIF1 data control fields are described in Table 4-54.

4.8.7      AIF TDM and Tristate Control
The AIFn output pins are tristated when the AIFn_TRI bit is set. Note that this function only affects output pins configured
for the respective AIFn function—a GPIO pin that is configured for a different function is not affected by AIFn_TRI. See
Section 4.15 to configure the GPIO pins.
Under default conditions, the AIFnTXDAT output is held at Logic 0 when the CS47L90 is not transmitting data (i.e., during
time slots that are not enabled for output by the CS47L90). If the AIFnTX_DAT_TRI bit is set, the CS47L90 tristates the
respective AIFnTXDAT pin when not transmitting data, allowing other devices to drive the AIFnTXDAT connection.
The AIF1 TDM and tristate control fields are described in Table 4-58.

4.9 SLIMbus Interface
The SLIMbus protocol is highly configurable and adaptable, supporting multiple audio signal paths, and mixed sample
rates simultaneously. It also supports control messaging and associated communications between devices.
4.9.1      SLIMbus Devices
The SLIMbus components comprise different device classes (manager, framer, interface, generic). Each component on
the bus has an interface device, which provides bus management services for the respective component. One or more
components on the bus provide manager and framer device functions; the manager has the capabilities to administer the
bus, although the framer is responsible for driving the CLK line and for driving the DATA required to establish the frame
structure on the bus. Note that only one manager and one framer device is active at any time. The framer function can be
transferred between devices when required. Generic devices provide the basic SLIMbus functionality for the associated
ports, and for the transport protocol by which audio signal paths are established on the bus.
4.9.2      SLIMbus Frame Structure
The SLIMbus bit stream is formatted within a defined structure of cells, slots, subframes, frames, and superframes:
    •  A single data bit is known as a cell.
    •  Four cells make a slot.
    •  A frame consists of 192 slots.
    •  Eight frames make a superframe.
The bit stream structure is configurable to some extent, but the superframe definition always comprises 1536 slots. The
transmitted/received bit rate can be configured according to system requirements and can be changed dynamically without
interruption to active audio paths.
The SLIMbus CLK frequency (also the bus bit rate) is defined by a root frequency (RF) and a clock gear (CG). In the top
clock gear (Gear 10), the CLK frequency is equal to the root frequency. Each reduction in the clock gear halves the CLK
frequency, and doubles the duration of the superframe.
The SLIMbus bandwidth typically comprises control space (for bus messages, synchronization, etc.) and data space (for
audio paths). The precise allocation is configurable and can be entirely control space, if required.

                                                                                                               CS47L90
                                                                                                     4.9 SLIMbus Interface
The subframe definition comprises the number of slots per subframe (6, 8, 24 or 32) and the number of these slots per
subframe allocated as control space. The applicable combination of subframe length and control space width are defined
by the Subframe Mode (SM) parameter.
The SLIMbus frame always comprises 192 slots, regardless of the subframe definition. A number of slots are allocated to
control space, as noted above; the remaining slots are allocated to data space. Some of the control space is required for
framing information and for the guide channel (see Section 4.9.3); the remainder of the control space are allocated to the
message channel.
Multiline SLIMbus comprises one or more secondary data line, supporting additional bandwidth and flexibility for data
transfer over the bus. All data lines are synchronized to the bus clock; the RF and CG parameters are common to all data
lines. Note that control space is allocated on the primary data line only—secondary lines are used exclusively for data
space. Accordingly, the SM parameter is defined for the primary line only.
4.9.3      Control Space
Framing information is provided in slots 0 and 96 of every frame. Slot 0 contains a 4-bit synchronization code; slot 96
contains the 32-bit framing information, transmitted 4 bits at a time over the eight frames that make up the SLIMbus
superframe. The clock gear, root frequency, subframe configuration, along with some other parameters, are encoded
within the framing information.
The guide channel occupies two slots within Frame 0. This provides the necessary information for a SLIMbus component
to acquire and verify the frame synchronization. The guide channel occupies the first two control space slots within the first
frame of the bit stream, excluding the framing information slots. Note that the exact slot allocation depends upon the
applicable subframe mode.
The message channel is allocated all of the control space not used by the framing information or the guide channel. The
message channel enables SLIMbus devices to communicate with each other, using a priority-based mechanism defined
in the MIPI specification.
Messages may be broadcast to all devices on the bus, or can be addressed to specific devices using their allocated logical
address (LA) or enumeration address (EA). Note that, device-specific messages are directed to a particular device (i.e.,
manager, framer, interface, or generic) within a component on the bus.
4.9.4      Data Space
The data space can be organized into a maximum of 256 data channels. Each channel, identified by a unique channel
number (CN), is a stream of one or more contiguous slots, organized in a consistent data structure that repeats at a fixed
interval.
A data channel is defined by its segment length (SL), (number of contiguous slots allocated), segment interval (spacing
between the first slots of successive segments), and segment offset (the slot number of the first allocated slot within the
superframe). The segment interval and segment offset are collectively defined by a segment distribution (SD), by which
the SLIMbus manager may configure or reconfigure any data channel.
Each segment may comprise TAG, AUX, and DATA portions. Any of these portions may have a length of zero; the exact
composition depends on the transport protocol (TP) for the associated channel. The DATA portion must be wide enough
to accommodate one full word of the data channel contents. Data words cannot be spread across multiple segments.
The segment interval for each data channel represents the minimum spacing between consecutive data samples for that
channel. (Note that the minimum spacing applies if every allocated segment is populated with new data; in many cases,
additional bandwidth is allocated and not every allocated segment is used.)
The segment interval gives rise to segment windows for each data channel, aligned to the start of every superframe. The
segment window boundaries define the times within which each new data sample must be buffered, ready for
transmission—adherence to these fixed boundaries allows slot allocations to be moved within a segment window, without
altering the signal latency. The segment interval may be either shorter or longer than the frame length, but there is always
an integer number of segment windows per superframe.

                                                                                                                CS47L90
                                                                                          4.10 SLIMbus Control Sequences
The TP defines the flow control or handshaking method used by the ports associated with a data channel. The applicable
flow control modes depend on the relationship between the audio sample rate (flow rate) and the SLIMbus CLK frequency.
If the two rates are synchronized and integer related, no flow control is needed. In other cases, the flow may be regulated
by the use of a presence bit, which can be set by the source device (pushed protocol) or by the sink device (pulled
protocol).
The data-channel structure is defined in terms of the TP, SD, SL, and data line (LN) parameters. For multiline operation,
the LN value identifies the data line on which the channel is present. Note that the mapping of secondary data lines (1–7)
with respect to the secondary data pins is configurable on each multiline SLIMbus component, using value elements
associated with the respective interface device. See Section 4.10.3 for details of value elements.
The data-channel content definition includes a presence rate (PR) parameter (describing the nominal sample rate for the
audio channel) and a frequency locked (FL) bit (identifying whether the data source is synchronized to the SLIMbus CLK).
The data length (DL) parameter defines the size of each data sample (number of slots). The auxiliary bits format (AF) and
data type (DT) parameters provide support for non-PCM encoded data channels; the channel link (CL) parameter is an
indicator that channel CN is related to the previous channel, CN-1.
For a given root frequency and clock gear, the SL and SD parameters define the amount of SLIMbus bandwidth that is
allocated to a given data channel. The minimum bandwidth requirements of a data channel are represented by the
presence rate (PR) and data length (DL) parameters. The allocated SLIMbus bandwidth must be equal to or greater than
the bandwidth of the data to be transferred.
The segment interval defines the repetition rate of the SLIMbus slots allocated to consecutive data samples for a given
data channel. The presence rate (PR) is the nominal sample rate of the audio path. The segment rate (determined by the
segment interval value) must be equal to or greater than the presence rate for a given data channel. The following
constraints must be observed when configuring a SLIMbus channel:
     •  If pushed or pulled transport protocol is selected, the segment rate must be greater than the presence rate to ensure
        that samples are not dropped as a result of clock drift.
     •  If isochronous transport protocol is selected, the segment rate must be equal to the presence rate. Isochronous
        transport protocol should be selected only if the data source is frequency locked to the SLIMbus CLK (i.e., the data
        source is synchronized to the SLIMbus framer device).
4.10 SLIMbus Control Sequences
This section describes the messages and general protocol associated with the SLIMbus system.
Note:      The SLIMbus specification permits flexibility in core message support for different components. See Section 4.11
           for details regarding which messages are supported on each of the SLIMbus devices present on the CS47L90.
4.10.1 Device Management and Configuration
This section describes the SLIMbus messages associated with configuring all devices on the SLIMbus interface.
When the SLIMbus interface starts up, it is required that only one component provides the manager and framer device
functions. Other devices can request connection to the bus after they have gained synchronization.
The REPORT_PRESENT (DC, DCV) message may be issued by devices attempting to connect to the bus. The payload
of this message contains the device class (DC) and device class version (DCV) parameters, describing the type of device
that is attempting to connect. This message may be issued autonomously by the connecting device, or else in response
to a REQUEST_SELF_ANNOUNCEMENT message from the manager device.
After positively acknowledging the REPORT_PRESENT message, the manager device then issues the ASSIGN_
LOGICAL_ADDRESS (LA) message to allow the other device to connect to the bus. The payload of this message contains
the logical address (LA) parameter only; this is the unique address by which the connected device sends and receives
SLIMbus messages. The device is then said to be enumerated.
Once a device has been successfully connected to the bus, the logical address (LA) parameter can be changed at any
time using the CHANGE_LOGICAL_ADDRESS (LA) message.

The RESET_DEVICE message commands an individual SLIMbus device to perform its reset procedure. As part of the
reset, all associated ports are reset, and any associated data channels are canceled. Note that, if the RESET_DEVICE
command is issued to an interface device, it causes a component reset (i.e., all devices within the associated component
are reset). Under a component reset, every associated device releases its logical address, and the component becomes
disconnected from the bus.
4.10.2 Information Management
A memory map of information elements is defined for each device. This is arranged in 3 x 1-kB blocks, comprising core
value elements, device class-specific value elements, and user value elements respectively, as described in the MIPI
specification. Note that the contents of the user information portion for each CS47L90 SLIMbus device are reserved.
Read/write access is implemented using the messages described as follows. Specific elements within the information map
are identified using the element code (EC) parameter. In the case of read access, a unique transaction ID (TID) is assigned
to each message relating to a particular read/write request.
    •   The REQUEST_INFORMATION (TID, EC) message is used to instruct a device to respond with the indicated
        information. The payload of this message contains the transaction ID (TID) and the element code (EC).
    •   The REQUEST_CLEAR_INFORMATION (TID, EC, CM) message is used to instruct a device to respond with the
        indicated information, and also to clear all, or parts, of the same information slice. The payload of this message
        contains the transaction ID (TID), element code (EC), and clear mask (CM). The clear mask field is used to select
        which elements are to be cleared as part of the instruction.
    •   The REPLY_INFORMATION (TID, IS) message is used to provide output of a requested parameter. The payload
        of this message contains the transaction ID (TID) and the information slice (IS). The information slice bytes contain
        the value of the requested parameter.
    •   The CLEAR_INFORMATION (EC, CM) message is used to clear all, or parts, of the indicated information slice. The
        payload of this message contains the element code (EC) and clear mask (CM). The clear mask field is used to select
        which elements are to be cleared as part of the instruction.
    •   The REPORT_INFORMATION (EC, IS) message is used to inform other devices about a change in a specified
        element in the information map. The payload of this message contains the element code (EC) and the information
        slice (IS). The information slice bytes contain the new value of the applicable parameter.
4.10.3 Value Management (Including Register Access)
A memory map of value elements is defined for each device. This is arranged in 3 x 1-kB blocks, comprising core value
elements, device class-specific value elements, and user value elements respectively, as described in the MIPI
specification. These elements are typically parameters used to configure device behavior.
The user value elements of the interface device are used on CS47L90 to support read/write access to the register map.
Details of how to access specific registers are described in Section 4.11. Note that, with the exception of the user value
elements of the interface device, the contents of the user value portion for each CS47L90 SLIMbus device are reserved.
Read/write access is implemented using the messages described as follows. Specific elements within the value map are
identified using the element code (EC) parameter. In the case of read access, a unique transaction ID (TID) is assigned
to each message relating to a particular read/write request.
    •   The REQUEST_VALUE (TID, EC) message is used to instruct a device to respond with the indicated information.
        The payload of this message contains the transaction ID (TID) and the element code (EC).
    •   The REPLY_VALUE (TID, VS) message is used to provide output of a requested parameter. The payload of this
        message contains the transaction ID (TID) and the value slice (VS). The value slice bytes contain the value of the
        requested parameter.
    •   The CHANGE_VALUE (EC, VU) message is used to write data to a specified element in the value map. The payload
        of this message contains the element code (EC) and the value update (VU). The value update bytes contain the
        new value of the applicable parameter.

4.10.4 Frame and Clocking Management
This section describes the SLIMbus messages associated with changing the frame or clocking configuration. One or more
configuration messages may be issued as part of a reconfiguration sequence; all of the updated parameters become
active at once, when the reconfiguration boundary is reached.
   •   The BEGIN_RECONFIGURATION message is issued to define a reconfiguration boundary point: subsequent
       NEXT_* messages become active at the first valid superframe boundary following receipt of the RECONFIGURE_
       NOW message. (A valid boundary must be at least two slots after the end of the RECONFIGURE_NOW message.)
       Both of these messages have no payload content.
   •   The NEXT_ACTIVE_FRAMER (LAIF, NCo, NCi) message is used to select a new device as the active framer. The
       payload of this message includes the logical address, incoming framer (LAIF). Two other fields (NCo, NCi) define
       the number of clock cycles for which the CLK line shall be inactive during the handover.
   •   The NEXT_SUBFRAME_MODE (SM) and NEXT_CLOCK_GEAR (CG) messages are used to reconfigure the
       SLIMbus clocking or framing definition. The payload of each is the respective subframe mode (SM) or clock gear
       (CG) respectively.
   •   The NEXT_PAUSE_CLOCK (RT) message instructs the active framer to pause the bus. The payload of the
       message contains the restart time (RT), which indicates whether the interruption is to be of a specified time and/or
       phase duration.
   •   The NEXT_RESET_BUS message instructs all components on the bus to be reset. In this case, all devices on the
       bus are reset and are disconnected from the bus. Subsequent reconnection to the bus follows the same process as
       when the bus is first initialized.
   •   The NEXT_SHUTDOWN_BUS message instructs all devices that the bus is to be shut down.
4.10.5 Data Channel Configuration
This section describes the SLIMbus messages associated with configuring a SLIMbus data channel. Note that the
manager device is responsible for allocating the available bandwidth as required for each data channel.
   •   The CONNECT_SOURCE (PN, CN) and CONNECT_SINK (PN, CN) messages are issued to the respective
       devices, defining the ports between which a data channel is to be established. Note that multiple destinations (sinks)
       can be configured for a channel, if required. The payload of each message contains the port number (PN) and the
       channel number (CN) parameters.
   •   The BEGIN_RECONFIGURATION message is issued to define a Reconfiguration Boundary point: subsequent
       NEXT_* messages become active at the first valid superframe boundary following receipt of the RECONFIGURE_
       NOW message. A valid boundary must be at least two slots after the end of the RECONFIGURE_NOW message.
   •   The NEXT_DEFINE_CHANNEL (CN, TP, SD, SL, LN) message informs the associated devices of the structure of
       the data channel. The payload of this message contains the channel number (CN), TP, SD, SL, and LN parameters
       for the data channel.
   •   The NEXT_DEFINE_CONTENT (CN, FL, PR, AF, DT, CL, DL), or CHANGE_CONTENT (CN, FL, PR, AF, DT, CL,
       DL) message provides more detailed information about the data channel contents. The payload of this message
       contains the channel number (CN), frequency locked (FL), presence rate (PR), auxiliary bits format (AF), data type
       (DT), channel link (CL), and data length (DL) parameters.
   •   The NEXT_ACTIVATE_CHANNEL (CN) message instructs the channel to be activated at the next reconfiguration
       boundary. The payload of this message contains the channel number (CN) only.
   •   The RECONFIGURE_NOW message completes the reconfiguration sequence, causing all of the NEXT_
       messages since the BEGIN_RECONFIGURATION to become active at the next valid superframe boundary. (A
       valid boundary must be at least two slots after the end of the RECONFIGURE_NOW message.)
   •   Active channels can be reconfigured using the CHANGE_CONTENT, NEXT_DEFINE_CONTENT, or NEXT_
       DEFINE_CHANNEL messages. Note that these changes can be effected without interrupting the data channel; the
       NEXT_DEFINE_CHANNEL, for example, may be used to change a segment distribution, in order to reallocate the
       SLIMbus bandwidth.
   •   An active channel can be paused using the NEXT_DEACTIVATE_CHANNEL message and reinstated using the
       NEXT_ACTIVATE_CHANNEL message.

    •  Data channels can be disconnected using the DISCONNECT_PORT or NEXT_REMOVE_CHANNEL messages.
       These messages provide equivalent functionality, but use different parameters (PN or CN respectively) to identify
       the affected signal path.
4.11 SLIMbus Interface Control
The CS47L90 features a MIPI-compliant SLIMbus interface. It supports multichannel audio input/output, control register
read/write access, and bulk data channels suitable for DSP firmware operations.
The SLIMbus interface on CS47L90 comprises a generic device, framer device, interface device, and 22 data ports,
providing up to 11 input (RX) channels and up to 11 output (TX) channels. Multiline capability is supported, offering
additional bandwidth and system-level flexibility.
The interface supports up to eight audio input channels and up to eight audio output channels. Mixed sample rates can be
supported simultaneously. The audio signal paths associated with the SLIMbus interface are described in Section 4.3.
The CS47L90 also supports up to three input and three output channels suitable for high-speed bulk data transfers. Note
that the secondary data lines are ideal for bulk data transfers, as they offer the highest bandwidth capability.
The SLIMbus interface also supports read/write access to the CS47L90 control registers via the value map of the interface
device, as described in Section 4.11.6.
The SLIMbus clocking rate and channel allocations are controlled by the manager device. The message channel and data
channel bandwidth may be dynamically adjusted according to the application requirements. Note that the manager device
functions are not implemented on the CS47L90, and these bandwidth allocation requirements are outside the scope of
this data sheet.
The SLIMbus interface provides full support for 32-bit data words (input and output). Audio data samples up to 32 bits can
be routed to the AIF1, AIF3, SLIMbus, and S/PDIF outputs. Note that other signal paths and signal-processing blocks
within the digital core are limited to 24-bit data length; data samples are truncated to 24-bit length if they are routed through
any function that does not support 32-bit data words.
4.11.1 SLIMbus Device Parameters
The SLIMbus interface on the CS47L90 comprises three devices. The enumeration address of each device within the
SLIMbus interface is derived from the parameters noted in Table 4-62.

4.11.3 SLIMbus Clocking Control
The clock frequency of the SLIMbus interface is not fixed, and may be set according to the application requirements. The
clock frequency can be reconfigured dynamically as required.
The CS47L90 SLIMbus interface includes a framer device. When configured as the active framer, the SLIMbus clock
(SLIMCLK) is an output from the CS47L90. At other times, SLIMCLK is an input. The framer function can be transferred
from one device to another; this is known as framer handover, and is controlled by the manager device.
The supported root frequencies in active framer mode are 24.576 or 22.5792 MHz only. At other times, the supported root
frequencies are as defined in the MIPI Alliance specification for SLIMbus.
Under normal operating conditions, the SLIMbus interface operates with a fixed root frequency (RF); dynamic updates to
the bus rate are applied using a selectable clock gear (CG) function. The root frequency and the clock gear setting are
controlled by the manager device; these parameters are transmitted in every SLIMbus superframe to all devices on the
bus.

In Gear 10 (the highest clock gear setting), the SLIMCLK input (or output) frequency is equal to the root frequency. In lower
gears, the SLIMCLK frequency is reduced by increasing powers of 2.
The clock gear definition is shown in Table 4-65.
Note:    The 24.576MHz root frequency is an example only; other frequencies are also supported.

                      1.Assuming 24.576-MHz root frequency
When the CS47L90 is the active framer, the SLIMCLK output is synchronized to the SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK system clock,
as selected by the SLIMCLK_SRC bit.
The applicable system clock must be enabled and configured at the SLIMbus root frequency, whenever the CS47L90 is
the active framer. See Section 4.17 for details of the SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK system clocks.
When the CS47L90 is not configured as the active framer device, the SLIMCLK input can be used to provide a reference
source for the FLLs. The frequency of this reference is controlled using SLIMCLK_REF_GEAR, as described in
Table 4-66.
The SLIMbus clock reference is generated using an adaptive divider on the SLIMCLK input. The divider automatically
adapts to the SLIMbus clock gear (CG).
Note that, if the clock gear on the bus is lower than the SLIMCLK_REF_GEAR, the selected reference frequency cannot
be supported, and the SLIMbus clock reference is disabled.
The SLIMbus clock reference is selected as input to the FLLs by using FLLn_REFCLK_SRC. See Section 4.17 for details
of system clocking and the FLLs.

4.11.4.2 Sample-Rate Control
The SLIMbus audio inputs may be selected as input to the digital mixers or signal-processing functions within the CS47L90
digital core. The SLIMbus audio outputs are derived from the respective output mixers.
The sample rate for each SLIMbus channel is configured using SLIMRXn_RATE and SLIMTXn_RATE—see Table 4-26.
Note that the SLIMbus interface provides simultaneous support for SYSCLK-referenced and ASYNCCLK-referenced
sample rates on different channels. For example, 48-kHz and 44.1-kHz SLIMbus audio paths can be simultaneously
supported.
Sample-rate conversion is required when routing the SLIMbus paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous or configured
for a different sample rate.
4.11.4.3 Signal Path Enable
The SLIMbus interface supports up to eight audio input (RX) channels and up to eight audio output (TX) channels. Each
channel can be enabled or disabled using the fields defined in Table 4-68.
Note:     SLIMbus audio channels can be supported only when the corresponding ports have been enabled by the manager
          device (i.e., in addition to setting the respective enable bits). The status bits in Registers R1527 and R1528
          indicate the status of each SLIMbus port.
The system clock, SYSCLK, must be configured and enabled before any audio path is enabled. The ASYNCCLK may also
be required, depending on the path configuration. See Section 4.17 for details of the system clocks.

4.11.5.2 Data Transfer Configuration
Bulk data transfers over the SLIMbus interface are configured by defining the start address location within the register
map; this is the address of the first data word in the transfer. The address location automatically increments for each data
word transmitted or received. The start address for each bulk data channel is configured using the fields described in
Table 4-70.
Note that a SLIMbus channel must also be configured and activated, with the required bandwidth for the intended transfer.
The secondary data lines are ideal for bulk data transfers, as they offer the highest bandwidth capability.
Note:    The start address value in the SLIMbus bulk data transfer x_ADDR fields is coded in byte units—different to the
         register address definitions throughout this data sheet. The required value of the x_ADDR fields is calculated by
         multiplying the respective register address by two. For example, to write to the DSP2 program memory, at start
         address 0x10_0000, the SLIMRXn_START_ADDR field is set to 0x20_0000.
The address autoincrement step size is fixed at 4 bytes, corresponding to successive addresses within the 32-bit register
space (from 0x3000 upwards). Accordingly, the SLIMbus bulk data transfer mode is only suitable for memory read/write
operations at address 0x3000 and above.
Data transfers using the bulk transfer mode must be configured with data length of 24- or 32-bits only.
The bulk data input channels use pushed transport protocol only. The output channels use pulled transport protocol only.
In each case, therefore, the bulk data transfer to/from the CS47L90 is controlled by the host device (typically, the
applications processor). The bulk data transfer completes when the host device ceases to push/pull data over the
respective channel.
The SLIMbus channel must be deactivated (using the NEXT_DEACTIVATE_CHANNEL message) after the bulk data
transfer has completed, before any subsequent bulk transfer is scheduled on that channel.
The address of the most recent data word transferred can be read from the SLIMTXn_ADDR and SLIMRXn_ADDR fields
(where n is 9, 10, or 11 for the respective bulk data channel). This can be used to indicate the progress of an ongoing data
transfer, or confirmation of completion.

4.11.6 SLIMbus Control Register Access
The SLIMbus interface supports read/write access to the CS47L90 control registers via the value map of the interface
device. Full read/write access to all registers is possible, via the user value elements portion of the value map.
Note that if multibyte transfers of more than 8 bytes are scheduled (see Section 4.11.6.3), system clocking constraints
must be observed to ensure control interface limits are not exceeded. Full details of the applicable clocking requirements
are provided in Section 4.17.7.
4.11.6.1 Control Register Write
Register write operations are implemented using the CHANGE_VALUE message. A maximum of two messages may be
required, depending on circumstances: the first CHANGE_VALUE message selects the register page (bits [23:8] of the
control register address); the second message contains the data and bits [7:0] of the register address. The first message
may be omitted if the register page is unchanged from the previous read or write operation.
The required SLIMbus parameters are described in Table 4-71 and Table 4-72, for the generic case of writing the value
0xVVVV to control register address 0xYYYYZZ. Note that it is also possible to write blocks of up to 16 bytes (to consecutive
register addresses), as described in Section 4.11.6.3.

 Destination Address   0xLL              LL is the 8-bit logical address of the message destination (i.e., the CS47L90 SLIMbus interface
                                         device). The value is assigned by the SLIMbus manager device.
 Access Mode           0b1               Selects byte-based access mode.
 Byte Address          0x800             Identifies the user value element for selecting the control register page address.
 Slice Size            0b001             Selects 2-byte slice size
 Value Update          0xYYYY            YYYY is bits [23:8] of the applicable control register address.

 Value Update           0xVVVV            VVVV is the 16-bit data to be written.
Note:     The first message may be omitted if its contents are unchanged from the previous CHANGE_VALUE message
          sent to the CS47L90.
4.11.6.2 Control Register Read
Register read operations are implemented using the CHANGE_VALUE and REQUEST_VALUE messages. A maximum
of two messages may be required, depending on circumstances: the CHANGE_VALUE message selects the register page
(bits [23:8] of the control register address); the REQUEST_VALUE message contains bits [7:0] of the register address.
The first message may be omitted if the register page is unchanged from the previous read or write operation.
The required SLIMbus parameters are described in Table 4-73 and Table 4-74, for the generic case of reading the
contents of control register address 0xYYYYZZ. Note that it is also possible to read blocks of up to 8 bytes (to consecutive
register addresses), as described in Section 4.11.6.3.

       Parameter       Value                                                     Description
 Source Address       0xSS     SS is the 8-bit logical address of the message source. This could be any active device on the bus, but is
                               typically the manager device (0xFF).
 Destination Address 0xLL      LL is the 8-bit logical address of the message destination (i.e., the CS47L90 SLIMbus interface device). The
                               value is assigned by the SLIMbus manager device.

 Source Address       0xSS    SS is the 8-bit logical address of the message source. This could be any active device on the bus, but is typically
                              the manager device (0xFF).
 Destination Address 0xLL     LL is the 8-bit logical address of the message destination (i.e., the CS47L90 SLIMbus interface device). The
                              value is assigned by the SLIMbus manager device.
 Access Mode          0b1     Selects byte-based access mode.
 Byte Address         0xUUU Specifies the value map address, calculated as
                              0xA00 + (2 x 0xZZ), where ZZ is bits [7:0] of the applicable control register address.
 Slice Size           0b001 Selects 2-byte slice size
 Transaction ID       0xTTTT TTTT is the 16-bit transaction ID for the message. The value is assigned by the SLIMbus manager device.
Note:     The first message may be omitted if its contents are unchanged from the previous CHANGE_VALUE message
          sent to the CS47L90.
The CS47L90 responds to the register read commands in accordance with the normal SLIMbus protocols.
Note that the CS47L90 assumes that sufficient control space slots are available in which to provide its response before
the next REQUEST_VALUE message is received. The CS47L90 response is made using a REPLY_VALUE message; the
SLIMbus manager should wait until the REPLY_VALUE message has been received before sending the next REQUEST_
VALUE message. If additional REQUEST_VALUE messages are received before the CS47L90 response has been made,
the earlier REQUEST_VALUE messages are ignored (i.e., only the last REQUEST_VALUE message is serviced).
4.11.6.3 Multibyte Control Register Access
Register data transfers of up to 16 bytes can be configured using the slice size parameter in the second message of the
applicable protocol (see Table 4-72 or Table 4-74). Additional value update words are appended to respective data
message in this case, with the applicable data contents.
     •   Multibyte register write access is supported with slice size of 2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 bytes.
     •   Multibyte register read access is supported with slice size of 2, 4, or 8 bytes.
Note that if multibyte transfers of more than 8 bytes are scheduled, system clocking constraints must be observed to
ensure control interface limits are not exceeded. See Section 4.17.7.
When a 2-byte transfer is selected, the register address 0xYYYYZZ is used (using the same naming conventions as
above). When more than 2 bytes are transferred, the register address is automatically incremented as described in
Table 4-75.

Note:      Register addresses from R12288 (0x3000) upwards are formatted as 32-bit words. When accessing these
           addresses, the slice size should be a multiple of 4 bytes and the byte address should be aligned with the 32-bit
           data word boundaries (i.e., an even number). The byte ordering for these register addresses is described in
           Table 4-76.

4.12 Output Signal Path
The CS47L90 provides four stereo pairs of audio output signal paths. These outputs comprise ground-referenced
headphone drivers, and a digital output interface suitable for external speaker drivers. The output signal paths are
summarized in Table 4-77.
                                             Table 4-77. Output Signal Path Summary

                   OUT3L, OUT3R     Ground-referenced headphone/earpiece output          HPOUT3L, HPOUT3R
                   OUT5L, OUT5R     Digital speaker (PDM) output                         SPKDAT, SPKCLK
The analog output paths incorporate high performance 24-bit sigma-delta DACs.
Under default conditions, the headphone drivers provide a stereo, single-ended output. A mono mode is also available on
each headphone output pair, providing a differential (BTL) configuration. The ground-referenced headphone output paths
incorporate a common mode feedback path for rejection of system-related noise. These outputs support direct connection
to headphone loads, with no requirement for AC coupling capacitors.
The digital output path provides a stereo pulse-density modulation (PDM) output interface, for connection to external audio
devices. A total of two digital output channels are provided.
Digital filters can be enabled in the output signal paths, supporting audiophile-quality DAC playback options. These hi-fi
filters allow user selection of the preferred characteristics, (e.g., linear phase, antialiasing, or apodizing filter responses).
Digital volume control is available on all outputs (analog and digital), with programmable ramp control for smooth,
glitch-free operation. A configurable noise-gate function is available on each output signal path. Any two of the output
signal paths may be selected as input to the AEC loop-back paths.
The CS47L90 provides short-circuit detection on the headphone output paths.
The CS47L90 output signal paths are shown in Fig. 4-51.
The OUT4 path is not implemented on this device.

4.12.1 Output Signal Path Enable
The output signal paths are enabled using the bits described in Table 4-78. The respective bits must be enabled for analog
or digital output on the respective output paths.
The output signal paths are muted by default. It is recommended that deselecting the mute should be the final step of the
path enable control sequence. Similarly, the mute should be selected as the first step of the path disable control sequence.
The output signal path mute functions are controlled using the bits described in Table 4-78.
The supply rails for the analog outputs (OUT1, OUT2, and OUT3) are generated using an integrated dual-mode charge
pump, CP1. The charge pump is enabled automatically by the CS47L90 when required by the output drivers; see
Section 4.20.
The CS47L90 schedules a pop-suppressed control sequence to enable or disable the OUT1, OUT2, and OUT3 signal
paths. This is automatically managed by the control-write sequencer in response to setting the respective HPnx_ENA bits;
see Section 4.19 for further details.
The output signal path enable/disable control sequences are inputs to the interrupt circuit and can be used to trigger an
interrupt event when a sequence completes; see Section 4.16.
The system clock, SYSCLK, must be configured and enabled before any audio path is enabled. The ASYNCCLK may also
be required, depending on the path configuration. See Section 4.17 for details of the system clocks.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the output
signal paths and associated DACs. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable an output signal path fails. Note that
active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The status bits in Register R1025 and R1030 indicate the status of each output signal path. If an underclocked error
condition occurs, these bits indicate which signal paths have been enabled.

4.12.2 Output Signal Path Sample-Rate Control
The output signal paths are derived from the respective output mixers within the CS47L90 digital core. The sample rate
for the output signal paths is configured using OUT_RATE—see Table 4-26.
Note that sample-rate conversion is required when routing the output signal paths to any signal chain that is asynchronous
or configured for a different sample rate.
4.12.3 Output Signal Path Control
Under default register conditions, the headphone output (OUT1–OUT3) paths are configured for stereo output. The
headphone paths can be configured for mono differential (BTL) output using the OUTn_MONO bits; this is ideal for driving
an earpiece or hearing aid coil.
When the OUTn_MONO bit is set, the respective right channel output is an inverted copy of the left channel output signal;
this creates a differential output between the respective outputs. The left and right channel output drivers must both be
enabled in Mono Mode; both channels should be enabled simultaneously using the bits described in Table 4-78.
The mono (BTL) signal paths are shown in Fig. 4-51. Note that, in Mono Mode, the effective gain of the signal path is
increased by 6 dB.
The SPKCLK frequency of the PDM output path (OUT5) is controlled by OUT5_OSR, as described in Table 4-79. When
the OUT5_OSR bit is set, the audio performance is improved, but power consumption is also increased.
Note that the SPKCLK frequencies noted in Table 4-79 assume that the SYSCLK frequency is a multiple of 6.144 MHz
(SYSCLK_FRAC=0). If the SYSCLK frequency is a multiple of 5.6448 MHz (SYSCLK_FRAC = 1), the SPKCLK frequency
is scaled accordingly.

The CS47L90 incorporates a stereo ANC processor that can provide noise reduction in many different operating
conditions. The noise cancelation signals can be mixed into any of the output signal paths using the x_ANC_SRC fields,
as described in Table 4-80. See Section 4.6 for further details of the ANC function.

4.12.4 Output Signal Path Digital Filter Control
An integrated signal-processing engine on the CS47L90 supports digital filter requirements for range of hi-fi applications.
Preset filter coefficients are held in on-board ROM, and can be configured and enabled as required. The hi-fi filters are
tailored to specific sample rates, and provide options relating to passband frequency, stopband attenuation, and
phase-response characteristics.
The filter type is selected using the HIFI_FIR_TYPE field. The available filters are each described in Table 4-81. The digital
filter can be enabled in any output path, using the respective OUTnx_HIFI bits.
Note that only one filter type can be selected at any time, but the applicable filter can be enabled on any number of output
paths simultaneously. The supported sample rates for each filter type are noted in Table 4-81—the selected filter must be
consistent with the output sample rate (OUT_RATE) setting.
The digital filter can be enabled or disabled independently in any output path. A short interruption to the playback if the
filter type is changed while the hi-fi filters are enabled on any output path.
The hi-fi digital filters are described in Table 4-81.

At 48 kHz (or 44.1 kHz) sample rate, the key parameters of the hi-fi digital filters are the stopband attenuation and phase
response. The stopband characteristics are noted in Table 4-81.
The choice between linear phase and minimum phase filters determines time-domain effects of the filter transfer function.
Linear phase offers zero group delay, and equal levels of pre- and postringing. Minimum phase offers minimum preringing
and latency, but higher levels of postringing and group delay distortion.

For sample rates above 48kHz, a choice between apodizing and non-apodizing filters is available. Apodizing filters have
the capability to reduce time-domain distortion—this can be used to eliminate time smear effects introduced by other filters
in the signal chain, provided the other filters have a flat frequency response throughout the apodizing filter’s cut-off region.
The cut-off (stopband) frequency of the apodizing filters are slightly lower than the respective non-apodizing filter
response.
The hi-fi digital filter control registers are described in Table 4-82.

4.12.5 Output Signal Path Digital Volume Control
A digital volume control is provided on each output signal path, providing –64 to +31.5 dB gain control in 0.5-dB steps. An
independent mute control is also provided for each output signal path.
Whenever the gain or mute setting is changed, the signal path gain is ramped up or down to the new settings at a
programmable rate. For increasing gain (or unmute), the rate is controlled by OUT_VI_RAMP. For decreasing gain (or
mute), the rate is controlled by OUT_VD_RAMP.
Note:     The OUT_VI_RAMP and OUT_VD_RAMP fields should not be changed while a volume ramp is in progress.

The OUT_VU bits control the loading of the output signal path digital volume and mute controls. When OUT_VU is cleared,
the digital volume and mute settings are loaded into the respective control register, but does not actually change the signal
path gain. The digital volume and mute settings on all of the output signal paths are updated when a 1 is written to OUT_
VU. This makes it possible to update the gain of multiple signal paths simultaneously.
Note that, although the digital-volume controls provide 0.5-dB steps, the internal circuits provide signal gain adjustment in
0.125-dB steps. This allows a very high degree of gain control—smooth volume ramping under all operating conditions.
The digital volume control registers are described in Table 4-83 and Table 4-84.

4.12.6 Output Signal Path Noise-Gate Control
The CS47L90 provides a digital noise-gate function for each output signal path. The noise gate ensures best noise
performance when the signal path is idle. When the noise gate is enabled, and the applicable signal level is below the
noise-gate threshold, the noise gate is activated, causing the signal path to be muted.
The noise-gate function is enabled by setting NGATE_ENA, as described in Table 4-85.
For each output path, the noise gate may be associated with one or more of the signal path threshold detection functions
using the x_NGATE_SRC fields. When more than one signal threshold is selected, the output-path noise gate is only
activated (i.e., muted) when all of the respective signal thresholds are satisfied.
For example, if the OUT1L noise gate is associated with the OUT1L and OUT1R signal paths, the OUT1L signal path is
only muted if both the OUT1L and OUT1R signal levels are below the respective thresholds.
The noise-gate threshold (the signal level below which the noise gate is activated) is set using NGATE_THR. Note that,
for each output path, the noise-gate threshold represents the signal level at the respective output pins; the threshold is
therefore independent of the digital volume and PGA gain settings.
Note that, although there is only one noise-gate threshold level (NGATE_THR), each output-path noise gate may be
activated independently, according to the respective signal content and the associated threshold configurations.
To prevent erroneous triggering, a time delay is applied before the gate is activated; the noise gate is only activated (i.e.,
muted) when the output levels are below the applicable signal level thresholds for longer than the noise-gate hold time.
The hold time is set using the NGATE_HOLD field.
When the noise gate is activated, the CS47L90 gradually attenuates the respective signal path at the rate set by OUT_
VD_RAMP (see Table 4-83). When the noise gate is deactivated, the output volume increases at the rate set by OUT_VI_
RAMP.

4.12.7 Output Signal Path AEC Loop-Back
The CS47L90 incorporates two loop-back signal paths, which are ideally suited as a reference for AEC processing. Any
two of the output signal paths may be selected as the AEC loop-back sources.
When configured with suitable DSP firmware, the CS47L90 can provide an integrated AEC capability. The AEC loop-back
feature also enables convenient hook-up to an external device for implementing the required signal-processing algorithms.
The AEC loop-back source is connected after the respective digital volume controls, as shown in Fig. 4-51. The AEC
loop-back signals can be selected as input to any of the digital mixers within the CS47L90 digital core. The sample rate
for the AEC loop-back paths is configured using OUT_RATE—see Table 4-26.
The AEC loop-back function is enabled using the AECn_LOOPBACK_ENA bits (where n identifies the applicable path,
AEC1 or AEC2). The source signals for the Transmit Path AEC function are selected using the AECn_LOOPBACK_SRC
bits.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the AEC
loop-back function. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable this function fails. Note that active signal paths are not
affected under such circumstances.
The AECn_ENA_STS bits indicate the status of the AEC loop-back functions. If an underclocked error condition occurs,
these bits indicate whether the AEC loop-back function has been enabled.

4.12.8 Headphone Outputs
The headphone/earpiece driver outputs, HPOUT1L, HPOUT1R, HPOUT2L, HPOUT2R, HPOUT3L, and HPOUT3R, are
suitable for direct connection to external headphones and earpieces. The outputs are ground referenced, eliminating any
requirement for AC coupling capacitors.
The headphone outputs incorporate a common mode, or ground loop, feedback path that provides rejection of
system-related ground noise. The feedback pin must be connected to ground for normal operation of the headphone
outputs.

Note that the feedback pins should be connected to GND as close as possible to the respective headphone jack ground
pin, as shown in Fig. 4-52. In mono (differential) mode, the feedback pins should be connected to the ground plane that is
closest to the earpiece output PCB tracks.
The ground feedback path for HPOUT1 and HPOUT2 headphone outputs is selected using the HP1_GND_SEL and HP2_
GND_SEL bits respectively—see Table 4-87.
The ground feedback path for HPOUT3 headphone output is provided via the HPOUT3FB pin.

The external connections associated with the PDM outputs are implemented on multifunction GPIO pins, which must be
configured for the respective PDM functions when required. The PDM output connections are pin-specific alternative
functions available on specific GPIO pins. See Section 4.15 to configure the GPIO pins for the PDM output.
The PDM digital speaker interface is a stereo interface; the OUT5L and OUT5R output signal paths are interleaved on the
SPKDAT output, and clocked using SPKCLK.
Note that the PDM interface supports two different operating modes; these are selected using SPK1_FMT. See Table 3-15
for detailed timing information in both modes.
     • If SPK1_FMT = 0 (Mode A), the Left PDM channel is valid at the rising edge of SPKCLK; the Right PDM channel is
       valid at the falling edge of SPKCLK.
     • If SPK1_FMT = 1 (Mode B), the Left PDM channel is valid during the low phase of SPKCLK; the Right PDM channel
       is valid during the high phase of SPKCLK.

Clocking for the PDM interface is derived from SYSCLK. Note that SYSCLK_ENA must also be set. See Section 4.17 for
further details of the system clocks and control registers.
If the OUT5L or OUT5R output signal path is enabled, the PDM interface clock signal is output on the SPKCLK pin.
The output signal paths support normal and high performance operating modes, as described in Section 4.12.3. The
SPKCLK frequency is set according to the operating mode of the relevant output path, as described in Table 4-88. The
OUT5_OSR bit is defined in Table 4-80.
Note that the SPKCLK frequencies noted in Table 4-88 assume that the SYSCLK frequency is a multiple of 6.144 MHz
(SYSCLK_FRAC = 0). If the SYSCLK frequency is a multiple of 5.6448 MHz (SYSCLK_FRAC=1), the SPKCLK frequency
is scaled accordingly.

The PDM output channels can be independently muted. When muted, the default output on each channel is a
DSD-compliant silent stream (0110_1001b). The mute output code can be programmed to other values if required, using
the SPK1_MUTE_SEQ field. The mute output code can be transmitted MSB-first or LSB-first; this is selectable using the
SPK1_MUTE_ENDIAN bit.
Note that the PDM Mute function is not a soft-mute; the audio output is interrupted immediately when the PDM mute is
asserted. It is recommended to use the output signal path mute function before applying the PDM mute. See Table 4-83
for details of the OUT5L_MUTE and OUT5R_MUTE bits.

The SPKCLK output can be selected as the clock timing reference for the DMIC input paths. This allows a two-way audio
interface to be supported, using SPKCLK as a shared clock. See Section 4.2 to configure the DMIC input paths.
The two-way interface can be used to support digital feedback from a PDM speaker driver, enabling advanced speaker
protection algorithms to be implemented.
The SPKCLK and DMICDATn pins are powered on different voltage domains, as noted in Table 1-1. If SPKCLK is selected
as the DMIC clock, it is advised to take care to ensure compatibility of the respective power domains.
4.13 External Accessory Detection
The CS47L90 provides external accessory detection functions that can sense the presence and impedance of external
components. This can be used to detect the insertion or removal of an external headphone or headset, and to provide an
indication of key/button push events.
Jack insertion is detected using the JACKDET1 and JACKDET2 pins, which are typically connected to a switch contact
within the jack sockets. An interrupt event is generated whenever a jack insertion or jack removal event is detected.
Suppression of pops and clicks caused by jack insertion or removal is provided using the MICDET clamp function. This
function can also be used to trigger interrupt events, and/or to trigger the control-write sequencer. The integrated
general-purpose switches can be synchronized with the MICDET clamp, to provide additional pop suppression capability.

Microphones, push buttons and other accessories can be detected via the MICDETn pins. The presence of a microphone,
and the status of a hook switch can be detected. This feature can also be used to detect push-button operation. (Note that
accessory detection is also possible via the HPDETn and JACKDETn pins, subject to some additional constraints.)
Headphone impedance can be measured via the HPDET1 and HPDET2 pins; this can be used to set different gain levels
or other configuration settings according to the type of load connected. For example, different settings may be applicable
to headphone or line output loads. (Note that impedance measurement is also possible via the MICDETn and JACKDETn
pins, subject to some additional constraints.)
The MICVDD power domain must be enabled when using the microphone detect function. (Note that MICVDD is not
required for the jack detect or headphone detect functions.) The MICVDD power domain is provided using an internal
charge pump (CP2) and LDO regulator (LDO2). See Section 4.20 for details of these circuits.
The internal 32-kHz clock must be present and enabled when using the microphone detect or headphone detect functions;
the 32-kHz clock is also required for the jack detect function, assuming input debounce is enabled. See Section 4.17 for
details of the internal 32-kHz clock and associated control fields.
4.13.1 Jack Detect
The CS47L90 provides support for jack insertion switch detection. The jack insertion status can be read using the relevant
register status bits. A jack insertion or removal can also be used to trigger an interrupt event.
The jack-detect interrupt (IRQ) functionality is maintained in Sleep Mode (see Section 4.14). This enables a jack insertion
event to be used to trigger a wake-up of the CS47L90.
Jack insertion and removal is detected using the JACKDET1 and JACKDET2 pins. The recommended external
connections are shown in Fig. 4-55. Note that the logic thresholds associated with the two JACKDET differ from each
other, as described in Table 3-11—this provides support for different jack switch configurations.
The jack detect feature is enabled using the JDn_ENA bits (where n = 1 or 2 for JACKDET1 or JACKDET2 respectively);
the jack insertion status can be read using JDn_STSx. Note that the JDn_STS1 and JDn_STS2 bits provide the same
information in respect of the applicable JACKDETn input.
The jack detect input debounce is selected using the JDn_DB bits, as described in Table 4-90. Note that, under normal
operating conditions, the debounce circuit uses the 32-kHz clock, which must be enabled whenever input debounce
functions are required. Input debounce is not provided in Sleep Mode; the JDn_DB bits have no effect in Sleep Mode.
Note that the jack detect signals, JD1 and JD2, can be used as inputs to the MICDET clamp function—this provides
additional functionality relating to jack insertion and removal events.
An interrupt request (IRQ) event is generated whenever a jack insertion or jack removal is detected (see Section 4.16).
Separate mask bits are provided, to allow IRQ events on the rising and/or falling edges of the JD1 or JD2 signals.
The control registers associated with the jack detect function are described in Table 4-90.

4.13.2 Jack Pop Suppression (MICDET Clamp and GP Switch)
Under typical configuration of a 3.5-mm headphone/accessory jack connection, there is a risk of pops and clicks arising
from jack insertion or removal. This can occur when the headphone load makes momentary contact with the MICBIAS
output when the jack is not fully inserted.
The CS47L90 provides a MICDET clamp function to suppress pops and clicks caused by jack insertion or removal. It can
be controlled directly, or can be activated by a configurable logic function derived from external logic inputs. The clamp
status can be read using the relevant register status bit. The clamp status can also be used to trigger an interrupt (IRQ)
event or to trigger the control-write sequencer.
4.13.2.1 MICDET Clamp Control
The MICDET clamp function can be configured using the MICD_CLAMP_MODE field; the selectable logic conditions
(derived from the JD1 and/or JD2 signals; see Table 4-90) provide support for different jack detect circuit configurations.
The MICD_CLAMP_OVD bit, when set, activates the MICDET clamp, regardless of other conditions.
Note:    The MICD_CLAMP_OVD bit is enabled by default; the MICDET clamp is always active following power-on reset,
         hardware reset, or software reset.
The MICDET clamp functionality (including the external IRQ) is maintained in Sleep Mode (see Section 4.14). This enables
a jack insertion event to be used to trigger a wake-up of the CS47L90. The recommended control sequence for the jack
detect and MICDET clamp functionality is described in Section 4.13.2.5.
When the MICDET clamp is active, the MICDET1/HPOUTFB1 and MICDET2/HPOUTFB2 pins are short-circuited
together. The grounding of the applicable MICDET is achieved via the HPOUTFB function of the other pin—it is assumed
that the HPOUTFB connection is grounded externally, as shown in Fig. 4-57.
Note:    The CS47L90 provides four MICDETn/HPOUTFBn connections, which can be used in many different
         configurations. The MICDET clamp is supported on the MICDET1 and MICDET2 pins only. In applications that
         provide a mixture of external connection types (e.g., 3.5-mm and USB-C connections), it is recommended that the
         MICDET1 and MICDET2 pins should be associated with the 3.5-mm connection.
The configurable logic provides flexibility in selecting the appropriate conditions for activating the MICDET clamp. The
clamp status can be read using the MICD_CLAMP_STSx bits. Note that the MICD_CLAMP_STS1 and MICD_CLAMP_
STS2 bits provide the same information.
The MICDET clamp debounce is selected by setting MICD_CLAMP_DB, as described in Table 4-91. Note that, under
normal operating conditions, the debounce circuit uses the 32-kHz clock, which must be enabled whenever input
debounce functions are required. Input debounce is not provided in Sleep Mode; the MICD_CLAMP_DB bit has no effect
in Sleep Mode.

4.13.2.2 Interrupts and Write-Sequencer Control
An interrupt request (IRQ) event is generated whenever the MICDET clamp is asserted or deasserted; see Section 4.16.
Separate mask bits are provided to enable IRQ events on the rising and/or falling edge of the MICDET clamp status.
The control-write sequencer can be triggered by the MICDET clamp status. This is enabled using the WSEQ_ENA_MICD_
CLAMP_FALL and WSEQ_ENA_MICD_CLAMP_RISE bits; see Section 4.19 for further details.
4.13.2.3 Pop Suppression using General-Purpose Switch
In applications where a large decoupling capacitance is present on the MICBIAS output, the MICDET clamp function alone
may be unable to discharge the capacitor sufficiently to eliminate pops and clicks associated with jack insertion and
removal. In this case, it may be desirable to use one of the general-purpose switches on the CS47L90 to provide isolation
from the MICBIAS output; an example circuit is shown in Fig. 4-58.
There are two general-purpose switches, configured using the respective SWn_MODE fields (where n = 1 or 2). The
SWn_MODE fields allow the switches to be disabled, enabled, or synchronized to the MICDET clamp status, as described
in Table 4-91.
For jack pop suppression, it is recommended to set SWn_MODE = 11 for the applicable switch. In this case, the switch
contacts are open whenever the MICDET clamp is active, and the switch contacts are closed whenever the MICDET clamp
is inactive.
Normal accessory functions are supported when the switch contacts (GPSWnP and GPSWnN) are closed, and the
MICDET clamp is inactive. Ground clamping of MICDET, and isolation of MICBIAS, are achieved when the switch contacts
are open and the MICDET clamp is active.
Note that the MICDET clamp function must also be configured appropriately when using this method of pop suppression
control.

4.13.2.5 Control Sequence for Jack Detect and MICDET Clamp
A summary of the jack detect and MICDET clamp functionality, and the recommended usage in typical applications, is
described as follows.
    •   On device power-up, and following reset, the MICDET clamp is active, due to the default setting of MICD_CLAMP_
        OVD; this ensures no spurious output can occur during jack insertion. It is recommended to keep the MICDET clamp
        active (MICD_CLAMP_OVD = 1) until after a jack insertion has been detected.
        The MICDET_CLAMP_MODE field should be set according to the applicable JD1/JD2 signal configuration
        (configured to assert the clamp when jack is removed).
    •   Jack insertion is indicated using the JD1/JD2 signals (assuming that the MICDET_CLAMP_MODE field has been
        correctly set for the applicable JD1/JD2 signal configuration); the associated status bits can be read directly, or
        associated signals can be unmasked as inputs to the interrupt controller.
        After jack insertion has been detected, the applicable headset functions (headphone, microphone, accessory
        detect) may then be enabled.
        If the headset function requires MICBIAS to be enabled on the respective jack, the MICDET clamp should be
        disabled (MICD_CLAMP_OVD = 0) immediately before enabling the MICBIAS (or immediately before enabling
        MICD_ENA). Note that, if MICBIAS is not required on the respective jack, the clamp should not be disabled (e.g.,
        for headphone-only operation).
    •   Jack removal is also indicated using the JD1/JD2 signals. The JD1/JD2 status bits can be read directly, or can be
        unmasked as inputs to the interrupt controller. In this event, the MICDET clamp ensures fast and automatic silencing
        of the jack outputs.
        Under typical use cases, the respective MICBIAS generator and headset audio paths should all be disabled
        following jack removal.

       After jack removal has been detected, the MICDET clamp override bit should be asserted (MICD_CLAMP_
       OVD = 1), to make the system ready for a jack insertion.
The recommended control sequence for jack detect and MICDET clamp is summarized in Table 4-92.

4.13.3 Microphone Detect
The CS47L90 microphone detection circuit measures the impedance of an external load connected to one of the MICDET
pins. This feature can be used to detect the presence of a microphone, and the status of the associated hook switch. It
can also be used to detect push-button status or the connection of other external accessories.
4.13.3.1 Microphone Detect Control
The microphone detection circuit measures the external impedance connected to the MICDETn pins. In the discrete
measurement mode, the function reports whether the measured impedance lies within one of eight predefined levels. In
the ADC measurement mode, a more specific result is provided in the form of a 7-bit ADC output.
Note that microphone/accessory detection is also possible via the HPDETn and JACKDETn pins, subject to some
additional constraints. If the measurement (sense) pin is connected to MICVDD or MICBIASnx (typically via a 2.2-k bias
resistor), MICDETn must always be used.
The microphone detection circuit typically uses one of the MICBIAS outputs as a reference. The CS47L90 automatically
enables the appropriate MICBIAS output when required in order to perform the detection function; this allows the detection
function to be supported in low-power standby operating conditions.
The MICVDD power domain must be enabled when using the microphone detection function. This power domain is
provided using an internal charge pump (CP2) and LDO regulator (LDO2). See Section 4.20 for details of these circuits.
The internal 32-kHz clock must be present and enabled when using the microphone detection function; see Section 4.17
for details.
The CS47L90 provides two microphone detection circuits, which are independently configurable. Detection can be
enabled on both circuits simultaneously.
To configure the microphone detection circuit, the applicable pin connections for the intended measurement must be
written to the MICDn_SENSE_SEL and MICDn_GND_SEL fields (where n identifies the respective detection circuit, 1 or
2). The respective detection circuit measures the external impedance between the pins selected by these two fields; the
valid selections for each are defined in Table 4-93.
Note:    There is no requirement for the SENSE and GND pin selections to be uniquely assigned between the microphone
         detect and headphone detect functions—the same pin may be used as a SENSE or GND connection for more
         than one of the detection functions. If multiple microphone/headphone detections are enabled, the respective
         measurements are automatically scheduled in isolation to each other. See Section 4.13.4 for details of the
         headphone detect function.
The microphone detection circuit uses MICVDD, or any one of the MICBIASxy sources, as a reference. The applicable
source is configured using the MICDn_BIAS_SRC field. If HPDETn or JACKDETn is selected as the measurement pin
(MICDn_SENSE_SEL = 1XX), MICDn_BIAS_SRC should be set to 1111.

                                                                                                               CS47L90
                                                                                       4.13 External Accessory Detection
The microphone detection function is enabled by setting MICDn_ENA.
When microphone detection is enabled, the CS47L90 performs a number of measurements in order to determine the
external impedance between the selected pins. The measurement process is repeated at a cyclic rate controlled by
MICDn_RATE. The MICDn_RATE field selects the delay between completion of one measurement and the start of the
next. When the microphone detection result has settled, the CS47L90 indicates valid data by setting MICDn_VALID.
The discrete measurement mode and ADC measurement mode provide different capabilities for microphone detection.
The control requirements and the measurement indication mechanisms differ according to the selected mode, as follows:
   •   In the discrete measurement mode (MICDn_ADC_MODE = 0), the measured impedance is only deemed valid after
       more than one successive measurement has produced the same result. The MICDn_DBTIME field provides control
       of the debounce period; this can be either two measurements or four measurements.
       When the microphone detection result has settled (i.e., after the applicable debounce period), the CS47L90
       indicates valid data by setting the MICDn_VALID bit. The measured impedance is indicated using the MICDn_LVL
       and MICDn_STS bits, as described in Table 4-93.
       The MICDn_VALID bit, when set, remains asserted for as long as the microphone detection function is enabled (i.e.,
       while MICDn_ENA = 1). If the detected impedance changes, the MICDn_LVL and MICDn_STS fields change, but
       the MICDn_VALID bit remains set, indicating valid data at all times.
       The detection circuit supports up to eight impedance levels (including the no-accessory-detected level), enabling
       detection of a typical microphone and up to six push buttons. Each measurement level can be enabled or disabled
       independently; this provides flexibility according to the required thresholds, and offers a faster measurement time
       in some applications. The MICDn_LVL_SEL field is described in Section 4.13.3.3. The default configuration
       supports a maximum of four push buttons, in accordance with the Android™ wired headset specification.
       Note that, for typical headset detection, the choice of external resistance values must take into account the
       impedance of the microphone—the detected impedance corresponds to the combined parallel resistance of the
       microphone and any asserted push button. Examples of suitable external components are described in
       Section 5.1.7.
   •   In the ADC measurement mode (MICDn_ADC_MODE = 1), the detection function generates two output results,
       contained within the MICDn_ADCVAL and MICDn_ADCVAL_DIFF fields. These fields contain the most recent
       measurement value (MICDn_ADCVAL) and the measurement difference value (MICDn_ADCVAL_DIFF). The
       difference value indicates the difference between the latest measurement and the previous measurement; this can
       be used to determine whether the measurement is stable and reliable.
       In ADC measurement mode, the detection function must be disabled before the measurement can be read. When
       the CS47L90 indicates valid data (MICDn_VALID = 1), the detection must be disabled by setting MICDn_ENA = 0.
       Note that MICDn_ADCVAL and MICDn_ADCVAL_DIFF do not follow a linear coding. The appropriate test condition
       for accepting the measurement value (or for rescheduling the measurement) varies depending on the application
       requirements, and depending on the expected impedance value.
The microphone detection functions are inputs to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event
every time an accessory insertion, removal, or impedance change is detected; see Section 4.16.
The fields associated with microphone detection (or other accessories) are described in Table 4-93. The external circuit
configuration is shown in Fig. 4-59.

The external connections for the microphone detect circuit are shown in Fig. 4-59. In typical applications, it can be used
to detect a microphone or button press.
Note that, when using the microphone detect circuit, it is recommended to use the IN1B or IN2B analog microphone input
paths to ensure best immunity to electrical transients arising from the external accessory.

4.13.3.2 MICBIAS Reference Control
The voltage reference for the microphone detection is configured using the MICDn_BIAS_SRC field, as described in
Table 4-93. The microphone detection function automatically enables the applicable reference when required for
impedance measurement.
If the selected reference (MICBIASxy) is not already enabled, the microphone detect circuit automatically enables the
respective MICBIAS output for short periods of time only, every time the impedance measurement is scheduled. To allow
time for the MICBIAS source to start-up, a time delay is applied before the measurement is performed; this is configured
using MICDn_BIAS_STARTTIME, as described in Table 4-93.
Note:    The microphone detection automatically enables the applicable MICBIASxy output switch, every time the
         impedance measurement is scheduled. The respective MICBIAS generator (MICBIAS1 or MICBIAS2) is not
         controlled automatically—the applicable generators must be enabled using the MICB1_ENA and MICB2_ENA
         bits, as described in Table 4-134.
The MICDn_BIAS_STARTTIME field should be set to 16 ms or more if MICBn_RATE = 1 (pop-free start-up/shutdown).
MICDn_BIAS_STARTTIME should be set to 0.25 ms or more if MICBn_RATE = 0 (fast start-up/shutdown).
The timing of the microphone detect function is shown in Fig. 4-60. Two different cases are shown, according to whether
MICBIASxy is enabled periodically by the impedance measurement function, or is enabled at all times.
If the selected reference (MICBIASxy) is not enabled continuously, the respective MICBIASxy discharge bits should be
cleared. The MICBIAS control registers are described in Section 4.20.

4.13.3.3 Measurement Range Control
When the discrete measurement mode is selected (MICDn_ADC_MODE = 0), the MICDn_LVL_SEL[7:0] bits allow each
impedance measurement level to be enabled or disabled independently. This allows the function to be tailored to the
particular application requirements.
If one or more bits within MICDn_LVL_SEL is cleared, the corresponding impedance level is disabled. Any measured
impedance which lies in a disabled level is reported as the next lowest, enabled level.
For example, the MICDn_LVL_SEL[2] bit enables the detection of a 360–680  impedance. If MICDn_LVL_SEL[2] = 0,
an external impedance in this range is indicated in the next lowest detection range (210–290 ); this would be reported in
the MICDn_LVL field as MICDn_LVL[2] = 1.
With default register configuration, and all measurement levels enabled, the CS47L90 can detect the presence of a typical
microphone and up to four push buttons. It is possible to configure the detection circuit for up to eight push buttons, by
adjusting the impedance detection thresholds. However, adjustment of the detection thresholds is outside the scope of
this data sheet—please contact your local Cirrus Logic representative for further information, if required.
The measurement time varies between 100–500 s, depending on the impedance of the external load, and depending on
how many impedance measurement levels are enabled. A high impedance is measured faster than a low impedance.
4.13.3.4 External Components
The external connections for the microphone detect circuit are shown in Fig. 4-59. Examples of suitable external
components are described in Section 5.1.7.
The accuracy of the microphone detect function is assured whenever the connected load is within the applicable limits
specified in Table 3-11. It is required that a 2.2-k (2%) resistor must also be connected between the measurement
(SENSE) pin and the selected MICBIAS reference—different resistor values lead to inaccuracy in the impedance
measurement.
Note that, for typical headset detection, the choice of external resistance values must take into account the impedance of
the microphone—the detected impedance corresponds to the combined parallel resistance of the microphone and any
asserted push button.

4.13.4 Headphone Detect
The CS47L90 headphone detection circuit measures the impedance of an external headphone load. This feature can be
used to set different gain levels or to apply other configuration settings according to the type of load connected. Separate
monitor pins are provided for headphone detection on the left and right channels of HPOUTn.
4.13.4.1 Headphone Detection Control
The headphone detection circuit measures the external impedance connected to the HPDETn pins. In typical usage, this
provides measurement of the load impedance on one or more of the headphone outputs (HPOUT1–3).
Note that impedance measurement is also possible via the MICDETn and JACKDETn pins, subject to some additional
constraints. If the measurement (sense) pin is connected to one of the headphone outputs, HPDET1, HPDET2, or
JACKDET1 must always be used. The valid measurement range and the measurement accuracy are reduced, if using the
MICDETn or JACKDETn pins.
To configure the headphone detection circuit, the applicable pin connections for the intended measurement must be
written to the HPD_SENSE_SEL and HPD_GND_SEL fields. The headphone detection circuit measures the external
impedance between the pins selected by these two fields; the valid selections for each are defined in Table 4-96.
    •  When measuring the load impedance on the HPOUT1 or HPOUT2 output paths, the HPD_GND_SEL selection
       should be the same MICDETn/HPOUTFBn pin as the ground feedback pin for the applicable headphone output.
       See Section 4.12.8 to configure the ground feedback pin for HPOUT1 and HPOUT2.
    •  When measuring the load impedance on the HPOUT3 output path, one of the MICDETn/HPOUTFBn pins must be
       connected to HPOUT3FB, and the HPD_GND_SEL field should select the same MICDETn/HPOUTFBn pin as the
       measurement reference.
The HPD_FRC_SEL field must also be configured, to select where the measurement current is applied. As a general rule,
this should be the same as the HPD_SENSE_SEL pin. Other configurations can be used if required—for example, to
improve measurement accuracy in cases where the SENSE input path includes significant unwanted resistance.
Note:    There is no requirement for the SENSE and GND pin selections to be uniquely assigned between the microphone
         detect and headphone detect functions—the same pin may be used as a SENSE or GND connection for more
         than one of the detection functions. If multiple microphone/headphone detections are enabled, the respective
         measurements are automatically scheduled in isolation to each other. See Section 4.13.3 for details of the
         microphone detect function.
Headphone detection is commanded by writing 1 to HPD_POLL.
The impedance measurement range is configured using HPD_IMPEDANCE_RANGE. This field should be set in
accordance with the expected load impedance. Note that a number of separate measurements are typically required to
determine the load impedance; the recommended control requirements are described in Section 4.13.4.2.
Note:    Setting HPD_IMPEDANCE_RANGE is not required for detection on the MICDETn or JACKDETn pins (HPD_
         SENSE_SEL = 0XX or 11X). The impedance measurement range, and measurement accuracy, in these cases
         are different to the HPDET1 and HPDET2 measurements.
If headphone detection is performed using a measurement pin connected to one of the headphone outputs, the respective
output driver must be disabled before the measurement is commanded. The required settings are shown in Table 4-94.

               HPOUT3L Impedance measurement                 HPD_OVD_ENA = 1, HPD_OUT_SEL = 100, HP3L_ENA = 0
               HPOUT3R Impedance measurement                 HPD_OVD_ENA = 1, HPD_OUT_SEL = 101, HP3R_ENA = 0
               Note: The applicable headphone outputs configuration must be maintained until after the headphone detection
               has completed. See Table 4-78 for details of the HPnx_ENA bits.

If headphone detection is performed using a measurement pin that is not connected to one of the headphone outputs, the
HPD_OVD_ENA bit should be cleared.
If headphone detection is performed using a measurement pin that is also connected to one of the MICBIAS outputs, the
respective MICBIAS output must be disabled and floating (MICBnx_ENA = 0, MICBnx_DISCH = 0).
When headphone detection is commanded, the CS47L90 uses an adjustable current source to determine the connected
impedance. A sweep of measurement currents is applied. The rate of this sweep can be adjusted using HPD_CLK_DIV
and HPD_RATE.
4.13.4.2 Measurement Output
The headphone detection process typically comprises a number of separate measurements (for different impedance
ranges). Completion of each measurement is indicated by HPD_DONE. When this bit is set, the measurement result can
be read from the HPD_DACVAL field, and decoded as described in Eq. 4-2.
                                                                                  C 0 +  C 1  Offset 

Note that, to achieve the specified measurement accuracy, the above equation must be calculated to an accuracy of at
least 5 decimal places throughout.
The impedance measurement result is valid if 169  HPD_DACVAL  1019. (In case of any contradiction with the HPD_
IMPEDANCE_RANGE description, the HPD_DACVAL validity takes precedence.)
If the external impedance is entirely unknown (i.e., it could lie in any of the HPD_IMPEDANCE_RANGE regions), it is
recommended to test initially with HPD_IMPEDANCE_RANGE = 00. If the resultant HPD_DACVAL is < 169, the
impedance is higher than the selected measurement range, so the test should be scheduled again, after incrementing
HPD_IMPEDANCE_RANGE.
Each measurement is triggered by writing 1 to HPD_POLL. Completion of each measurement is indicated by HPD_DONE.
Note that, after HPD_DONE bit has been asserted, it remains asserted until the next measurement has been commanded.
Note:    A simpler, but less accurate, procedure for headphone impedance measurement is also supported, using the
         HPD_LVL field. When the HPD_DONE bit is set, indicating completion of a measurement, the impedance can be
         read directly from the HPD_LVL field, provided that the value lies within the range of the applicable HPD_
         IMPEDANCE_RANGE setting.
         Note that, for detection using the MICDETn or JACKDETn pins, the HPD_LVL field is the only supported
         measurement output option. The HPD_IMPEDANCE_RANGE field is not valid for detection on the MICDETn or
         JACKDETn pins. See Table 4-96 for further description of the HPD_LVL field.

The headphone detection function is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event
on completion of the headphone detection; see Section 4.16.
The fields associated with headphone detection are described in Table 4-96. The external circuit configuration is shown
Fig. 4-61.
Note that 32-bit register addressing is used from R12888 (0x3000) upwards; 16-bit format is used otherwise. The registers
noted in Table 4-96 contain a mixture of 16- and 32-bit register addresses.

Note that, where external resistors are connected in series with the headphone load, as shown, it is recommended that
the HPDETn connection is to the headphone side of the resistors. If the HPDETn connection is made to the CS47L90 end
of these resistors, this leads to a corresponding offset in the measured impedance.
Under default conditions, the measurement time varies between 17–244 ms, depending on the impedance of the external
load. A high impedance is measured faster than a low impedance.
4.14 Low Power Sleep Configuration
The CS47L90 supports a low-power Sleep mode, in which most functions are disabled and power consumption is
minimized. The CS47L90 enters Sleep Mode when the DCVDD supply is removed. Note that the AVDD and DBVDD1
supplies must be present throughout the Sleep Mode duration.
In Sleep Mode, the CS47L90 can generate an interrupt event in response to a change in voltage on the JACKDET1 or
JACKDET2 pins. This enables a jack insertion event (or other digital logic transition) to be used to trigger a wake-up of the
CS47L90.
The system clocks (SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, DSPCLK) should be disabled before selecting Sleep Mode. The external clock
input (MCLKn) may also be stopped, if desired.
The functionality and control fields associated with Sleep Mode are supported via an internal always-on supply domain.
The always-on control registers are listed in Table 4-97. These fields are maintained (i.e., not reset) in Sleep Mode.
Note that the control interface is not supported in Sleep Mode; read/write access to the always-on registers is not possible.
Access to the register map using any of the control interfaces should be ceased before selecting Sleep Mode.

The always-on digital I/O pins are listed in Table 4-98. All other digital input pins have no effect in Sleep Mode; all other
digital output pins are undriven (floating).
The IRQ output is normally deasserted in Sleep Mode. In Sleep Mode, the IRQ output can be asserted only in response
to the JACKDET1 or JACKDET2 inputs. If the IRQ output is asserted in Sleep Mode, it can be deasserted only after a
wake-up transition.
Output drivers and bus keepers are disabled in Sleep Mode, for all pins not on the always-on domain; this means that the
logic level on these pins is undefined. If a defined logic state is required during Sleep Mode (e.g., as input to another
device), an external pull resistor may be required. If an external pull resistor is connected to a pin that also supports a bus
keeper function, the pull resistance should be chosen carefully, taking into account the resistance of the bus keeper. See
Section 4.15.1 for specific notes concerning the GPIO pins.

The always-on functionality includes the JD1 and JD2 control signals, which provide support for the low-power Sleep
Mode. The MICDET clamp status signal is also supported; this is controlled by a selectable logic function, derived from
JD1 and/or JD2.
The JD1, JD2 and MICDET clamp status signals are derived from the JACKDET1 and JACKDET2 inputs, and can be used
to trigger the interrupt controller.
    •   The JD1 and JD2 signals are derived from the jack detect function (see Section 4.13). These inputs can be used to
        trigger a response to a jack insertion or jack removal detection.
        When these signals are enabled, the JD1 and JD2 signals indicate the status of the JACKDET1 and JACKDET2
        input pins respectively. See Table 4-90 for details of the associated control fields.
    •   The MICDET clamp status is controlled by the JD1 and/or JD2 signals (see Section 4.13). The configurable logic
        provides flexibility in selecting the appropriate conditions for activating the MICDET clamp. The clamp status can
        be used to trigger a response to a jack insertion or jack removal detection.
        The MICDET clamp function is configured using MICD_CLAMP_MODE, as described in Table 4-91.

The interrupt functionality associated with these signals is part of the always-on functionality, enabling the CS47L90 to
provide indication of jack insertion or jack removal to the host processor in Sleep Mode; see Section 4.16.
Note that the JACKDET1 and JACKDET2 inputs do not result in a wake-up transition directly; a wake-up transition only
occurs by reapplication of DCVDD. In a typical application, the JACKDETn inputs provide a signal to the applications
processor, via the IRQ output; if a wake-up transition is required, this is triggered by the applications processor enabling
the DCVDD supply.
4.15 General-Purpose I/O
The CS47L90 supports up to 38 GPIO pins, which can be assigned to application-specific functions. The GPIOs enable
interfacing and detection of external hardware and can provide logic outputs to other devices. The GPIO input functions
can be used to generate an interrupt (IRQ) event.
There are 8 dedicated GPIO pins; the remaining 30 GPIOs are implemented as alternate functions to a pin-specific
capability. The GPIO and interrupt circuits support the following functions:
    •   Pin-specific alternative functions for external interfaces (AIF, DMIC, PDM, MIF)
    •   Logic input/button detect (GPIO input)
    •   Logic 1 and Logic 0 output (GPIO output)
    •   Interrupt (IRQ) status output
    •   Clock output
    •   Frequency-locked loop (FLL) status output
    •   FLL clock output
    •   IEC-60958-3–compatible S/PDIF output
    •   Pulse-width modulation (PWM) signal output
    •   ASRC lock status
    •   General-purpose timer status output
    •   Event logger FIFO buffer status output
Note that the GPIO pins are referenced to different power domains (DBVDD1, DBVDD2, or DBVDD3), as indicated in
Table 1-1.
Logic input and output (GPIO) can be supported in two different ways on the CS47L90. The standard mechanism
described in this section provides a comprehensive suite of options including input debounce, and selectable output drive
configuration. The DSP GPIO circuit is tailored towards more advanced requirements typically demanded by DSP software
features. The DSP GPIO functions are described in Section 4.5.4.
The CS47L90 also incorporates two general-purpose switches; these are analog switches, described in Section 4.15.16.
4.15.1 GPIO Control
For each GPIO, the selected function is determined by the GPn_FN field, where n identifies the GPIO pin (1–38). The pin
direction, set by GPn_DIR, must be set according to function selected by GPn_FN.
If a pin is configured as a GPIO input (GPn_DIR = 1, GPn_FN = 0x001), the logic level at the pin can be read from the
respective GPn_LVL bit. Note that GPn_LVL is not affected by the GPn_POL bit.
A debounce circuit can be enabled on any GPIO input, to avoid false event triggers. This is enabled on each pin by setting
the respective GPn_DB bit. The debounce circuit uses the 32-kHz clock, which must be enabled whenever input debounce
functions are required. The debounce time is configurable using the GP_DBTIME field. See Section 4.17 for further details
of the CS47L90 clocking configuration.
Each GPIO pin is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event. An interrupt event
is triggered on the rising and falling edges of the GPIO input. The associated interrupt bit is latched once set; it can be
polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal. See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt event handling.

                                                                                                              4.15 General-Purpose I/O
Integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors are provided on each GPIO pin; these can be configured independently using
the GPn_PU and GPn_PD fields. When the pull-up and pull-down control bits are both enabled, the CS47L90 provides a
bus keeper function on the respective pin. The bus keeper function holds the logic level unchanged whenever the pin is
undriven (e.g., if the signal is tristated).
Note:     The bus keeper is enabled by default on all GPIO pins and, if not actively driven, may result in either a Logic 0 or
          Logic 1 at the respective input on start-up. If an external pull resistor is connected (e.g., to control the logic level
          in Sleep Mode), the chosen resistance should take account of the bus keeper resistance (see Table 3-10). A
          strong pull resistor (e.g., 10 k) is required, if a specific start-up condition is to be forced by the external pull
          component.
If a pin is configured as a GPIO output (GPn_DIR = 0, GPn_FN = 0x001), its level can be set to Logic 0 or Logic 1 using
the GPn_LVL field. Note that the GPn_LVL bits are write-only when the respective GPIO pin is configured as an output.
If a pin is configured as an output (GPn_DIR = 0), the polarity can be inverted using the GPn_POL bit. When GPn_
POL = 1, the selected output function is inverted. In the case of logic level output (GPn_FN = 0x001), the external output
is the opposite logic level to GPn_LVL when GPn_POL = 1. Note that, if GPn_FN = 0x000 or 0x002, the GPn_POL bit has
no effect on the respective GPIO pin.
A GPIO output can be either CMOS driven or open drain. This is selected on each pin using the respective GPn_OP_CFG
bit. Note that if GPn_FN = 0x000 the GPn_OP_CFG bit has no effect on the respective GPIO pin—see Table 4-99 for
further details. If GPn_FN = 0x002, the respective pin output is CMOS.
The register fields that control the GPIO pins are described in Table 4-99.

 1. n is a number (1–38) that identifies the individual GPIO.
 2. The default value of GPn_LVL depends upon whether the pin is actively driven by another device. If the pin is actively driven, the bus keeper
    maintains this logic level. If the pin is not actively driven, the bus keeper may establish either a Logic 1 or Logic 0 as the initial input level.

The available GPIO functions are described in Table 4-100. The function of each GPIO is set using GPn_FN, where n
identifies the GPIO pin (1–38). Note that the respective GPn_DIR must also be set according to whether the function is an
input or output.

4.15.3 Pin-Specific Alternate Function—GPn_FN = 0x000
The CS47L90 provides eight dedicated GPIO pins (1–8). The remaining 30 GPIOs are multiplexed with the pin-specific
functions listed in Table 4-101. The alternate functions are selected by setting the respective GPn_FN fields to 0x000, as
described in Section 4.15.1. Note that each function is unique to the associated pin and can be supported only on that pin.

If the alternate function is selected on a GPIO pin, the pin direction (input or output) and the output driver configuration
(CMOS or open drain) are set automatically as described in Table 4-101. The respective GPn_DIR and GPn_OP_CFG
bits have no effect in this case.

4.15.4 Button Detect (GPIO Input)—GPn_FN = 0x001
Button-detect functionality can be selected on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in
Section 4.15.1. The same functionality can be used to support a jack-detect input function.
It is recommended to enable the GPIO input debounce feature when using GPIOs as button input or jack-detect input.
The GPn_LVL fields may be read to determine the logic levels on a GPIO input, after the selectable debounce controls.
Note that GPn_LVL is not affected by the GPn_POL bit.
The debounced GPIO signals are also inputs to the interrupt-control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered on the rising
and falling edges of the GPIO input. The associated interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or
used to control the IRQ signal. See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt event handling.
4.15.5 Logic 1 and Logic 0 Output (GPIO Output)—GPn_FN = 0x001
The CS47L90 can be programmed to drive a logic high or logic low level on a GPIO pin by selecting the GPIO Output
function as described in Section 4.15.1.
The output logic level is selected using the respective GPn_LVL bit. Note that, if a GPIO pin is configured as an output,
the respective GPn_LVL bits are write-only.

The polarity of the GPIO output can be inverted using the GPn_POL bits. If GPn_POL = 1, the external output is the
opposite logic level to GPn_LVL.
4.15.6 DSP GPIO (Low-Latency DSP Input/Output)—GPn_FN = 0x002
The DSP GPIO function provides an advanced I/O capability, supporting the requirements of the CS47L90 as a
multi-purpose sensor hub. The DSP GPIO pins are accessed using maskable sets of I/O control registers; this allows the
selected combinations of GPIOs to be controlled with ease, regardless of how the allocation of GPIO pins has been
implemented in hardware.
The DSP GPIO function is selected by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in Section 4.15.1.
A full description of the DSP GPIO function is provided in Section 4.5.4.
Note that, if GPn_FN is set to 0x002, the respective pin direction (input or output) is set according to the DSP GPIO
configuration for that pin—the GPn_DIR control bit has no effect in this case.
4.15.7 Interrupt (IRQ) Status Output—GPn_FN = 0x003, 0x004
The CS47L90 has an interrupt controller, which can be used to indicate when any selected interrupt events occur.
Individual interrupts may be masked in order to configure the interrupt as required. See Section 4.16 for a full definition of
all supported interrupt events.
The interrupt controller supports two separate interrupt request (IRQ) outputs. The IRQ1 or IRQ2 status may be output
directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in Section 4.15.1.
Note that the IRQ1 status is output on the IRQ pin at all times.
4.15.8 Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) Clock Output—GPn_FN = 0x010, 0x011, 0x013
Clock outputs derived from the FLLs may be output on a GPIO pin. The GPIO output from each FLLn (FLL1, FLL2, or FLL_
AO) is controlled by the respective FLLn_GPCLK_DIV and FLLn_GPCLK_ENA fields, as described in Table 4-102.
It is recommended to disable the clock output (FLLn_GPCLK_ENA = 0) before making any change to the respective
FLLn_GPCLK_DIV field.
Note that FLLn_GPCLK_DIV and FLLn_GPCLK_ENA affect the GPIO outputs only; they do not affect the FLL frequency.
The maximum output frequency supported for GPIO output is noted in Table 3-10.
The FLL clock outputs may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in
Section 4.15.1.
See Section 4.17 for details of the CS47L90 system clocking and how to configure the FLLs.

4.15.9 Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL) Status Output—GPn_FN = 0x018, 0x019, 0x01B
The CS47L90 provides FLL status flags, which may be used to control other events. The FLL lock signals indicate whether
FLL lock has been achieved. See Section 4.17.8 and Section 4.17.9 for details of the FLLs.
The FLL lock signals may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in
Section 4.15.1.
The FLL lock signals are inputs to the interrupt controller circuit. An interrupt event is triggered on the rising edge of these
signals. The associated interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or used to control the IRQ signal.
See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt event handling.
4.15.10 OPCLK and OPCLK_ASYNC Clock Output—GPn_FN = 0x040, 0x041
A clock output (OPCLK) derived from SYSCLK can be output on a GPIO pin. The OPCLK frequency is controlled by
OPCLK_DIV and OPCLK_SEL. The OPCLK output is enabled by setting OPCLK_ENA, as described in Table 4-103.
A clock output (OPCLK_ASYNC) derived from ASYNCCLK can be output on a GPIO pin. The OPCLK_ASYNC frequency
is controlled by OPCLK_ASYNC_DIV and OPCLK_ASYNC_SEL. The OPCLK_ASYNC output is enabled by setting
OPCLK_ASYNC_ENA.

It is recommended to disable the clock output (OPCLK_ENA = 0 or OPCLK_ASYNC_ENA = 0) before making any change
to the respective OPCLK_DIV, OPCLK_SEL, OPCLK_ASYNC_DIV, or OPCLK_ASYNC_SEL fields.
The OPCLK or OPCLK_ASYNC clock can be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as
described in Section 4.15.1.
Note that the OPCLK source frequency cannot be higher than the SYSCLK frequency. The OPCLK_ASYNC source
frequency cannot be higher than the ASYNCCLK frequency. The maximum output frequency supported for GPIO output
is noted in Table 3-10.
See Section 4.17 for details of the system clocks (SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK).

The PWM outputs may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in
Section 4.15.1.
See Section 4.3.12 for details of how to configure the PWM signal generators.
4.15.12 S/PDIF Audio Output—GPn_FN = 0x04C
The CS47L90 incorporates an IEC-60958-3–compatible S/PDIF transmitter, which can be selected as a GPIO output. The
S/PDIF transmitter supports stereo audio channels and allows full control over the S/PDIF validity bits and channel status
information.
The S/PDIF signal may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in
Section 4.15.1.
See Section 4.3.8 for details of how to configure the S/PDIF output generator.
4.15.13 ASRC Lock Status Output—GPn_FN = 0x088, 0x089, 0x08A, 0x08B
The CS47L90 provides ASRC status flags, which may be used to control other events. The ASRC-lock signals indicate
whether ASRC lock has been achieved. See Section 4.3.15 for details of the ASRCs.
The ASRC lock signals may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as described in
Section 4.15.1.
The ASRC lock signals are inputs to the interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered on the rising and falling
edges of the ASRC lock signals. The associated interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or used
to control the IRQ signal. See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt event handling.
4.15.14 General-Purpose Timer Status Output—GPn_FN = 0x140–0x147
The general-purpose timers can count up or down, and support continuous or single count modes. Status outputs
indicating the progress of these timers are provided. See Section 4.5.3 for details of the general-purpose timers.
A logic signal from the general-purpose timers may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields
as described in Section 4.15.1. This logic signal is pulsed high whenever the respective timer reaches its final count value.
The general-purpose timers also provide inputs to the interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered whenever the
respective timer reaches its final count value. The associated interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any
time or used to control the IRQ signal. See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt event handling.
4.15.15 Event Logger FIFO Buffer Status Output—GPn_FN = 0x150–0x157
The event loggers are each provided with a 16-stage FIFO buffer, in which any detected events (signal transitions) are
recorded. Status outputs for each FIFO buffer are provided. See Section 4.5.2 for details of the event loggers.
A logic signal from the event loggers may be output directly on a GPIO pin by setting the respective GPIO fields as
described in Section 4.15.1. This logic signal is set high whenever the FIFO not-empty condition is true.
The event loggers also provide inputs to the interrupt control circuit. An interrupt event is triggered whenever the respective
FIFO condition occurs. The associated interrupt bits are latched once set; they can be polled at any time or used to control
the IRQ signal. See Section 4.16 for details of the interrupt event handling.
4.15.16 General-Purpose Switch
The CS47L90 provides two general-purpose switches, which can be used as controllable analog switches for external
functions. The switches support bidirectional analog operation, offering flexibility in the potential circuit applications. Refer
to Table 3-2 and Table 3-10 for further details. Note that this feature is entirely independent of the GPIOn pins.
    •  The GP1 switch is implemented between the GPSW1P and GPSW1N pins; it is configured using SW1_MODE.
    •  The GP2 switch is implemented between the GPSW2P and GPSW2N pins; it is configured using SW2_MODE.

The SWn_MODE fields allow the switches to be disabled, enabled, or synchronized to the MICDET clamp status, as
described in Table 4-104.
The switches can be used in conjunction with the MICDET clamp function to suppress pops and clicks associated with
jack insertion and removal. An example circuit is shown in Fig. 4-58 within Section 4.13.2. Note that the MICDET clamp
function must also be configured appropriately when using this method of pop suppression.

4.16 Interrupts
The interrupt controller has multiple inputs. These include the jack detect and GPIO input pins, DSP_IRQn flags,
headphone/accessory detection, FLL/ASRC lock detection, and status flags from DSP peripheral functions. See
Table 4-105 and Table 4-106 for a full definition of the interrupt controller inputs. Any combination of these inputs can be
used to trigger an interrupt request event.
The interrupt controller supports two sets of interrupt registers. This allows two separate interrupt request (IRQ) outputs
to be generated, and for each IRQ to report a different set of input or status conditions.
For each interrupt request (IRQ1 and IRQ2) output, there is an interrupt register field associated with each interrupt input.
These fields are asserted whenever a logic edge is detected on the respective input. Some inputs are triggered on rising
edges only; some are triggered on both edges. Separate rising and falling interrupt bits are provided for the JD1 and JD2
signals. The interrupt register fields for IRQ1 are described in Table 4-105. The interrupt register fields for IRQ2 are
described in Table 4-106. The interrupt flags can be polled at any time or in response to the interrupt request output being
signaled via the IRQ pin or a GPIO pin.
All interrupts are edge triggered, as noted above. Many are triggered on both the rising and falling edges and, therefore,
the interrupt bits cannot indicate which edge has been detected. The raw status fields described in Table 4-105 and
Table 4-106 indicate the current value of the corresponding inputs to the interrupt controller. Note that the raw status bits
associated with IRQ1 and IRQ2 provide the same information. The status of any GPIO (or DSP GPIO) inputs can also be
read using the GPIO (or DSP GPIO) control fields, as described in Table 4-99 and Table 4-41.
Individual mask bits can enable or disable different functions from the interrupt controller. The mask bits are described in
Table 4-105 (for IRQ1) and Table 4-106 (for IRQ2). Note that a masked interrupt input does not assert the corresponding
interrupt register field and does not cause the associated interrupt request output to be asserted.
The interrupt request outputs represent the logical OR of the associated interrupt registers. IRQ1 is derived from the x_
EINT1 registers; IRQ2 is derived from the x_EINT2 registers. The interrupt register fields are latching fields and, once they
are set, they are not reset until a 1 is written to the respective bits. The interrupt request outputs are not reset until each
of the associated interrupts has been reset.
A debounce circuit can be enabled on any GPIO input, to avoid false event triggers. This is enabled on each pin using the
fields described in Table 4-99. The GPIO debounce circuit uses the 32-kHz clock, which must be enabled whenever the
GPIO debounce function is required.
The IRQ outputs can be globally masked using the IM_IRQ1 and IM_IRQ2 bits. When not masked, the IRQ status can be

The IRQ1 output is provided externally on the IRQ pin. Under default conditions, this output is active low. The polarity can
be inverted using IRQ_POL. The IRQ output can be either CMOS driven or open drain; this is selected using the IRQ_
OP_CFG bit. The IRQ output is referenced to the DBVDD1 power domain.
The IRQ2 status can be used to trigger DSP firmware execution; see Section 4.4. This allows the DSP firmware execution
to be linked to external events (e.g., jack detection, or GPIO input), or to any of the status conditions flagged by the
interrupt registers.
The IRQ1 and IRQ2 signals may be output on a GPIO pin; see Section 4.15.
The CS47L90 interrupt controller circuit is shown in Fig. 4-62. (Note that not all interrupt inputs are shown.) The control
fields associated with IRQ1 and IRQ2 are described in Table 4-105 and Table 4-106 respectively. The global interrupt
mask bits, status bits, and output configuration fields are described Table 4-107.
Note that, under default register conditions, the boot done status is the only unmasked interrupt source; a falling edge on
the IRQ pin indicates completion of the boot sequence.

4.17 Clocking and Sample Rates
The CS47L90 requires a clock reference for its internal functions and also for the input (ADC) paths, output (DAC) paths,
and digital audio interfaces. Under typical clocking configurations, all commonly used audio sample rates can be derived
directly from the external reference; for additional flexibility, the CS47L90 incorporates three FLL circuits to perform
frequency conversion and filtering.
External clock signals may be connected via MCLK1 and MCLK2. These inputs are referenced to the DBVDD1 and
DBVDD2 power domains respectively. In AIF Slave Modes, the BCLK signals may be used as a reference for the system
clocks. The SLIMbus interface can provide the clock reference, when used as the input to one of the FLLs. To avoid
audible glitches, all clock configurations must be set up before enabling playback.
4.17.1 System Clocking Overview
The CS47L90 supports three primary clock domains—SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, and DSPCLK.
The SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK clock domains are the reference clocks for all the audio signal paths on the CS47L90. Up
to five different sample rates may be independently selected for specific audio interfaces and other input/output signal
paths; each selected sample rate must be synchronized either to SYSCLK or to ASYNCCLK, as described in
Section 4.17.2.
The SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK clock domains are independent (i.e., not synchronized). Stereo full-duplex sample-rate
conversion is supported, allowing asynchronous audio data to be mixed and to be routed between independent interfaces.
See Section 4.3 for further details.

                                                                                                              CS47L90
                                                                                          4.17 Clocking and Sample Rates
The DSPCLK clock domain is the reference clock for the programmable DSP cores on the CS47L90. A wide range of
DSPCLK frequencies can be supported, and a programmable clock divider is provided for each DSP core, allowing the
DSP clocking (and power consumption) to be optimized according to the applicable processing requirements of each DSP
core. See Section 4.3 for further details.
Note that there is no requirement for DSPCLK to be synchronized to SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK. The DSPCLK controls the
software execution in the DSP cores; audio outputs from the DSP cores are synchronized either to SYSCLK or
ASYNCCLK, regardless of the applicable DSPCLK rate.
Excluding the DSP cores, each subsystem within the CS47L90 digital core is clocked at a dynamically controlled rate,
limited by the SYSCLK (or ASYNCCLK) frequency, as applicable. For maximum signal mixing and processing capacity, it
is recommended that the highest possible SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK frequencies are configured.
The DSP cores are clocked at the DSPCLK rate (or supported divisions of the DSPCLK frequency). The DSPCLK
configuration must ensure that sufficient clock cycles are available for the processing requirements of each DSP core. The
requirements vary, according to the particular software that is in use.
4.17.2 Sample-Rate Control
The CS47L90 supports two independent clock domains for the audio signal paths, referenced to SYSCLK and ASYNCCLK
respectively.
Different sample rates may be selected for each of the audio interfaces (AIF1, AIF2, AIF3, AIF4, SLIMbus), and for the
input (ADC) and output (DAC) paths. Each of these must be referenced either to SYSCLK or to ASYNCCLK. (Note that
the SLIMbus interface supports multiple sample rates, selected independently for each input or output channel.)
Up to three different sample rates can be selected using SAMPLE_RATE_1, SAMPLE_RATE_2 and SAMPLE_RATE_3.
These must each be numerically related to each other and to the SYSCLK frequency (further details of these requirements
are provided in Table 4-108 and the accompanying text).
The remaining two sample rates can be selected using ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_1 and ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_2.
These sample rates must be numerically related to each other and to the ASYNCCLK frequency (further details of these
requirements are provided in Table 4-109 and the accompanying text),
Each of the audio interfaces, input paths, and output paths is associated with one of the sample rates selected by the
SAMPLE_RATE_n or ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n fields.
Note that if any two interfaces are operating at the same sample rate, but are not synchronized, one of these must be
referenced to the ASYNCCLK domain, and the other to the SYSCLK domain.
When any of the SAMPLE_RATE_n or ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n fields is written to, the activation of the new setting is
automatically synchronized by the CS47L90 to ensure continuity of all active signal paths. The SAMPLE_RATE_n_STS
and ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n_STS bits provide indication of the sample rate selections that have been implemented.
The following restrictions must be observed regarding the sample-rate control configuration:
    •  The input (ADC/DMIC) and output (DAC) signal paths must always be associated with the SYSCLK clocking
       domain.
    •  All external clock references (MCLK input or Slave Mode AIF input) must be within 1% of the applicable register
       field settings.
    •  The input (ADC/DMIC) sample rates are valid from 8–192 kHz. If 384- or 768-kHz DMIC clock rate is selected, the
       supported sample rate for the respective paths is restricted as described in Table 4-1. The sample rate for the input
       signal paths can be set globally, or can be configured independently for each input channel—see Section 4.2.5.
    •  The S/PDIF sample rate is valid from 32–192 kHz.
    •  The asynchronous sample-rate converters (ASRCs) support sample rates 8–192 kHz. For each ASRC, the ratio of
       the two sample rates must not exceed 6.
    •  The isochronous sample-rate converters (ISRCs) support sample rates 8–192 kHz. For each ISRC, the higher
       sample rate must be an integer multiple of the lower rate.

                                                                                        4.17 Clocking and Sample Rates
4.17.3 Automatic Sample-Rate Detection
The CS47L90 supports automatic sample-rate detection on the digital audio interfaces (AIF1–AIF4). Note that this is only
possible when the respective interface is operating in Slave Mode (i.e., when LRCLK and BCLK are inputs to the
CS47L90).
Automatic sample-rate detection is enabled by setting RATE_EST_ENA. The LRCLK input pin selected for sample-rate
detection is set using LRCLK_SRC.
As many as four audio sample rates can be configured for automatic detection; these sample rates are selected using the
SAMPLE_RATE_DETECT_n fields. Note that the function only detects sample rates that match one of the SAMPLE_
RATE_DETECT_n fields.
If one of the selected audio sample rates is detected on the selected LRCLK input, the control-write sequencer is triggered.
A unique sequence of actions may be programmed for each detected sample rate. Note that the applicable control
sequences must be programmed by the user for each detection outcome; see Section 4.19.
The TRIG_ON_STARTUP bit controls whether the sample-rate detection circuit responds to the initial detection of the
applicable interface (i.e., when the AIFn interface starts up).
    •   If TRIG_ON_STARTUP = 0, the detection circuit only responds (i.e., trigger the control-write sequencer) to a
        change in the detected sample rate—the initial sample-rate detection is ignored. (Note that the initial sample-rate
        detection is the first detection of a sample rate that matches one of the SAMPLE_RATE_DETECT_n fields.)
    •   If TRIG_ON_STARTUP = 1, the detection circuit triggers the control-write sequencer whenever a selected sample
        rate is detected, including when the AIF interface starts up, or when the sample-rate detection is first enabled.
As described above, setting TRIG_ON_STARTUP = 0 is designed to inhibit any response to the initial detection of a
sample rate that matches one of the SAMPLE_RATE_DETECT_n fields. Note that, if the LRCLK_SRC setting is changed,
or if the detection function is disabled and reenabled, a subsequent detection of a matching sample rate may trigger the
control-write sequencer, regardless of the TRIG_ON_STARTUP setting.
There are some restrictions to be observed regarding the automatic sample-rate detection configuration, as noted in the
following:
    •   The same sample rate must not be selected on more than one of the SAMPLE_RATE_DETECT_n fields.
    •   Sample rates 192 kHz and 176.4 kHz must not be selected concurrently.
    •   Sample rates 96 kHz and 88.2 kHz must not be selected concurrently.
The control registers associated with the automatic sample-rate detection function are described in Table 4-110.
4.17.4 System Clock Configuration
The system clocks (SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, and DSPCLK) may be provided directly from external inputs (MCLK, or Slave
Mode BCLK inputs). Alternatively, these clocks can be derived using the integrated FLLs, with MCLK, BCLK, LRCLK or
SLIMCLK as a reference. Each clock is configured independently, as described in the following sections.
The SYSCLK (and ASYNCCLK, when applicable) clocks must be configured and enabled before any audio path is
enabled. The DSPCLK clock must be configured and enabled, if running firmware applications on any of the DSP cores.
4.17.4.1 SYSCLK Configuration
The required SYSCLK frequency is dependent on the SAMPLE_RATE_n fields. Table 4-108 illustrates the valid SYSCLK
frequencies for every supported sample rate.
The SYSCLK frequency must be valid for all of the SAMPLE_RATE_n fields. It follows that all of the SAMPLE_RATE_n
fields must select numerically-related values, that is, all from the same group of sample rates as represented in
Table 4-108.

          Note: The SAMPLE_RATE_n fields must each be set to a value from the same group of sample rates, and from the same
          group as the SYSCLK frequency.
SYSCLK_SRC is used to select the SYSCLK source, as described in Table 4-110. The source may be MCLKn,
AIFnBCLK, or FLLn. If an FLL circuit is selected as the source, the relevant FLL must be enabled and configured, as
described in Section 4.17.8 and Section 4.17.9.
Note:     If FLL_AO is selected as SYSCLK source, two different clock frequencies are available—the loop frequency
          (45–50 MHz) or a higher frequency (loop frequency multiplied by 2). If either of these clocks is the SYSCLK
          source, the respective FLL must be enabled and configured. FLL_AO_FREQ must be configured for the
          applicable (loop) frequency.
SYSCLK_FREQ and SYSCLK_FRAC must be set according to the frequency of the selected SYSCLK source.
The SYSCLK-referenced circuits within the digital core are clocked at a dynamically controlled rate this is limited by the
SYSCLK frequency. For maximum signal mixing and processing capacity, the highest possible SYSCLK frequency should
be used.
The SAMPLE_RATE_n fields are set according to the sample rates that are required by one or more of the CS47L90 audio
interfaces. The CS47L90 supports sample rates ranging from 8–192 kHz.
The SYSCLK signal is enabled by setting SYSCLK_ENA. The applicable clock source (MCLKn, AIFnBCLK, or FLLn) must
be enabled before setting SYSCLK_ENA. This bit should be cleared before stopping or removing the applicable clock
source.
The CS47L90 supports seamless switching between clock sources. To change the SYSCLK configuration while SYSCLK
is enabled, the SYSCLK_FRAC, SYSCLK_FREQ, and SYSCLK_SRC fields must be updated together in one register
write operation. Note that, if changing the frequency only (not the source), SYSCLK_ENA should be cleared before the
clock frequency is updated. The current SYSCLK frequency and source can be read from the SYSCLK_FREQ_STS and
SYSCLK_SRC_STS fields respectively.
Note:     Changing SYSCLK source may cause audible glitches on the INn and OUTn signal paths. Accordingly, it is
          recommended to mute all INn and OUTn signal paths before changing SYSCLK source. All other signal paths on
          the CS47L90 are unaffected by on-the-fly switching of the SYSCLK source.
          To switch between different external clock sources without interruption to the INn and OUTn signal paths, one of
          the FLLs must be selected as the SYSCLK source and the clock reference selection must be implemented by
          reconfiguring the FLL. See Section 4.17.8.2 and Section 4.17.9.2 for FLL configuration requirements.
The CS47L90 performs automatic checks to confirm that the SYSCLK frequency is high enough to support the
commanded signal paths and processing functions. If the frequency is too low, an attempt to enable a signal path or
processing function fails. Note that active signal paths are not affected under such circumstances.
The SYSCLK frequency check provides input to the interrupt-control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event
if the frequency is not high enough to support the commanded functionality; see Section 4.16.

4.17.4.2 ASYNCCLK Configuration
The required ASYNCCLK frequency is dependent on the ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n fields. Table 4-109 illustrates the
valid ASYNCCLK frequencies for every supported sample rate.
Note that, if all the sample rates in the system are synchronized to SYSCLK, the ASYNCCLK should be disabled (see
Table 4-110). The associated register field values are not important in this case.

4.17.4.3 DSPCLK Configuration
The required DSPCLK frequency depends on the requirements of firmware loaded on the DSP cores. The DSP cores are
clocked at the DSPCLK rate or at supported divisions of the DSPCLK frequency; the DSPCLK configuration must ensure
that sufficient clock cycles are available for the processing requirements of each DSP core. The requirements vary,
according to the particular firmware that is in use.
A configurable clock divider is provided for each DSP core, allowing the DSP clocking (and power consumption) to be
optimized according to the applicable processing requirements of each DSP core; see Section 4.4 for details.
DSP_CLK_FREQ must be configured for the applicable DSPCLK frequency. This field is coded in LSB units of 1/64 MHz.
Note that, if the field coding cannot represent the DSPCLK frequency exactly, the DSPCLK frequency must be rounded
down in the DSP_CLK_FREQ field.
The suggested method for calculating DSP_CLK_FREQ is to multiply the DSPCLK frequency by 64, round down to the
nearest integer, and use the resulting integer as DSP_CLK_FREQ (LSB = 1).
DSP_CLK_SRC is used to select the DSPCLK source, as described in Table 4-110. The source may be MCLKn,
AIFnBCLK, or FLLn. If an FLL circuit is selected as the source, the relevant FLL must be enabled and configured, as
described in Section 4.17.8 and Section 4.17.9.
Note:     If FLL1 or FLL2 is selected as DSPCLK source, the DSPCLK frequency is FVCO × 1.5. See Section 4.17.8.
          If FLL_AO is selected as DSPCLK source, two different clock frequencies are available—the loop frequency
          (45–50 MHz) or a higher frequency (loop frequency multiplied by 3). If using either of these clocks as the
          DSPCLK source, the respective FLL must be enabled and configured. FLL_AO_FREQ must be configured for
          the applicable (loop) frequency.
The DSPCLK signal is enabled by setting DSP_CLK_ENA. The applicable clock source (MCLKn, AIFnBCLK, or FLLn)
must be enabled before setting DSP_CLK_ENA. This bit should be cleared when reconfiguring the clock sources.
The CS47L90 supports seamless switching between clock sources. To change the DSPCLK configuration while DSPCLK
is enabled, the DSP_CLK_FREQ field must be updated before DSP_CLK_SRC. The new configuration becomes effective
when the DSP_CLK_SRC field is written. Note that, if changing the frequency only (not the source), the DSP_CLK_ENA
bit should be cleared before the clock frequency is updated. The current DSPCLK frequency and source can be read from
the DSP_CLK_FREQ_STS and DSP_CLK_SRC_STS fields respectively.
In a typical application, DSPCLK and SYSCLK are derived from a single FLL source. Note that there is no requirement for
DSPCLK to be synchronized to SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK. The DSPCLK controls the software execution in the DSP cores;
audio outputs from the DSP cores are synchronized either to SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK, regardless of the applicable
DSPCLK rate.
Under specific conditions, the CS47L90 can provide clocking to the DSP cores when DSPCLK is disabled. This capability
is supported using the always-on FLL (FLL_AO), either in Free-Running Mode or locked to a valid clock reference. See
Section 4.4.3 for further details.
4.17.5 Miscellaneous Clock Controls
The CS47L90 incorporates a 32-kHz clock circuit, which is required for input signal debounce, microphone/accessory
detect, and for the Charge Pump 2 (CP2) circuits. The 32-kHz clock must be configured and enabled whenever any of
these features are in use.
The 32-kHz clock can be generated automatically from SYSCLK, or may be input directly as MCLK1 or MCLK2. The
32-kHz clock source is selected using CLK_32K_SRC. The 32-kHz clock is enabled by setting CLK_32K_ENA.
A clock output (OPCLK) derived from SYSCLK can be output on a GPIO pin. A clock output (OPCLK_ASYNC) derived
from ASYNCCLK can be output on a GPIO pin. See Section 4.15 for details on configuring a GPIO pin for these functions.
The CS47L90 provides integrated pull-down resistors on the MCLK1 and MCLK2 pins. This provides a flexible capability
for interfacing with other devices.
The clocking scheme for the CS47L90 is shown in Fig. 4-63.

In AIF Slave Modes, it is important to ensure that the applicable clock domain (SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK) is synchronized
with the associated external LRCLK. This can be achieved by selecting an MCLK input that is derived from the same
reference as the LRCLK, or can be achieved by selecting the external BCLK or LRCLK signal as a reference input to one
of the FLLs, as a source for SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK.
If the AIF clock domain is not synchronized with the LRCLK, clicks arising from dropped or repeated audio samples occur,
due to the inherent tolerances of multiple, asynchronous, system clocks. See Section 5.4 for further details on valid
clocking configurations.
4.17.6 BCLK and LRCLK Control
The digital audio interfaces (AIF1–AIF4) use BCLK and LRCLK signals for synchronization. In Master Mode, these are
output signals, generated by the CS47L90. In Slave Mode, these are input signals to the CS47L90. It is also possible to
support mixed master/slave operation.

The BCLK and LRCLK signals are controlled as shown in Fig. 4-64. See Section 4.8 for details of the associated control
fields.
Note that the BCLK and LRCLK signals are synchronized to SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK, depending upon the applicable clock
domain for the respective interface. See Section 4.3.14 for further details.

4.17.7 Control Interface Clocking
Register map access is possible with or without a system clock—there is no requirement for SYSCLK, or any other system
clock, to be enabled when accessing the register map. See Section 4.18 for details of control register access.
Timing specifications for each of the control interfaces are provided in Table 3-19–Table 3-21. In some applications,
additional system-wide constraints must be observed to ensure control interface limits are not exceeded. These
constraints need to be considered if any of the following conditions is true.

    •   SYSCLK is enabled and is < 22.5792 MHz
    •   Control-register access is scheduled at register address 0x8_0000 or above
    •   Control-register access is scheduled on more than one of the control interfaces simultaneously
The control interface limits vary depending on the system clock (SYSCLK or DSPCLK) configuration, the address of the
control register access, and on which control interfaces are being used.
Table 4-111 describes valid system conditions for accessing the codec registers (below 0x8_0000). The control interfaces
must operate within the limits represented by one of the permitted configurations shown, in accordance with the applicable
SYSCLK frequency.

Three integrated FLLs are provided to support the clocking requirements of the CS47L90. These can be configured
according to the available reference clocks and the application requirements. The reference clock may use a high
frequency (e.g., 12.288 MHz) or low frequency (e.g., 32.768 kHz). The FLL is tolerant of jitter and may be used to generate
a stable output clock from a less stable input reference.
There are two FLL implementations on the CS47L90:
    •    FLL1 and FLL2 incorporate two subsystems in each—the main loop and the synchronizer loop—providing an
         advanced capability to use more than one reference clock to achieve best performance. FLL1 and FLL2 are
         described in the following subsections.
    •    FLL_AO is low-power FLL that supports additional always-on capability to provide system clocking when other
         references are unavailable or disabled. FLL_AO is described in Section 4.17.9.
4.17.8.1 Overview
The FLL characteristics are summarized in Table 3-11. In normal operation, the FLL output is frequency locked to an input
clock reference. The FLL can be used to generate a free-running clock in the absence of any external reference, as
described in Section 4.17.8.7. Configurable spread-spectrum modulation can be applied to the FLL outputs, to control
electro-magnetic interference (EMI) effects.
Each FLL comprises two subsystems—the main loop and the synchronizer loop; these can be used together to maintain
best frequency accuracy and noise (jitter) performance across multiple use cases. The two-loop design enables the FLL
to synchronize effectively to an input clock that may be intermittent or noisy, while also achieving the performance benefits
of a stable clock reference that may be asynchronous to the audio data.

                                                                                                                 4.17 Clocking and Sample Rates
The main loop takes a constant and stable clock reference as its input. For best performance, a high-frequency (e.g.,
12.288 MHz) reference is recommended. The main FLL loop is free running without any clock reference if the input signal
is removed; it can also be configured to initiate an output in the absence of any reference signal.
The synchronizer loop takes a separate clock reference as its input. The synchronizer input may be intermittent (e.g.,
during voice calls only). The FLL uses the synchronizer input, when available, as the frequency reference. To achieve the
designed performance advantage, the synchronizer input must be synchronous with the audio data.
Note that, if only a single clock input reference is used, this must be configured as the main FLL input reference. The
synchronizer should be disabled in this case.
The synchronizer loop should only be used when the main loop clock reference is present. If the input reference to the
main FLL is intermittent, or may be interrupted unexpectedly, the synchronizer should be disabled.
4.17.8.2 FLL Enable
The FLL is enabled by setting FLLn_ENA (where n = 1 or 2 for the corresponding FLL). The FLL synchronizer is enabled
by setting FLLn_SYNC_ENA.
Note that the other FLL fields should be configured before enabling the FLL; the FLLn_ENA and FLLn_SYNC_ENA bits
should be set as the final step of the FLLn enable sequence.
The FLL supports configurable free-running operation, using the FLLn_FREERUN bits described in Section 4.17.8.7. Note
that, once the FLL output has been established, the FLL is always free running if the input reference clock is stopped,
regardless of the FLLn_FREERUN bits.
To disable the FLL while the input reference clock has stopped, FLLn_FREERUN must be set before clearing FLLn_ENA.
When changing FLL settings, it is recommended to disable the FLL by clearing the FLLn_ENA bit before updating the other
register fields. Some of the FLL configuration registers can be updated while the FLL is enabled, as described in
Section 4.17.8.4. As a general rule, however, it is recommended to configure the FLL (and FLL Synchronizer, if
applicable), before setting the corresponding x_ENA bits.
When changing the input reference frequency FREF, the FLL should be reset by clearing the FLLn_ENA bit before updating
the affected register fields. If reconfiguration of the input reference is required and continuous operation of the FLL must
be supported during the changeover, Free-Running Mode must be selected before updating the FLL configuration. A
minimum delay of 32s should be allowed between selecting Free-Running Mode and writing to the required FLL register
fields. The FLLn_FREERUN bit must remain set until after the FLL has been reconfigured.
The FLL configuration is shown in Fig. 4-65.

The procedure for configuring the FLL is described in the following subsections. Note that the configuration of the main
FLL path and the FLL synchronizer path are very similar. One or both paths must be configured, depending on the
application requirements:
     •  If a single clock input reference is used, only the main FLL path should be used.
     •  If the input reference to the main FLL is intermittent, or may be interrupted unexpectedly, only the main FLL path
        should be used.
     •  If two clock input references are used, the constant or low-noise clock is configured on the main FLL path and the
        high-accuracy clock is configured on the FLL synchronizer path. Note that the synchronizer input must be
        synchronous with the audio data.
The following description is applicable to FLL1 and FLL2. The associated control fields are described in Table 4-115 and
Table 4-116.
4.17.8.3 Input Frequency Control
The main input reference is selected using FLLn_REFCLK_SRC. The synchronizer input reference is selected using
FLLn_SYNCCLK_SRC. The available options in each case are MCLK1, MCLK2, SLIMCLK, AIFnBCLK, or AIFnLRCLK.
The SLIMCLK reference is controlled by an adaptive divider on the external SLIMCLK input. The divider automatically
adapts to the SLIMbus clock gear, to provide a constant reference frequency for the FLL—see Section 4.11.
The FLLn_REFCLK_DIV field controls a programmable divider on the main input reference. The FLLn_SYNCCLK_DIV
field controls a programmable divider on the synchronizer input reference. Each input can be divided by 1, 2, 4 or 8. The
divider should be configured to bring each reference down to 13.5 MHz or below. For best performance, it is recommended
that the highest possible frequency—within the 13.5 MHz limit—should be selected.
4.17.8.4 Output Frequency Control—Main Loop
The FLL output frequency, relative to the main input reference FREF, is a function of the following:
     •  The FLL oscillator frequency, FVCO
     •  The frequency ratio set by FLLn_FRATIO
     •  The real number represented by N.K. (N = integer; K = fractional portion)
The FVCO frequency must be in the range 90–104 MHz.
If the FLL is selected as SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK source, the respective FVCO frequency must be exactly 98.304 MHz (for
48 kHz–related sample rates) or 90.3168 MHz (for 44.1 kHz–related sample rates).
If the FLL is selected as DSPCLK source, the DSPCLK frequency is FVCO × 1.5. Note that the DSPCLK can be divided to
lower clocking rates for each individual DSP.
The FLL clock can be configured as a GPIO output; a programmable divider supports division ratios in the range 2 through
127, enabling a wide range of GPIO clock output frequencies.
Note:      The chosen FVCO frequency can be used to support multiple outputs simultaneously (e.g., SYSCLK, DSPCLK,
           and GPIO), as shown in Fig. 4-65.
The FLL oscillator frequency, FVCO is set according to the following equation:
             FVCO = (FREF × N.K × FLLn_FRATIO)
The value of N.K can thus be determined as follows:
             N.K = FVCO / (FLLn_FRATIO × FREF)
It is recommended to calculate N.K using an initial assumption of FLLn_FRATIO = 1. If N > 1023, FLLn_FRATIO should
be incremented until N < 1024.
Note that, in the above equations, the following interpretations are assumed:
     •  FREF is the input frequency, after division by FLLn_REFCLK_DIV, where applicable

                                                                                                   4.17 Clocking and Sample Rates
   •   FLLn_FRATIO is the FVCO clock ratio (1, 2, 3, … 16)
The value of N is held in FLLn_N.
The value of K is determined by the ratio FLLn_THETA / FLLn_LAMBDA. In fractional mode (FLLn_THETA > 0), the
FLLn_THETA and FLLn_LAMBDA fields can be derived as described in Section 4.17.8.6.
The FLLn_N, FLLn_THETA, and FLLn_LAMBDA fields are all coded as integers (LSB = 1).
The FLLn_CTRL_UPD bit controls the updating of the FLLn_N or FLLn_THETA fields:
   •   If the FLLn_N or FLLn_THETA fields are updated while the FLL is enabled (FLLn_ENA = 1), the new values are
       only effective when a 1 is written to FLLn_CTRL_UPD. This makes it possible to update the two fields
       simultaneously, without disabling the FLL.
       Note that, if the FLL is disabled (FLLn_ENA = 0), the FLLn_N and FLLn_THETA fields can be updated without
       writing to FLLn_CTRL_UPD.
The FLLn_GAIN and FLLn_PHASE_ENA fields should be set as shown in Table 4-113, depending on FREF, FLLn_
THETA, and whether the FLL synchronizer is enabled.
Note:     When writing to the FLLn_PHASE_ENA bit, take care not to change other nonzero bits that are configured at the
          same register address.

     Note: FREF is the input frequency, after division by FLLn_REFCLK_DIV, where applicable.
4.17.8.5 Output Frequency Control—Synchronizer Loop
A similar procedure applies for the derivation of the FLL synchronizer parameters—assuming that this function is used.
The FLLn_SYNC_FRATIO field selects the frequency division ratio of the FLL synchronizer input. The FLLn_GAIN and
FLLn_SYNC_DFSAT fields are used to optimize the FLL, according to the input frequency. These fields should be set as
described in Table 4-114.
Note:     The FLLn_SYNC_FRATIO coding differs from that of FLLn_FRATIO.

               Note: FSYNC is the synchronizer input frequency, after division by FLLn_SYNCCLK_DIV, where applicable.
The FLL oscillator frequency, FVCO, is the same frequency calculated as described in Section 4.17.8.4.
The value of N.K (Sync) can be determined as follows:
            N.K (Sync) = FVCO / (FLLn_SYNC_FRATIO × FSYNC)
Note that, in the above equation, the following interpretations are assumed:
   •   FSYNC is the synchronizer input frequency, after division by FLLn_SYNCCLK_DIV, where applicable
   •   FLLn_SYNC_FRATIO is the FVCO clock ratio (1, 2, 4, 8, or 16)

The value of N (Sync) is held in FLLn_SYNC_N.
The value of K (Sync) is determined by the ratio FLLn_SYNC_THETA / FLLn_SYNC_LAMBDA. See Section 4.17.8.6 to
derive the recommended settings for these fields.
The FLLn_SYNC_N, FLLn_SYNC_THETA, and FLLn_SYNC_LAMBDA fields are all coded as integers (LSB = 1).
4.17.8.6 Calculation of Theta and Lambda
In Fractional Mode (FLLn_THETA > 0), FLLn_THETA and FLLn_LAMBDA are calculated with the following steps:
     1. Calculate GCD(FLL) using the Greatest Common Denominator function:
        GCD(FLL) = GCD(FLLn_FRATIO × FREF, FVCO),
        where GCD(x, y) is the greatest common denominator of x and y.
        FREF is the input frequency, after division by FLLn_REFCLK_DIV, where applicable.
     2. Calculate FLLn_THETA and FLLn_LAMBDA using the following equations:
        FLLn_THETA = (FVCO – (FLL_N × FLLn_FRATIO × FREF)) / GCD(FLL)
        FLLn_LAMBDA = (FLLn_FRATIO × FREF) / GCD(FLL)
Note that the equivalent procedure is also used to derive FLLn_SYNC_THETA and FLLn_SYNC_LAMBDA from the
corresponding synchronizer parameters.
Note also that, in Fractional Mode, the values of FLLn_THETA and FLLn_LAMBDA must be coprime (i.e., not divisible by
any common integer). The calculation above ensures that the values are coprime.
The value of K must be less than 1 (i.e., FLLn_THETA must be less than FLLn_LAMBDA).
4.17.8.7 Free-Running FLL Mode
The FLL can generate a clock signal even if no external reference is available. This may be because the normal input
reference has been interrupted, or may be during a standby or start-up period when no initial reference clock is available.
Free-Running FLL Mode is enabled by setting FLLn_FREERUN. Note that FLLn_ENA must also be enabled in
Free-Running FLL Mode.
In Free-Running FLL Mode, the normal feedback mechanism of the FLL is halted and the FLL oscillates independently of
the external input references.
If the FLL was previously operating normally (with an input reference clock), the FLL output frequency remains unchanged
when Free-Running FLL Mode is enabled. The FLL output is independent of the input reference while operating with
FLLn_FREERUN = 1.
The main FLL loop always runs freely if the input reference clock is stopped (regardless of the FLLn_FREERUN setting).
If FLLn_FREERUN = 0, the FLL relocks to the input reference whenever it is available.
In Free-Running FLL Mode, (with FLLn_FREERUN = 1), the FLL integrator value (part of the feedback mechanism) can
be commanded directly using FLLn_FRC_INTEG_VAL. The integrator value in this field is applied to the FLL when a 1 is
written to FLLn_FRC_INTEG_UPD.
If the FLL is started up in Free-Running FLL Mode, (i.e., it was not previously running), the default value of FLLn_FRC_
INTEG_VAL is applied.
The FLL integrator value (part of the feedback mechanism) can be read from the FLLn_INTEG field; the value may be
stored for later use. Note that the value of FLLn_INTEG is only valid if FLLn_FREERUN = 1 and FLLn_INTEG_VALID = 1.
The FLL integrator setting does not ensure a specific output frequency for the FLL across all devices and operating
conditions; some level of variation applies.
The free-running FLL clock may be selected as the SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, or DSPCLK source, as shown in Fig. 4-63.

4.17.8.8 Spread-Spectrum FLL Control
The CS47L90 can apply modulation to the FLL outputs, using spread-spectrum techniques. This can be used to control
the EMI characteristics of the circuits that are clocked via the FLLs.
Each FLL can be configured for triangle modulation, zero mean frequency modulation (ZMFM), or dither. The amplitude
and frequency parameters of the spread spectrum functions is also programmable, using the fields described in
Section 4.17.8.9.
4.17.8.9 FLL Control Registers
The FLL1 control registers are described in Table 4-115.
Example settings for a variety of reference frequencies and output frequencies are shown in Section 4.17.8.12.

4.17.8.10 FLL Interrupts and GPIO Output
For each FLL, the CS47L90 provides an FLL lock signal, which indicates whether FLL lock has been achieved (i.e., the
FLL is locked to the input reference signal).
The FLL lock signals are inputs to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event; see
Section 4.16.
The FLL lock signal can be output directly on a GPIO pin as an external indication of the FLL status. See Section 4.15 to
configure a GPIO pin for these functions.
Clock output signals derived from the FLL can be output on a GPIO pin. See Section 4.15 to configure a GPIO pin for this
function.
The FLL1/FLL2 configuration is shown in Fig. 4-65.
4.17.8.11 Example FLL Calculation
The following example illustrates how to derive the FLL1 register fields to generate an oscillator frequency (FVCO) of
98.304 MHz from a 12.000-MHz reference clock (FREF). This is suitable for generating SYSCLK at 98.304 MHz and/or
DSPCLK at 147.456 MHz.
    1. Set FLL1_REFCLK_DIV to generate FREF  13.5 MHz:
        FLL1_REFCLK_DIV = 00 (divide by 1)
    2. Calculate N.K as given by N.K = FVCO / (FLL1_FRATIO × FREF). Assume FLL1_FRATIO = 0x0 (divide by 1).
        N.K = 98304000 / (1 × 12000000) = 8.192
    3. Confirm that the calculated value of N is less than 1024.
    4. Determine FLL1_N from the integer portion of N.K:
        FLL1_N = 8 (0x008)
    5. Determine GCD(FLL), as given by GCD(FLL) = GCD(FLL1_FRATIO × FREF, FVCO):
        GCD(FLL) = GCD(1 × 12000000, 98304000) = 96000
    6. Determine FLL1_THETA, as given by FLL1_THETA = (FVCO – (FLL1_N × FLL1_FRATIO × FREF)) / GCD(FLL):
        FLL1_THETA = (98304000 – (8 × 1 × 12000000)) / 96000
        FLL1_THETA = 24 (0x0018)
    7. Determine FLL1_LAMBDA, as given by FLL1_LAMBDA = (FLL1_FRATIO x FREF) / GCD(FLL):
        FLL1_LAMBDA = (1 × 12000000) / 96000
        FLL1_LAMBDA = 125 (0x007D)
    8. Determine FLL1_GAIN and FLL1_PHASE_ENA as specified in Section 4.17.8.4:
        FLL1_GAIN = 0x5
        FLL1_PHASE_ENA = 1

4.17.9 Frequency-Locked Loop (FLL_AO)
Three integrated FLLs are provided to support the clocking requirements of the CS47L90. These can be configured
according to the available reference clocks and the application requirements. The reference clock may use a high
frequency (e.g., 12.288 MHz) or low frequency (e.g., 32.768 kHz). The FLL is tolerant of jitter and may be used to generate
a stable output clock from a less stable input reference.
There are two FLL implementations on the CS47L90:
     •  FLL1 and FLL2 provide an advanced capability to use more than one reference clock to achieve best performance.
        See Section 4.17.8.
     •  FLL_AO is low-power FLL that supports additional always-on capability to provide system clocking when other
        references are unavailable or disabled. FLL_AO is described in the following subsections.
4.17.9.1 Overview
The FLL_AO characteristics are summarized in Table 3-11. In normal operation, the FLL output is frequency-locked to an
input clock reference. The FLL can also be used to generate a free-running clock in the absence of any external reference,
as described in Section 4.17.9.5. Configurable dither modulation can be applied to the FLL_AO output, to control EMI
effects.
FLL_AO is a low-power FLL that can be configured as the source for SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, or DSPCLK system clocks.
It also supports always-on functions—it can be used to provide clocking for the DSP cores if DSPCLK is not enabled (e.g.,
for always-on DSP applications). See Section 4.4.3.4 to configure FLL_AO for always-on DSP operation.
The default FLL_AO settings are configured to provide a 49.152-MHz output, without any input reference required. The
FLL_AO can be used in its default settings or can be reconfigured for different input/output frequencies. The FLL_AO
control registers must always hold valid settings—either enabled and locked to an input reference clock or configured in
FLL Hold Mode.
FLL_AO takes a constant and stable clock reference as its input. Under typical application conditions, a low-frequency
(e.g., 32.768 kHz) reference is used. FLL_AO is free running without any clock reference if the input signal is removed; it
can also initiate an output in the absence of any reference signal.
4.17.9.2 FLL Enable
FLL_AO is enabled by setting FLL_AO_ENA. In normal operation, the FLL_AO output is frequency locked to the selected
input reference.
FLL_AO supports free-running operation in FLL Hold Mode, using the FLL_AO_HOLD bit described in Section 4.17.9.5.
If the FLL is enabled and FLL Hold Mode is selected, the configured output frequency is maintained without any input
reference required. Note that, once the FLL output has been established, FLL_AO always runs freely if the input reference
clock is stopped, regardless of the FLL_AO_HOLD bit.
To disable FLL_AO, FLL_AO_HOLD must be set before clearing FLL_AO_ENA. FLL_AO_HOLD must always be set if
the FLL is disabled; this holds the oscillator loop-configuration settings, in readiness for always-on system requirements.
FLL_AO_HOLD should remain set when enabling FLL_AO. If normal (input-reference locked) FLL operation is required,
FLL_AO_HOLD should be cleared after FLL_AO_ENA has been set.
When changing FLL_AO settings, FLL_AO_HOLD must be set before writing to the configuration registers. FLL_AO_
HOLD must not be cleared until after the new register values have been written. Note that, if the FLL is disabled, the FLL_
AO_HOLD bit must remain set until after FLL_AO_ENA has been set.
Under default conditions, FLL_AO is preconfigured to generate 49.152-MHz output, without any input reference required.
Setting FLL_AO_ENA without changing any other control bits enables this reference clock output, which may be selected
as SYSCLK, ASYNCCLK, or DSPCLK source, as shown in Fig. 4-63.
The FLL_AO configuration is shown in Fig. 4-66.

                                               Figure 4-66. FLL_AO Configuration
The procedure for configuring FLL_AO is described in the following subsections. The associated register control fields are
described in Table 4-119.
4.17.9.3 Input Frequency Control
The main input reference is selected using FLL_AO_REFCLK_SRC. The available options in each case are MCLK1,
MCLK2, SLIMCLK, AIFnBCLK, or AIFnLRCLK.
The SLIMCLK reference is controlled by an adaptive divider on the external SLIMCLK input. The divider automatically
adapts to the SLIMbus clock gear, to provide a constant reference frequency for the FLL; see Section 4.11.
The FLL_AO reference clock provides input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event
when the input reference is stopped; see Section 4.16.
4.17.9.4 Output Frequency Control
If FLL_AO is selected as SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK source, the associated multiplexer can select the FLL_AO oscillator
frequency (equal to FNCO) or a multiplied frequency (equal to FNCO x 2). For hi-fi audio use, FNCO must be exactly
49.152 MHz for 48 kHz–related sample rates or 45.1584 MHz for 44.1 kHz–related sample rates.
If FLL_AO is selected as DSPCLK source, the associated multiplexer can select the basic frequency (equal to FNCO) or a
multiplied frequency (equal to FNCO x 3). Note that the DSPCLK can be further divided for each DSP.
If FLL_AO is selected as a GPIO output, a programmable divider supports division ratios in the range 1 through 127,
enabling a wide range of GPIO clock output frequencies.
Note:     The chosen FNCO frequency can be used to support multiple outputs simultaneously (e.g., SYSCLK and
          DSPCLK); each FLL clock output path is controlled by a separate divider function, as shown in Fig. 4-66.
4.17.9.5 FLL Hold Mode
FLL Hold Mode enables the FLL to generate a clock signal even if no external reference clock is available, such as when
the normal input reference has been interrupted during a standby or start-up period. FLL Hold Mode is selected by setting
FLL_AO_HOLD.
    •  If the FLL is enabled and FLL Hold Mode is selected, the normal feedback mechanism of the FLL is halted and the
       FLL oscillates independently of the external input references—the FLL output frequency remains unchanged if FLL
       Hold Mode is enabled.
    •  If the FLL is enabled and the input reference clock is stopped, the loop always runs freely, regardless of the FLL_
       AO_HOLD setting. If FLL_AO_HOLD = 0, the FLL relocks to the input reference whenever it is available.

    •   If the FLL is disabled and FLL Hold Mode is selected, the latest oscillator loop configuration is held for later use.
        Note that this is the default condition of FLL_AO: preconfigured to generate 49.152-MHz output with no input
        reference required.
Note:      For specified CS47L90 functionality, FLL_AO_HOLD must be set before disabling the FLL and must always be
           set if the FLL is disabled.
4.17.9.6 FLL Control Registers
The FLL_AO control registers are described in Table 4-119.
Example settings for a variety of reference frequencies and output frequencies are shown in Section 4.17.9.8.

                                                    setting is maintained. This bit must always be set if FLL_AO is disabled.

4.17.9.7 FLL Interrupts and GPIO Output
For each FLL, the CS47L90 provides an FLL lock signal that indicates whether FLL lock has been achieved (i.e., the FLL
is locked to the input reference signal).
The FLL lock signals are inputs to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event; see
Section 4.16.
The FLL lock signal can be output directly on a GPIO pin as an external indication of the FLL status. See Section 4.15 to
configure a GPIO pin for these functions.
Clock output signals derived from the FLL can be output on a GPIO pin. See Section 4.15 to configure a GPIO pin for this
function.
The FLL_AO configuration is shown in Fig. 4-66.

Table 4-120 shows FLL settings for generating an oscillator frequency (FNCO) of 45.1854 MHz or 49.152 MHz from a
variety of low-frequency reference inputs.

Notes: For correct FLL_AO configuration, the register values must be written in the sequence shown. The sequence must
         be executed in full, regardless of the previous contents of the respective registers.
         The example FLL_AO settings assume MCLK2 is input source. The register 0x01D6 value should be amended,
         if a different input source is used. See Table 4-119 for the applicable register field definitions.
         To enable the FLL_AO output, the FLL_AO_HOLD and FLL_AO_ENA control bits must also be written. See
         Section 4.17.9.2 for further details.
4.18 Control Interface
The CS47L90 is controlled by read/write access to its control registers. Three independent control interfaces are provided,
giving flexible capability as described below. Note that the SLIMbus interface also supports read/write access to the
CS47L90 control registers; see Section 4.11.

The CS47L90 executes a boot sequence following power-on reset, hardware reset, software reset, or wake-up from Sleep
Mode. Note that control register writes should not be attempted until the boot sequence has completed. See Section 4.23
for further details.
Register access is possible on all of the control interfaces (including SLIMbus) simultaneously. Note that the control
interface function can be supported with or without system clocking—there is no requirement for SYSCLK, or any other
system clock, to be enabled when accessing the register map.
Timing specifications for each of the control interfaces are provided in Table 3-19–Table 3-21. In some applications,
additional system-wide constraints must be observed to ensure control interface limits are not exceeded. Full details of
these requirements are provided in Section 4.17.7. These constraints need to be considered if any of the following
conditions is true.
    •   SYSCLK is enabled and is < 22.5792 MHz
    •   Control-register access is scheduled at register address 0x80000 or above
    •   Control-register access is scheduled on more than one of the control interfaces simultaneously
A summary of the CS47L90 control interfaces is described in Table 4-121.

The CS47L90 provides integrated pull-down resistors on the CIF1MISO and CIF3MISO pins. This provides a flexible
capability for interfacing with other devices. The pull-downs are enabled using the CIF1MISO_PD and CIF3MISO_PD bits,
as described in Table 4-122.

A detailed description of the I2C and SPI interface modes is provided in the following sections.
4.18.1 Four-Wire (SPI) Control Mode
The SPI control interface mode is supported on CIF1 and CIF3 and uses the respective SS, SCLK, MOSI, and MISO pins.
In write operations (R/W = 0), the MOSI pin input is driven by the controlling device.
In read operations (R/W = 1), the MOSI pin is ignored following receipt of the valid register address.
If SS is asserted (Logic 0), the MISO output is actively driven when outputting data and is high impedance at other times.
If SS is not asserted, the MISO output is high impedance.
The high-impedance state of the MISO output allows the pin to be shared with other slaves. An internal pull-down resistor
can be enabled on the CIF1MISO pin, as described in Table 4-122.

Data transfers on CIF1 or CIF3 must use the applicable SPI message format, according to the register address space that
is being accessed:
    •  When accessing register addresses below R12288 (0x3000), the applicable SPI protocol comprises a 31-bit register
       address and 16-bit data words.
    •  When accessing register addresses from R12888 (0x3000) upwards, the applicable SPI protocol comprises a 31-bit
       register address and 32-bit data words.
    •  Note that, in all cases, the complete SPI message protocol also includes a read/write bit and a 16-bit padding phase
       (see Fig. 4-67 and Fig. 4-68 below).
Continuous read and write modes enable multiple register operations to be scheduled faster than is possible with single
register operations. In these modes, the CS47L90 automatically increments the register address at the end of each data
word, for as long as SS is held low and SCLK is toggled. Successive data words can be input/output every 16 (or 32) clock
cycles (depending on the applicable register address space).
The SPI protocol is shown in Fig. 4-67 and Fig. 4-68. Note that 16-bit data words are shown, but the equivalent protocol
also applies to 32-bit data words.

4.18.2 Two-Wire (I2C) Control Mode
The I2C control interface mode is supported on CIF2 only and uses the respective SCLK and SDA pins.
In I2C Mode, the CS47L90 is a slave device on the control interface; SCLK is a clock input, while SDA is a bidirectional
data pin. To allow arbitration of multiple slaves (and/or multiple masters) on the same interface, the CS47L90 transmits
Logic 1 by tristating the SDA pin, rather than pulling it high. An external pull-up resistor is required to pull the SDA line high
so that the Logic 1 can be recognized by the master.
In order to allow many devices to share a single two-wire control bus, every device on the bus has a unique 8-bit device
ID (this is not the same as the address of each register in the CS47L90).
The CS47L90 device ID is 0011_0100 (0x34). Note that the LSB of the device ID is the read/write bit; this bit is set to Logic
1 for read and Logic 0 for write.

The CS47L90 operates as a slave device only. The controller indicates the start of data transfer with a high-to-low
transition on SDA while SCLK remains high. This indicates that a device ID and subsequent address/data bytes follow.
The CS47L90 responds to the start condition and shifts in the next 8 bits on SDA (8-bit device ID, including read/write bit,
MSB first). If the device ID received matches the device ID of the CS47L90, the CS47L90 responds by pulling SDA low
on the next clock pulse (ACK). If the device ID is not recognized or the R/W bit is set incorrectly, the CS47L90 returns to
the idle condition and waits for a new start condition.
If the device ID matches the device ID of the CS47L90, the data transfer continues. The controller indicates the end of
data transfer with a low-to-high transition on SDA while SCLK remains high. After receiving a complete address and data
sequence the CS47L90 returns to the idle state and waits for another start condition. If a start or stop condition is detected
out of sequence at any point during data transfer (i.e., SDA changes while SCLK is high), the device returns to the idle
condition.
Data transfers on CIF2 must use the applicable I2C message format, according to the register address space that is being

     •  When accessing register addresses below R12288 (0x3000), the applicable I2C protocol comprises a 32-bit register
        address and 16-bit data words.
     •  When accessing register addresses from R12888 (0x3000) upwards, the applicable I2C protocol comprises a 32-bit
        register address and 32-bit data words.
     •  Note that, in all cases, the complete I2C message protocol also includes a device ID, a read/write bit, and other
        signaling bits (see Fig. 4-69 and Fig. 4-70).
The CS47L90 supports the following read and write operations:
     •  Single write
     •  Single read
     •  Multiple write
     •  Multiple read
Continuous (multiple) read and write modes allow register operations to be scheduled faster than is possible with single
register operations. In these modes, the CS47L90 automatically increments the register address after each data word.
Successive data words can be input/output every 2 (or 4) data bytes, depending on the applicable register address space.
The I2C protocol for a single, 16-bit register write operation is shown in Fig. 4-69.

4.19 Control-Write Sequencer
The control-write sequencer is a programmable unit that forms part of the CS47L90 control interface logic. It provides the
ability to perform a sequence of register-write operations with the minimum of demands on the host processor—the
sequence may be initiated by a single operation from the host processor and then left to execute independently.
Default sequences for pop-suppressed start-up and shutdown of each headphone/earpiece output driver are provided
(these are scheduled automatically when the respective output paths are enabled or disabled). Other control sequences
can be programmed, and may be associated with sample-rate detection, DRC, MICDET clamp, or event logger status;
these sequences are automatically scheduled whenever a corresponding event is detected.
When a sequence is initiated, the sequencer performs a series of predefined register writes. The start index of a control
sequence within the sequencer’s memory may be commanded directly by the host processor. The applicable start index
for each of the sequences associated with sample-rate detection, DRC, or MICDET clamp, or event logger status is held
in a user-programmed control register.
The control-write sequencer may be triggered by a number of different events. Multiple sequences are queued if
necessary, and each is scheduled in turn.
The control-write sequencer can be supported with or without system clocking—there is no requirement for SYSCLK or for
any other system clock to be enabled when using the control-write sequencer. The timing accuracy of the sequencer
operation is improved when SYSCLK is present, but the general functionality is supported with or without SYSCLK.
4.19.1 Initiating a Sequence
The fields associated with running the control-write sequencer are described in Table 4-124.
The CS47L90 provides 16 general-purpose trigger bits for the write sequencer to allow easy triggering of the associated
control sequences. Writing 1 to the trigger bit initiates a control sequence, starting at the respective index position within
the control-write sequencer memory.

                                                                                                                               CS47L90
                                                                                                         4.19 Control-Write Sequencer
The WSEQ_TRG1_INDEX field defines the sequencer start index corresponding to the WSEQ_TRG1 trigger control bit.
Equivalent start index fields are provided for each trigger control bit, as described in Table 4-124. Note that a sequencer
start index of 0x1FF causes the respective sequence to be aborted.
The general-purpose control sequences are undefined following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode
transition. The general-purpose control sequences must be reconfigured by the host processor following any of these
events. Note that all control sequences are maintained in the sequencer memory through software reset.
The write sequencer can also be commanded using control bits in register R22 (0x16). In this case, the write sequencer
is enabled using the WSEQ_ENA bit and the index location of the first command in the sequence is held in the WSEQ_
START_INDEX field. Writing 1 to the WSEQ_START bit commands the sequencer to execute a control sequence, starting
at the specified index position. Note that, if the sequencer is already running, the WSEQ_START command is queued and
executed when the sequencer becomes available.
Note:    The mechanism for queuing multiple sequence requests has limitations when the WSEQ_START bit is used to
         trigger the write sequencer. If a sequence is initiated using the WSEQ_START bit, no other control sequences
         should be triggered until the sequence completes. The WSEQ_BUSY bit (described in Table 4-130) provides an
         indication of the sequencer status and can be used to confirm the sequence has completed.
         Multiple control sequences triggered by any other method are queued if necessary, and scheduled in turn.
The write sequencer can be interrupted by writing 1 to the WSEQ_ABORT bit. Note that this command only aborts a
sequence that is currently running; if other sequence commands are pending and not yet started, these sequences are
not aborted by writing to the WSEQ_ABORT bit.
The write sequencer stores up to 508 register-write commands. These are defined in registers R12288 (0x3000) through
R13302 (0x33F6). See Table 4-131 for a description of these registers.

4.19.2 Automatic Sample-Rate Detection Sequences
The CS47L90 supports automatic sample-rate detection on the digital audio interfaces (AIF1–AIF4) when operating in AIF
Slave Mode. Automatic sample-rate detection is enabled by setting RATE_EST_ENA—see Table 4-110.
As many as four audio sample rates can be configured for automatic detection; these sample rates are selected using the
SAMPLE_RATE_DETECT_n fields. If a selected audio sample rate is detected, the control-write sequencer is triggered.
The applicable start index location within the sequencer memory is separately configurable for each detected sample rate.
The WSEQ_SAMPLE_RATE_DETECT_A_INDEX field defines the sequencer start index corresponding to the SAMPLE_
RATE_DETECT_A sample rate. Equivalent start index fields are defined for the other sample rates, as described in
Table 4-125.
Note that a sequencer start index of 0x1FF causes the respective sequence to be aborted.
The automatic sample-rate detection control sequences are undefined following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a
Sleep Mode transition. The automatic sample-rate detection control sequences must be reconfigured by the host
processor following any of these events. Note that all control sequences are maintained in the sequencer memory through
software reset.
See Section 4.17 for further details of the automatic sample-rate detection function.

4.19.3 DRC Signal-Detect Sequences
The DRC function within the CS47L90 digital core provides a configurable signal-detect function. This allows the signal
level at the DRC input to be monitored and used to trigger other events.
The DRC signal-detect functions are enabled and configured using the fields described in Table 4-17 and Table 4-17 for
DRC1 and DRC2 respectively.
A control-write sequence can be associated with a rising edge and/or a falling edge of the DRC1 signal-detect output. This
is enabled by setting DRC1_WSEQ_SIG_DET_ENA, as described in Table 4-17.
Note that signal detection is supported on DRC1 and DRC2, but the triggering of the control-write sequencer is available
on DRC1 only.
When the DRC signal-detect sequence is enabled, the control-write sequencer is triggered whenever the DRC1
signal-detect output transitions (high or low). The applicable start index location within the sequencer memory is separately
configurable for each logic condition.
The WSEQ_DRC1_SIG_DET_RISE_SEQ_INDEX field defines the sequencer start index corresponding to a DRC1
signal-detect rising edge event, as described in Table 4-126. The WSEQ_DRC1_SIG_DET_FALL_SEQ_INDEX field
defines the sequencer start index corresponding to a DRC1 signal-detect falling edge event.
Note that a sequencer start index of 0x1FF causes the respective sequence to be aborted.
The DRC signal-detect sequences cannot be independently enabled for rising and falling edges. Instead, a start index of
0x1FF can be used to disable the sequence for either edge, if required.
The DRC signal-detect control sequences are undefined following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode
transition. The DRC signal-detect control sequences must be reconfigured by the host processor following any of these
events. Note that all control sequences are maintained in the sequencer memory through software reset.
See Section 4.3.5 for further details of the DRC function.

4.19.4 MICDET Clamp Sequences
The CS47L90 supports external accessory detection functions, including the MICDET clamp circuit. The MICDET clamp
status can be used to trigger the control-write sequencer. The MICDET clamp is controlled by the JD1 and/or JD2 signals,
as described in Table 4-91.
A control-write sequence can be associated with a rising edge and/or a falling edge of the MICDET clamp status. This is
configured using the fields described in Table 4-91.
If one of the selected logic conditions is detected, the control-write sequencer is triggered. The applicable start index
location within the sequencer memory is separately configurable for the rising and falling edge conditions.
The WSEQ_MICD_CLAMP_RISE_INDEX field defines the sequencer start index corresponding to a MICDET clamp
rising edge (clamp active) event, as described in Table 4-127. The WSEQ_MICD_CLAMP_FALL_INDEX field defines the
sequencer start index corresponding to a MICDET clamp falling edge event.
Note that a sequencer start index of 0x1FF causes the respective sequence to be aborted.
The MICDET clamp control sequences are undefined following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode
transition. The MICDET clamp control sequences must be reconfigured by the host processor following any of these
events. Note that all control sequences are maintained in the sequencer memory through software reset.
See Section 4.13 for further details of the MICDET clamp status signals.

4.19.5 Event Logger Sequences
The CS47L90 provides eight event log functions, for monitoring and recording internal or external signals. The logged
events are held in a FIFO buffer, from which the application software can read details of the detected logic transitions.
The control-write sequencer is automatically triggered whenever the NOT_EMPTY status of the event log buffer is
asserted. A different control sequence may be configured for each event logger.
The WSEQ_EVENTLOGn_INDEX field defines the sequencer start index corresponding to respective event logger (where
n is 1 to 8), as described in Table 4-128.
Note that a sequencer start index of 0x1FF causes the respective sequence to be aborted.
The event logger control sequences are undefined following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode transition.
The event logger control sequences must be reconfigured by the host processor following any of these events. Note that
all control sequences are maintained in the sequencer memory through software reset.
See Section 4.5.2 for further details of the event loggers.

4.19.6 Boot Sequence
The CS47L90 executes a boot sequence following power-on reset, hardware reset, software reset, or wake-up from Sleep
Mode. The boot sequence configures the CS47L90 with factory-set trim (calibration) data. See Section 4.23 and
Section 4.24 for further details.
The start index location of the boot sequence is 384 (0x180). See Table 4-133 for details of the write sequencer memory
allocation.
The boot sequence can be commanded at any time by writing 1 to the WSEQ_BOOT_START bit.

4.19.7 Sequencer Status Indication
The status of the write sequencer can be read using WSEQ_BUSY and WSEQ_CURRENT_INDEX, as described in
Table 4-130. When the WSEQ_BUSY bit is asserted, this indicates that the write sequencer is busy.
The index address of the most recent write sequencer command can be read from the WSEQ_CURRENT_INDEX field.
This can be used to provide a precise indication of the write sequencer progress.

4.19.8 Programming a Sequence
A control-write sequence comprises a series of write operations to data bits within the control register map. Standard write
operations are defined by five fields, contained within a single 32-bit register. An extended instruction set is also defined;
the associated actions make use of alternate definitions of the 32-bit registers.
The sequencer instruction fields are replicated 508 times, defining each of the sequencer’s 508 possible index addresses.
Many sequences can be stored in the sequencer memory at the same time, with each assigned a unique range of index
addresses. The WSEQ_DELAYn field is used to identify the end-of-sequence position, as described below.
The general definition of the sequencer instruction fields is described as follows, where n denotes the sequencer index
address (valid from 0 to 507):
     •  WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn is a 3-bit field that identifies the width of the data block to be written. Note that the maximum
        value of this field selects a width of 8 bits; writes to fields that are larger than 8 bits wide must be performed using
        two separate operations of the write sequencer.
     •  WSEQ_ADDRn is a 12-bit field containing the register address in which the data should be written. The applicable
        register address is referenced to the base address currently configured for the sequencer—it is calculated as: (base
        address * 512) + WSEQ_ADDRn. Note that the base address is configured using the sequencer’s extended
        instruction set.
     •  WSEQ_DELAYn is a 4-bit field that controls the waiting time between the current step and the next step in the
        sequence (i.e., the delay occurs after the write in which it was called). The total delay time per step (including
        execution) is defined below, giving a useful range of execution/delay times from 3.3 s up to 1 s per step.
            If WSEQ_DELAYn = 0x0 or 0xF, the step execution time is 3.3 s
            For all other values, the step execution time is 61.44 s x ((2 WSEQ_DELAY) – 1)
            Setting this field to 0xF identifies the step as the last in the sequence
     •  WSEQ_DATA_STARTn is a 4-bit field that identifies the LSB position within the selected control register to which
        the data should be written. For example, setting WSEQ_DATA_STARTn = 0100 selects bit [4] as the LSB position
        of the data to be written.
     •  WSEQ_DATAn is an 8-bit field that contains the data to be written to the selected control register. The WSEQ_
        DATA_WIDTHn field determines how many of these bits are written to the selected control register; the most
        significant bits (above the number indicated by WSEQ_DATA_WIDTHn) are ignored.
The extended instruction set for the write sequencer is accessed by setting WSEQ_MODEn (bit [28]) in the respective
sequencer definition register. The extended instruction set comprises the following functions:
     •  If bits [31:24] = 0x11, the register base address is set equal to the value contained in bits [23:0].
     •  If bits [31:16] = 0x12FF, the sequencer performs an unconditional jump to the index location defined in bits [15:0].
        The index location is valid in the range 0 to 507 (0x1FB).
     •  All other settings within the extended instruction set are reserved.
The control field definitions for Step 0 are described in Table 4-131. The equivalent definitions also apply to Step 1 through
Step 507, in the subsequent register address locations.

4.19.9 Sequencer Memory Definition
The write sequencer memory defines up to 508 write operations; these are indexed as 0 to 507 in the sequencer memory
map.
The write sequencer memory reverts to its default contents following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode
transition. In these cases, the sequence memory contains the boot sequence and the OUT1–OUT3 signal path enable/
disable sequences; the remainder of the sequence memory is undefined.
User-defined sequences can be programmed after power-up. The user-defined control sequences must be reconfigured
by the host processor following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode transition. Note that all control
sequences are maintained in the sequencer memory through software reset. See Section 5.2 for a summary of the
CS47L90 memory reset conditions.
The default control sequences can be overwritten in the sequencer memory, if required. Note that the headphone/earpiece
output path enable bits (HPnx_ENA) always trigger the write sequencer (at the predetermined start index addresses).
Writing 1 to the WSEQ_LOAD_MEM bit clears the sequencer memory to the power-on reset state.

The sequencer memory is summarized in Table 4-133. User-defined sequences should be assigned space within the
allocated portion (user space) of the write sequencer memory.
The start index for the user-defined sequences is configured using the fields described in Table 4-124 through
Table 4-128.

4.20 Charge Pumps, Regulators, and Voltage Reference
The CS47L90 incorporates two charge-pump circuits and an LDO-regulator circuit to generate supply rails for internal
functions and to support external microphone requirements. The CS47L90 also provides two MICBIAS generators (with
eight switchable outputs), which provide low noise reference voltages suitable for biasing ECM-type microphones or
powering digital microphones.
Refer to Section 5.1 for recommended external components.
The CPVDD domain (1.8 V) powers the Charge Pump 1 and Charge Pump 2 circuits. The CPVDD2 power domain (1.2 V)
is an additional supply used by Charge Pump 1 only.
4.20.1 Charge Pump 1
Charge Pump 1 (CP1) is used to generate the positive and negative supply rails for the analog output drivers. CP1 is
enabled automatically by the CS47L90 when required by the output drivers.
The Charge Pump 1 circuit is shown in Fig. 4-75.
4.20.2 Charge Pump 2 and LDO2 Regulator
Charge Pump 2 (CP2) powers LDO2, which provides the supply rail for analog input circuits and for the MICBIAS
generators. CP2 and LDO2 are enabled by setting CP2_ENA.
The 32-kHz clock must be configured and enabled when using CP2. See Section 4.17 for details of the system clocks.
When CP2 and LDO2 are enabled, the MICVDD voltage is selected using the LDO2_VSEL field. Note that, when one or
more of the MICBIAS generators is operating in normal (regulator) mode, the MICVDD voltage must be at least 200 mV
greater than the highest selected MICBIASn output voltages.
When CP2 and LDO2 are enabled, an internal bypass path may be selected, connecting the MICVDD pin directly to the
CPVDD supply. This path is controlled using the CP2_BYPASS bit. Note that the bypass path is only supported when CP2
is enabled.
When CP2 is disabled, the CP2VOUT pin can be configured to be floating or to be actively discharged. This is selected
using the CP2_DISCH bit.
When LDO2 is disabled, the MICVDD pin can be configured to be floating or to be actively discharged. This is selected
using the LDO2_DISCH bit.
The MICVDD pin is connected to the output of LDO2. Note that the MICVDD does not support direct connection to an
external supply; MICVDD is always powered internally to the CS47L90.
The Charge Pump 2 and LDO2 Regulator circuits are shown in Fig. 4-75. The associated control bits are described in
Table 4-134.
Note that decoupling capacitors and flyback capacitors are required for these circuits. Refer to Section 5.1 for
recommended external components.
4.20.3 Microphone Bias (MICBIAS) Control
There are two MICBIAS generators, which provide low-noise reference voltages suitable for biasing ECM-type
microphones or powering digital microphones. Refer to Section 5.1.3 for recommended external components.

                                                                                                                CS47L90
                                                                4.20 Charge Pumps, Regulators, and Voltage Reference
The MICBIAS generators are powered from MICVDD, which is generated by an internal charge pump and LDO, as shown
in Fig. 4-75.
Switchable outputs from the MICBIAS generators allow eight separate reference/supply outputs to be independently
controlled. The MICBIAS regulators are enabled using the MICB1_ENA and MICB2_ENA bits. The MICBIAS output
switches are enabled using the MICB1x_ENA and MICB2x_ENA (where x is A, B, C, or D).
Note that, to enable any of the MICBIASnx outputs, both the output switch and the respective regulator must be enabled.
When a MICBIAS output is disabled, it can be configured to be floating or to be actively discharged. This is configured
using the MICBn_DISCH bits (for the MICBIAS regulators), and the MICBnx_DISCH bits (for the switched outputs). Each
discharge path is only effective when the respective regulator, or switched output, is disabled.
The MICBIAS generators can each operate in Regulator Mode or in Bypass Mode. The applicable mode is selected using
the MICBn_BYPASS bits.
In Regulator Mode (MICBn_BYPASS = 0), the output voltage is selected using the MICBn_LVL fields. In this mode,
MICVDD must be at least 200 mV greater than the required MICBIAS output voltages. The MICBIAS outputs are powered
from the MICVDD pin and use the internal band-gap circuit as a reference.
In Regulator Mode, the MICBIAS regulators are designed to operate without external decoupling capacitors. The
regulators can be configured to support a capacitive load if required, using the MICBn_EXT_CAP bits. (This may be
appropriate for a DMIC supply.) It is important that the external capacitance is compatible with the applicable MICBn_EXT_
CAP setting. The compatible load conditions are detailed in Table 3-11.
In Bypass Mode (MICBn_BYPASS = 1), the respective outputs (MICBIASnx), when enabled, are connected directly to
MICVDD. This enables a low power operating state. Note that the MICBn_EXT_CAP settings are not applicable in Bypass
Mode—there are no restrictions on the external MICBIAS capacitance in Bypass Mode.
The MICBIAS generators incorporate a pop-free control circuit to ensure smooth transitions when the MICBIAS outputs
are enabled or disabled in Bypass Mode; this feature is enabled using the MICBn_RATE bits.
The MICBIAS generators are shown in Fig. 4-75. The MICBIAS control fields are described in Table 4-134.
The maximum output current for each MICBIAS regulator is noted in Table 3-11. This limit must be observed for each set
of MICBIASnx outputs, especially if more than one microphone is connected to a single regulator. Note that the maximum
output current differs between Regulator Mode and Bypass Mode.
4.20.4 Voltage-Reference Circuit
The CS47L90 incorporates a voltage-reference circuit, powered by AVDD. This circuit ensures the accuracy of the
LDO-regulator and MICBIAS voltage settings.
4.20.5 Block Diagram and Control Registers
The charge-pump and regulator circuits are shown in Fig. 4-75. Note that decoupling capacitors and flyback capacitors
are required for these circuits. Refer to Section 5.1 for recommended external components.

4.21 JTAG Interface
The JTAG interface provides test and debug access to the CS47L90 DSP core. The interface comprises five pins, detailed
as follows:
286                                                      Cirrus Logic Confidential                                 DS1105F1


                                                                                                                   CS47L90
                                                                                                 4.22 Short-Circuit Protection
     •  TCK: clock input
     •  TDI: data input
     •  TDO: data output
     •  TMS: mode select input
     •  TRST: test access port reset input (active low)
For normal operation (test and debug access disabled), the JTAG interface should be held in reset (i.e., TRST should be
at Logic 0). An internal pull-down resistor holds the TRST pin low when not actively driven. External connection to DGND
is recommended, if the JTAG interface function is not required.
The other JTAG input pins (TCK, TDI, TMS) should also be held at Logic 0 for normal operation. An internal pull-down
resistor holds these pins low when not actively driven.
If the JTAG interface is enabled (TRST deasserted and TCK active) at the time of any reset, a software reset must be
scheduled, with the TCK input stopped or TRST asserted (Logic 0), before using the JTAG interface.
It is recommended to always schedule a software reset before starting the JTAG clock or deasserting the JTAG reset. In
this event, the JTAG interface should be held in its reset state until the software reset has completed, and the BOOT_
DONE_STSx bits have been set.
See Section 4.24 for further details of the CS47L90 software reset.
4.22 Short-Circuit Protection
The CS47L90 provides short-circuit protection on the headphone output drivers.
The short-circuit protection function for the headphone output paths operates continuously if the respective output driver
is enabled. If a short circuit is detected on the headphone output, current limiting is applied to protect the respective output
driver. Note that the driver continues to operate, but the output is current-limited.
The headphone short-circuit protection function provides input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an
interrupt event when a short-circuit condition is detected; see Section 4.16.
4.23 Power-On Reset (POR)
The CS47L90 remains in the reset state until AVDD, DBVDD1, and DCVDD are above their respective reset thresholds.
Note that specified device performance is not assured outside the voltage ranges defined in Table 3-3.
After the initial power-up, the POR is rescheduled following an interruption to the DBVDD1 or AVDD supplies.
If the CS47L90 SLIMbus component is in its operational state, it must be reset before scheduling a POR. See Section 4.11
for details of the SLIMbus reset control messages.
4.23.1 Boot Sequence
Following power-on reset, a boot sequence is executed. The BOOT_DONE_STSx bits are asserted on completion of the
boot sequence, as described in Table 4-136. Control-register writes should not be attempted until BOOT_DONE_STSx
has been asserted. Note that the BOOT_DONE_STS1 and BOOT_DONE_STS2 bits provide the same information.
The BOOT_DONE_STSx signal is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event on
completion of the boot sequence; see Section 4.16. Under default register conditions, a falling edge on the IRQ pin
indicates completion of the boot sequence.
For details of the boot sequence, see Section 4.19.

                                                 Control register writes should not be attempted until Boot Sequence has completed.
4.23.2 Digital I/O Status in Reset
Table 1-1 describes the default status of the CS47L90 digital I/O pins on completion of power-on reset, prior to any register
writes. The same default conditions are also applicable on completion of a hardware reset or software reset (see
Section 4.24).
The same default conditions are applicable following a wake-up transition, except for the IRQ and RESET pins. These are
always-on pins whose configuration is unchanged in Sleep Mode and during a wake-up transition.
Note that the default conditions described in Table 1-1 are not valid if modified by the boot sequence or by a wake-up
control sequence. See Section 4.19 for details of these functions.
4.24 Hardware Reset, Software Reset, Wake-Up, and Device ID
The CS47L90 supports hardware- and software-controlled reset functions. The reset functions, and the Sleep/Wake-Up
state transitions, provide similar (but not identical) functionality. Each of these is described in the following subsections.
The CS47L90 device ID can be read from the Software_Reset (R0) control register, as described in Section 4.24.7.
4.24.1 Hardware Reset
The CS47L90 provides a hardware reset function, which is executed whenever the RESET input is asserted (Logic 0). The
RESET input is active low and is referenced to the DBVDD1 power domain. A hardware reset causes all of the CS47L90
control registers to be reset to their default states.
An internal pull-up resistor is enabled by default on the RESET pin; this can be configured using the RESET_PU bit. A
pull-down resistor is also available, as described in Table 4-137. When the pull-up and pull-down resistors are both
enabled, the CS47L90 provides a bus keeper function on the RESET pin. The bus keeper function holds the input logic
level unchanged whenever the external circuit removes the drive (e.g., if the signal is tristated).
If the CS47L90 SLIMbus component is in its operational state, it must be reset prior to scheduling a hardware reset. See
Section 4.11 for details of the SLIMbus reset control messages.

                                           Note: If RESET_PD and RESET_PU are both set, a bus keeper function is enabled on the
                                           RESET pin.

                                           RESET pin.

4.24.2 Software Reset
A software reset is executed by writing any value to register R0. A software reset causes most of the CS47L90 control
registers to be reset to their default states. Note that the control-write sequencer memory is retained during software reset.
Note that the first register read/write operation following a software reset may be unsuccessful, if the register access is
attempted via a different control interface to the one that commanded the software reset. Note that only the first register
read/write is affected, and only when using more than one control interface.
4.24.3 Wake-Up
The CS47L90 is in Sleep Mode when AVDD and DBVDD1 are present, and DCVDD is below its reset threshold. (Note
that specific control requirements are also applicable for entering Sleep Mode, as described in Section 4.14.)
In Sleep Mode, most of the digital core (and control registers) are held in reset; selected functions and control registers
are maintained via an always-on internal supply domain. See Section 4.14 for details of the always-on functions.
A wake-up transition (from Sleep Mode) is similar to a software reset, but selected functions and control registers are
maintained via an always-on internal supply domain—the always-on registers are not reset during wake-up. See
Section 4.14 for details of the always-on functions.
4.24.4 Write Sequencer and DSP Firmware Memory Control in Reset and Wake-Up
The control-write sequencer memory contents reverts to its default contents following power-on reset, a hardware reset,
or a Sleep Mode transition. The control sequences (including any user-defined sequences) are maintained in the
sequencer memory through software reset.
The DSP firmware memory contents are cleared following power-on reset, a hardware reset, or a Sleep Mode transition.
The firmware memory contents are not affected by software reset, provided DCVDD is held above its reset threshold.
See Section 5.2 for a summary of the CS47L90 memory reset conditions.
4.24.5 Boot Sequence
Following hardware reset, software reset, or wake-up from Sleep Mode, a boot sequence is executed. The BOOT_DONE_
STSx bits (see Table 4-136) are deasserted during hardware reset and software reset, and also in Sleep Mode. The
BOOT_DONE_STSx bits are asserted on completion of the boot sequence. Control register writes should not be
attempted until BOOT_DONE_STSx has been asserted.
The BOOT_DONE_STSx status is an input to the interrupt control circuit and can be used to trigger an interrupt event; see
Section 4.16. Note that the BOOT_DONE_STS1 and BOOT_DONE_STS2 bits provide the same information.
For details of the boot sequence, see Section 4.19.
4.24.6 Digital I/O Status in Reset
The status of the CS47L90 digital I/O pins following hardware reset, software reset, or wake-up is described in
Section 4.23.
4.24.7 Device ID
The device ID can be read from Register R0. The hardware revision can be read from Register R1.
The software revision can be read from Register R2. The software revision code is incremented if software driver
compatibility or software feature support is changed.

5 Applications
5.1 Recommended External Components
This section provides information on the recommended external components for use with the CS47L90.
5.1.1       Analog Input Paths
The CS47L90 supports up to seven analog audio input connections. Each input is biased to the internal DC reference,
VREF. (Note that this reference voltage is present on the VREFC pin.) A DC-blocking capacitor is required for each analog
input pin used in the target application. The choice of capacitor is determined by the filter that is formed between that
capacitor and the impedance of the input pin. The circuit is shown in Fig. 5-1.
                                                                                            1

                                        Figure 5-1. Audio Input Path DC-Blocking Capacitor
In accordance with the CS47L90 input pin resistance (see Table 3-5), a 1-F capacitance for all input connections gives
good results in most cases, with a 3-dB cut-off frequency around 13 Hz.
Ceramic capacitors are suitable, but take care to ensure the desired capacitance is maintained at the AVDD operating
voltage. Also, ceramic capacitors may show microphonic effects, where vibrations and mechanical conditions give rise to
electrical signals. This is particularly problematic for microphone input paths where a large signal gain is required.
A single capacitor is required for a single-ended line or microphone input connection. For a differential input connection,
a DC-blocking capacitor is required on both input pins.
The external connections for single-ended and differential microphones, incorporating the CS47L90 microphone bias
circuit, are shown in Fig. 5-2.
5.1.2       DMIC Input Paths
The CS47L90 supports up to 10 channels of DMIC input; two channels of audio data can be multiplexed on each
DMICDATn pin. Each stereo pair is clocked using the respective DMICCLKn pin.

The external connections for digital microphones, incorporating the CS47L90 microphone bias circuit, are shown in
Fig. 5-4. Ceramic decoupling capacitors for the digital microphones may be required—refer to the specific
recommendations for the application microphones.
If two microphones are connected to a single DMICDAT pin, the microphones must be configured to ensure that the Left
mic transmits a data bit when DMICCLK is high, and the Right mic transmits a data bit when DMICCLK is low. The
CS47L90 samples the DMIC data at the end of each DMICCLK phase. Each microphone must tristate its data output when
the other microphone is transmitting. Integrated pull-down resistors can be enabled on the DMICDAT pins if required.
The voltage reference for each DMIC interface is selectable. It is important that the selected reference for the CS47L90
interface is compatible with the applicable configuration of the external microphone.
5.1.3      Microphone Bias Circuit
The CS47L90 is designed to interface easily with analog or digital microphones.
Each microphone requires a bias current (electret condenser microphones) or voltage supply (silicon microphones); these
can be provided by the MICBIAS regulators on the CS47L90. Two MICBIAS generators are available; switchable outputs
allow eight separate reference/supply outputs to be independently controlled.
Note that the MICVDD pin can also be used (instead of MICBIASnx) as a reference or power supply for external
microphones. The MICBIAS outputs are recommended, as these offer better noise performance and independent enable/
disable control.
Analog microphones may be connected in single-ended or differential configurations, as shown in Fig. 5-2. The differential
configuration provides better performance due to its rejection of common-mode noise; the single-ended method provides
a reduction in external component count.
A bias resistor is required when using an ECM. The bias resistor should be chosen according to the minimum operating
impedance of the microphone and MICBIAS voltage so that the maximum bias current of the CS47L90 is not exceeded.
A 2.2-k bias resistor is recommended; this provides compatibility with a wide range of microphone components.

Each MICBIAS generator can operate in Regulator Mode or in Bypass Mode. See Section 4.20 for details of the MICBIAS
generators.
In Regulator Mode, the MICBIAS regulators are designed to operate without external decoupling capacitors. The
regulators can be configured to support a capacitive load if required (e.g., for DMIC supply decoupling). The compatible
load conditions are detailed in Table 3-11.
If the capacitive load on MICBIAS1 or MICBIAS2 exceeds the specified conditions for Regulator Mode (e.g., due to a
decoupling capacitor or long PCB trace), the respective generator must be configured in Bypass Mode.
The maximum output current for each MICBIAS regulator is noted in Table 3-11. This limit must be observed for each set
of MICBIASnx outputs, especially if more than one microphone is connected to a single regulator. Note that the maximum
output current differs between Regulator Mode and Bypass Mode. The MICBIAS output voltage can be adjusted using
register control in Regulator Mode.

5.1.4      Headphone Driver Output Path
The CS47L90 provides three stereo headphone output drivers. These outputs are all ground referenced, allowing direct
connection to the external loads. There is no requirement for DC-blocking capacitors.
In single-ended (default) configuration, the headphone outputs comprise six independently controlled output channels, for
up to three stereo headphone or line outputs. In mono (BTL) mode, the headphone drivers support up to three differential
outputs, suitable for a mono earpiece or hearing coil load.
The headphone outputs incorporate a common mode, or ground loop, feedback path that provides rejection of
system-related ground noise. The feedback pins must be connected to ground for normal operation of the headphone
outputs. The ground feedback path for HPOUT1 and HPOUT2 headphone paths is selected using the HP1_GND_SEL
and HP2_GND_SEL bits respectively.
The feedback pins should be connected to GND as close as possible to the respective headphone jack ground pin, as
shown in Fig. 5-5. In mono (differential) mode, the feedback pins should be connected to the ground plane that is closest
to the earpiece output PCB tracks.
It is recommended to ensure that the electrical characteristics of the PCB traces for each output pair are closely matched.
This is particularly important to matching the two traces of a differential (BTL) output.
Typical headphone and earpiece connections are shown in Fig. 5-5.

It is common for ESD diodes to be wired to pins that link to external connectors. This provides protection from potentially
harmful ESD effects. In a typical application, ESD diodes would be recommended if the headphone paths
(HPOUT1–HPOUT3) are used for external headphone or line output.
The HPOUTn outputs are ground-referenced, and the respective voltages may swing between +1.8V and –1.8V. The ESD
diode configuration must be carefully chosen.
The recommended ESD diode configuration for these ground-referenced outputs is shown in Fig. 5-6. The back-to-back
arrangement prevents clipping and distortion of the output signal.

5.1.5       Power Supply/Reference Decoupling
Electrical coupling exists particularly in digital logic systems where switching in one subsystem causes fluctuations on the
power supply. This effect occurs because the inductance of the power supply acts in opposition to the changes in current
flow that are caused by the logic switching. The resultant variations (spikes) in the power-supply voltage can cause
malfunctions and unintentional behavior in other components. A decoupling (bypass) capacitor can be used as an energy
storage component that provides power to the decoupled circuit for the duration of these power-supply variations,
protecting it from malfunctions that could otherwise arise.
Coupling also occurs in a lower frequency form when ripple is present on the power supply rail caused by changes in the
load current or by limitations of the power-supply regulation method. In audio components such as the CS47L90, these
variations can alter the performance of the signal path, leading to degradation in signal quality. A decoupling capacitor can
be used to filter these effects by presenting the ripple voltage with a low-impedance path that does not affect the circuit to
be decoupled.
These coupling effects are addressed by placing a capacitor between the supply rail and the corresponding ground
reference. In the case of systems comprising multiple power supply rails, decoupling should be provided on each rail.
PCB layout is also a contributory factor for coupling effects. If multiple power supply rails are connected to a single supply
source, it is recommended to provide separate PCB tracks connecting each rail to the supply. See Section 5.5 for
PCB-layout recommendations.
The recommended power-supply decoupling capacitors for CS47L90 are detailed in Table 5-1.

                 1.Total capacitance of 4.7 F is required for each DBVDDn domain. This can be provided by dedicated
                   DBVDDn decoupling or by other capacitors on the same power rail.
All decoupling capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the CS47L90 device. The connection between AGND,
the AVDD decoupling capacitor, and the main system ground should be made at a single point as close as possible to the
AGND balls of the CS47L90.
Due to the wide tolerance of many types of ceramic capacitors, care must be taken to ensure that the selected components
provide the required capacitance across the required temperature and voltage ranges in the intended application. For most
application the use of ceramic capacitors with capacitor dielectric X5R is recommended.
5.1.6       Charge-Pump Components
The CS47L90 incorporates two charge-pump circuits (CP1 and CP2).
CP1 generates the CP1VOUTnx supply rails for the ground-referenced headphone drivers; CP2 generates the CP2VOUT
supply rail for the microphone bias (MICBIAS) regulators.
Decoupling capacitors are required on each of the charge-pump outputs. Two fly-back capacitors are required for CP1; a
single fly-back capacitor is required for CP2.
The recommended charge-pump capacitors for CS47L90 are detailed in Table 5-2.

                       CP1 fly-back 2                                  Required capacitance is 1.0 F at 2 V.
                       (connect between CP1C2A and CP1C2B)             Suitable component typically 2.2 F.
                       CP2VOUT decoupling                              Required capacitance is 1.0 F at 3.6 V.
                                                                       Suitable component typically 4.7 F.
                       CP2 fly-back                                    Required capacitance is 220 nF at 2 V.
                       (connect between CP2CA and CP2CB)               Suitable component typically 470 nF.
Ceramic capacitors are recommended for these charge-pump requirements. Note that, due to the wide tolerance of many
types of ceramic capacitors, care must be taken to ensure that the selected components provide the required capacitance
across the required temperature and voltage ranges in the intended application. Ceramic capacitors with X5R dielectric
are recommended.
The positioning of the charge-pump capacitors is important. These capacitors (particularly the fly-back capacitors) must
be placed as close as possible to the CS47L90. The component choice and positioning of the CP1 components are more
critical than those of CP2, due to the higher output power requirements of CP1.

5.1.7      External Accessory Detection Components
The external accessory detection circuit measures jack insertion using the JACKDET1 and JACKDET2 pins. The insertion
switch status is detected using an internal pull-up resistor circuit on the respective pin. Note that the logic thresholds
associated with the two JACKDET differ from each other, as described in Table 3-11—this provides support for different
jack switch configurations.
Microphone detection and key-button press detection is supported using the MICDETn pins. The applicable pin should be
connected to one of the MICBIASnx outputs, via a 2.2-k bias resistor, as described in Section 5.1.3. Note that, when
using the external accessory detection function, the MICBIASnx resistor must be 2.2 k ±2%.
A recommended circuit configuration, including headphone output on HPOUT1 and microphone connections, is shown in
Fig. 5-7. See Section 5.1.1 for details of the DC-blocking microphone input capacitor selection.
The recommended external components and connections for microphone/push-button detection are shown in Fig. 5-7.
Note that, when using the microphone detect circuit, it is recommended to use the IN1B or IN2B analog microphone input
paths to ensure best immunity to electrical transients arising from the external accessory.

                                                 Figure 5-7. External Accessory Detection
The accessory detection circuit measures the impedance of an external load connected to one of the MICDET pins.
The microphone-detection circuit uses MICVDD, or any one of the MICBIASnx sources, as a reference. The applicable
source is configured using MICDn_BIAS_SRC.
With default register configuration, the CS47L90 can detect the presence of a typical microphone and up to four push
buttons, using the components shown in Fig. 5-8. When the microphone detection circuit is enabled, each of the push
buttons shown causes a different bit in the MICDn_LVL field to be set.
The choice of external resistor values must take into account the impedance of the microphone—the detected impedance
corresponds to the combined parallel resistance of the microphone and any asserted push button. The components shown
in Fig. 5-8 are examples only, assuming default impedance measurement ranges and a microphone impedance of 1 k
or higher.

        The measured impedance is reported using the MICDm_STS and MICDm_LVL bits.
        If no accessory or push button is detected, the MICDm_STS bit is cleared.                                                                             MICBIAS
        If MICDm_STS = 1, one of the MICDm_LVL bits is set to indicate the measured
        impedance.

5.2 Resets Summary
Table 5-3 summarizes the CS47L90 registers and other programmable memory under different reset conditions. The
associated events and conditions are listed as follows:
   •    A power-on reset occurs when AVDD or DBVDD1 is below its respective reset threshold. Note that DCVDD is also
        required for initial start-up; subsequent interruption to DCVDD should only be permitted as part of a control
        sequence for entering Sleep Mode.
   •    A hardware reset occurs when the RESET input is asserted (Logic 0).
   •    A software reset occurs when register R0 is written to.
   •    Sleep Mode is selected when DCVDD is removed. Note that the AVDD and DBVDD1 supplies must be present
        throughout the Sleep Mode duration.

 1.See Section 4.14 for details of Sleep Mode and the always-on registers.
 2.To retain the DSP firmware memory contents during software reset, it must be ensured that DCVDD is held above its reset threshold.
5.3 Output-Signal Drive-Strength Control
The CS47L90 supports configurable drive-strength control for the digital output pins. This can be used to assist
system-level integration and design considerations.
The drive-strength control bits are described in Table 5-4. Note that, in the case of bidirectional pins (e.g., GPIOn), the
drive-strength control bits are only applicable if the pin is configured as an output.

5.4 Digital Audio Interface Clocking Configurations
The digital audio interfaces (AIF1–AIF4) can be configured in master or slave modes. In all applications, it is important that
the system clocking configuration is correctly designed. Incorrect clock configurations lead to audible clicks arising from
dropped or repeated audio samples; this is caused by the inherent tolerances of multiple asynchronous system clocks.
To ensure reliable clocking of the audio interface functions, the external interface clocks (e.g., BCLK, LRCLK) must be
derived from the same clock source as SYSCLK (or ASYNCCLK, where applicable).
In AIF Master Mode, the external BCLK and LRCLK signals are generated by the CS47L90 and synchronization of these
signals with SYSCLK (or ASYNCCLK) is ensured. In this case, clocking of the AIF is typically derived from the MCLK1 or
MCLK2 inputs, either directly or via one of the FLL circuits. Alternatively, an AIFn or SLIMbus interface can be used to
provide the reference clock to which the AIF master can be synchronized.
In AIF Slave Mode, the external BCLK and LRCLK signals are generated by another device, as inputs to the CS47L90. In
this case, the system clock (SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK) must be generated from a source that is synchronized to the external
BCLK and LRCLK inputs.
In a typical Slave Mode application, the BCLK input is selected as the clock reference, using the FLL to perform frequency
shifting. The MCLK1 or MCLK2 inputs can also be used, but only if the selected clock is synchronized externally to the
BCLK and LRCLK inputs. The SLIMbus interface can also provide the clock reference, via one of the FLLs, provided that
the BCLK and LRCLK signals are externally synchronized with the SLIMCLK input.
The valid AIF clocking configurations are listed in Table 5-5 for AIF Master and AIF Slave Modes.
The applicable system clock (SYSCLK or ASYNCCLK) depends on the AIFn_RATE setting for the relevant digital audio
interface; if AIFn_RATE < 1000, SYSCLK is applicable; if AIFn_RATE  1000, ASYNCCLK is applicable.

          AIF Master Mode            SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source.
                                     SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects FLLn as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source;
                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as FLLn source.
                                     SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects FLLn as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source;
                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects a different interface (BCLK, LRCLK, SLIMCLK) as FLLn source.
          AIF Slave Mode             SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects FLLn as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source;
                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects BCLK as FLLn source.
                                     SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source,
                                     provided MCLK is externally synchronized to the BCLK input.
                                     SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects FLLn as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source;
                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects MCLK1 or MCLK2 as FLLn source, provided MCLK is externally
                                     synchronized to the BCLK input.
                                     SYSCLK_SRC (ASYNCCLK_SRC) selects FLLn as SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) source;
                                     FLLn_REFCLK_SRC selects a different interface (e.g., SLIMCLK) as FLLn source, provided the
                                     other interface is externally synchronized to the BCLK input.
In each case, the SYSCLK (ASYNCCLK) frequency must be a valid ratio to the LRCLK frequency; the supported clocking
rates are defined by the SYSCLK_FREQ (ASYNC_CLK_FREQ) and SAMPLE_RATE_n (ASYNC_SAMPLE_RATE_n)
fields.
The valid AIF clocking configurations are shown in Fig. 5-9 to Fig. 5-15. Note that, where MCLK1 is shown as the clock
source, it is equally possible to select MCLK2 as the clock source. Similarly, in cases where FLL1 is shown, it is equally
possible to select FLL2 or FLL_AO.
Fig. 5-9 shows AIF Master Mode operation, using MCLK as the clock reference.

                                                                                                   5.5 PCB Layout Considerations
5.5 PCB Layout Considerations
PCB layout should be carefully considered, to ensure optimum performance of the CS47L90. Poor PCB layout degrades
the performance and is a contributory factor in EMI, ground bounce, and resistive voltage losses. All external components
should be placed close to the CS47L90, with current loop areas kept as small as possible. The following specific
considerations should be noted:
     •     Placement of the charge pump capacitors is a high priority requirement—these capacitors (particularly the fly-back
           capacitors) must be placed as close as possible to the CS47L90. The component choice and positioning of the CP1
           components are more critical than those of CP2, due to the higher output power requirements of CP1.
     •     Decoupling capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the CS47L90. The connection between AGND, the
           AVDD decoupling capacitor, and the main system ground should be made at a single point as close as possible to
           the AGND balls of the CS47L90.
     •     The VREFC capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the CS47L90. The ground connection to the VREFC
           capacitor should be as close as possible to the AGND1 ball of the CS47L90.
     •     If multiple power supply rails are connected to a single supply source, it is recommended to provide separate PCB
           tracks connecting each rail to the supply. This configuration is also known as star connection.
     •     If power supply rails are routed between different layers of the PCB, it is recommended to use several track vias, in
           order to minimize resistive voltage losses.
     •     Differential input signal tracks should be routed as a pair, ensuring similar length/width dimensions on each track.
           Input signal paths should be kept away from high frequency digital signals.
     •     Differential output signal tracks should be routed as a pair, ensuring similar length/width dimensions on each track.
           The tracks should provide a low resistance path from the device output pin to the load (< 1% of the minimum load).
     •     The headphone output ground-feedback pins should be connected to GND as close as possible to the respective
           headphone jack ground pin. The ground-feedback PCB track should follow the same route as the respective output
           signal paths.
6 Register Map
The CS47L90 control registers are listed in the following tables. Note that only the register addresses described here
should be accessed; writing to other addresses may result in undefined behavior. Register bits that are not documented
should not be changed from the default values.
The CS47L90 register map is defined in two regions:
     •     The codec register space (below 0x3000) is defined in 16-bit word format
     •     The DSP register space (from 0x3000 upwards) is defined in 32-bit word format
It is important to ensure that all control interface register operations use the applicable data word format, in accordance
with the applicable register addresses.
The 16-bit codec register space is described in Table 6-1.
