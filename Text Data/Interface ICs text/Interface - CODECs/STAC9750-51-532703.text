    1.2.    Description
                     TSI's STAC9750/9751 are general purpose 18-bit ADC, 20-bit DAC, full duplex, audio CODECs con-
                     forming to the analog component specification of AC'97 (Audio Codec ‘97 Component Specification
                     Rev. 2.2). The STAC9750/9751 incorporate TSI's proprietary  technology to achieve a DAC SNR
                     in excess of 90 dB. The DACs, ADCs, and mixer are integrated with analog I/Os, which include four
                     analog line-level stereo inputs, two analog line-level mono inputs, two stereo outputs, and one mono
                     output channel. The STAC9750/9751 include digital input/output capability for support of modern PC
                     systems with an output that supports the SPDIF format. The STAC9750/9751 is a standard 2-chan-
                     nel stereo CODEC. With TSI’s headphone drive capability, headphones can be driven with no exter-
                     nal amplifier. The STAC9750/9751 may be used as a secondary CODEC, with the
                     STAC9700/21/44/56/08/84/66 as the primary, in a multiple CODEC configuration conforming to the
                     AC'97 Rev. 2.2 specification. This configuration can provide the true six-channel, AC-3 playback
                     required for DVD applications. The STAC9750/9751 communicates via the five-wire AC-Link to any
                     digital component of AC'97, providing flexibility in the audio system design. Packaged in an AC'97
                     compliant 48-pin LQFP, the STAC9750/9751 can be placed on a motherboard, daughter boards,
                     PCI, AMR, CNR, or ACR cards.
                     The STAC9750/9751 block diagram is illustrated in Figure 1. It provides variable sample rate Digi-
                     tal-to-Analog (DA) and Analog-to-Digital (AD) conversion, mixing, and analog processing. Supported
                     audio sample rates include 48 KHz, 44.1 KHz, 32 KHz, 22.05 KHz, 16 KHz, 11.025 KHz, and 8 KHz;
                     additional rates are supported in the STAC9750/9751 soft audio drivers. The digital interface com-
                     municates with the AC'97 controller via the five-wire AC-Link and contains the 64-word by 16-bit reg-
                     isters. The two DACs convert the digital stereo PCM-out content to audio. The MIXER block
                     combines the PCM_OUT with any analog sources, to drive the LINE_OUT and HP_OUT outputs.
                     The MONO_OUT delivers either microphone only, or a mono mix of sources from the MIXER. The
                     stereo variable sample rate ADCs provide record capability for any mix of mono or stereo sources,
                     and deliver a digital stereo PCM_IN signal back to the AC-Link. The microphone input and mono
                     input can be recorded simultaneously, thus allowing for an all digital output in support of the digital

                     ready initiative. All ADCs operate at 18-bit resolution and DACs at 20-bit resolution. For a digital
                     ready record path, the microphone is connected to the left channel ADC while the mono output of the
                     stereo mixer is connected to right channel ADC. Make sure the microphone input is not connected to
                     the stereo mixer when in this mode.
                     The STAC9750/9751 supports General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO), as well as SPDIF output.
                     These digital I/O options provide for a number of advanced architectural implementations, with vol-
                     ume controls and digital mixing capabilities built directly into the CODEC.
                     The STAC9750/9751 is designed primarily to support stereo (2-speaker) audio. True AC-3 playback
                     can be achieved for 6-speaker applications by taking advantage of the multi-CODEC option avail-
                     able in the STAC9750/9751 to support multiple CODECs in an AC'97 architecture. Additionally, the
                     STAC9750/9751 provides for a stereo enhancement feature, TSI Surround 3D (SS3D). SS3D pro-
                     vides the listener with several options for improved speaker separation beyond the normal
                     2/4-speaker arrangements.
                     Together with the logic component (controller or advanced core logic chip-set) of AC'97,
                     STAC9750/9751 can be SoundBlaster® and Windows Sound System® compatible with TSI’s WDM

                       general, when a 24.576 MHz clock XTAL is not used, the XTAL_OUT pin should be tied to ground.
                       This short to ground configures the part into an alternate clock mode and enables an on board PLL.

Note:   1.  All AC-Link signals are normally low through the trailing edge of RESET#. Bringing SDATA_OUT high for the trailing edge
            of RESET# causes the STAC9750/9751 AC-Link outputs to go high-impedance, which is suitable for ATE in-circuit testing.
        2.  Once the test mode has been entered, the STAC9750/9751 must be issued another RESET# with all AC-Link signals low
            to return to the normal operating mode.
        3.  # denotes active low.

        4.  The CD_GND signal is an AC signal return for the two CD input channels. It is normally biased at about 2.5V. The name of
            the pin in the AC97 specification is CD_GND, and this has confused many designers. It should not have any DC path to
            GND. Connecting the CD_GND signal directly to ground will change the internal bias of the entire CODEC, and cause
            significant distortion. If there is no analog CD input, then this pin can be No-Connect.

    4.1.    Clocking
                     STAC9750/9751 derives its clock internally from an externally connected 24.576 MHz crystal or an
                     oscillator, through the XTAL_IN pin. Synchronization with the AC'97 controller is achieved through
                     the BIT_CLK pin at 12.288 MHz.
                     The beginning of all audio sample packets, or “Audio Frames”, transferred over AC-Link is synchro-
                     nized to the rising edge of the “SYNC” signal driven by the AC'97 controller. Data is transitioned on
                     AC-Link on every rising edge of BIT_CLK, and subsequently sampled by the receiving side on each
                     immediately following falling edge of BIT_CLK.
    4.2.    Reset
                     There are 3 types of resets:
                     1. a “cold” reset where all STAC9750/9751 logic and registers are initialized to their default state
                     2. a “warm” reset where the contents of the STAC9750/9751 register set are left unaltered
                     3. a “register” reset which only initializes the STAC9750/9751 registers to their default states
                     After signaling a reset to the STAC9750/9751, the AC'97 controller should not attempt to play or cap-
                     ture audio data until it has sampled a “CODEC Ready” indication via register 26h from the
                     STAC9750/9751.
                     For proper reset operation SDATA_OUT should be 0 during cold reset.

5. DIGITAL INTERFACE
    5.1.    AC-Link Digital Serial Interface Protocol
                     The STAC9750/9751 communicates to the AC'97 controller via a 5-wire, digital, serial, AC-Link inter-
                     face, which is a bi-directional, fixed rate, serial PCM digital stream. All digital audio streams, com-
                     mands and status information are communicated over this point-to-point serial interconnect. The
                     AC-Link handles multiple input and output audio streams, as well as control register accesses using
                     a time division multiplexed (TDM) scheme. The AC'97 controller synchronizes all AC-Link data trans-
                     action. Table 9 shows the data streams available on the STAC9750/9751:
                                                   Table 9. STAC9750/9751 Available Data Streams

                     Synchronization of all AC-Link data transactions is handled by the AC'97 controller. The
                     STAC9750/9751 drives the serial bit clock onto AC-Link. The AC'97 controller then qualifies with a
                     synchronization signal to construct audio frames.
                     SYNC, fixed at 48 KHz, is derived by dividing down the serial bit clock (BIT_CLK). BIT_CLK, fixed at
                     12.288 MHz, provides the necessary clocking granularity to support twelve 20-bit outgoing and
                     incoming time slots. AC-Link serial data is transitioned on each rising edge of BIT_CLK. The receiver
                     of AC-Link data, STAC9750/9751 for outgoing data and AC'97 controller for incoming data, samples
                     each serial bit on the falling edges of BIT_CLK.
                     The AC-Link protocol provides for a special 16-bit (13-bits defined, with 3 Reserved trailing bit posi-
                     tions) time slot (Slot 0) wherein each bit conveys a “slot-valid” tag for its corresponding time slot
                     within the current audio frame. A 1 in a given bit position of slot 0 indicates that the corresponding
                     time slot within the current audio frame has been assigned to a data stream, and contains valid data.
                     If a slot is tagged invalid, it is the responsibility of the source of the data, (STAC9750/9751 for the
                     input stream, AC'97 controller for the output stream), to stuff all bit positions with 0s during that slot’s
                     active time.
                     SYNC remains high for a total duration of 16 BIT_CLKs at the beginning of each audio frame. The
                     portion of the audio frame where SYNC is high is defined as the “Tag Phase”. The remainder of the
                     audio frame where SYNC is low is defined as the “Data Phase”.
                     Additionally, for power savings, all clock, SYNC, and data signals can be halted by the controller.

            5.1.1.   AC-Link Audio Output Frame (SDATA_OUT)
                     The audio output frame data streams correspond to the multiplexed bundles of all digital output data
                     targeting the STAC9750/9751 DAC inputs, and control registers. Each audio output frame supports
                     up to twelve 20-bit outgoing data time slots. Slot 0 is a special Reserved time slot containing 16 bits
                     that are used for AC-Link protocol infrastructure.
                     Within slot 0, the first bit is a global bit (SDATA_OUT slot 0, bit 15) which flags the validity for the
                     entire audio frame. If the “Valid Frame” bit is a 1, this indicates that the current audio frame contains
                     at least one slot time of valid data. The next 12 bit positions sampled by the STAC9750/9751 indi-
                     cate which of the corresponding 12 times slots contain valid data. In this way data streams of differ-
                     ing sample rates can be transmitted across AC-Link at its fixed 48 KHz audio frame rate. The
                     following diagram illustrates the time slot based AC-Link protocol.

                     A new audio output frame begins with a low to high transition of SYNC. SYNC is synchronous to the
                     rising edge of BIT_CLK. On the immediately following falling edge of BIT_CLK, the STAC9750/9751
                     samples the assertion of SYNC. This following edge marks the time when both sides of AC-Link are
                     aware of the start of a new audio frame. On the next rising edge of BIT_CLK, the AC'97 controller
                     transitions SDATA_OUT into the first bit position of slot 0 (Valid Frame bit). Each new bit position is
                     presented to AC-Link on a rising edge of BIT_CLK, and subsequently sampled by the
                     STAC9750/9751 on the following falling edge of BIT_CLK. This sequence ensures that data transi-
                     tions, and subsequent sample points for both incoming and outgoing data streams, are time aligned.

                     The command port is used to control features and monitor status (see Audio Input Frame Slots 1
                     and 2) of the STAC9750/9751 functions including, but not limited to, mixer settings and power man-
                     agement (refer to the Control Register section of this specification).
                     The control interface architecture supports up to sixty-four 16-bit read/write registers, addressable
                     on even byte boundaries. Only the even registers (00h, 02h, etc.) are valid. Odd accesses are con-

                     The command data port is used to deliver 16-bit control register write data in the event that the cur-
                     rent command port operation is a write cycle (as indicated by Slot 1, bit 19).

                     If the current command port operation is a read cycle, then the entire slot time must be stuffed with
                     0s by the AC'97 controller.
                     5.1.1.3.       Slot 3: PCM Playback Left Channel
                     Audio output frame slot 3 is the composite digital audio left playback stream. In a typical “Games
                     Compatible” PC this slot is composed of standard PCM (.wav) output samples digitally mixed (on the
                     AC'97 controller or host processor) with music synthesis output samples. If a sample stream of reso-
                     lution less than 20-bits is transferred, the AC'97 controller must stuff all trailing non-valid bit positions
                     within this time slot with 0s.
                     5.1.1.4.       Slot 4: PCM Playback Right Channel
                     Audio output frame slot 4 is the composite digital audio right playback stream. In a typical “Games
                     Compatible” PC this slot is composed of standard PCM (.wav) output samples digitally mixed (on the
                     AC'97 controller or host processor) with music synthesis output samples. If a sample stream of reso-

STAC9750/9751
Value-Line Two-Channel AC’97 Codecs
            5.1.2.   AC-Link Audio Input Frame (SDATA_IN)
                     The audio input frame data streams correspond to the multiplexed bundles of all digital input data
                     targeting the AC'97 controller. As is the case for audio output frame, each AC-Link audio input frame
                     consists of twelve 20-bit time slots. Slot 0 is a special Reserved time slot containing 16 bits that are
                     used for AC-Link protocol infrastructure.
                     Within slot 0, the first bit is a global bit (SDATA_IN slot 0, bit 15) which flags whether the
                     STAC9750/9751 is in the “CODEC Ready” state or not. If the “CODEC Ready” bit is a 0, this indi-
                     cates that STAC9750/9751 is not ready for normal operation. This condition is normal following the
                     de-assertion of power on reset, for example, while STAC9750/9751’s voltage references settle.
                     When the AC-Link “CODEC Ready” indicator bit is a 1, it indicates that the AC-Link and
                     STAC9750/9751 control/status registers are in a fully operational state. The AC'97 controller must
                     further probe the Powerdown Control Status Register (refer to Mixer Register section) to determine
                     exactly which subsections, if any, are ready.
                     Prior to any attempts at putting STAC9750/9751 into operation the AC'97 controller should poll the
                     first bit in the audio input frame (SDATA_IN slot 0, bit 15) for an indication that STAC9750/9751 has
                     become “CODEC Ready”. Once the STAC9750/9751 is sampled “CODEC Ready”, the next 12 bit
                     positions sampled by the AC'97 controller indicate which of the corresponding 12 time slots are
                     assigned to input data streams, and that they contain valid data. The following diagram illustrates the
                     time slot based AC-Link protocol.

                     A new audio input frame begins with a low to high transition of SYNC. SYNC is synchronous to the
                     rising edge of BIT_CLK. Immediately following the falling edge of BIT_CLK, the STAC9750/9751
                     samples the assertion of SYNC. This falling edge marks the time when both sides of AC-Link are
                     aware of the start of a new audio frame. On the next rising of BIT_CLK, the STAC9750/9751 transi-
                     tions SDATA_IN into the first bit position of slot 0 (“CODEC Ready” bit). Each new bit position is pre-
                     sented to AC-Link on a rising edge of BIT_CLK and subsequently sampled by the AC'97 controller
                     on the following falling edge of BIT_CLK. This sequence ensures that data transitions, and subse-
                     quent sample points for both incoming and outgoing data streams are time aligned.

                     age level. The AC'97 controller can wake up the STAC9750/9751 by providing the appropriate reset
                     signals.

                     The AC'97 controller should also drive SYNC, and SDATA_OUT low after programming the
                     STAC9750/9751 to this low power mode.
    5.3.    Waking up the AC-Link
                     Once the STAC9750/9751 has halted BIT_CLK, there are only two ways to “wake up” the AC-Link.
                     Both methods must be activated by the AC'97 controller. The AC-Link protocol provides for a “Cold
                     AC'97 Reset”, and a “Warm AC'97 Reset”. The current power down state would ultimately dictate
                     which form of reset is appropriate. Unless a “cold” or “register” reset (a write to the Reset register) is
                     performed, wherein the AC'97 registers are initialized to their default values, registers are required to
                     keep state during all power down modes. Once powered down, re-activation of the AC-Link via
                     re-assertion of the SYNC signal must not occur for a minimum of 4 audio frame times following the
                     frame in which the power down was triggered. When AC-Link powers up it indicates readiness via
                     the CODEC Ready bit (input slot 0, bit 15).
                     Cold Reset - a cold reset is achieved by asserting RESET# for the minimum specified time, and
                     then bringing RESET# back HIGH. The reset occurs on the rising edge when RESET# is deas-
                     serted. By asserting and deasserting RESET#, BIT_CLK and SDATA_IN will be activated, or re-acti-
                     vated as the case may be, and all STAC9750/9751 control registers will be initialized to their default
                     power-on-reset values.
                        Note: RESET# is an asynchronous input. (# denotes active low)
                     Warm Reset - a warm reset will re-activate the AC-Link without altering the current STAC9750/9751
                     register values. A warm reset is signaled by driving SYNC high for a minimum of 1 s in the absence
                     of BIT_CLK.
                        Note: Within normal audio frames, SYNC is a synchronous input. However, in the absence of
                        BIT_CLK, SYNC is treated as an asynchronous input used in the generation of a warm reset to the
                        STAC9750/9751.

    6.1.    Analog Mixer Input
                     The mixer provides recording and playback of any audio sources or output mix of all sources. The
                     STAC9750/9751 supports the following input sources:
                     •      Any mono or stereo source
                     •      Mono or stereo mix of all sources
                     •      Two-channel input with mono output reference (microphone + stereo mix)

                       Note: All unused inputs should be tied together connected to ground through a capacitor (0.1 F
                       suggested).
    6.2.    Analog Mixer Output
                     The mixer generates three distinct outputs:
                     •    A stereo mix of all sources for output to the LINE_OUT and HP_OUT
                     •    A stereo mix of all analog sources for recording
                     •    Microphone only or mono mix of all sources for MONO_OUT
                       Note: Mono output of stereo mix is attenuated by -6 dB.
    6.3.    SPDIF Digital Mux
                     The STAC9750/9751 incorporates a digital output that supports SPDIF formats. A multiplexer deter-
                     mines which of two digital input streams are used for the digital output conversion process. These
                     two streams include the PCM OUT data from the audio controller and the ADC recorded output. The
                     normal analog LINE_OUT signal can be converted to the SPDIF formats by using the internal ADC
                     to record the “MIX” output, which is the combination of all analog and all digital sources. In the case
                     of digital controllers with support for 4 or more channels, the SPDIF output mode can be used to sup-
                     port compressed 6-channel output streams for delivery to home theater systems. These can be
                     routed on alternate AC-Link slots to the SPDIF output, while the standard 2-channel output is deliv-
                     ered as selected by bits D5 and D4 in Register 6E. If the digital controller supports 6 channels, a
                     SPDIF output with 4 analog channels can also be configured (in a multi-CODEC setup). For more
                     information for SPDIF please see 6.5.12.2; page 43.
                     PIN 48: TO ENABLE SPDIF, USE AN 1 K-10 K EXTERNAL PULLDOWN. TO DISABLE SPDIF, USE
                     AN 1 K-10 K EXTERNAL PULLUP. DO NOT LEAVE PIN 48 FLOATING.
    6.4.    PC Beep Implementation
                     PC Beep is active on power up and defaults to an un-muted state. The PC_BEEP input is routed
                     directly to the MONO_OUT, LINE_OUT and HP_OUT pins of the CODEC. Because the PC_BEEP
                     input drive is often a full scale digital signal, some resistive attenuation of the PC_BEEP input is rec-
                     ommended to keep the beep tone within reasonable volume levels. The user should mute this input
                     before using any other mixer input because the PC Beep input can contribute noise to the lineout
                     during normal operation. This style of PC Beep is related to the AC’97 Specification Rev 2.2. To use
                     the analog PC Beep, a value of 00h to bits F[7:0](D[12:5]) disables the Digital PC Beep generation.
                     PV[3:0] (D[4:1]) controls the volume level from 0 to 45dB of attenuation in 3dB steps.

                       Writing any value to this register performs a register reset, which causes all registers to revert to
                       their default values. Reading this register returns the ID code of the part.

                       These registers manage the output signal volumes. Register 02h controls the stereo LINE_OUT
                       master volume (both right and left channels), register 04h controls the Headphone Out master vol-
                       ume, and register 06h controls the MONO volume output. Each step corresponds to 1.5 dB. The
                       MSB of the register is the mute bit. When this bit is set to 1 the level for that channel is set at -dB.
                       ML5 through ML0 is for left channel level, MR5 through MR0 is for the right channel and MM5
                       through MM0 is for the mono out channel. When bits D5 and D13 are set in any of these registers it
                       automatically writes all 1 to the next lower 5-bits.
                       The default value is 8000h for registers 02h, 04h, and 06h, which corresponds to 0 dB attenuation
                       with mute on.

                     This register controls the level for the PC Beep input. Each step corresponds to approximately 3dB
                     of attenuation. The MSB of the register is the mute bit. When this bit is set to 1, the level for that
                     channel is set at -dB. PC_BEEP supports motherboard implementations. The intention of routing
                     PC_BEEP through the STAC9750/9751 mixer is to eliminate the requirement for an onboard
                     speaker by guaranteeing a connection to speakers connected via the output jack. In order for this to
                     be viable, the PC_BEEP signal needs to reach the output jack at all times. NOTE: the PC_BEEP is
                     routed to the mono outputs when the STAC9750/9751 is in a RESET state. This is so that Power On
                     Self Test (POST) codes can be heard by the user in case of a hardware problem with the PC. For
                     further PC_BEEP implementation details please refer to the AC'97 Technical FAQ sheet. The default
                     value is 0000h, which corresponds to 0 dB attenuation with mute off.

                      This register is used to control some miscellaneous functions. Below is a summary of each bit and its
                      function. The MS bit controls the MIC selector. The LPBK bit enables loopback of the ADC output to
                      the DAC input without involving the AC-Link, allowing for full system performance measurements.

                      This register is used to control the 3D stereo enhancement function, TSI Surround 3D (SS3D), built
                      into the AC'97 component. Note that register bits DP3-DP2 are used to control the separation ratios
                      in the 3D control for LINE_OUT. SS3D provides for a wider soundstage extending beyond the nor-
                      mal 2-speaker arrangement. Note that the 3D bit in the general purpose register (20h) must be set to
                      1 to enable SS3D functionality and for the bits in 22h to take effect.

                      The three separation ratios are implemented as shown in Table 21. The separation ratio defines a
                      series of equations that determine the amount of depth difference (High, Medium, and Low) per-
                      ceived during two-channel playback. The ratios provide for options to narrow or widen the sound-
                      stage.

STAC9750/9751
Value-Line Two-Channel AC’97 Codecs
                       When the AC-Link “CODEC Ready” indicator bit (SDATA_IN slot 0, bit 15) is a 1, it indicates that the
                       AC-Link and AC'97 control and status registers are in a fully operational state. The AC'97 controller
                       must further probe this Powerdown Control/Status Register to determine exactly which subsections,
                       if any are ready. When this register is written, the bit values that come in on AC-Link will have no
                       effect on read only bits 0-7.
                       6.5.10.2.      Powerdown Controls
                       The STAC9750/9751 is capable of operating at reduced power when no activity is required. The
                       state of power down is controlled by the Powerdown Register (26h). See the section “Low Power
                       Modes” for more information.
                       6.5.10.3.      External Amplifier Power Down Control
                       The EAPD bit 15 of the Powerdown Control/Status Register (Index 26h) directly controls the output
                       of the EAPD output (pin 45), and produces a logical 1 when this bit is set to logic high. This function
                       is used to control an external audio amplifier power down. EAPD = 0 places approximately 0V on the
                       output pin, enabling an external audio amplifier. EAPD = 1 places approximately DVdd on the output
                       pin, disabling the external audio amplifier. Audio amplifiers that operate with reverse polarity will
                       likely require an external inverter to maintain software driver compatibility.

                       The Extended Audio ID register is a read-only register, except for bits D5:D4. ID1 and ID0 echo the
                       configuration of the CODEC as defined by the programming of pins 45 and 46 externally. A returned
                       00 defines the CODEC as the primary CODEC, while any other code identifies the CODEC as one of
                       three secondary CODEC possibilities. SDAC = 0 tells the controller that the STAC9750/9751 is a
                       two-channel CODEC as defined by the Intel specification. The AMAP bit, D9, will return a 1 indicat-
                       ing that the CODEC supports the optional “AC’97 2.2 compliant AC-link slot to audio DAC map-
                       pings”. The default condition assumes that 00 are loaded in the DSA0 and DSA1 bits of the
                       Extended Audio ID (Index 28h). With 00 in the DSAx bits, the CODEC slot assignments are as per
                       the AC’97 specification recommendations. If the DSAx bits do not contain 00, the slot assignments
                       are as per the table in the section describing the Extended Audio ID (Index 28h). The VRA bit, D0,
                       will return a 1 indicating that the CODEC supports the optional variable sample rate conversion as
                       defined by the AC’97 specification.

                     The Extended Audio Status Control register also contains one active bit to enable or disable the Vari-
                     able Sampling Rate capabilities of the DACs and ADCs. If the VRA, bit D0, is 1, the variable sample
                     rate control registers (2Ch and 32h) are active, and “on-demand” slot data required transfers are
                     allowed. If the VRA bit is 0, the DACs and ADCs will operate at the default 48 KHz data rate.
                     The STAC9750/9751 supports “on-demand” slot request flags. These flags are passed from the
                     CODEC to the AC’97 controller in every audio input frame. Each time a slot request flag is set (active
                     low) in a given audio frame, the controller will pass the next PCM sample for the corresponding slot
                     in the audio frame that immediately follows. The VRA enable bit must be set to 1 to enable
                     “on-demand” data transfers. If the VRA enable bit is not set, the CODEC will default to 48 KHz trans-
                     fers and every audio frame will include an active slot request flag and data is transferred every
                     frame.
                     For variable sample rate output, the CODEC examines its sample rate control registers, the state of
                     the FIFOs, and the incoming SDATA_OUT tag bits at the beginning of each audio output frame to

                     determine which SLOTREQ bits to set active (low). SLOTREQ bits are asserted during the current
                     audio input frame for active output slots, which will require data in the next audio output frame.
                     For variable sample rate input, the tag bit for each input slot indicates whether valid data is present
                     or not. Thus, even in variable sample rate mode, the CODEC is always the master: for SDATA_IN
                     (CODEC to controller), the CODEC sets the TAG bit; for SDATA_OUT (controller to CODEC), the
                     CODEC sets the SLOTREQ bit and then checks for the TAG bit in the next frame. Whenever VRA is
                     set to 0, the PCM rate registers (2Ch and 32h) are overwritten with BB80h (48 KHz).
                     6.5.12.2.     SPDIF
                     The SPDIF bit in the Extended Audio Status Control Register is used to enable and disable the
                     SPDIF functionality within the STAC9750/9751. If the SPDIF is set to a 1, then the function is
                     enabled and when set to a 0 it is disabled.
                     6.5.12.3.     SPCV (SPDIF Configuration Valid)
                     The SPCV bit is read only and indicates whether or not the SPDIF system is set up correctly. When
                     SPCV is a 0, it indicates the system configuration is invalid and valid if it is a 1.

                     The internal sample rate for the DACs and ADCs are controlled by the value in these read/write reg-
                     isters that contain a 16-bit unsigned value between 0 and 65535 representing the conversion rate in
                     Hertz (Hz). In VRA mode (register 2Ah bit D0 = 1), if the value written to these registers is supported,
                     that value will be echoed back when read, otherwise the closest (higher in the case of a tie) sample
                     rate is supported and returned. Per PC 99 / PC 2001 specification, independent sample rates are

                      Register 3Ah is a read/write register that controls SPDIF functionality and manages bit fields propa-
                      gated as channel status (or sub-frame in the V case). With exception of V, this register should only
                      be written to when the SPDIF transmitter is disabled (SPDIF bit register 2 Ah is 0). This ensures that
                      control and status information start up correctly at the beginning of SPDIF transmission. The default
                      is 2A00h which sets the SPDIF output sample rate at 48 KHz and the normal SPDIF expectations.

                           (SPDIF disabled) and Register 28h bit D2 = 1 (SPDIF available).

                     6.5.25.1.     ALL MIX
                     The AC’97 ALL_MIX, bit D12 of register 6Eh, controls the record source when the Stereo Mix option
                     is selected for recording. If the AC’97 mode is default logic 1, the “Stereo Mix Record” option will
                     include the sum of the analog sources with or without 3D enhancement, and the main PCM DAC
                     output. If the “ALL Analog Record” option is selected, the Stereo Mix Record option will include the
                     sum of the analog sources only, with or without 3D enhancement. The “AC’97 mode” is useful for
                     recording all sound sources. The “ALL Analog Record” mode is useful in conjunction with the POP
                     BYPASS mode for recording all analog sources, which are often further processed and combined
                     with other PCM data to be output directly to the DAC outputs which are configured in POP_BYPASS
                     mode using the General Purpose register (index 20h).
                     6.5.25.2.     ADC Data on AC LINK
                     Bits D5-D4 select slots for ADC data on ACLINK.

                     6.5.25.3.     MuteFix Disable
                     Bit D6 controls the enable and disable of the MuteFix functions.
                     •    0 = MUTE FIX Enabled
                     •    1 = MUTE FIX Disabled
                     When this bit is zero, and either channel is set to -46.5dB attenuation (1Fh), then that channel is fully
                     muted. When this bit is one, then operation is per AC’97 specification.
                     This bit is reserved in revisions prior to CC1.
                     6.5.25.4.     Mic Boost Select
                     The Mic boost value can be selected with bit D2, which in enabled by Register 0Eh, bit D6. Writing a
                     zero to bit D2 will provide 20dB of Mic Boost. Writing a one will provide 30dB of Mic Boost.
                                                             Table 36. Mic Boost Select

                     6.5.25.5.     Supply Override Select
                     The Supply Override bit, D1, allows override of the supply detect. Writing a zero disables the over-
                     ride on supply detect. Writing a one, overrides supply detect with bit D0. Bit D0 provides the supply
                     override value. A zero forces 3.3 V analog operation and one forces 5 V analog operation.

                       The Analog Current Adjust register (index 72h) is a locked register and can only be properly written
                       and read from when ABBAh has been written into register 70h. The IBIASx bits allow the analog cur-
                       rent to be adjusted with minimal reduction in performance. A lower analog current setting is NOT
                       recommended when a 5V analog supply is used. A lower setting for 3.3V supplies is recommended
                       for notebook computers to reduce power consumption to its lowest level.

                       The STAC9750/9751 includes an internal power supply anti-pop circuit that prevents audible clicks
                       and pops from being heard when the CODEC is powered on and off. This function is accomplished
                       by delaying the charge/discharge of the VREF capacitor (Pin 27). CVREF value of 1 F will cause a
                       turn-on delay of roughly 3 seconds, which will allow the power supplies to stabilize before the
                       CODEC outputs are enabled. The delay can be extended to 30 seconds if a value of CVREF value of
                       10 F is used. The CODEC outputs are also kept stable for the same amount of time at power-off to

                       The GPIO Access Register requires that the output enable bits (D11, D9 and D8) be used in con-
                       junction with the data source selection (input or output) for the EAPD, GPIO0 and GPIO1 (pins 47,
                       43 and 44 respectively). For example, to use GPIO1 as an output, set D9 = 1 to enable the output,
                       and use D13 to write the output value desired. To use GPIO1 as an input, set D9 = 0 to disable the
                       output, and use D13 to read the input value.
            6.5.27.    High Pass Filter Bypass (Index 76h and 78h)
                       The High Pass Filter Bypass register (index 78h) is a locked register and can only be properly written
                       and read from when ABBAh has been written into register 76h. Bit D0 controls the High Pass Filter
                       Bypass. Default is zero which provides for normal operation where the high pass filter is active. Writ-
                       ing a one, will disable, or bypass the ADC high pass filter.

                      These two registers contain four 8-bit ID codes. The first three codes have been assigned by Micro-
                      soft using their Plug and Play Vendor ID methodology. The fourth code is an TSI assigned code
                      identifying the STAC9750/9751. The ID1 register (index 7Ch) contains the value 8384h, which is the
                      first (83h) and second (84h) characters of the Microsoft ID code. The ID2 register (index 7Eh) con-
                      tains the value 7650h, which is the third (76h) of the Microsoft ID code, and 50h which is the
                      STAC9750/9751 ID code.
                         Note: The lower half of the Vendor ID2 register (index 7Eh) currently contains the value xxh
                         identifying the STAC9750/9751. This value can be used by the audio driver, or miniport driver in
                         the case of WIN98®, to adjust software functionality to match the feature-set of the
                         STAC9750/9751. This portion of the register will likely contain different values if the software
                         profile of the STAC9750/9751 changes, as in the case of silicon level device modifications. This
                         will allow the software driver to identify any required operational differences between the existing
                         STAC9750/9751 and any future versions.

7. LOW POWER MODES
                     The STAC9750/9751 is capable of operating at reduced power when no activity is required. The
                     state of power-down is controlled by the Powerdown Register (26h). There are 7 commands of sep-
                     arate power down. The power down options are listed in Table 39. The first three bits, PR0..PR2, can
                     be used individually or in combination with each other, and control power distribution to the ADCs,
                     DACs and Mixer. The last analog power control bit, PR3, affects analog bias and reference voltages,
                     and can only be used in combination with PR0, PR1, and PR2. PR3 essentially removes power from
                     all analog sections of the CODEC, and is generally only asserted when the CODEC will not be
                     needed for long periods. PR0 and PR1 control the PCM ADCs and DACs only. PR2 and PR3 do not
                     need to be “set” before a PR4, but PR0 and PR1 must be “set” before PR4. PR5 disables the internal
                     CODEC clock and requires an external cold reset for recovery. PR6 disables the headphone driver
                     amplifier for additional analog power saving.

                     The Figure 19 illustrates one example procedure to do a complete power down of STAC9750/9751.
                     From normal operation, sequential writes to the Powerdown Register are performed to power down
                     STAC9750/9751 a piece at a time. After everything has been shut off, a final write (of PR4) can be
                     executed to shut down the AC-Link. The part will remain in sleep mode with all its registers holding
                     their static values. To wake up, the AC'97 controller will send an extended pulse on the sync line,
                     issuing a warm reset. This will restart the AC-Link (resetting PR4 to zero). The STAC9750/9751 can
                     also be woken up with a cold reset. A cold reset will reset all of the registers to their default states.
                     When a section is powered back on, the Powerdown Control/Status register (index 26h) should be
                     read to verify that the section is ready (stable) before attempting any operation that requires it.

                     contained in their associated registers. This configuration can be used when playing a CD (or exter-
                     nal LINE_IN source) through STAC9750/9751 to the speakers, while most of the system in low
                     power mode. The procedure for this follows the previous except that the analog mixer is never shut
                     down.

8. MULTIPLE CODEC SUPPORT
                     The STAC9750/9751 provides support for the multi-CODEC option according to the Intel AC'97, rev
                     2.2 specification. By definition there can be only one Primary CODEC (CODEC ID 00) and up to
                     three Secondary CODECs (CODEC IDs 01, 10, and 11). The CODEC ID functions as a chip select.
                     Secondary devices therefore have completely orthogonal register sets; each is individually accessi-
                     ble and they do not share registers.
    8.1.    Primary/Secondary CODEC Selection
                     In a multi-CODEC environment the CODEC ID is provided by external programming of pins 45 and
                     46 (CID0 and CID1). The CID pin electrical function is logically inverted from the CODEC ID desig-
                     nation. The corresponding pin state and its associated CODEC ID are listed in the “CODEC ID
                     Selection” table. Also see slot assignment discussion, “Multi-Channel Programming Register (Index
                     74)”.

            8.1.1.   Primary CODEC Operation
                     As a Primary device the STAC9750/9751 is completely compatible with existing AC'97 definitions
                     and extensions. Primary CODEC registers are accessed exactly as defined in the AC'97 Component
                     Specification and AC'97 Extensions. The STAC9750/9751 operates as Primary by default, and the
                     external ID pins (45 and 46), have internal pull-ups so that these pins may be left as no-connects for
                     primary operation.
                     When used as the Primary CODEC, the STAC9750/9751 generates the master AC-Link BIT_CLK
                     for both the AC'97 Digital Controller and any Secondary CODECs. The STAC9750/9751 can support
                     up to four loads of 10 K and 50 pF on the BIT_CLK line. This is to ensure that implementations of
                     up to four CODECs will not load down the clock output.
            8.1.2.   Secondary CODEC Operation
                     When the STAC9750/9751 is configured as a Secondary device the BIT_CLK pin is configured as an
                     input at power up. Using the BIT_CLK provided by the Primary CODEC insures that everything on
                     the AC-Link will be synchronous. As a Secondary device it can be defined as CODEC ID 01, 10 or
                     11 in the two-bit field(s) of the Extended Audio and/or Extended Modem ID Register(s).

    8.2.    Secondary CODEC Register Access Definitions
                     The AC'97 Digital Controller can independently access Primary and Secondary CODEC registers by
                     using a 2-bit CODEC ID field (chip select) which is defined as the LSBs of Output Slot 0. For Sec-
                     ondary CODEC access, the AC'97 Digital Controller must invalidate the tag bits for Slot 1 and 2
                     Command Address and Data (Slot 0, bits 14 and 13) and place a non-zero value (01, 10, or 11) into
                     the CODEC ID field (Slot 0, bits 1 and 0).
                     As a Secondary CODEC, the STAC9750/9751 will disregard the Command Address and Command
                     Data (Slot 0, bits 14 and 13) tag bits when it sees a 2-bit CODEC ID value (Slot 0, bits 1 and 0) that
                     matches its configuration. In a sense the Secondary CODEC ID field functions as an alternative
                     Valid Command Address (for Secondary reads and writes) and Command Data (for Secondary
                     writes) tag indicator.
                     Secondary CODECs must monitor the Frame Valid bit, and ignore the frame (regardless of the state
                     of the Secondary CODEC ID bits) if it is not valid. AC'97 Digital Controllers should set the frame valid
                     bit for a frame with a secondary register access, even if no other bits in the output tag slot except the
                     Secondary CODEC ID bits are set.
                     This method is designed to be backward compatible with existing AC'97 controllers and CODECs.
                     There is no change to output Slot 1 or 2 definitions.

9. TESTABILITY
                     The STAC9750/9751 has two test modes. One is for ATE in-circuit test and the other is restricted for
                     TSI’s internal use. STAC9750/9751 enters the ATE in-circuit test mode if SDATA_OUT is sampled
                     high at the trailing edge of RESET#. Once in the ATE test mode, the digital AC-Link outputs
                     (BIT_CLK and SDATA_IN) are driven to a high impedance state. This allows ATE in-circuit testing of
                     the AC'97 controller. Use of the ATE test mode is the recommended means of removing the CODEC
                     from the AC-Link when another CODEC is to be used as the primary. This case will never occur dur-
                     ing standard operating conditions. Once either of the two test modes have been entered, the
                     STAC9750/9751 must be issued another RESET# with all AC-link signals held low to return to the
                     normal operating mode.

                      The CD_GND signal is an AC signal return for the two CD input channels. It is normally biased at
                      about 2.5V. The name of the pin in the AC97 specification is CD_GND, and this has confused many
                      designers. It should not have any DC path to GND. Connecting the CD_GND signal directly to
                      ground will change the internal bias of the entire CODEC, and cause significant distortion. If there is
                      no analog CD input, then this pin can be No-Connect

14. APPENDIX A: SPLIT INDEPENDENT POWER SUPPLY OPERATION
                     In PC applications, one power supply input to the STAC9750/9751 may be derived from a supply
                     regulator (as shown in Figure 24) and the other directly from the PCI power supply bus. When power
                     is applied to the PC, the regulated supply input to the IC will be applied some time delay after the
                     PCI power supply. Without proper on-chip partitioning of the analog and digital circuitry, some manu-
                     facturer's CODECs would be subject to on-chip SCR type latch-up.
                     TSI’s STAC9750/9751 specifically allows power-up sequencing delays between the analog (AVddx)
                     and digital (VDddx) supply pins. These two power supplies can power-up independently and at dif-
                     ferent rates with no adverse effects to the CODEC. The IC is designed with independent analog and
                     digital circuitry that prevents on-chip SCR type latch-up.
                     However, the STAC9750/9751 is not designed to operate for extended periods with only the analog
                     supply active.
                        NOTE: PIN 48:
                        TO ENABLE SPDIF, USE A 1 K-10 K EXTERNAL PULLDOWN.
                        TO DISABLE SPDIF, USE A 1 K-10 K EXTERNAL PULLUP.
                        DO NOT LEAVE PIN 48 FLOATING.

   16. REVISION HISTORY
            Revision          Date                                                Description of Change
                                           Corrected error on page 26: Slot 1 Status Address Port, bit D2 is a SLot Request not Reserved
                                           as stated in rev 5.1
                                           Added CD_GND elaboration note on connection diagram, pin list and pin out diagrams:
                                           The CD_GND signal is an AC signal return for the two CD input channels. It is normally biased at
               5.2       October 2003
                                           about 2.5V. The name of the pin in the AC97 specification is CD_GND, and this has confused
                                           many designers. It should not have any DC path to GND. Connecting the CD_GND signal
                                           directly to ground will change the internal bias of the entire CODEC, and cause significant
                                           distortion. If there is no analog CD input, then this pin can be No-Connect.
                                           Corrected Note 4 in performance characteristics, was missing the text “Ratio of Full Scale signal
                                           to THD+N output with -3dB signal, measured “A weighted” over a”. Complete note now reads
               5.3        June 2004
                                           “Ratio of Full Scale signal to THD+N output with -3dB signal, measured “A weighted” over a 20
                                           Hz to a 20 KHz bandwidth. 48 KHz Sample Frequency”.
               5.4       January 2005     Added updated 48-pin package drawing. Added reflow profile information.
               5.5      February 2005      Revised reflow profile information
               5.6        March 2005      Revised TQFP to say LQFP.
                                           Updated with new logo template
                                           Added Part order information for RoHS package, with EOL information to Pb-bearing
               5.7      December 2005
                                           Removed references to older revisions (CA3) and their relationship to CC1, as CA3 is EOL and
                                           CC1 is the only production revision.
