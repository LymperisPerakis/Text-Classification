Notes:
         20. If Fs is lower than 46.875 kHz, the maximum CCLK frequency should be less than 128 Fs. This is
              dictated by the timing requirements necessary to access the Channel Status and User Bit buffer
              memory. Access to the control register file can be carried out at the full 6 MHz rate. The minimum
              allowable input sample rate is 8 kHz, so choosing CCLK to be less than or equal to 1.024 MHz should
              be safe for all possible conditions.
          21. Data must be held for sufficient time to bridge the transition time of CCLK.

                 Mute Control (Output) - The Mute Control pin outputs high impedance following an initial power-on con-
                 dition or whenever the PDN bit is set to a ‘1’, forcing the codec into power-down mode. The signal will
                 remain in a high impedance state as long as the part is in power-down mode. The Mute Control pin goes
MUTEC       38   to the selected “active” state during reset, muting, or if the master clock to left/right clock frequency ratio
                 is incorrect. This pin is intended to be used as a control for external mute circuits to prevent the clicks
                 and pops that can occur in any single supply system. The use of external mute circuits are not manda-
                 tory but may be desired for designs requiring the absolute minimum in extraneous clicks and pops.

4. APPLICATIONS
4.1   Overview
      The CS42518 is a highly integrated mixed-signal 24-bit audio codec comprised of 2 analog-to-digital con-
      verters (ADC), implemented using multi-bit delta-sigma techniques, 8 digital-to-analog converters (DAC)
      and a 192 kHz digital audio S/PDIF receiver. Other functions integrated within the codec include indepen-
      dent digital volume controls for each DAC, digital de-emphasis filters for DAC and S/PDIF, digital gain con-
      trol for ADC channels, ADC high-pass filters, an on-chip voltage reference, and an 8:2 mux for S/PDIF
      sources. All serial data is transmitted through two configurable serial audio interfaces with standard serial
      interface support as well as enhanced one-line modes of operation, allowing up to 6 channels of serial audio
      data on one data line. All functions are configured through a serial control port operable in SPI mode or in
      I²C mode. 5 show the recommended connections for the CS42518.
      The CS42518 operates in one of three oversampling modes based on the input sample rate. Mode selection
      is determined by the FM bits in register “Functional Mode (address 03h)” on page 47. Single-Speed Mode
      (SSM) supports input sample rates up to 50 kHz and uses a 128x oversampling ratio. Double-Speed Mode
      (DSM) supports input sample rates up to 100 kHz and uses an oversampling ratio of 64x. Quad-Speed
      Mode (QSM) supports input sample rates up to 192 kHz and uses an oversampling ratio of 32x.
      Using the receiver clock recovery PLL, a low-jitter clock is recovered from the incoming S/PDIF data stream.
      The recovered clock or an externally supplied clock attached to the OMCK pin can be used as the System
      Clock.
4.2   Analog Inputs
4.2.1    Line-Level Inputs
         AINR+, AINR-, AINL+, and AINL- are the line-level differential analog inputs. The analog signal must be
         externally biased to VQ, approximately 2.7 V, before being applied to these inputs. The level of the signal
         can be adjusted for the left and right ADC independently through the ADC Left and Right Channel Gain
         Control Registers on page 61. The ADC output data is in two’s complement binary format. For inputs
         above positive full scale or below negative full scale, the ADC will output 7FFFFFH or 800000H, respec-
         tively and cause the ADC Overflow bit in the register “Interrupt Status (address 20h) (Read Only)” on
         page 63 to be set to a ‘1’. The RXP/GPO pins may also be configured to indicate an overflow condition
         has occurred in the ADC. See “RXP/General-Purpose Pin Control (addresses 29h to 2Fh)” on page 69
         for proper configuration. Figure 6 shows the full-scale analog input levels. See “ADC Input Filter” on
         page 73 for a recommended input buffer.

                                                                                                         CS42518
4.2.2   High-Pass Filter and DC Offset Calibration
        The high-pass filter continuously subtracts a measure of the DC offset from the output of the decimation
        filter. The high-pass filter can be independently enabled and disabled. If the HPF_Freeze bit is set during
        normal operation, the current value of the DC offset for the corresponding channel is frozen and this DC
        offset will continue to be subtracted from the conversion result. This feature makes it possible to perform
        a system DC offset calibration by:
        1. Running the CS42518 with the high-pass filter enabled until the filter settles. See the Digital Filter
              Characteristics for filter settling time.
        2. Disabling the high-pass filter and freezing the stored DC offset.
        The high-pass filters are controlled using the HPF_FREEZE bit in the register “Misc Control (address
        05h)” on page 50.
4.3   Analog Outputs
4.3.1   Line-Level Outputs and Filtering
        The CS42518 contains on-chip buffer amplifiers capable of producing line-level differential outputs. These
        amplifiers are biased to a quiescent DC level of approximately VQ.
        The delta-sigma conversion process produces high-frequency noise beyond the audio passband, most of
        which is removed by the on-chip analog filters. The remaining out-of-band noise can be attenuated using
        an off-chip low-pass filter. See “DAC Output Filter” on page 73 for a recommended output buffer. This filter
        configuration accounts for the normally differing AC loads on the AOUT+ and AOUT- differential output
        pins. It also shows an AC coupling configuration which minimizes the number of required AC coupling ca-
        pacitors. Figure 7 shows the full-scale analog output levels.
                                                                              3.95 V
                           AOUT+                                              2.7 V

                                                                              3.95 V

4.3.2   Interpolation Filter
        To accommodate the increasingly complex requirements of digital audio systems, the CS42518 incorpo-
        rates selectable interpolation filters for each mode of operation. A “fast” and a “slow” roll-off filter is avail-
        able in Single-, Double-, and Quad-Speed Modes. These filters have been designed to accommodate a
        variety of musical tastes and styles. The FILT_SEL bit found in the register “Misc Control (address 05h)”
        on page 50 selects which filter is used. Filter response plots can be found in Figures 46 to 69.

                                                                                                       CS42518
4.3.3    Digital Volume and Mute Control
         Each DAC’s output level is controlled via the Volume Control registers operating over the range of 0 to
         -127 dB attenuation with 0.5 dB resolution. See “Volume Control (addresses 0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h,
         14h, 15h, 16h)” on page 58. Volume control changes are programmable to ramp in increments of
         0.125 dB at the rate controlled by the SZC[1:0] bits in the Digital Volume Control register. See “Volume
         Transition Control (address 0Dh)” on page 56.
         Each output can be independently muted via mute control bits in the register “Channel Mute (address
         0Eh)” on page 58. When enabled, each XX_MUTE bit attenuates the corresponding DAC to its maximum
         value (-127 dB). When the XX_MUTE bit is disabled, the corresponding DAC returns to the attenuation
         level set in the Volume Control register. The attenuation is ramped up and down at the rate specified by
         the SZC[1:0] bits.
         The Mute Control pin, MUTEC, is typically connected to an external mute control circuit. The Mute Control
         pin outputs high impedance during Power-Up or in Power-Down Mode by setting the PDN bit in the reg-
         ister “Power Control (address 02h)” on page 46 to a ‘1’. Once out of Power-Down Mode, the pin can be
         controlled by the user via the control port, or automatically asserted high when zero data is present on all
         DAC inputs, or when serial port clock errors are present. To prevent large transients on the output, it is
         desirable to mute the DAC outputs before the Mute Control pin is asserted. Please see the MUTEC pin
         in the Pin Descriptions section for more information.
         Each of the RXP1/GPO1-RXP7/GPO7 can be programmed to provide a hardware MUTE signal to indi-
         vidual circuits. When not used as an S/PDIF input, each pin can be programmed as an output, with spe-
         cific muting capabilities as defined by the function bits in the register “RXP/General-Purpose Pin Control
         (addresses 29h to 2Fh)” on page 69.
4.3.4    ATAPI Specification
         The CS42518 implements the channel-mixing functions of the ATAPI CD-ROM specification. The
         ATAPI functions are applied per A-B pair. Refer to Table 16 on page 60 and Figure 8 for additional infor-
         mation.
                                                                  A Channel

                                                                                                     CS42518
4.4   S/PDIF Receiver
      The CS42518 includes an S/PDIF digital audio receiver. The S/PDIF receiver accepts and decodes digital
      audio data according to the IEC60958 (S/PDIF), and EIAJ CP-1201 interface standards. The receiver con-
      sists of an 8:2 multiplexer input stage driven through pins RXP0 and RXP1/GPO1 - RXP7/GPO7, a PLL
      based clock recovery circuit, and a decoder which separates the audio data from the channel status and
      user data. A comprehensive buffering scheme provides read access to the channel status and user data.
      External components are used to terminate and isolate the incoming data cables from the CS42518. These
      components and required circuitry are detailed in the CDB42518.
4.4.1   8:2 S/PDIF Input Multiplexer
        The CS42518 contains an 8:2 S/PDIF Input Multiplexer to accommodate up to eight channels of input dig-
        ital audio data. Digital audio data is single-ended and input through the RXP0 and
        RXP1/GPO1-RXP7/GPO7 pins. Any one of these inputs can be multiplexed to the input of the S/PDIF
        receiver and to the S/PDIF output pin TXP.
        When any portion of the multiplexer is implemented, unused RXP0 and RXPx/GPOx pins should be tied
        to a 0.01uF capacitor to ground. The receiver multiplexer select line control is accessed through bits
        RMUX2:0 in the Receiver Mode Control 2 register on page 63. The TXP multiplexer select line control is
        accessed through bits TMUX2:0 in the same register. The multiplexer defaults to RXP0 for both functions.
4.4.2   Error Reporting and Hold Function
        While decoding the incoming S/PDIF data stream, the CS42518 can identify several kinds of error, indi-
        cated in the register “Receiver Errors (address 26h) (Read Only)” on page 67. See “Error Reporting and
        Hold Function” on page 74 for more information.
4.4.3   Channel Status Data Handling
        The first 2 bytes of the Channel Status block (C data) are decoded into the Receiver Channel Status reg-
        ister (See “Receiver Channel Status (address 25h) (Read Only)” on page 66). See “Channel Status Data
        Handling” on page 74 for more information.
4.4.4   User Data Handling
        The incoming User (U) data is buffered in a user accessible buffer. If the U data bits have been encoded
        as Q-channel subcode, the data is decoded and presented in 10 consecutive register locations, address
        30h to 39h. The user can configure the Interrupt Mask Register to cause interrupts to indicate the decod-
        ing of a new Q-channel block, which may be read through the control port. See “User (U) Data E Buffer
        Access” on page 76 for more information.
4.4.5   Non-Audio Auto-Detection
        A S/PDIF data stream may be used to convey non-audio data, thus it is important to know whether the
        incoming data stream is digital PCM audio samples or not. This information is typically conveyed in chan-
        nel status bit 1 (AUDIO), which is extracted automatically by the CS42518. Certain non-audio sources,
        however, such as AC-3 or MPEG encoders, may not adhere to this convention, and the bit may not be
        properly set. See “Non-Audio Auto-Detection” on page 76 for more information including details for inter-

4.5   Clock Generation
      The clock generation for the CS42518 is shown in the figure below. The internal MCLK is derived from the
      output of the PLL or a master clock source attached to OMCK. The mux selection is controlled by the SW_C-
      TRLx bits and can be configured to manual switch mode only, or automatically switch on loss of PLL lock
      to the other source input.

4.5.1    PLL and Jitter Attenuation
         An on-chip Phase Locked Loop (PLL) is used to recover the clock from the incoming S/PDIF data stream.
         There are some applications where low jitter in the recovered clock, presented on the RMCK pin, is im-
         portant. For this reason, the PLL has been designed to have good jitter attenuation characteristics as
         shown in Figure 28 on page 79.
         The PLL can be configured to lock onto the incoming SAI_LRCK signal from the Serial Audio Interface
         Port and generate the required internal master clock frequency. By setting the PLL_LRCK bit to a ‘1’ in
         the register “Clock Control (address 06h)” on page 52, the PLL will lock to the incoming SAI_LRCK and
         generate an output master clock (RMCK) of 256Fs. Table 2 shows the output of the PLL with typical input
         Fs values for SAI_LRCK.
         See “Appendix C: PLL Filter” on page 77 for more information concerning PLL operation, required filter
         components, optimal layout guidelines, and jitter-attenuation characteristics.

4.5.2   OMCK System Clock Mode
        A special clock-switching mode is available that allows the clock that is input through the OMCK pin to be
        used as the internal master clock. This feature is controlled by the SW_CTRLx bits in register “Clock Con-
        trol (address 06h)” on page 52. An advanced auto-switching mode is also implemented to maintain mas-
        ter clock functionality. The clock auto-switching mode allows the clock input through OMCK to be used as
        a clock in the system without any disruption when the PLL loses lock, for example, when the input is re-
        moved from the receiver. This clock-switching is done glitch-free. A clock adhering to the specifications
        detailed in the Switching Characteristics table on page 11 must be applied to the OMCK pin at all times
        that the FRC_PLL_LK bit is set to ‘0’ (See “Force PLL Lock (FRC_PLL_LK)” on page 53).

4.5.3   Master Mode
        In Master Mode, the serial interface timings are derived from an external clock attached to OMCK or from
        the output of the PLL with an input reference to either the S/PDIF Receiver recovered clock or the SAI_L-
        RCK input from the Serial Audio Interface Port. Master clock selection and operation is configured with
        the SW_CTRL1:0 bits in the Clock Control Register (See “Clock Control (address 06h)” on page 52).The
        supported PLL output frequencies are shown in Table 2 below.

4.5.4   Slave Mode
        In Slave Mode, CX_LRCK, CX_SCLK and/or SAI_LRCK, SAI_SCLK operate as inputs. The Left/Right
        clock signal must be equal to the sample rate, Fs, and must be synchronously derived from the supplied
        master clock, OMCK, or the output of the PLL. The serial bit clock, CX_SCLK and/or SAI_SCLK, must be
        synchronously derived from the master clock and be equal to 128x, 64x, 48x or 32x Fs, depending on the
        interface format selected and desired speed mode.
        When the device is clocked from OMCK, the frequency of OMCK must be at least twice the frequency of
        the fastest Slave Mode, SCLK. For example, if both serial ports are in Slave Mode with one SCLK running
        at 32x Fs and the other at 64x Fs, the slowest OMCK signal that can be used to clock the device is
        128x Fs.

        When either serial port is in Slave Mode, its respective LRCK signal must be present for proper device
        operation.
        In Slave Mode, One-Line Mode #1 is supported; One-Line Mode #2 is not.
        The sample rate to OMCK ratios and OMCK frequency requirements for Slave Mode operation are shown
        in Table 1. Refer to Table 3 for required clock ratios.

4.6   Digital Interfaces
4.6.1   Serial Audio Interface Signals
        The CS42518 interfaces to an external Digital Audio Processor via two independent serial ports, the
        CODEC serial port, CODEC_SP and the Serial Audio Interface serial port, SAI_SP. The digital output of
        the internal ADCs can be configured to use either the CX_SDOUT pin or the SAI_SDOUT pin and the
        corresponding serial port clocking signals. These configuration bits and the selection of Single-, Double-
        or Quad-Speed Mode for CODEC_SP and SAI_SP are found in register “Functional Mode (address 03h)”
        on page 47.
        The serial interface clocks, SAI_SCLK for SAI_SP and CX_SCLK for CODEC_SP, are used for transmit-
        ting and receiving audio data. Either SAI_SCLK or CX_SCLK can be generated by the CS42518 (Master
        Mode), or it can be input from an external source (Slave Mode). Master or Slave Mode selection is made
        using bits CODEC_SP M/S and SAI_SP M/S in register “Misc Control (address 05h)” on page 50.
        The Left/Right clock (SAI_LRCK or CX_LRCK) is used to indicate left and right data frames and the start
        of a new sample period. It may be an output of the CS42518 (Master Mode), or it may be generated by
        an external source (Slave Mode). As described in later sections, particular modes of operation do allow
        the sample rate, Fs, of the SAI_SP and the CODEC_SP to be different, but must be multiples of each
        other.
        The serial data interface format selection (Left/Right-Justified, I²S or One-Line Mode) for the Serial Audio
        Interface serial port data out pin, SAI_SDOUT, the CODEC serial port data out pin, CX_SDOUT, and the
        CODEC input pins, CX_SDIN1:4, is configured using the appropriate bits in the register “Interface For-
        mats (address 04h)” on page 49. The serial audio data is presented in two's complement binary form with
        the MSB first in all formats.
        CX_SDIN1, CX_SDIN2, CX_SDIN3 and CX_SDIN4 are the serial data input pins supplying the associ-
        ated internal DAC. CX_SDOUT, the ADC data output pin, carries data from the two internal 24-bit ADCs
        and, when configured for one-line mode, up to four additional ADC channels attached externally to the
        signals ADCIN1 and ADCIN2 (typically two CS5361 stereo ADCs). When operated in One-Line Mode,
        6 channels of DAC data are input on CX_SDIN1, two additional DAC channels on CX_SDIN4, and 6 chan-
        nels of ADC data are output on CX_SDOUT. Table 4 on page 27 outlines the serial port channel alloca-
        tions.

4.6.2      Serial Audio Interface Formats
           The CODEC_SP and SAI_SP digital audio serial ports support five formats with varying bit depths from
           16 to 24 as shown in Figures 10 to 14. These formats are selected using the configuration bits in the reg-
           isters, “Functional Mode (address 03h)” on page 47 and “Interface Formats (address 04h)” on page 49.
           For the diagrams below, Single-Speed Mode is equivalent to Fs = 32, 44.1, 48 kHz; Double-Speed Mode
           is for Fs = 64, 88.2, 96 kHz; and Quad-Speed Mode is for Fs = 176.4, 196 kHz.

           only left-justified, 24-bit samples at 64Fs or 128Fs. This interface is not affected by any of the serial port
           configuration register bit settings. These serial data lines are used when supporting One-Line Mode of
           operation with external ADCs attached. If these signals are not being used, they should be tied together
           and wired to GND via a pull-down resistor.

           For proper operation, the CS42518 must be configured to select which SCLK/LRCK is being used to clock
           the external ADCs. The EXT ADC SCLK bit in register “Misc Control (address 05h)” on page 50 must be
           set accordingly. Set this bit to ‘1’ if the external ADCs are wired using the CODEC_SP clocks. If the ADCs
           are wired to use the SAI_SP clocks, set this bit to ‘0’.

This One Line Mode configuration #3 will support up to 8 channels of DAC data, 6 channels of ADC data and 2
channels of S/PDIF received data and will handle up to 20-bit samples at a sampling frequency of 48 kHz on all
channels for both the DAC and ADC. The output data stream of the internal and external ADCs is configured to use
the CX_SDOUT output and run at the CODEC_SP clock speeds. One Line Mode #2, which supports 24-bit sam-
ples, is not supported by this configuration.

           S/PDIF received data. OLM Config #4 will handle up to 20-bit ADC samples at an Fs of 48 kHz and 24-
           bit DAC samples at an Fs of 48 kHz. Since the ADC’s data stream is configured to use the SAI_SDOUT
           output and the internal and external ADCs are clocked from the SAI_SP, the sample rate for the CODEC
           Serial Port can be different from the sample rate of the Serial Audio Interface serial port.

          This One-Line Mode configuration can support up to 8 channels of DAC data 2 channels of ADC data and
          2 channels of S/PDIF received data and will handle up to 24-bit samples at a sampling frequency of 48 kHz
          on all channels for both the DAC and ADC. The output data stream of the internal ADCs can be configured
          to use the CX_SDOUT output and run at the CODEC_SP clock speeds or to use the SAI_SDOUT data
          output and run at the SAI_SP rate. The CODEC_SP and SAI_SP can operate at different Fs rates.

4.7      Control Port Description and Timing
         The control port is used to access the registers, allowing the CS42518 to be configured for the desired op-
         erational modes and formats. The operation of the control port may be completely asynchronous with re-
         spect to the audio sample rates. However, to avoid potential interference problems, the control port pins
         should remain static if no operation is required.
         The control port has two modes: SPI and I²C, with the CS42518 acting as a slave device. SPI mode is se-
         lected if there is a high-to-low transition on the AD0/CS pin after the RST pin has been brought high. I²C
         mode is selected by connecting the AD0/CS pin through a resistor to VLC or DGND, thereby permanently
         selecting the desired AD0 bit address state.
4.7.1      SPI Mode
           In SPI mode, CS is the CS42518 chip-select signal; CCLK is the control port bit clock (input into the
           CS42518 from the microcontroller); CDIN is the input data line from the microcontroller, and CDOUT is
           the output data line to the microcontroller. Data is clocked in on the rising edge of CCLK and out on the
           falling edge.
           Figure 21 shows the operation of the control port in SPI mode. To write to a register, bring CS low. The
           first seven bits on CDIN form the chip address and must be 1001111. The eighth bit is a read/write indi-
           cator (R/W), which should be low to write. The next eight bits form the Memory Address Pointer (MAP),
           which is set to the address of the register that is to be updated. The next eight bits are the data which will
           be placed into the register designated by the MAP. During writes, the CDOUT output stays in the Hi-Z
           state. It may be externally pulled high or low with a 47 k resistor, if desired.
           There is a MAP auto-increment capability, enabled by the INCR bit in the MAP register. If INCR is a zero,
           the MAP will stay constant for successive read or writes. If INCR is set to a 1, the MAP will auto-increment
           after each byte is read or written, allowing block reads or writes of successive registers.
           To read a register, the MAP has to be set to the correct address by executing a partial write cycle which
           finishes (CS high) immediately after the MAP byte. The MAP auto increment bit (INCR) may be set or not,
           as desired. To begin a read, bring CS low, send out the chip address and set the read/write bit (R/W) high.
           The next falling edge of CCLK will clock out the MSB of the addressed register (CDOUT will leave the high
           impedance state). If the MAP auto-increment bit is set to 1, the data for successive registers will appear
           consecutively.

4.7.2     I²C Mode
          In I²C mode, SDA is a bidirectional data line. Data is clocked into and out of the part by the clock, SCL.
          There is no CS pin. Pins AD0 and AD1 form the two least-significant bits of the chip address and should
          be connected through a resistor to VLC or DGND as desired. The state of the pins is sensed while the
          CS42518 is being reset.
          The signal timings for a read and write cycle are shown in Figure 22 and Figure 23. A Start condition is
          defined as a falling transition of SDA while the clock is high. A Stop condition is a rising transition while
          the clock is high. All other transitions of SDA occur while the clock is low. The first byte sent to the
          CS42518 after a Start condition consists of a 7-bit chip address field and a R/W bit (high for a read, low
          for a write). The upper 5 bits of the 7-bit address field are fixed at 10011. To communicate with a CS42518,
          the chip address field, which is the first byte sent to the CS42518, should match 10011, followed by the
          settings of the AD1 and AD0. The eighth bit of the address is the R/W bit. If the operation is a write, the
          next byte is the Memory Address Pointer (MAP) which selects the register to be read or written. If the op-
          eration is a read, the contents of the register pointed to by the MAP will be output. Setting the auto-incre-
          ment bit in MAP allows successive reads or writes of consecutive registers. Each byte is separated by an
          acknowledge bit. The ACK bit is output from the CS42518 after each input byte is read and is input to the
          CS42518 from the microcontroller after each transmitted byte.

          Since the read operation cannot set the MAP, an aborted write operation is used as a preamble. As shown
          in Figure 23, the write operation is aborted after the acknowledge for the MAP byte by sending a stop con-
          dition. The following pseudocode illustrates an aborted write operation followed by a read operation.
              Send start condition.
              Send 10011xx0 (chip address & write operation).
              Receive acknowledge bit.
              Send MAP byte, auto increment off.
              Receive acknowledge bit.
              Send stop condition, aborting write.

                                                                                                       CS42518
            Send start condition.
            Send 10011xx1(chip address & read operation).
            Receive acknowledge bit.
            Receive byte, contents of selected register.
            Send acknowledge bit.
            Send stop condition.
         Setting the auto increment bit in the MAP allows successive reads or writes of consecutive registers. Each
         byte is separated by an acknowledge bit.
4.8   Interrupts
      The CS42518 has a comprehensive interrupt capability. The INT output pin is intended to drive the interrupt
      input pin on the host microcontroller. The INT pin may be set to be active low, active high or active low with
      no active pull-up transistor. This last mode is used for active low, wired-OR hook-ups, with multiple periph-
      erals connected to the microcontroller interrupt input pin.
      Many conditions can cause an interrupt, as listed in the interrupt status register descriptions (see “Interrupt
      Status (address 20h) (Read Only)” on page 63). Each source may be masked off through mask register bits.
      In addition, each source may be set to rising edge, falling edge, or level-sensitive. Combined with the option
      of level-sensitive or edge-sensitive modes within the microcontroller, many different configurations are pos-
      sible, depending on the needs of the equipment designer.
4.9   Reset and Power-Up
      Reliable power-up can be accomplished by keeping the device in reset until the power supplies, clocks and
      configuration pins are stable. It is also recommended that reset be activated if the analog or digital supplies
      drop below the recommended operating condition to prevent power-glitch-related issues.
      When RST is low, the CS42518 enters a low-power mode and all internal states are reset, including the
      control port and registers, and the outputs are muted. When RST is high, the control port becomes opera-
      tional, and the desired settings should be loaded into the control registers. Writing a 0 to the PDN bit in the
      Power Control Register will then cause the part to leave the low-power state and begin operation. If the in-
      ternal PLL is selected as the clock source, the serial audio outputs will be enabled after the PLL has settled
      (see “Power Control (address 02h)” on page 46 for more details).
      The delta-sigma modulators settle in a matter of microseconds after the analog section is powered, either
      through the application of power or by setting the RST pin high. However, the voltage reference will take
      much longer to reach a final value due to the presence of external capacitance on the FILT+ pin. A time
      delay of approximately 80 ms is required after applying power to the device or after exiting a reset state.
      During this voltage reference ramp delay, all serial ports and DAC outputs will be automatically muted.
4.10  Power Supply, Grounding, and PCB Layout
      As with any high-resolution converter, the CS42518 requires careful attention to power supply and ground-
      ing arrangements if its potential performance is to be realized. Figure 5 shows the recommended power ar-
      rangements, with VA and VARX connected to clean supplies. VD, which powers the digital circuitry, may be
      run from the system logic supply. Alternatively, VD may be powered from the analog supply via a ferrite
      bead. In this case, no additional devices should be powered from VD.

                                                                                                  CS42518
   For applications where the output of the PLL is required to be low jitter, use a separate, low-noise analog
   +5 V supply for VARX, decoupled to AGND. In addition, a separate region of analog ground plane around
   the FILT+, VQ, LPFLT, REFGND, AGND, VA, VARX, RXP/and RXP0 pins is recommended.
   Extensive use of power and ground planes, ground plane fill in unused areas and surface mount decoupling
   capacitors are recommended. Decoupling capacitors should be as near to the pins of the CS42518 as pos-
   sible. The low value ceramic capacitor should be the nearest to the pin and should be mounted on the same
   side of the board as the CS42518 to minimize inductance effects. All signals, especially clocks, should be
   kept away from the FILT+, VQ and LPFLT pins in order to avoid unwanted coupling into the modulators and
   PLL. The FILT+ and VQ decoupling capacitors, particularly the 0.1 µF, must be positioned to minimize the
   electrical path from FILT+ and REFGND. The CDB42518 evaluation board demonstrates the optimum lay-
   out and power supply arrangements.

             sence of a clock signal on OMCK. When set to a ‘1’b, the auto-detect sample frequency feature will
             be disabled and the SW_CTRLX bits must be set to ‘00’b. The OMCK/PLL_CLK Ratio (address 07h)
             (Read Only) register contents are not valid, and the PLL_CLK[2:0] bits will be set to ‘111’b. Use the

6.9.4   RECEIVER CLOCK FREQUENCY (RCVR_CLKX)
          Default = xxx
          Function:
             The CS42518 detects the ratio between the OMCK and the recovered clock from the PLL. Given the
             absolute frequency of OMCK, this ratio may be used to determine the absolute frequency of the PLL
             clock.
             If a 12.2880 MHz, 18.4320 MHz, or 24.5760 MHz clock is applied to OMCK and the OMCK_FREQX
             bits are set accordingly (see “OMCK Frequency (OMCK Freqx)” on page 52), the absolute frequency
             of the PLL clock is reflected in the RCVR_CLKX bits according to Table 16. If the absolute frequency
             of the PLL clock does not match one of the frequencies given in Table 16, these bits will reflect the
             closest available value.
             If the frequency of OMCK is not equal to 12.2880 MHz, 18.4320 MHz, or 24.5760 MHz, the contents
             of the RCVR_CLKX bits will be inaccurate and should be disregarded. In this case, an external con-
             troller may use the contents of the OMCK/PLL_CLK ratio register and the known OMCK frequency to

6.11.1 SINGLE VOLUME CONTROL (SNGVOL)
          Default = 0
          Function:
              The individual channel volume levels are independently controlled by their respective Volume Control
              registers when this function is disabled. When enabled, the volume on all channels is determined by
              the A1 Channel Volume Control register and the other Volume Control registers are ignored.
6.11.2 SOFT RAMP AND ZERO CROSS CONTROL (SZCX)
          Default = 00
          00 - Immediate Change
          01 - Zero Cross
          10 - Soft Ramp
          11 - Soft Ramp on Zero Crossings
          Function:
        Immediate Change
              When Immediate Change is selected, all level changes will take effect immediately in one step.
        Zero Cross
              Zero Cross Enable dictates that signal-level changes, either by attenuation changes or muting, will
              occur on a signal zero crossing to minimize audible artifacts. The requested level-change will occur
              after a timeout period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms at 48 kHz sample
              rate) if the signal does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is independently mon-
              itored and implemented for each channel.
        Soft Ramp
              Soft Ramp allows level changes, both muting and attenuation, to be implemented by incrementally
              ramping, in 1/8 dB steps, from the current level to the new level at a rate of 1 dB per 8 left/right clock
              periods.
        Soft Ramp on Zero Crossing
              Soft Ramp and Zero Cross Enable dictates that signal level changes, either by attenuation changes
              or muting, will occur in 1/8 dB steps and be implemented on a signal zero crossing. The 1/8 dB level
              change will occur after a timeout period between 512 and 1024 sample periods (10.7 ms to 21.3 ms
              at 48 kHz sample rate) if the signal does not encounter a zero crossing. The zero cross function is
              independently monitored and implemented for each channel.

6.11.3 AUTO-MUTE (AMUTE)
        Default = 1
        0 - Disabled
        1 - Enabled
        Function:
             The digital-to-analog converters of the CS42518 will mute the output following the reception of 8192
             consecutive audio samples of static 0 or -1. A single sample of non-static data will release the mute.
             Detection and muting is done independently for each channel. The quiescent voltage on the output
             will be retained, and the MUTEC pin will go active during the mute period. The muting function is af-
             fected, similar to volume control changes, by the Soft and Zero Cross bits (SZC[1:0]).
6.11.4 SERIAL AUDIO INTERFACE SERIAL PORT MUTE (MUTE SAI_SP)
        Default = 0
        0 - Disabled
        1 - Enabled
        Function:
             When enabled, the Serial Audio Interface port (SAI_SP) will be muted.
6.11.5 SOFT VOLUME RAMP-UP AFTER ERROR (RMP_UP)
        Default = 0
        0 - Disabled
        1 - Enabled
        Function:
             An un-mute will be performed after executing a filter mode change, after a MCLK/LRCK ratio change
             or error, and after changing the Functional Mode. When this feature is enabled, this un-mute is affect-
             ed, similar to attenuation changes, by the Soft and Zero Cross bits (SZC[1:0]). When disabled, an
             immediate un-mute is performed in these instances.
        Note:      For best results, it is recommended that this bit be used in conjunction with the RMP_DN bit.
6.11.6 SOFT RAMP-DOWN BEFORE FILTER MODE CHANGE (RMP_DN)
        Default = 0
        0 - Disabled
        1 - Enabled
        Function:
             A mute will be performed prior to executing a filter mode or de-emphasis mode change. When this
             feature is enabled, this mute is affected, similar to attenuation changes, by the Soft and Zero Cross
             bits (SZC[1:0]). When disabled, an immediate mute is performed prior to executing a filter mode or
             de-emphasis mode change.
        Note:      For best results, it is recommended that this bit be used in conjunction with the RMP_UP bit.

          Function:
               The digital-to-analog converter outputs of the CS42518 will mute when enabled. The quiescent volt-
               age on the outputs will be retained. The muting function is affected, similar to attenuation changes,
               by the Soft and Zero Cross bits (SZC[1:0]).

          Function:
               The Digital Volume Control registers allow independent control of the signal levels in 0.5 dB incre-
               ments from 0 to -127 dB. Volume settings are decoded as shown in Table 15. The volume changes
               are implemented as dictated by the Soft and Zero Cross bits (SZC[1:0]). All volume settings less than
               -127 dB are equivalent to enabling the MUTE bit for the given channel.

For all bits in this register, a “1” means the associated interrupt condition has occurred at least once since the reg-
ister was last read. A ”0” means the associated interrupt condition has NOT occurred since the last reading of the
register. Reading the register resets all bits to 0. Status bits that are masked off in the associated mask register will
always be “0” in this register.

              Function:
              The two Interrupt Mode registers form a 2-bit code for each Interrupt Status register function. There
              are three ways to set the INT pin active in accordance with the interrupt condition. In the Rising edge
              active mode, the INT pin becomes active on the arrival of the interrupt condition. In the Falling edge
              active mode, the INT pin becomes active on the removal of the interrupt condition. In Level active
              mode, the INT interrupt pin becomes active during the interrupt condition. Be aware that the active
              level (Active High or Low) only depends on the INT[1:0] bits located in the register “Receiver Mode
              Control (address 1Eh)” on page 61.

               The bits in this register serve as masks for the corresponding bits of the Receiver Errors register. If a
               mask bit is set to 1, the error is unmasked, meaning that its occurrence will appear in the receiver
               errors register, will affect the RERR interrupt, and will affect the current audio sample according to

            will not appear in the receiver error register, will not affect the RERR interrupt, and will not affect the
            current audio sample. The CCRC and QCRC bits behave differently from the other bits: they do not
            affect the current audio sample even when unmasked.

            Determines the polarity of the MUTEC pin.
6.27.2 CHANNEL MUTES SELECT (M_AOUTXX)
            Default = 11111
            0 - Channel mute is not mapped to the MUTEC pin
            1 - Channel mute is mapped to the MUTEC pin
            Function:
            Determines which channel mutes will be mapped to the MUTEC pin. If no channel mute bits are
            mapped, then the MUTEC pin is driven to the “active” state as defined by the POLARITY bit. These
            Channel Mute Select bits are “ANDed” together in order for the MUTEC pin to go active. This means
            that if multiple Channel Mutes are selected to be mapped to the MUTEC pin, all corresponding chan-
            nels must be muted before the MUTEC will go active.

7. PARAMETER DEFINITIONS
Dynamic Range
           The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified
           bandwidth. Dynamic Range is a signal-to-noise ratio measurement over the specified band width made
           with a -60 dBFS signal. 60 dB is added to resulting measurement to refer the measurement to full-scale.
           This technique ensures that the distortion components are below the noise level and do not effect the
           measurement. This measurement technique has been accepted by the Audio Engineering Society,
           AES17-1991, and the Electronic Industries Association of Japan, EIAJ CP-307. Expressed in decibels.
Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise
           The ratio of the rms value of the signal to the rms sum of all other spectral components over the specified
           band width (typically 10 Hz to 20 kHz), including distortion components. Expressed in decibels. Measured
           at -1 and -20 dBFS as suggested in AES17-1991 Annex A.
Frequency Response
           A measure of the amplitude response variation from 10 Hz to 20 kHz relative to the amplitude response
           at 1 kHz. Units in decibels.
Interchannel Isolation
           A measure of crosstalk between the left and right channels. Measured for each channel at the converter's
           output with no signal to the input under test and a full-scale signal applied to the other channel. Units in
           decibels.
Interchannel Gain Mismatch
           The gain difference between left and right channels. Units in decibels.
Gain Error
           The deviation from the nominal full-scale analog output for a full-scale digital input.
Gain Drift
           The change in gain value with temperature. Units in ppm/°C.
Offset Error
           The deviation of the mid-scale transition (111...111 to 000...000) from the ideal. Units in mV.

8. APPENDIX A: EXTERNAL FILTERS
8.1   ADC Input Filter
      The analog modulator samples the input at 6.144 MHz (internal MCLK=12.288 MHz). The digital filter will
      reject signals within the stopband of the filter. However, there is no rejection for input signals which are
      (n  6.144 MHz) the digital passband frequency, where n=0,1,2,... Refer to Figure 24 for a recommended
      analog input buffer that will attenuate any noise energy at 6.144 MHz, in addition to providing the optimum
      source impedance for the modulators. The use of capacitors that have a large voltage coefficient (such as
      general-purpose ceramics) must be avoided since these can degrade signal linearity.

8.2   DAC Output Filter
      The CS42518 is a linear phase design and does not include phase or amplitude compensation for an exter-
      nal filter. Therefore, the DAC system phase and amplitude response will be dependent on the external an-
      alog circuitry.

9. APPENDIX B: S/PDIF RECEIVER
9.1  Error Reporting and Hold Function
     The UNLOCK bit indicates whether the PLL is locked to the incoming S/PDIF data. The V bit reflects the
     current validity bit status. The CONF (Confidence) bit indicates the amplitude of the eye pattern opening,
     indicating a link that is close to generating errors. The BIP (Bi-Phase) error bit indicates an error in incoming
     bi-phase coding. The PAR (Parity) bit indicates a received parity error.
     The error bits are “sticky”, meaning they are set on the first occurrence of the associated error and will re-
     main set until the user reads the register through the control port. This enables the register to log all un-
     masked errors that occurred since the last time the register was read.
     The Receiver Errors Mask register (See “Receiver Errors Mask (address 27h)” on page 68) allows masking
     of individual errors. The bits in this register serve as masks for the corresponding bits of the Receiver Error
     Register. If a mask bit is set to 1, the error is unmasked, which implies the following: its occurrence will be
     reported in the receiver error register, invoke the occurrence of a RERR interrupt, and affect the current au-
     dio sample according to the status of the HOLD bits. The HOLD bits allow a choice of holding the previous
     sample, replacing the current sample with zero (mute), or not changing the current audio sample. If a mask
     bit is set to 0, the error is masked, which implies the following: its occurrence will not be reported in the re-
     ceiver error register, the RERR interrupt will not be generated, and the current audio sample will not be af-
     fected. The QCRC and CCRC errors do not affect the current audio sample, even if unmasked.
9.2  Channel Status Data Handling
     The setting of the CHS bit in the register “Channel Status Data Buffer Control (address 24h)” on page 65
     determines whether the channel status decodes are from the A channel (CHS = 0) or B channel (CHS = 1).
     The PRO (professional) bit is extracted directly. For consumer data, the COPY (copyright) bit is extracted,
     and the category code and L bits are decoded to determine SCMS status, indicated by the ORIG (original)
     bit. If the category code is set to General on the incoming S/PDIF stream, copyright will always be indicated
     even when the stream indicates no copyright. Finally, the AUDIO bit is extracted and used to set an AUDIO
     indicator, as described in section 4.4.5, Non-Audio Auto-Detection.
     If 50/15 µs pre-emphasis is detected, and the Receiver Auto De-emphasis control is enabled, then de-em-
     phasis will automatically be applied to the incoming digital PCM data. See “Functional Mode (address 03h)”
     on page 47 for more details.
     The encoded channel status bits which indicate sample word length are decoded according to IEC 60958.
     Audio data routed to the Serial Audio Interface port is unaffected by the word length settings; all 24 bits are
     passed on as received.
     The CS42518 also contains sufficient RAM to store a full block of C data for both A and B channels
     (192 x 2 = 384 bits), and also 384 bits of User (U data) information. The user may read from these buffer
     RAMs through the control port.
     The buffering scheme involves two block-sized buffers, named D and E, as shown in Figure 26. The MSB
     of each byte represents the first bit in the serial C data stream. For example, the MSB of byte 0 (which is at
     control port address 4Ah) is the consumer/professional bit for channel status block A.
     The first buffer (D) accepts incoming C data from the S/PDIF receiver. The 2nd buffer (E) accepts entire
     blocks of data from the D buffer. The E buffer is also accessible from the control port, allowing reading of
     the C data.

                                 Figure 26. Channel Status Data Buffer Structure
9.2.1    Channel Status Data E Buffer Access
         The user can monitor the incoming Channel Status data by reading the E buffer, which is mapped into the
         register space of the CS42518 through the control port Data Buffer. The Data Buffer must first be config-
         ured to point to the address space of the C data. This is accomplished by setting the BSEL bit to ‘0’ in the
         register “Channel Status Data Buffer Control (address 24h)” on page 65.
         The user can configure the Interrupt Mask Register to cause an interrupt whenever any data-bit changes
         are detected when D to E Channel Status buffer transfers occur. If no data bits have changed within the
         current transfer of data from D to E, no interrupt will be generated. This allows determination of the ac-
         ceptable time periods to interact with the E buffer. See “Interrupt Mask (address 21h)” on page 64 for more
         details.
         The E buffer is organized as 24 x 16-bit words. For each word the MS Byte is the A channel data, and the
         LS Byte is the B channel data (see Figure 26). There are two methods of accessing this memory, known
         as One-Byte Mode and Two-Byte Mode. The desired mode is selected by setting the CAM bit in the Chan-
         nel Status Data Buffer Control Register.
       9.2.1.1       One-Byte Mode
       In many applications, the channel status blocks for the A and B channels will be identical. In this situation,
       the user may read a byte from one of the channel's blocks since the corresponding byte for the other chan-
       nel will likely be the same. One-Byte Mode takes advantage of the often identical nature of A and B channel
       status data. When reading data in One-Byte Mode, a single byte is returned, which can be from channel A
       or B data, depending on a register control bit.
       One-Byte Mode saves the user substantial control port access time, as it effectively accesses two bytes
       worth of information in 1 byte's worth of access time. If the control port's auto-increment addressing is used
       in combination with this mode, multi-byte accesses, such as full-block reads, can be done especially effi-
       ciently.
       9.2.1.2       Two-Byte Mode
       There are those applications in which the A and B channel status blocks will not be the same, and the user
       is interested in accessing both blocks. In these situations, Two-Byte Mode should be used to access the
       E buffer.
       In this mode, a read will cause the CS42518 to output two bytes from its control port. The first byte out will
       represent the A channel status data, and the second byte will represent the B channel status data.

                                                                                                              CS42518
9.2.2    Serial Copy Management System (SCMS)
         The CS42518 allows read access to all the channel status bits. For consumer mode SCMS compliance,
         the host microcontroller needs to read and interpret the Category Code, Copy bit and L bit appropriately.
9.3   User (U) Data E Buffer Access
      Entire blocks of U data are buffered using a cascade of two block-sized RAMs to perform the buffering as
      described in the Channel Status section. The user has access to the E buffer through the control port Data
      Buffer which is mapped into the register space of the CS42518. The Data Buffer must first be configured to
      point to the address space of the U data. This is accomplished by setting the BSEL bit to ‘1’ in the register
      “Channel Status Data Buffer Control (address 24h)” on page 65.
      The user can configure the Interrupt Mask Register to cause an interrupt whenever any data bit changes
      are detected when D to E Channel Status buffer transfers occur. If no data bits have changed within the
      current transfer of data from D to E, no interrupt will be generated. This allows determination of the accept-
      able time periods to interact with the E buffer. See “Interrupt Mask (address 21h)” on page 64 for more de-
      tails.
      The U buffer access only operates in Two-Byte Mode, since there is no concept of A and B blocks for user
      data. The arrangement of the data is as follows: Bit15[A7]Bit14[B7]Bit13[A6]Bit12[B6]...Bit1[A0]Bit0[B0].
      The arrangement of the data in each byte is as follows: MSB is the first received bit and is the first transmit-
      ted bit. The first byte read is the first byte received, and the first byte sent is the first byte transmitted. When
      two bytes are read from the E buffer, the bits are presented in the following arrangement:
      A[7]B[7]A[6]B[6]....A[0]B[0].
9.3.1    Non-Audio Auto-Detection
         The CS42518 S/PDIF receiver can detect non-audio data originating from AC-3 or MPEG encoders. This
         is accomplished by looking for a 96-bit sync code, consisting of 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000, 0x0000,
         0xF872, and 0x4E1F. When the sync code is detected, an internal AUTODETECT signal will be asserted.
         If no additional sync codes are detected within the next 4096 frames, AUTODETECT will be de-asserted
         until another sync code is detected. The AUDIO bit in the Receiver Channel Status register is the logical
         OR of AUTODETECT and the received channel status bit 1. If non-audio data is detected, the data will
         be processed exactly as if it were normal audio. It is up to the user to mute the outputs as required.
       9.3.1.1      Format Detection
       The CS42518 can automatically detect various serial audio input formats. The Receiver Status register
       (08h) is used to indicate a detected format. The register will indicate if uncompressed PCM data, IEC61937
       data, DTS-LD data, DTS-CD data, HDCD data, or digital silence was detected. Additionally, the IEC61937
       Pc/Pd burst preambles are available in registers 09h-0Ch. See the register descriptions for more informa-
       tion.

10.APPENDIX C: PLL FILTER
The PLL has been designed to only use the preambles of the S/PDIF stream to provide lock update information to
the PLL. This results in the PLL being immune to data-dependent jitter effects because the S/PDIF preambles do
not vary with the data.
The PLL has the ability to lock onto a wide range of input sample rates with no external component changes. The
nominal center sample rate is the sample rate that the PLL first locks onto upon application of an S/PDIF data
stream.

   The external PLL component values listed in Table 21 have a high corner-frequency jitter-attenuation
   curve, take a short time to lock, and offer good output jitter performance. It should be noted that the PLL
   component values shown must be used with their associated locking modes as shown in Table 21. Use
   of any other combinations of component values and locking modes may result in unstable PLL behavior.
   Configuration 1 may be used for hardware and software backward-compatibility for designs originally
   made with the CS42518 Revision C.
   Configuration 2 may be used for hardware-only backward-compatibility for designs originally made with
   the CS42518 Revision C. Using the Revision D default locking mode of ‘01’ will provide improved wide-
   band jitter rejection in Double- and Quad-Speed modes.
   Configuration 3 may be used for new designs with the CS42518 Revision D, or for existing designs in
   which the hardware and software may be changed to use the specified PLL component values and
   LOCKM[1:0] register setting. This configuration provides the best DAC and ADC performance when
   clocked from the PLL recovered clock.
   The Typical Connection Diagram, Figure 5, shows the recommended configuration of the two capacitors
   and one resistor that comprise the PLL filter. It is important to treat the LPFILT pin as a low-level analog
   input. It is suggested that the ground end of the PLL filter be returned directly to the AGND pin inde-

10.1.2 Jitter Attenuation
        Figures 28 and 29 show the jitter-attenuation characteristics for the 32-192 kHz sample rate range when
        used with the external PLL component values and locking modes as specified in Table 21.
        The AES3 and IEC60958-4 specifications do not have allowances for locking to sample rates less than
        32 kHz or for locking to the SAI_LRCK input. These specifications state a maximum of 2 dB jitter gain or
        peaking.

10.1.3 Capacitor Selection
       The type of capacitors used for the PLL filter can have a significant effect on receiver performance. Large
       or exotic film capacitors are not necessary because their leads, and the required longer circuit board trac-
       es, add undesirable inductance to the circuit. Surface-mount ceramic capacitors are a good choice be-
       cause their own inductance is low, and they can be mounted close to the LPFLT pin to minimize trace
       inductance. For CRIP, a C0G or NPO dielectric is recommended; and for CFILT, an X7R dielectric is pre-
       ferred. Avoid capacitors with large temperature co-coefficient, or capacitors with high dielectric constants,
       that are sensitive to shock and vibration. These include the Z5U and Y5V dielectrics.

10.1.4 Circuit Board Layout
          Board layout and capacitor choice affect each other and determine the performance of the PLL. Figure
          30 illustrates a suggested layout for the PLL filter components and for bypassing the analog supply volt-
          age. The 10 µF bypass capacitor is an electrolytic in a surface-mount case A or thru-hole package. RFILT,
          CFILT, CRIP, and the 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor are in an 0805 form factor. The 0.01 µF decoupling
          capacitor is in the 0603 form factor. The traces are on the top surface of the board with the IC so that there
          is no via inductance. The traces themselves are short to minimize the inductance in the filter path. The
          VARX and AGND traces extend back to their origin and are shown only in truncated form in the drawing.

11.APPENDIX D: EXTERNAL AES3-S/PDIF-IEC60958 RECEIVER
   COMPONENTS
11.1 AES3 Receiver External Components
     The CS42518 AES3 receiver is designed to accept only consumer-standard interfaces. The standards call
     for an unbalanced circuit having a receiver impedance of 75  ±5%. The connector is an RCA phono socket.
     The receiver circuit is shown in Figure 31. Figure 32 shows an implementation of the Input S/PDIF Multi-
     plexer using the consumer interface.
     In the configuration of systems, it is important to avoid ground loops and DC current flowing down the shield
     of the cable that could result when boxes with different ground potentials are connected. Generally, it is
     good practice to ground the shield to the chassis of the transmitting unit and connect the shield through a
     capacitor to chassis ground at the receiver. However, in some cases, it is advantageous to have the ground
     of two boxes held at the same potential and make the electrical connection through the cable shield. Gen-
     erally, it may be a good idea to provide the option of grounding or capacitively coupling the shield to the
     chassis.
     When more than one RXP pin is driven simultaneously, as shown in Figure 32, there is a potential for cross-
     talk between inputs. To minimize this crosstalk, provide as much trace separation as is reasonable and
     choose non-adjacent inputs when possible.
     The circuit shown in Figure 33 may be used when external RS422 receivers, optical receivers or other
     TTL/CMOS logic outputs drive the CS42518 receiver input.
