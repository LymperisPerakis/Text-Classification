Low Power Stereo Codec with
Headphone Amp                                                                                             SGTL5000
   The SGTL5000 is a Low Power Stereo Codec with Headphone Amp
from Freescale, and is designed to provide a complete audio solution
for products needing LINEIN, MIC_IN, LINEOUT, headphone-out, and                                           AUDIO CODEC
digital I/O. Deriving it’s architecture from best in class, Freescale
integrated products that are currently on the market. The SGTL5000 is
able to achieve ultra low power with very high performance and
functionality, all in one of the smallest footprints available. Target
markets include media players, navigation devices, smart phones,
tablets, medical equipment, exercise equipment, consumer audio
equipment, etc. Features such as capless headphone design and an
internal PLL help lower overall system cost.

Notes
    1. The SGTL5000 has an internal reset that is deasserted 8 SYS_MCLK cycles after all power rails have been brought up. After this time,
         communication can start.
    2. 1.0s represents 8 SYS_MCLK cycles at the minimum 8.0 MHz SYS_MCLK.
    3.   This section provides timing for the SGTL5000 while in I2C mode (CTRL_MODE = 0).
    4.   This section provides timing for the SGTL5000 while in SPI mode (CTRL_MODE = 1)
    5.   The following are the specifications and timing for I2S port. The timing applies to all formats.

                                             DAP_COEF_WR_XX_LSB registers (XX= B0,B1,B2,A1,A2)
                                             2. Set INDEX of the coefficient from the table below.
                                             3. Set the WR bit to load the coefficient.
                                             NOTE: Steps 2 and 3 can be performed with a single write to
                                             DAP_FILTER_COEF_ACCESS register.
                                             Coefficient address:

                                     Hex Value = (1 - (10^(-(Rate_dBs/(20*SYS_FS)))) * 2^19

2. If both VDDIO and VDDA are equal to or below 3V, the CPFILT pin (pin
17) must be connected to a 0.1uF capacitor to ground. If either is above                                                             C9    1uF

CTRL_ADR0_CS (pin 31) is tied to ground.
4. AGND (pin 7) should be "star" connected to the jack grounds for
LINEIN and LINEOUT, and to the VAG capacitor ground. This node
should via to the ground plane (or connected to ground) at a single point.
