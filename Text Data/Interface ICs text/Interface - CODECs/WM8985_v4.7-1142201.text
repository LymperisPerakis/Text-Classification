TERMINOLOGY
1.    Full-scale input and output levels scale in relation to AVDD1 or AVDD2 depending upon the input or output used. For
      example, when AVDD1 = 3.3V, 0dBFS = 1Vrms (0dBV). When AVDD < 3.3V the absolute level of 0dBFS will decrease
      with a linear relationship to AVDD.
2.    Input level to RIP and LIP in differential configurations is limited to a maximum of -3dB or performance will be reduced.
3.    Signal-to-noise ratio (dBFS) – SNR is the difference in level between a reference full scale output signal and the
      device output with no signal applied. This ratio is also called idle channel noise. (No Auto-zero or Automute function is
      employed in achieving these results).
4.    Total Harmonic Distortion (dB) – THD is the difference in level between a reference output signal and the first seven
      harmonics of the output signal. To calculate the ratio, the fundamental frequency of the output signal is notched out
      and an RMS value of the next seven harmonics is calculated.
5.    Total Harmonic Distortion plus Noise (dB) – THD+N is the difference in level between a reference output signal and
      the sum of the harmonics, wide-band noise and interference on the output signal. To calculate the ratio, the
      fundamental frequency of the output signal is notched out and an RMS value of the total harmonics, wide-band noise
      and interference is calculated.
6.    Channel Separation (dB) – Also known as Cross-Talk. This is a measure of the amount one channel is isolated from
      the other. Normally measured by sending a full scale signal down one channel and measuring the other.
                                                                                                            PD, Rev 4.7, February 2012

INTERNAL POWER ON RESET CIRCUIT
                           Figure 7 Internal Power on Reset Circuit Schematic
                           The WM8985 includes an internal Power-On-Reset Circuit, as shown in Figure 7, which is used to
                           reset the digital logic into a default state after power up. The POR circuit is powered from AVDD1 and
                           monitors DCVDD. It asserts PORB low if AVDD1 or DCVDD is below a minimum threshold.
Figure 8 Typical Power up Sequence where AVDD1 is Powered before DCVDD
                           Figure 8 shows a typical power-up sequence where AVDD1 comes up first. When AVDD1 goes
                           above the minimum threshold, Vpora, there is enough voltage for the circuit to guarantee PORB is
                           asserted low and the chip is held in reset. In this condition, all writes to the control interface are
                           ignored. Now AVDD1 is at full supply level. Next DCVDD rises to Vpord_on and PORB is released high
                           and all registers are in their default state and writes to the control interface may take place.
                           On power down, where AVDD1 falls first, PORB is asserted low whenever AVDD1 drops below the
                           minimum threshold Vpora_off.

Figure 9 Typical Power up Sequence where DCVDD is Powered before AVDD1
                           Figure 9 shows a typical power-up sequence where DCVDD comes up first. First it is assumed that
                           DCVDD is already up to specified operating voltage. When AVDD1 goes above the minimum
                           threshold, Vpora, there is enough voltage for the circuit to guarantee PORB is asserted low and the
                           chip is held in reset. In this condition, all writes to the control interface are ignored. When AVDD1
                           rises to Vpora_on, PORB is released high and all registers are in their default state and writes to the
                           control interface may take place.
                           On power down, where DCVDD falls first, PORB is asserted low whenever DCVDD drops below the
                           minimum threshold Vpord_off.

                           Notes:
                           1.   If AVDD1 and DCVDD suffer a brown-out (i.e. drop below the minimum recommended operating
                                level but do not go below Vpora_off or Vpord_off) then the chip will not reset and will resume normal
                                operation when the voltage is back to the recommended level again.
                           2.   The chip will enter reset at power down when AVDD1 or DCVDD falls below Vpora_off or Vpord_off.
                                This may be important if the supply is turned on and off frequently by a power management
                                system.
                           3.   The minimum tpor period is maintained even if DCVDD and AVDD1 have zero rise time. This
                                specification is guaranteed by design rather than test.
                                                                                                           PD, Rev 4.7, February 2012

RECOMMENDED POWER UP/DOWN SEQUENCE
                In order to minimise output pop and click noise, it is recommended that the WM8985 device is
                powered up and down under control using the following sequences:
                Power Up:
                     1.     Turn on external power supplies. Wait for supply voltage to settle.
                     2.     Set low analogue bias mode, BIASCUT = 1
                     3.     Enable thermal shutdown TSDEN = TSOPCTRL = 1
                     4.     Enable Internal bias BIASEN = 1.
                     5.     Mute all outputs and set PGAs to minimum gain, R52 to R57 = 0x140h.
                     6.     Enable VMID independent current bias, POBCTRL = 1.
                     7.     Enable required outputs, DACs and mixers.
                     8.     Enable VMID with required charge time e.g. VMIDSEL=01.
                                         1
                     9.     Wait 500ms
                     10. Setup digital interface, input amplifiers, PLL, ADCs and DACs for desired operation.
                     11. Disable VMID independent current bias, POBCTRL = 0.
                     12. Unmute L/ROUT1 and set desired volume, e.g. for 0dB R52 and R53 = 0x139h.
                     13. Unmute L/ROUT2 and set desired volume, e.g. for 0dB R54 and R55 = 0x139h.
                                2
                Power Down :
                     1.     Disable Thermal shutdown, TSDEN = TSOPCTRL = 0
                     2.     Disable VMIDSEL=00 and BIASEN=0
                                                        3
                     3.     Wait for VMID to discharge
                     4.     Power off registers R1, R2, R3 = 0x000h
                     5.     Remove external power supplies
                Notes:
                1.   Charging time constant is determined by impedance selected by VMIDSEL and the value of
                     decoupling capacitor connected to VMID pin.
                2.   It is possible to interrupt the power down sequence and power up to VMID before the allocated
                     VMID discharge time. This is done by following the power-up sequence omitting steps 4 to 8.
                3.   Discharge time constant is determined by the values of analogue output capacitors.
                                                                                            PD, Rev 4.7, February 2012

                          Notes:
                         1.   The analogue input pin charge time, tmidrail_on, is determined by the VMID pin charge time. This
                              time is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling capacitor and VMID pin input resistance
                              and AVDD1 power supply rise time.
                         2.   The analogue input pin discharge time, tmidrail_off, is determined by the analogue input coupling
                              capacitor discharge time. The time, tmidrail_off, is measured using a 1μF capacitor on the analogue
                              input but will vary dependent upon the value of input coupling capacitor.
                         3.   While the ADC is enabled there will be LSB data bit activity on the ADCDAT pin due to system
                              noise but no significant digital output will be present.
                         4.   The VMIDSEL and BIASEN bits must be set to enable analogue input midrail voltage and for
                              normal ADC operation.
                         5.   ADCDAT data output delay from power up - with power supplies starting from 0V - is determined
                              primarily by the VMID charge time. ADC initialisation and power management bits may be set
                              immediately after POR is released; VMID charge time will be significantly longer and will dictate
                              when the device is stabilised for analogue input.
                         6.   ADCDAT data output delay at power up from device standby (power supplies already applied) is
                              determined by ADC initialisation time, 2/fs.

       1.   The lineout charge time, tline_midrail_on, is determined by the VMID pin charge time. This time is

       2.   It is not advisable to allow DACDAT data input during initialisation of the DAC. If the DAC data
            value is not zero at point of initialisation, then this is likely to cause a pop noise on the analogue
            outputs. The same is also true if the DACDAT is removed at a non-zero value, and no mute
            function has been applied to the signal beforehand.
       3.   The lineout discharge time, tline_midrail_off, is determined by the VMID pin discharge time. This time
            is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling capacitor and VMID pin input resistance. The
            values above were measured using a 4.7μF capacitor.
       4.   The headphone charge time, thp_midrail_on, is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling
            capacitor and VMID pin input resistance and AVDD1 power supply rise time. The values above
            were measured using a 4.7μF VMID decoupling capacitor.
       5.   The headphone discharge time, thp_midrail_off, is dependent upon the value of VMID decoupling
            capacitor and VMID pin input resistance. The values above were measured using a 4.7μF VMID
            decoupling capacitor.

            normal DAC operation.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION
                The WM8985 is a low power audio CODEC combining a high quality stereo audio DAC and ADC, with
                flexible line and microphone input and output processing.
                FEATURES
                The chip offers great flexibility in use, and so can support many different modes of operation as
                follows:
                MICROPHONE INPUTS
                Two pairs of stereo microphone inputs are provided, allowing a pair of stereo microphones to be
                pseudo-differentially connected, with user defined gain. The provision of the common mode input pin
                for each stereo input allows for rejection of common mode noise on the microphone inputs (level
                depends on gain setting chosen). A microphone bias is output from the chip which can be used to
                bias both microphones. The signal routing can be configured to allow manual adjustment of mic
                levels, or to allow the ALC loop to control the level of mic signal that is transmitted.
                Total gain through the microphone paths of up to +55.25dB can be selected.
                PGA AND ALC OPERATION
                A programmable gain amplifier is provided in the input path to the ADC. This may be used manually
                or in conjunction with a mixed analogue/digital automatic level control (ALC) which keeps the
                recording volume constant.
                AUXILIARY ANALOG LINE INPUTS (AUXL, AUXR)
                The inputs, AUXL and AUXR, can be used as a stereo line input or as an input for warning tones (or
                ‘beeps’) etc. These inputs can be summed into the record paths, along with the microphone preamp
                outputs, so allowing for mixing of audio with ‘backing music’ etc as required.
                Additional stereo analogue signals might be connected to the Line inputs of WM8985 (e.g. melody
                chip or FM radio), and the stereo signal listened to via headphones, or recorded, simultaneously if
                required.
                ADC
                The stereo ADC uses a 24-bit high-order over sampling architecture to deliver optimum performance
                with low power consumption.
                HI-FI DAC
                The hi-fi DAC provides high quality audio playback suitable for all portable audio hi-fi type
                applications, including MP3 players and portable disc players of all types.
                OUTPUT MIXERS
                Flexible mixing is provided on the outputs of the device. A stereo mixer is provided for the stereo
                headphone or line outputs, LOUT1/ROUT1, and additional summers on the OUT3/OUT4 outputs
                allow for an optional differential or stereo line output on these pins. Gain adjustment PGAs are
                provided for the LOUT1/ROUT1 and LOUT2/ROUT2 outputs, and signal switching is provided to allow
                for all possible signal combinations.
                                                                                                PD, Rev 4.7, February 2012

WM8985                                                                                                   Production Data
                OUT3 and OUT4 can be configured to provide an additional stereo or mono differential lineout from
                the output of the DACs, the mixers or the input microphone boost stages. They can also provide a
                midrail reference for pseudo differential inputs to external amplifiers.
                AUDIO INTERFACES
                The WM8985 has a standard audio interface, to support the transmission of stereo data to and from
                the chip. This interface is a 3 wire standard audio interface which supports a number of audio data
                formats including:
                             2
                           IS
                           DSP/PCM Mode (a burst mode in which LRC sync plus 2 data packed words are
                            transmitted)
                           MSB-First, left justified
                           MSB-First, right justified
                The interface can operate in master or slave modes.
                CONTROL INTERFACES
                To allow full software control over all features, the WM8985 offers a choice of 2 or 3 wire control
                interface. It is fully compatible and an ideal partner for a wide range of industry standard
                microprocessors, controllers and DSPs.
                Selection of the mode is via the MODE pin. In 2 wire mode, the address of the device is fixed as
                0011010.
                CLOCKING SCHEMES
                WM8985 offers the normal audio DAC clocking scheme operation, where 256fs MCLK is provided to
                the DAC and ADC. A flexible clock divider allows the 256fs DAC clock to be generated from a range
                of input clock frequencies, for example, 256fs, 384fs, 512fs and 768fs.
                A PLL is included which may be used to generate these clocks in the event that they are not available
                from the system controller. This PLL can accept a range of common input clock frequencies between
                8MHz and 50MHz to generate high quality audio clocks. If this PLL is not required for generation of
                these clocks, it can be reconfigured to generate alternative clocks which may then be output on the
                GPIO1 pin and used elsewhere in the system; available in 2-wire control mode only.
                POWER CONTROL
                The design of the WM8985 has given much attention to power consumption without compromising
                performance. The WM8985 operates at low analogue and digital supply voltages, and includes the
                ability to power off any unused parts of the circuitry under software control. It also includes standby
                and power off modes.
INPUT SIGNAL PATH
                 The WM8985 has a number of flexible analogue inputs. There are two input channels, Left and
                 Right, each of which consists of an input PGA stage followed by a boost/mix stage which drives into
                 the hi-fi ADC. Each input path has three input pins which can be configured in a variety of ways to
                 accommodate single-ended, pseudo-differential or dual differential microphones. There are two
                 auxiliary input pins which can be fed into to the input boost/mix stage as well as driving into the
                 output path. A bypass path exists from the output of the boost/mix stage into the output left/right
                 mixers.
                MICROPHONE INPUTS
                The WM8985 can accommodate a variety of microphone configurations including single ended and
                pseudo-differential inputs. The inputs to the left differential input PGA are LIN, LIP and L2. The
                inputs to the right differential input PGA are RIN, RIP and R2.
                In single-ended microphone input configuration the microphone signal should be input to LIN or RIN
                and the non-inverting input of the input PGA clamped to VMID.

       Table 6 Input PGA Control
       INPUT PGA VOLUME CONTROLS
        The input microphone PGAs have a gain range from -12dB to +35.25dB in 0.75dB steps. The gain
        from the LIN/RIN input to the PGA output and from the L2/R2 amplifier to the PGA output are always
        common and controlled by the register bits INPPGAVOLL[5:0] and INPPGABVOLR[5:0]. These
        register bits also affect the LIP pin when LIP2INPPGA=1, the L2 pin when L2_2INPPGA=1, the RIP
        pin when RIP2INPPGA=1 and the L2 pin when L2_2INPPGA=1.
        When the Automatic Level Control (ALC) is enabled the input PGA gains are controlled automatically
        and the INPPGAVOLL and INPPGAVOLR bits should not be used.

       VOLUME UPDATES
       Volume settings will not be applied to the PGAs until a '1' is written to one of the INPPGAVU bits.
       This is to allow left and right channels to be updated at the same time, as shown in Figure 13.
       Figure 13 Simultaneous Left and Right Volume Updates
       If the volume is adjusted while the signal is a non-zero value, an audible click can occur as shown in
       Figure 14.
       Figure 14 Click Noise during Volume Update
       In order to prevent this click noise, a zero cross function is provided. When enabled, this will cause
       the PGA volume to update only when a zero crossing occurs, minimising click noise as shown in
       Figure 15.

                Figure 15 Volume Update using Zero Cross Detection
                If there is a long period where no zero-crossing occurs, a timeout circuit in the WM8985 will
                automatically update the volume. The volume updates will occur between one and two timeout
                periods, depending on when the INPPGAVU bit is set as shown in Figure 16.

       AUXILLIARY INPUTS
        There are two auxiliary inputs, AUXL and AUXR which can be used for a variety of purposes such as
        stereo line inputs or as a ‘beep’ input signal to be mixed with the outputs.
        The AUXL/R inputs can be used as a line input to the input BOOST stage which has adjustable gain
        of -12dB to +6dB in 3dB steps, with an additional "off" state (i.e. not connected to ADC input). See
        the INPUT BOOST section for further details.
        The AUXL/R inputs can also be mixed into the output channel mixers, with a gain of -15dB to +6dB
        plus off.
       INPUT BOOST
        Each of the stereo input PGA stages is followed by an input BOOST circuit. The input BOOST circuit
        has 3 selectable inputs: the input microphone PGA output, the AUX amplifier output and the L2/R2
        input pin (can be used as a line input, bypassing the input PGA). These three inputs can be mixed
        together and have individual gain boost/adjust as shown in Figure 17.

                The input PGA paths can have a +20dB boost (PGABOOSTL/R=1), a 0dB pass through
                (PGABOOSTL/R=0) or be completely isolated from the input boost circuit (INPPGAMUTEL/R=1).

                The Auxiliary amplifier path to the BOOST stages is controlled by the AUXL2BOOSTVOL[2:0] and
                AUXR2BOOSTVOL[2:0] register bits. When AUXL2BOOSTVOL/AUXR2BOOSTVOL=000 this path
                is completely disconnected from the BOOST stage. Settings 001 through to 111 control the gain in
                3dB steps from -12dB to +6dB.
                The L2/R2 path to the BOOST stage is controlled by the LIP2BOOSTVOL[2:0] and the
                RIP2BOOSTVOL[2:0] register bits. When L2_2BOOSTVOL[6:4] and R2_2BOOSTVOL[6:4]=000 the
                L2/R2 input pin is completely disconnected from the BOOST stage. Settings 001 through to 111
                control the gain in 3dB steps from -12dB to +6dB.

                the MICBIAS current to 3mA.

ANALOGUE TO DIGITAL CONVERTER (ADC)
                             The WM8985 uses stereo multi-bit, oversampled sigma-delta ADCs. The use of multi-bit feedback
                             and high oversampling rates reduces the effects of jitter and high frequency noise. The ADC Full
                             Scale input level is proportional to AVDD1. With a 3.3V supply voltage, the full scale level is 1.0Vrms.
                             Any voltage greater than full scale may overload the ADC and cause distortion.
                             ADC DIGITAL FILTERS
                             The ADC filters perform true 24 bit signal processing to convert the raw multi-bit oversampled data
                             from the ADC to the correct sampling frequency to be output on the digital audio interface. The digital
                             filter path for each ADC channel is illustrated in Figure 19.

                PROGRAMMABLE NOTCH FILTER
                A programmable notch filter is provided. This filter has a variable centre frequency and bandwidth,
                programmable via two coefficients, a0 and a1. These coefficients should be converted to 2’s
                complement numbers to determine the register values. A0 and a1 are represented by the register bits
                NFA0[13:0] and NFA1[13:0]. Because these coefficient values require four register writes to setup
                there is an NFU (Notch Filter Update) flag which should be set only when all four registers are setup.

       NOTCH FILTER WORKED EXAMPLE
       The following example illustrates how to calculate the a0 and a1 coefficients for a desired centre
       frequency and -3dB bandwidth.
       Fc = 1000 Hz
       fb = 100 Hz
       fs = 48000 Hz

        w b  2fb / fs = 2 x (100 / 48000) = 0.01308996939 rads
              1  tan( w b / 2)    1  tan(0.0130899693 9 / 2)
        a0                      =                             = 0.9869949627
             1  tan( w b / 2)     1  tan(0.0130899693 9 / 2)
        a1  (1  a0 ) cos( w 0 ) = (1  0.9869949627 ) cos(0.1308996939 ) = -1.969995945
                          13
       NFA0 = -a0 x 2 = -8085 (rounded to nearest whole number)
                          12
       NFA1 = -a1 x 2 = 8069 (rounded to nearest whole number)
       These values are then converted to 2’s complement:
       NFA0 = 14’h206B = 14’b10000001101011
       NFA1 = 14’h1F85 = 14’b 01111110000101
       DIGITAL ADC VOLUME CONTROL

INPUT LIMITER / AUTOMATIC LEVEL CONTROL (ALC)
                  The WM8985 has an automatic PGA gain control circuit, which can function as an input peak limiter
                  or as an automatic level control (ALC).
                  The Automatic Level Control (ALC) provides continuous adjustment of the input PGA in response to
                  the amplitude of the input signal. A digital peak detector monitors the input signal amplitude and
                  compares it to a register defined threshold level (ALCLVL).
                  If the signal is below the threshold, the ALC will increase the gain of the PGA at a rate set by
                  ALCDCY. If the signal is above the threshold, the ALC will reduce the gain of the PGA at a rate set
                  by ALCATK.
                  The ALC has two modes selected by the ALCMODE register: normal mode and peak limiter mode.
                  The ALC/limiter function is enabled by settings the register bits R32[8:7] ALCSEL.

                         When the ALC is disabled, the input PGA remains at the last controlled value of the ALC. An input
                         gain update must be made by writing to the INPPGAVOLL/R register bits.
                        NORMAL MODE
                         In normal mode, the ALC will attempt to maintain a constant signal level by increasing or decreasing
                         the gain of the PGA. The following diagram shows an example of this.

LIMITER MODE
                          In limiter mode, the ALC will reduce peaks that go above the threshold level, but will not increase the
                          PGA gain beyond the starting level. The starting level is the PGA gain setting when the ALC is
                          enabled in limiter mode. If the ALC is started in limiter mode, this is the gain setting of the PGA at
                          startup. If the ALC is switched into limiter mode after running in ALC mode, the starting gain will be
                          the gain at switchover. The diagram below shows an example of limiter mode.

                          ATTACK AND DECAY TIMES
                          The attack and decay times set the update times for the PGA gain. The attack time is the time
                          constant used when the gain is reducing. The decay time is the time constant used when the gain is
                          increasing. In limiter mode, the time constants are faster than in ALC mode. The time constants are
                          shown below in terms of a single gain step, a change of 6dB and a change of 90% of the PGAs gain
                          range.
                          Note that, these times will vary slightly depending on the sample rate used (specified by the SR
                          register).

                The ALCMIN and ALCMAX register bits set the minimum/maximum gain value that the PGA can be

                In normal mode, ALCMAX sets the maximum boost which can be applied to the signal. In limiter
                mode, ALCMAX will normally have no effect (assuming the starting gain value is less than the
                maximum gain specified by ALCMAX) because the maximum gain is set at the starting gain level.
                ALCMIN sets the minimum gain value which can be applied to the signal.

       Note that if the ALC gain setting strays outside the ALC operating range, either by starting the ALC
       outside of the range or changing the ALCMAX or ALCMIN settings during operation, the ALC will
       immediately adjust the gain to return to the ALC operating range. It is recommended that the ALC
       starting gain is set between the ALCMAX and ALCMIN limits.
       ALC HOLD TIME (NORMAL MODE ONLY)
       In Normal mode, the ALC has an adjustable hold time which sets a time delay before the ALC begins
       it’s decay phase (gain increasing). The hold time is set by the ALCHLD register.

         ALC Control
         2
       Table 26 ALC Hold Time
       If the hold time is exceeded this indicates that the signal has reached a new average level and the
       ALC will increase the gain to adjust for that new average level. If the signal goes above the threshold
       during the hold period, the hold phase is abandoned and the ALC returns to normal operation.

                 PEAK LIMITER
                To prevent clipping when a large signal occurs just after a period of quiet, the ALC circuit includes a
                limiter function. If the ADC input signal exceeds 87.5% of full scale (–1.16dB), the PGA gain is
                ramped down at the maximum attack rate (as when ALCATK = 0000), until the signal level falls below
                87.5% of full scale. This function is automatically enabled whenever the ALC is enabled.
                Note: If ALCATK = 0000, then the limiter makes no difference to the operation of the ALC. It is
                designed to prevent clipping when long attack times are used.
                NOISE GATE (NORMAL MODE ONLY)
                When the signal is very quiet and consists mainly of noise, the ALC function may cause “noise
                pumping”, i.e. loud hissing noise during silence periods. The WM8985 has a noise gate function that
                prevents noise pumping by comparing the signal level at the input pins against a noise gate
                threshold, NGTH. The noise gate cuts in when:
                Signal level at ADC [dBFS] < NGTH [dBFS] + PGA gain [dB] + Mic Boost gain [dB]
                This is equivalent to:
                Signal level at input pin [dBFS] < NGTH [dBFS]
                The PGA gain is then held constant (preventing it from ramping up as it normally would when the
                signal is quiet).
                The table below summarises the noise gate control register. The NGTH control bits set the noise
                gate threshold with respect to the ADC full-scale range. The threshold is adjusted in 6dB steps.
                Levels at the extremes of the range may cause inappropriate operation, so care should be taken with
                set–up of the function. The noise gate only operates in conjunction with the ALC and cannot be used
                in limiter mode.

OUTPUT SIGNAL PATH
                          The WM8985 output signal paths consist of digital application filters, up-sampling filters, stereo Hi-Fi
                          DACs, analogue mixers, stereo headphone and stereo line/mono/midrail output drivers. The digital
                          filters and DAC are enabled by register bits DACENL and DACENR. The mixers and output drivers
                          can be separately enabled by individual control bits (see Analogue Outputs). Thus it is possible to
                          utilise the analogue mixing and amplification provided by the WM8985, irrespective of whether the
                          DACs are running or not.
                          The WM8985 DACs receive digital input data on the DACDAT pin. The digital filter block processes
                          the data to provide the following functions:
                                    Digital volume control
                                    Graphic equaliser
                                    A digital peak limiter
                                    Sigma-Delta Modulation
                          High performance sigma-delta audio DAC converts the digital data into an analogue signal.

                             The analogue outputs from the DACs can then be mixed with the aux analogue inputs and the ADC
                             analogue inputs. The mix is fed to the output drivers for headphone (LOUT1/ROUT1,
                             LOUT2/ROUT2) or line (OUT3/OUT4). OUT3 and OUT4 have additional mixers which allow them to
                             output different signals to the line outputs or back into the record path.

                             Digital data is passed to the WM8985 via the flexible audio interface and is then passed through a
                             variety of advanced digital filters as shown in Figure 23 to the hi-fi DACs. The DACs are enabled by
                             the DACENL/R register bits.

                             The WM8985 also has a Soft Mute function, which when enabled, gradually attenuates the volume of
                             the digital signal to zero. When disabled, the gain will ramp back up to the digital gain setting. This
                             function is enabled by default. To play back an audio signal, it must first be disabled by setting the
                             SOFTMUTE bit to zero.

                high quality analogue audio signal. The multi-bit DAC architecture reduces high frequency noise and
                sensitivity to clock jitter. It also uses a Dynamic Element Matching technique for high linearity and low
                distortion.
                The DAC output phase defaults to non-inverted. Setting DACLPOL will invert the DAC output phase
                on the left channel and DACRPOL inverts the phase on the right channel.
                AUTO-MUTE
                The DAC has an auto-mute function which applies an analogue mute when 1024 consecutive zeros
                are detected. The mute is released as soon as a non-zero sample is detected. Auto-mute can be
                disabled using the AMUTE control bit.
                DIGITAL HI-FI DAC VOLUME (GAIN) CONTROL
                The signal volume from each hi-fi DAC can be controlled digitally. The gain range is –127dB to 0dB
                in 0.5dB steps. The level of attenuation for an eight-bit code X is given by:
                0.5  (X-255) dB for 1  X  255;             MUTE for X = 0

                5-BAND EQUALISER
                A 5-band graphic equaliser function which can be used to change the output frequency levels to suit
                the environment. This can be applied to the ADC or DAC path and is described in the 5-BAND
                EQUALISER section for further details on this feature.
                3-D ENHANCEMENT
                The WM8985 has an advanced digital 3-D enhancement feature which can be used to vary the
                perceived stereo separation of the left and right channels. Like the 5-band equaliser this feature can
                be applied to either the ADC record path or the DAC playback path but not both simultaneously.
                Refer to the 3-D STEREO ENHANCEMENT section for further details on this feature.
                DAC DIGITAL OUTPUT LIMITER
                The WM8985 has a digital output limiter function. The operation of this is shown in Figure 24. In this
                diagram the upper graph shows the envelope of the input/output signals and the lower graph shows
                the gain characteristic.

       Figure 24 DAC Digital Limiter Operation
       The limiter has a programmable upper threshold which is close to 0dB. Referring to Figure 24, in
       normal operation (LIMBOOST=000 => limit only) signals below this threshold are unaffected by the
       limiter. Signals above the upper threshold are attenuated at a specific attack rate (set by the LIMATK
       register bits) until the signal falls below the threshold. The limiter also has a lower threshold 1dB
       below the upper threshold. When the signal falls below the lower threshold the signal is amplified at
       a specific decay rate (controlled by LIMDCY register bits) until a gain of 0dB is reached. Both
       threshold levels are controlled by the LIMLVL register bits. The upper threshold is 0.5dB above the
       value programmed by LIMLVL and the lower threshold is 0.5dB below the LIMLVL value.
       VOLUME BOOST
       The limiter has programmable upper gain which boosts signals below the threshold to compress the
       dynamic range of the signal and increase its perceived loudness. This operates as an ALC function
       with limited boost capability. The volume boost is from 0dB to +12dB in 1dB steps, controlled by the
       LIMBOOST register bits.
       The output limiter volume boost can also be used as a stand alone digital gain boost when the limiter
       is disabled.

       Note: The ADCs and DACs must be disabled before changing the EQ3DMODE bit.
       The equaliser consists of low and high frequency shelving filters (Band 1 and 5) and three peak filters
       for the centre bands. Each has adjustable cut-off or centre frequency, and selectable boost (+/- 12dB
       in 1dB steps). The peak filters have selectable bandwidth.
       To enable the use of the 5-band equaliser the device must be in 128fs mode by setting M128ENB to
       1 in register R7 bit 8. Refer to the Low Power section under Power Management below for more
       details.

3D STEREO ENHANCEMENT
               The WM8985 has a digital 3D enhancement option to increase the perceived separation between the
               left and right channels. Selection of 3D for record or playback is controlled by register bit
               EQ3DMODE. Switching this bit from record to playback or from playback to record may only be done
               when both ADCs and both DACs are disabled.
                To enable the 3D Stereo Enhancement in the ADC path the device must be in 128fs mode by setting
                M128ENB to 1 in register R7 bit 8. Refer to the Low Power section under Power Management below
                for more details.
               The DEPTH3D setting controls the degree of stereo expansion.

ANALOGUE OUTPUTS
                 The WM8985 has three sets of stereo analogue outputs. These are:
                          LOUT1 and ROUT1 which are normally used to drive a headphone load.
                          LOUT2 and ROUT2 – which can be used as class D or class AB headphone
                           drivers.
                          OUT3 and OUT4 – can be configured as a stereo line out (OUT3 is left output and
                           OUT4 is right output) or a differential output. OUT4 can also be used to provide a
                           mono mix of left and right channels.
                 The outputs LOUT2 and ROUT2 are powered from AVDD2 and are capable of driving a 1V rms
                 signal (AVDD1/3.3).
                 LOUT1, ROUT1, OUT3 and OUT4 are powered from AVDD1
                 LOUT1, ROUT1, LOUT2 and ROUT2 have individual analogue volume PGAs with -57dB to +6dB
                 gain ranges.
                 There are four output mixers in the output signal path, the left and right channel mixers which control
                 the signals to headphone (and optionally the line outputs) and also dedicated OUT3 and OUT4
                 mixers.

       LEFT AND RIGHT OUTPUT CHANNEL MIXERS
       The left and right output channel mixers are shown in Figure 25. These mixers allow the AUX inputs,
       the ADC bypass and the DAC left and right channels to be combined as desired. This allows a mono
       mix of the DAC channels to be performed as well as mixing in external line-in from the AUX or
       speech from the input bypass path.
       The AUX and bypass inputs have individual volume control from -15dB to +6dB and the DAC volume
       can be adjusted in the digital domain if required. The output of these mixers is connected to both the
       headphone (LOUT1 and ROUT1) and class D headphone (LOUT2 and ROUT2) and can optionally
       be connected to the OUT3 and OUT4 mixers.

       HEADPHONE OUTPUTS (LOUT1 AND ROUT1)
       The headphone outputs LOUT1 and ROUT1 can drive a 16 or 32 headphone load, either through
       DC blocking capacitors, or DC-coupled to a buffered midrail reference (LOUT2 or ROUT2), saving a
       capacitor (capless mode). When using capless mode AVDD1 and AVDD2 should use the same
       supply to maximise supply rejection. OUT3 and OUT4 should not be used as a buffered midrail
       reference in capless mode.

                Figure 26 Recommended Headphone Output Configurations
                When DC blocking capacitors are used, their capacitance and the load resistance together determine
                the lower cut-off frequency of the output signal, fc. Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the
                bass response. Smaller capacitance values will diminish the bass response. Assuming a 16 load
                and C1, C2 = 220F:
                fc = 1 / 2 RLC1 = 1 / (2 x 16 x 220F) = 45 Hz
                In the DC coupled configuration, the headphone pseudo-ground is connected to the buffered midrail
                reference pin (LOUT2 or ROUT2). The L/ROUT2 pins can be configured as a DC output driver by
                setting the LOUT2MUTE and ROUT2MUTE register bits. The DC voltage on VMID in this
                configuration is equal to the DC offset on the LOUT1 and ROUT1 pins therefore no DC blocking
                capacitors are required. This saves space and material cost in portable applications.
                It is not recommended to use DC-coupling to line inputs of another device. Although the built-in short
                circuit protection on the headphone outputs would be tolerant of shorts to ground, such a connection
                could be noisy, and may not function properly if the other device is grounded. DC-coupled
                configurations should only be used with headphones.

                CLASS D / CLASS AB HEADPHONE OUTPUTS (LOUT2 AND ROUT2)
                The outputs LOUT2 and ROUT2 are designed to drive two headphone loads of 16 or 32 or line
                outputs (See Headphone Output and Line Output sections, respectively). Each output has an
                individual volume control PGA, a mute and an enable control bit as shown in Figure 27. LOUT2 and
                ROUT2 output the left and right channel mixer outputs respectively.

                Table 35 Class D Control Registers
                When driving headphones using class D outputs it is necessary to use appropriate filtering, placed
                close to the device, to minimise EMI emissions from the headphone cable (Refer to "Applications
                Information" for more information). This filtering does not prevent class AB mode operation.

       Figure 28 LOUT2 and ROUT2 Class AB Headphone Configuration
       The output configurations shown in figures 29 and 30 are both suitable for class AB operation.
       The signal output on LOUT2/ROUT2 comes from the Left/Right Mixer circuits and can be any
       combination of the DAC output, the bypass path (output of the input boost stage) and the AUX input.
       The LOUT2/ROUT2 volume is controlled by the LOUT2VOL/ ROUT2VOL register bits. Gains over
       0dB may cause clipping if the input signal is too high. The LOUT2MUTE/ ROUT2MUTE register bits
       cause these outputs to be muted (the output DC level is driven out). The output pins remain at the
       same DC level, so that no click noise is produced when muting or un-muting.

                A zero-cross timeout function is provided so that if zero cross is enabled on the input or output PGAs
                the gain will automatically update after a timeout period if a zero cross has not occurred. This is
                enabled by setting SLOWCLKEN. The timeout period is dependent on the clock input to the digital

       OUT3/OUT4 MIXERS AND OUTPUT STAGES
       The OUT3/OUT4 pins provide an additional stereo line output, a mono output, or a differential output.
       There is a dedicated analogue mixer for OUT3 and one for OUT4 as shown in Figure 29.
       The OUT3 and OUT4 output stages are powered from AVDD1 and AGND1.
       Figure 29 OUT3 and OUT4 Mixers
       OUT3 can provide a left line output, or a mono mix line output.
       OUT4 can provide a right line output, or a mono mix line output.
       A 6dB attenuation function is provided for OUT4, to prevent clipping during mixing of left and right
       signals. This function is enabled by the OUT4ATTN register bit.

       ENABLING THE OUTPUTS
       Each analogue output of the WM8985 can be independently enabled or disabled. The analogue
       mixer associated with each output has a separate enable bit. All outputs are disabled by default. To
       save power, unused parts of the WM8985 should remain disabled.
       Outputs can be enabled at any time, but it is not recommended to do so when BUFIO is disabled
       (BUFIOEN=0), as this may cause pop noise (see “Power Management” and “Applications
       Information” sections).

       THERMAL SHUTDOWN
       To protect the WM8985 from becoming too hot, a thermal sensor has been built in. If the device
       junction temperature reaches approximately 125C and the TSDEN and TSOPCTRL bit are set, then
       all outputs will be disabled to avoid further increase of the chip temperature.
       Additionally, when the device is too hot and TSDEN is set, then the WM8985 de-asserts GPIO bit 11,
       a virtual GPIO that can be set up to generate an interrupt to the CPU (see “GPIO and Interrupt
       Control” section).

                  UNUSED ANALOGUE INPUTS/OUTPUTS
                  Whenever an analogue input/output is disabled, it remains connected to a voltage source (AVDD1/2)
                  through a resistor. This helps to prevent pop noise when the output is re-enabled. The resistance
                  between the voltage buffer and the output pins can be controlled using the VROI control bit. The
                  default impedance is low, so that any capacitors on the outputs can charge up quickly at start-up. If a
                  high impedance is desired for disabled outputs, VROI can then be set to 1, increasing the resistance
                  to about 30k.

DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACES
                 The audio interface has four pins:
                           ADCDAT: ADC data output
                           DACDAT: DAC data input
                           LRC: Data Left/Right alignment clock
                           BCLK: Bit clock, for synchronisation
                 The clock signals BCLK, and LRC can be outputs when the WM8985 operates as a master, or inputs
                 when it is a slave (see Master and Slave Mode Operation, below).
                 Five different audio data formats are supported:
                           Left justified
                           Right justified
                             2
                           IS
                           DSP mode A
                           DSP mode B
                 All of these modes are MSB first. They are described in Audio Data Formats, below. Refer to the
                 Electrical Characteristic section for timing information.
                 MASTER AND SLAVE MODE OPERATION
                 The WM8985 audio interface may be configured as either master or slave. As a master interface
                 device the WM8985 generates BCLK and LRC and thus controls sequencing of the data transfer on
                 ADCDAT and DACDAT. To set the device to master mode register bit MS should be set high. In
                 slave mode (MS=0), the WM8985 responds with data to clocks it receives over the digital audio
                 interfaces.
                 AUDIO DATA FORMATS
                 In Left Justified mode, the MSB is available on the first rising edge of BCLK following an LRC
                 transition. The other bits up to the LSB are then transmitted in order. Depending on word length,
                 BCLK frequency and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles before each LRC transition.
                 Figure 31 Left Justified Audio Interface (assuming n-bit word length)
                 In Right Justified mode, the LSB is available on the last rising edge of BCLK before a LRC transition.
                 All other bits are transmitted before (MSB first). Depending on word length, BCLK frequency and
                 sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles after each LRC transition.
                                                                                            PD, Rev 4.7, February 2012

                In I S mode, the MSB is available on the second rising edge of BCLK following a LRC transition. The
                other bits up to the LSB are then transmitted in order. Depending on word length, BCLK frequency
                and sample rate, there may be unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of one sample and the MSB of
                the next.

                In DSP/PCM mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1 (mode B) or 2 (mode A) rising
                edge of BCLK (selectable by LRP) following a rising edge of LRC. Right channel data immediately
                follows left channel data. Depending on word length, BCLK frequency and sample rate, there may be
                unused BCLK cycles between the LSB of the right channel data and the next sample.
                In device master mode, the LRC output will resemble the LRC pulse shown in Figure 34 and Figure
                35. In device slave mode, Figure 36 and Figure 37, it is possible to use any length of LRC pulse less
                than 1/fs, providing the falling edge of the LRC pulse occurs greater than one BCLK period before the
                rising edge of the next LRC pulse.

                AUDIO INTERFACE CONTROL
                The register bits controlling audio format, word length and master / slave mode are summarised
                below.
                Register bit MS selects audio interface operation in master or slave mode. In Master mode BCLK,
                and LRC are outputs. The frequency of BCLK in master mode can be controlled with BCLKDIV. The
                frequencies of BCLK and LRC are also controlled by MCLKDIV. The LRC sample rate is set to the
                required values by MCLKDIV and the BCLK rate will be set accordingly to provide sufficient BCLKs
                for that chosen sample rate. These clocks are divided down versions of master clock.

       Table 44 Clock Control
       The CLKSEL bit selects the internal source of the Master clock from the PLL (CLKSEL=1) or from
       MCLK (CLKSEL=0). When the internal clock is switched from one source to another using the
       CLKSEL bit, the clock originally selected must generate at least one falling edge after CLKSEL has
       changed for the switching of clocks to be successful.
       EXAMPLE:
       If the PLL is the current source of the internal clock (CLKSEL=1) and it is required to switch to the
       MCLK, change CLKSEL to select MCLK (CLKSEL=0) and then disable PLL (PLLEN=0).

AUDIO SAMPLE RATES
                The WM8985 ADC high pass filter, ALC and DAC limiter characteristics are sample rate dependent.
                SR should be set to the correct sample rate or the closest value if the actual sample rate is not
                available.
                If a sample rate that is not explicitly supported by the SR register settings is required then the closest
                SR value to that sample rate should be chosen. The filter characteristics and the ALC attack decay
                and hold times will scale appropriately.

MASTER CLOCK AND PHASE LOCKED LOOP (PLL)
                The WM8985 has an on-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) circuit that can be used to:
                Generate master clocks for the WM8985 audio functions from another external clock, e.g. in
                telecoms applications.
                Generate and output (on pin CSB/GPIO1) a clock for another part of the system that is derived from
                an existing audio master clock.
                Figure 38 shows the PLL and internal clocking on the WM8985.
                The PLL can be enabled or disabled by the PLLEN register bit.

                          The PLL frequency ratio R = f2/f1 (see Figure 38) can be set using the register bits PLLK and PLLN:
                                     PLLN = int R
                                                   24
                                     PLLK = int (2 (R-PLLN))
                          EXAMPLE:
                          MCLK=12MHz, required clock = 12.288MHz.
                          R should be chosen to ensure 5 < PLLN < 13. There is a fixed divide by 4 in the PLL and a selectable
                          divide by N after the PLL which should be set to divide by 2 to meet this requirement.
                          Enabling the divide by 2 sets the required f2 = 4 x 2 x 12.288MHz = 98.304MHz.
                                     R = 98.304 / 12 = 8.192
                                     PLLN = int R = 8
                                                24
                                     k = int ( 2 x (8.192 – 8)) = 3221225 = 3126E9h

                              from the ADC audio interface is fed directly into the DAC data input.
COMPANDING
                              The WM8985 supports A-law and -law companding on both transmit (ADC) and receive (DAC)
                              sides. Companding can be enabled on the DAC or ADC audio interfaces by writing the appropriate
                              value to the DAC_COMP or ADC_COMP register bits respectively.

         A law (where A=87.6 for Europe):
         F(x) = A|x| / ( 1 + lnA)                                   for x ≤ 1/A
         F(x) = ( 1 + lnA|x|) / (1 + lnA)                           for 1/A ≤ x ≤ 1
         The companded data is also inverted as recommended by the G.711 standard (all 8 bits are inverted
         for -law, all even data bits are inverted for A-law). The data will be transmitted as the first 8 MSB’s
         of data.
         Companding converts 13 bits (-law) or 12 bits (A-law) to 8 bits using non-linear quantization. The
         input data range is separated into 8 levels, allowing low amplitude signals better precision than that
         of high amplitude signals. This is to exploit the operation of the human auditory system, where louder
         sounds do not require as much resolution as quieter sounds. The companded signal is an 8-bit word
         containing sign (1-bit), exponent (3-bits) and mantissa (4-bits).
         Setting the WL8 register bit allows the device to operate with 8-bit data. In this mode it is possible to
         use 8 BCLK’s per LRC frame. When using DSP mode B, this allows 8-bit data words to be output
         consecutively every 8 BCLK’s and can be used with 8-bit data words using the A-law and u-law
         companding functions.

GENERAL PURPOSE INPUT/OUTPUT
              The WM8985 has three dual purpose input/output pins.
                        CSB/GPIO1: CSB / GPIO1 pin
                        L2/GPIO2: Left channel line input / headphone detection input
                        R2/GPIO3: Right channel line input / headphone detection input
              The GPIO2 and GPIO3 functions are provided for use as jack detection inputs.
              The GPIO1 function is provided for use as jack detection input or general purpose output.
              The default configuration for the CSB/GPIO1 is to be an input.
              When setup as an input, the CSB/GPIO1 pin can either be used as CSB or for jack detection,
              depending on how the MODE pin is set.
              Table 45 illustrates the functionality of the GPIO1 pin when used as a general purpose output.

OUTPUT SWITCHING (JACK DETECT)
                When the device is operated using a 2-wire interface the CSB/GPIO1 pin can be used as a switch
                control input to automatically disable one set of outputs and enable another; the most common use
                for this functionality is as jack detect circuitry. The L2/GPIO2 and R2/GPIO3 pins can also be used
                for this purpose.
                The GPIO pins have an internal de-bounce circuit when in this mode in order to prevent the output
                enables from toggling multiple times due to input glitches. This de-bounce circuit is clocked from a
                                           21
                slow clock with period 2 x MCLK and is enabled by the SLOWCLKEN bit.
                Notes:
                1.    The SLOWCLKEN bit must be enabled for the jack detect circuitry to operate.
                2.    The GPIOPOL bit is not relevant for jack detection, it is the signal detected at the pin which is
                      used
                Switching on/off of the outputs is fully configurable by the user. Each output, OUT1, OUT2, OUT3
                and OUT4 has 2 associated enables. OUT1_EN_0, OUT2_EN_0, OUT3_EN_0 and OUT4_EN_0 are
                the output enable signals which are used if the selected jack detection pin is at logic 0 (after de-
                bounce). OUT1_EN_1, OUT2_EN_1, OUT3_EN_1 and OUT4_EN_1 are the output enable signals
                which are used if the selected jack detection pin is at logic 1 (after de-bounce).
                The jack detection enables operate as follows:
                All OUT_EN signals have an AND function performed with their normal enable signals (in Table 39).
                When an output is normally enabled as per Table 39, the selected jack detection enable (controlled
                by selected jack detection pin polarity) is set 0; it will turn the output off. If the normal enable signal is
                already OFF (0), the jack detection signal will have no effect due to the AND function.
                During jack detection if the user desires an output to be un-changed whether the jack is in or not,
                both the JD_EN settings, i.e. JD_EN0 and JD_EN1, should be set to 0000.
                If jack detection is not enabled (JD_EN=0), the output enables default to all 1’s, allowing the outputs
                to be controlled as normal via the normal output enables found in Table 39.

               SELECTION OF CONTROL MODE AND 2-WIRE MODE ADDRESS
               The control interface can operate as either a 3-wire or 2-wire control interface. The MODE pin
               determines the 2 or 3 wire mode as shown in Table 47.
               The WM8985 is controlled by writing to registers through a serial control interface. A control word
               consists of 16 bits. The first 7 bits (B15 to B9) are register address bits that select which control
               register is accessed. The remaining 9 bits (B8 to B0) are data bits, corresponding to the 9 data bits in
               each control register.

                2-WIRE SERIAL CONTROL MODE
                The WM8985 supports software control via a 2-wire serial bus. Many devices can be controlled by
                the same bus, and each device has a unique 7-bit device address (this is not the same as the 7-bit
                address of each register in the WM8985).
                The WM8985 operates as a slave device only. The controller indicates the start of data transfer with
                a high to low transition on SDIN while SCLK remains high. This indicates that a device address and
                data will follow. All devices on the 2-wire bus respond to the start condition and shift in the next eight
                bits on SDIN (7-bit address + Read/Write bit, MSB first). If the device address received matches the
                address of the WM8985, the WM8985 responds by pulling SDIN low on the next clock pulse (ACK). If
                the address is not recognised or the R/W bit is ‘1’ when operating in write only mode, the WM8985
                returns to the idle condition and waits for a new start condition and valid address.
                During a write, once the WM8985 has acknowledged a correct address, the controller sends the first
                byte of control data (B15 to B8, i.e. the WM8985 register address plus the first bit of register data).
                The WM8985 then acknowledges the first data byte by driving SDIN low for one clock cycle. The
                controller then sends the second byte of control data (B7 to B0, i.e. the remaining 8 bits of register
                data), and the WM8985 acknowledges again by pulling SDIN low.
                Transfer is complete when there is a low to high transition on SDIN while SCLK is high. After a
                complete sequence the WM8985 returns to the idle state and waits for another start condition. If a
                start or stop condition is detected out of sequence at any point during data transfer (i.e. SDIN
                changes while SCLK is high), the control interface returns to the idle condition.

RESETTING THE CHIP
                The WM8985 can be reset by performing a write of any value to the software reset register (address
                0h). This will cause all register values to be reset to their default values. In addition to this there is a
                Power-On Reset (POR) circuit which ensures that the registers are initially set to default when the
                device is powered up.
POWER SUPPLIES
                The WM8985 requires four separate power supplies:
                AVDD1 and AGND1: Analogue supply, powers all internal analogue functions and output drivers
                LOUT1, ROUT1, OUT3 and OUT4. AVDD1 must be between 2.5V and 3.6V and has the most
                significant impact on overall power consumption (except for power consumed in the headphones).
                Higher AVDD1 will improve audio quality.
                AVDD2 and AGND2: Output driver supplies, power LOUT2 and ROUT2. AVDD2 must be between
                2.5V and 3.6V. AVDD2 can be tied to AVDD1, but it requires separate layout and decoupling
                capacitors to curb harmonic distortion.
                DCVDD: Digital core supply, powers all digital functions except the audio and control interface pads.
                DCVDD must be between 1.71V and 3.6V, and has no effect on audio quality. The return path for
                DCVDD is DGND, which is shared with DBVDD.
                DBVDD must be between 1.71V and 3.6V. DBVDD return path is through DGND.
                It is possible to use the same supply voltage for all four supplies. However, digital and analogue
                supplies should be routed and decoupled separately on the PCB to keep digital switching noise out of
                the analogue signal paths.

              SAVING POWER BY REDUCING OVERSAMPLING RATE
              The default mode of operation of the ADC and DAC digital filters is in 64x oversampling mode. Under
              the control of ADCOSR128 and DACOSR128 the oversampling rate may be doubled. 64x
              oversampling results in a slight decrease in noise performance compared to 128x but lowers the
              power consumption of the device.

              If only DAC or ADC functionality is required, the WM8985 can be put into a low power mode. In this
              mode, the DSP core runs at half of the normal rate, reducing digital power consumption of the core
              by half. For DAC low power only, 3D enhancement with 2-Band equaliser functionality is permitted,
              where only Band 1 (low shelf) and Band 5 (high shelf) can be used. For ADC low power, the
              equaliser and 3D cannot be used.

                 The analogue circuitry will not operate unless VMID is enabled. The impedance of the VMID resistor
                 string, together with the decoupling capacitor on the VMID pin will determine the start-up time of the
                 VMID circuit.

POP MINIMISATION
                 POBCTRL
                 WM8985 has two bias generators. A noisy bias derived from AVDD and a low noise bias derived from
                 VMID. POBCTRL is use to switch between the two bias generators. During power up, the AVDD
                 derived bias is available as soon as AVDD is applied; the VMID derived bias is available once the
                 VMID node has charged up.

5-BAND EQUALISER
                                                        The WM8985 has a 5-band equaliser which can be applied to either the ADC path or the DAC path.
                                                        The plots from Figure 51 to Figure 64 show the frequency responses of each filter with a sampling
                                                        frequency of 48kHz, firstly showing the different cut-off/centre frequencies with a gain of 12dB, and
                                                        secondly a sweep of the gain from -12dB to +12dB for the lowest cut-off/centre frequency of each

         Figure 64 shows the result of having the gain set on more than one channel simultaneously. The
         blue traces show each band (lowest cut-off/centre frequency) with 12dB gain. The red traces show
         the cumulative effect of all bands with +12dB gain and all bands -12dB gain, with EqxBW=0 for the
         peak filters.

APPLICATIONS INFORMATION
RECOMMENDED EXTERNAL COMPONENTS
Figure 65 External Component Diagram
    1.    When operating LOUT2 and ROUT2 in class D mode, it is recommended that LC filtering is placed as close to the
          LOUT2 and ROUT2 pins as possible. Low ESR components should be used for maximum efficiency. It is
          recommended that a filter, consisting of a 33μH inductor and a 220nF capacitor, is used for optimal performance.
    2.    The addition of ferrite beads to the outputs of LOUT2 and ROUT2 will suppress any potential interference noise
          produced by the class D switching clocks.
