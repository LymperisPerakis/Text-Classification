1.1      Brief Description
The CMX639 is a Continuously Variable Slope Delta Modulation (CVSD) full duplex CODEC for use in
consumer and commercial digital voice communication systems. With its robust and selectable coding
algorithms, low cost, very low power, and small size, the CMX639 is ideal for use in a wide variety of
consumer and business digital voice applications. Its completely integrated CODEC simplifies design and
eliminates the costs, complexity and risk of external filters and software algorithms.
8kbps to 128kbps data/sampling clock rates are supported both via external clock signals or internally
generated, programmable clocks. Internal data/sampling clocks are derived from an on-chip reference
oscillator that uses an external clock crystal. An internal data/sampling clock output signal is provided to
synchronize external circuits, if desired. Multiplexer applications are also well supported by the encoder
output’s three-state/high impedance enable feature.
The CMX639 operates from 2.7V to 5.5V supplies and is available in the following packages: 24-pin
TSSOP (CMX639E2), 16-pin SOIC (CMX639D4) and 22-pin PDIP (CMX639P6).

Notes:
1. Oscillator inverter bias resister
2. Xtal circuit load capacitor
3. The drive source impedance connected to the coupling capacitor’s input node, rather than the
    CMX639 ENCODER INPUT pin node, should be should be less than 1kΩ. Output idle channel noise
    levels will improve with even lower source impedances driving the coupling capacitor’s input node.
4. Bias decoupling capacitor
5. VDD decoupling capacitor
6. A 1.024MHz Xtal/Clock input will yield exactly 16kbps/32kbps/64kbps internally generated data clock
    rates
7. For best results, a crystal oscillator design should drive the clock inverter input with signal levels of at
    least 40% of VDD, peak to peak. Tuning fork crystals generally cannot meet this requirement. To
    obtain crystal oscillator design assistance, please consult your crystal manufacturer.

10. Some applications may benefit from the use of an Xtal/Clock frequency other than 1.024MHz.
    Note: Codec time constants and filter response curves are effectively proportional to Xtal/Clock
    frequency and so will shift with the use of Xtal/Clock frequencies other than 1.024MHz. For example,
    the specified Encoder Decoder (Full Codec) passband of 300Hz min. to 3400Hz max. for a 1.024MHz
    Xtal/Clock will shift to 600Hz min. to 6800Hz max. when the device is operated from a 2.048MHz
    Xtal/Clock. For this reason, all CMX639 codecs involved in the same communications link should
    usually be operated from the same Xtal/Clock frequency.
    Example 1: A design saves the cost of a 1.024MHz Xtal or clock generator by making use of an
    already existing clock source of a frequency other than 1.024MHz.
    Example 2: Best noise performance is achieved when the CMX639 codec data clock is internally
    generated. If a codec bit rate other than 16kbps, 32kbps or 64kbps is desired then an Xtal/Clock
    different from 1.024MHz can be used to proportionately shift the available set of internally generated
    clock rates, as needed.
    Example 3: To increase the codec high frequency response and audio bandwidth a faster Xtal/Clock
    speed can be used. Other designs may prefer the proportionately higher codec bandwidths and data
    rates that can be supported with faster clock speeds.
11. In general, optimum codec performance is achieved when both encoder and decoder Xtal/Clock
    signals are synchronized. While this is practical in many telecom applications, it may not be so for
    others such as wireless data links. The CMX639 decoder can generally deliver best performance
    when its data clock is recovered/derived from the received data stream and applied as an external
    data clock to the decoder as per the decoder timing depicted in Figure 4. Nonetheless, some
    Xtal/Clock frequency and data rate combinations are better served by the use of internal clocks.
    Experimentation with each specific design may provide the best guidance for making this design
    choice.
