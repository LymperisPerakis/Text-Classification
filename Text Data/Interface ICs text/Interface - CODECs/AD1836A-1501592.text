ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on the
human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
ADCs
There are four ADC channels in the AD1836A configured as                         The voltage at the VREF pin, FILTR (~2.25 V), can be used to
two independent stereo pairs. One stereo pair is the primary                     bias external op amps that buffer the input signals. See the
ADC and has fully differential inputs. The second pair can be                    Power Supply and Voltage Reference section.

(for 2-channel 96 kHz operation).                                                through three serial data input pins (one for each stereo pair)
