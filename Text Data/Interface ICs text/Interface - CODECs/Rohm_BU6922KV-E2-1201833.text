1.Functional overview
  BU6922KV is a voice synthesis IC which retrieves voice synthesis data from external ROM
  along with various modes set by the serial interface, and decodes and playbacks
  high-efficiency voice compression data. The main functions are described below.
１）High compression rate
２）Support maximum 128Mbits external ROM
３）Sampling rate is 32KHz
４）Built-in 16bits DAC
５）System clock is 16.384MHz. Build in oscillation circuit
６）Serial interface is supported for host interface.
７）Various play modes
      - decodable 4 tracks simultaneously
      - adjustable volume at each track independently.
      - enable to decode tunes        which are registered in the sequencer list. Order of tunes are
      randomly selected.
      - For each track, enable to playback a selected tune or to playback tunes in the sequencer list
      with/without loop.
      - fade-in and fade-out functions are supported.

6. Command interface
       Command interface is a serial interface receiving 8 or 16 bits command data synchronized
       with input clock, non parity, and sync-code (8 bits). Sync-code is a fixed value, BF(h).
        The order of received data is LSB FAST.
6.1.1. Command communication
      The command is communicated with clocks and the data as follows;
      (1) Serial data transfer clock input (RXC_BAR); retrieves data by rising edge.
          Frequency shall be equal to or less than 1MHz.
      (2) Serial data input (RXD); 8 bits or 16 bits serial data(LSB FAST)
      (3) Sync-code request output (SYNC_REQ); when this signal is "H", sync-code should be sent
          followed by the commands
6.1.2. Monitoring TSTATUS (TXD)
      It outputs status of accepting play and stop command at each track.
      ("H" shows accepting play command, "L" shows accepting stop command)
      Also, it outputs OR of 4 tracks status(play or stop) to TSEVENT terminal.
     Figure 6-1 shows timing chart of communication.
                                    Figure 6-1 Serial interface timing chart
      At Fig.6-1, sync-code(more than 1 byte) is input before sending command. The maximum chunk of
      consecutive commands is 128 bytes. Noted that , if sync-code is input after command transfer, 128
      bytes of consecutive command after sync-code are accepted.
      If more than 129 bytes of command are conseutively input, 129th byte or later is ignored. Noted
      that, if 128th byte is the first byte of 2 byte command, 129th byte (2nd byte of 2 byte command) can be
      accepted.
      If 128th byte is sync-code, it is ignored. In this case, SYNC_REQ becomes "H" and its status
      becomes “waiting for sync-code”.
      After command transfer is completed, interface shall be one of the following states until next
      command transfer.
      1. continue to input sync-code
      2. input nothing (stops clock RXC_BAR.)
      The status(play/stop)of each track is output to TXD during synchronization. The bit order of
      TXD is Track0,1,2,3.

6.2. Status signal
    BU6922KV outputs the following status signals.
     1. SYNC_REQ
     SYNC_REQ is a sync-code request signal. "L" shows the state of synchronization, and "H" shows
     the state of “waiting for sync-code”, or synchronization error.
     Timing chart is described below.
                                  Figure 6-2-1 SYNC_REQ timing
     2. TSEVENT
    TSEVENT signal becomes "H" when any of the track receives play command.
    The timing chart is described in a figure below.
                                           Figure 6-2-2 TSEVENT timing
    Noted that outputting sound has several ms delay after accepting play command. When stop
    commands are issued and accepted to all tracks, TSEVENT signal becomes "L". Noted also that
    there is several ms delay until the sound stops.

The usage of this command is to disable loop mode during playing with loop mode. The command is also
valid for sequencer mode. When disabling loop during playing tunes at sequencer mode, sequencer stops
at the end of the tune in the sequencer list. For example, when five songs are set for looping, it stops
to playback at the end of 5th song when “disable loop” command is issued.

 7. Sequencer
    Control of sequencer and addition/clear of tune are done by play command and tune-selection
    command respectively. Each track has a sequencer independently. The maximum numbers of tune
    registered to sequencer are 8. The example of sequencer is shown below;
                                           Figure 7-1 Sequencer
 - Addition of a tune to sequencer
 It is done by selection command (Mode=1).
 When sequencer is stopped by stop command while sequencer is running, or when additional
 command is issued after execution of sequencer is finished, a tune is added at the end of sequencer
 list.
 - Sequencer clear
 Clear of sequencer is done by tune-selection command (Mode=2). When sequencer clear is issued,
 all tunes in the list are cleared shown in figure 7-1. For changing the order of tunes, it is necessary to
 clear sequencer once, and add tune by tune-selection command.
 Clear command during sequencer is running is ignored.
 - tune-selection command issued when 8 tunes are already in the sequencer list
 The command is ignored.

 9. Fade
   BI6922KV supports the function of fade in/out.
   The example of fade in is described below.
   1.Fade volume initial value command (TrSel=0,Vol=0)
   2.Fade interval time command (TrSel=0,Time=10)
   3.Volume command (Fade=1,Master=0,TrSel=0,Vol=31)---Fade in is executed when this command
                                                              is issued.
                                                               31
                  Volume
                                              0
                                                    320ms=10ms×32 steps
                                            Figure 9-1 Fade
   In this example, volume increases from 0 by one step and becomes 31 after 320ms.
   In the case that volume value of initial value command is bigger than the volume set by volume
   command, fade out is executed.

                  Figure 10-1 example of system block diagram using BU6922KV
   Example of command setting
   The example shows the case when playing 2 tracks simultaneously and executing fade out at the
   end of the sequence. For the tune number to play, track 0 loop from 0th to 5th tune, and track 1
   repeats 10th tune.
