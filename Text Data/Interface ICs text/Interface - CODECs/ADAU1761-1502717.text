TYPICAL POWER MANAGEMENT MEASUREMENTS
Master clock = 12.288 MHz, integer PLL, input sample rate = 48 kHz, input tone = 1 kHz. Pseudo-differential input to ADCs, DACs to
line output with 10 kΩ load. ADC input @ −1 dBFS, DAC input @ 0 dBFS. In Table 4, the mixer boost and power management conditions
are set for MXBIAS[1:0], ADCBIAS[1:0], HPBIAS[1:0], and DACBIAS[1:0]. RBIAS[1:0] and PBIAS[1:0] do not have an extreme power
saving mode and are therefore set for power saving mode in the extreme power saving rows in Table 4.

1         IOVDD                PWR         Supply for Digital Input and Output Pins. The digital output pins are supplied from IOVDD,
                                           which also sets the highest input voltage that should be seen on the digital input pins.
                                           IOVDD should be set between 1.8 V and 3.3 V. The current draw of this pin is variable because
                                           it is dependent on the loads of the digital outputs. IOVDD should be decoupled to DGND
                                           with a 100 nF capacitor and a 10 μF capacitor.

                                           SPI Latch Signal (CLATCH). Must go low at the beginning of an SPI transaction and high at the
                                           end of a transaction. Each SPI transaction can take a different number of CCLKs to complete,
                                           depending on the address and read/write bit that are sent at the beginning of the SPI
                                           transaction.

                                           be connected between this pin and AGND to reduce crosstalk between the ADCs and DACs.
                                           This pin can be used to bias external analog circuits, as long as they are not drawing current
                                           from CM (for example, the noninverting input of an op amp).
8         AVDD                 PWR         1.8 V to 3.65 V Analog Supply for DAC and Microphone Bias. This pin should be decoupled
                                           locally to AGND with a 100 nF capacitor.
9         AGND                 PWR         Analog Ground. The AGND and DGND pins can be tied together on a common ground plane.

                                                      AGND should be decoupled locally to AVDD with a 100 nF capacitor.

                                                      increased reliability of the solder joints and maximum thermal capability, it is recommended
                                                      that the pad be soldered to the ground plane. See the Exposed Pad PCB Design section for

    INFREQ[1:0] = 1024 × fS
    fS = 49.152 MHz/1024 = 48 kHz
The PLL output clock rate is always 1024 × fS, and the clock
control register automatically sets the INFREQ[1:0] bits to
1024 × fS when using the PLL. When using a direct clock, the
INFREQ[1:0] frequency should be set according to the MCLK
pin clock rate and the desired base sampling frequency.

In mobile phone applications, excessive 217 Hz GSM noise on
the analog supply pins can degrade the audio quality. To avoid
this problem, it is recommended that an L-C filter be used in
series with the bypass capacitors for the AVDD pins. This filter
should consist of a 1.2 nH inductor and a 9.1 pF capacitor in
series between AVDD and ground, as shown in Figure 64.

R3: Record Power Management, 16,393 (0x4009)
This register manages the power consumption for the record path. In particular, the current distribution for the mixer boosts, ADCs,
record path mixers, and PGAs can be set to one of four modes. These settings are normal operation, power saving mode, enhanced
performance mode, and extreme power saving mode. Each of these modes draws current from a central bias. Enhanced performance
mode offers the highest performance with the trade-off of higher power consumption.

R67: Dejitter Control, 16,438 (0x4036)
The dejitter control register allows the size of the dejitter window to be set, and also allows all dejitter circuits in the device to be activated or
bypassed. Dejitter circuits protect against duplicate samples or skipped samples due to jitter from the serial ports in slave mode. Disabling
and reenabling certain subsystems in the device—that is, the ADCs, serial ports, SigmaDSP core, and DACs—during operation can cause
the associated dejitter circuits to fail. As a result, audio data fails to be output to the next subsystem in the device.
When the serial ports are in master mode, the dejitter circuit can be bypassed by setting the dejitter window to 0. When the serial ports
are in slave mode, the dejitter circuit can be reinitialized prior to outputting audio from the device, guaranteeing that audio is output to
the next subsystem in the device. Any time that audio must pass through the ADCs, serial port, sound engine/DSP core, or DACs, the
dejitter circuit can be bypassed and reset by setting the dejitter window size to 0. In this way, the dejitter circuit can be immediately
reactivated, without a wait period, by setting the dejitter window size to the default value of 3.

R43 to R47: Cyclic Redundancy Check Registers, 16,576 to 16,580 (0x40C0 to 0x40C4)
The cyclic redundancy check (CRC) constantly checks the validity of the program RAM contents. SigmaStudio generates a 32-bit hash
sum, which must be written to four consecutive read-only 8-bit register locations. CRC must then be enabled. Every 1024 frames (21 ms
at 48 kHz), the IC generates its own 32-bit code and compares it to the one stored in these registers. If the codes do not match, a GPIO pin
is set high (CRC flag). This output flag must be enabled using the output CRC error sticky setting in the GPIO pin control register (see
Table 79). The 1-bit CRC error flag is reset when the CRCEN bit goes low. For example, a GPIO pin can be connected to an interrupt pin
on an external microcontroller, which triggers a rewrite of the corrupted memory.
By default, CRC is disabled (the CRCEN bit is set to 0). To enable continuous CRC checking, the user can set the CRCEN bit to 1 after
loading a program and sending the correct CRC, which is calculated by SigmaStudio. If an error occurs, it can be cleared by setting the
CRCEN bit low, fixing the error (presumably by reloading the program), and then setting the CRCEN bit high again.

R48 to R51: GPIO Pin Control, 16,582 to 16,585 (0x40C6 to 0x40C9)
The GPIO pin control register sets the functionality of each GPIO pin as shown in Table 79. The GPIO functions use the same pins as the
serial port and must be enabled in the serial data/GPIO pin configuration register (Address 0x40F4). When the GPIO pins are set to
I2C/SPI port control mode, the pins are set through writes to memory locations described in Table 32. The value of the optional internal
pull-up is nominally 250 kΩ.
The output CRC error and output watchdog error settings are sticky, that is, once set, they remain set until the ADAU1761 is reset.

R52 to R56: Watchdog Registers, 16,592 to 16,596 (0x40D0 to 0x40D4)
A program counter watchdog is used when the core does block processing (which can span several samples). The watchdog flags an error
if the program counter reaches a specific 24-bit value (ranging from 0x000000 to 0xFFFFFF) that is set in the register map. This value
consists of three consecutive 8-bit register locations. The error flag sends a high signal to one of the GPIO pins. The watchdog function
must be enabled by setting the DOGEN bit high in Register R52 (Address 0x40D0).
The watchdog error bit (DOGER) is the 1-bit watchdog error flag that can be sent to a GPIO pin, as described in Table 79. This error flag
can connect, for example, to an interrupt pin on a microcontroller in the system. The flag is reset when the DOGEN bit goes low. This
flag can also be read back over the control port from Register R56 (Address 0x40D4).

R60: Serial Data/GPIO Pin Configuration, 16,628 (0x40F4)
The serial data/GPIO pin configuration register controls the functionality of the serial data port pins. If the bits in this register are set to 1,
these pins are configured as GPIO interfaces to the SigmaDSP. If these bits are set to 0, they are configured as serial data I/O port pins.

R63: DSP Slew Modes, 16,631 (0x40F7)
The DSP slew modes register sets the slew source for each output. The slew source can be either the DSP (digital slew) or the codec (analog
slew). When these bits are set to Logic 0, the codec provides volume slew according to the ASLEW[1:0] bits in Register R34 (playback
pop/click suppression register, Address 0x4028). When these bits are set to Logic 1, the slew is provided and defined by the DSP program,
disabling the codec volume slew.
