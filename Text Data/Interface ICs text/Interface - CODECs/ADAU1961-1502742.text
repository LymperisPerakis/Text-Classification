Pin No.   Mnemonic             Type 1     Description
1         IOVDD                PWR        Supply for Digital Input and Output Pins. The digital output pins are supplied from IOVDD,
                                          which also sets the highest input voltage that should be seen on the digital input pins.
                                          IOVDD should be set to 3.3 V. The current draw of this pin is variable because it is dependent
                                          on the loads of the digital outputs. IOVDD should be decoupled to DGND with a 100 nF
                                          capacitor and a 10 μF capacitor.
2         MCLK                 D_IN       External Master Clock Input.
3         ADDR0/CLATCH         D_IN       I2C Address Bit 0 (ADDR0).
                                          SPI Latch Signal (CLATCH). Must go low at the beginning of an SPI transaction and high at the
                                          end of a transaction. Each SPI transaction can take a different number of CCLKs to complete,
                                          depending on the address and read/write bit that are sent at the beginning of the SPI
                                          transaction.
4         JACKDET/MICIN        D_IN       Detect Insertion/Removal of Headphone Plug (JACKDET).
                                          Digital Microphone Stereo Input (MICIN).
5         MICBIAS              A_OUT      Bias Voltage for Electret Microphone.
6         LAUX                 A_IN       Left Channel Single-Ended Auxiliary Input. Biased at AVDD/2.
7         CM                   A_OUT      AVDD/2 V Common-Mode Reference. A 10 μF to 47 μF standard decoupling capacitor should
                                          be connected between this pin and AGND to reduce crosstalk between the ADCs and DACs.
                                          This pin can be used to bias external analog circuits, as long as they are not drawing current
                                          from CM (for example, the noninverting input of an op amp).
8         AVDD                 PWR        3.3 V Analog Supply for DAC and Microphone Bias. This pin should be decoupled locally to
                                          AGND with a 100 nF capacitor.
9         AGND                 PWR        Analog Ground. The AGND and DGND pins can be tied together on a common ground plane.
                                          AGND should be decoupled locally to AVDD with a 100 nF capacitor.

                                                      AGND should be decoupled locally to AVDD with a 100 nF capacitor.
23            AVDD                     PWR            3.3 V Analog Supply for ADC, Output Driver, and Input to Digital Supply Regulator. This pin
                                                      should be decoupled locally to AGND with a 100 nF capacitor.
24            DVDDOUT                  PWR            Digital Core Supply Decoupling Point. The digital supply is generated from an on-board
                                                      regulator and does not require an external supply. DVDDOUT should be decoupled to DGND
                                                      with a 100 nF capacitor and a 10 μF capacitor.

                                                      DGND should be decoupled to DVDDOUT and to IOVDD with 100 nF capacitors and 10 μF

Integer Mode
Integer mode is used when the MCLK is an integer (R) multiple
of the PLL output (1024 × fS).
For example, if MCLK = 12.288 MHz and fS = 48 kHz, then
      PLL required output = 1024 × 48 kHz = 49.152 MHz
      R = 49.152 MHz/12.288 MHz = 4
In integer mode, the values set for N and M are ignored.

Microphone Bias
The MICBIAS pin provides a voltage reference for electret analog
microphones. The MICBIAS voltage is set in Register R10
(record microphone bias control register, Address 0x4010). In
this register, the MICBIAS output can be enabled or disabled.
Additional options include high performance operation and a
gain boost. The gain boost provides two different voltage biases:
0.65 × AVDD or 0.90 × AVDD. When enabled, the high perfor-
mance bit increases supply current to the microphone bias
circuit to decrease rms input noise.

One common problem with noise gate functions is chatter,                                                                MUTE

To reduce this effect, the noise gate in the ADAU1961 uses a                                                                                                                         08915-028

In mobile phone applications, excessive 217 Hz GSM noise on
the analog supply pins can degrade the audio quality. To avoid
this problem, it is recommended that an L-C filter be used in
series with the bypass capacitors for the AVDD pins. This filter
should consist of a 1.2 nH inductor and a 9.1 pF capacitor in
series between AVDD and ground, as shown in Figure 63.

                         below the target. A typical setting for music recording is 24.58 seconds, and a typical setting for voice recording
                         is 1.54 seconds.

With IOVDD set to 3.3 V, the low and high drive strengths of the SDA/COUT pin are approximately 2.0 mA and 4.0 mA, respectively.
The high drive strength mode may be useful for generating a stronger ACK pulse in I2C mode, if needed.

R67: Dejitter Control, 16,438 (0x4036)
The dejitter control register allows the size of the dejitter window to be set, and also allows all dejitter circuits in the device to be activated or
bypassed. Dejitter circuits protect against duplicate samples or skipped samples due to jitter from the serial ports in slave mode. Disabling
and reenabling certain subsystems in the device—that is, the ADCs, serial ports, and DACs—during operation can cause the associated
dejitter circuits to fail. As a result, audio data fails to be output to the next subsystem in the device.
When the serial ports are in master mode, the dejitter circuit can be bypassed by setting the dejitter window to 0. When the serial ports
are in slave mode, the dejitter circuit can be reinitialized prior to outputting audio from the device, guaranteeing that audio is output
to the next subsystem in the device. Any time that audio must pass through the ADCs, serial port, or DACs, the dejitter circuit can be
bypassed and reset by setting the dejitter window size to 0. In this way, the dejitter circuit can be immediately reactivated, without a wait
period, by setting the dejitter window size to the default value of 3.
