TYPICAL POWER CONSUMPTION
Unless otherwise noted, IOVDD = 1.8 V, AVDD = 1.8 V, master clock = 12.288 MHz, fS = 192 kHz; on-board regulator enabled and set to
1.2 V, PLL enabled, two ADCs with PGA enabled and two ADCs configured for line input, no input signal. ADC0 and ADC1 are routed
to ADC_SDATA0 and ADC_SDATA0 is externally routed back into the DAC_SDATA input. The serial port is set to slave. Two DACs are
configured for differential line output operation; DAC outputs are unloaded. Both MICBIAS0 and MICBIAS1 are enabled. For total
power consumption, add IOVDD at the 8 kHz slave current listed in Table 4.

                                               mode. The line connected to this pin must have a 2.0 kΩ pull-up resistor in I2C mode.
                                               SPI Clock (SCLK). This pin can either run continuously or be gated off between SPI
                                               transactions.

4     ADDR0/SS                    D_IN         I2C Address 0 (ADDR0).
                                               SPI Latch Signal (SS). This pin must go low at the beginning of an SPI transaction and high at
                                               the end of a transaction. Each SPI transaction can take a different number of SCLK cycles to
                                               complete, depending on the address and the read/write bit sent at the beginning of the SPI
                                               transaction.

12  CM                    A_OUT  AVDD/2 V Common-Mode Reference. Connect a 10 µF to 47 µF decoupling capacitor
                                 between this pin and ground to reduce crosstalk between the ADCs and DACs. The material
                                 of the capacitors is not critical. This pin can be used to bias external analog circuits, as long
                                 as they are not drawing current from CM (for example, the noninverting input of an
                                 operational amplifier).
13  AIN1REF               A_IN   ADC1 Input Reference. AC couple this reference pin to ground with a 10 µF capacitor.

                                 0.1 µF capacitor. The PCB trace to this pin must be able to supply the higher current necessary for
                                 driving the headphone outputs.

27  PD                    D_IN   Active Low Power-Down. All digital and analog circuits are powered down. There is an
                                 internal pull-down resistor on this pin; therefore, the ADAU1372 is held in power-down
                                 mode if its input signal is floating while power is applied to the supply pins.
28  REG_OUT               A_OUT  Regulator Output Voltage. Connect this pin to DVDD if the internal voltage regulator is
                                 generating the DVDD voltage.
29  DVDD                  PWR    Digital Core Supply. The digital supply can be generated from an on-board regulator or
                                 supplied directly from an external supply. In each case, decouple DVDD to DGND with a
                                 0.1 µF capacitor.

38  XTALO                 A_OUT  Crystal Clock Output. This pin is the output of the crystal amplifier and must not be used to
                                 provide a clock to other ICs in the system. If a master clock output is needed, use CLKOUT
                                 (Pin 35).

LAYOUT
Pin 24 is the AVDD supply for the headphone amplifiers. If the
headphone amplifiers are enabled, the PCB trace to this pin must
be wider than traces to other pins to increase the current carrying
capacity. A wider trace must also be used for the headphone
output lines.

These bits enable clocks to the digital filters and ASRC decimator filters of the ADCs. These bits must be enabled for all channels that are
used in the design. To use the ADCs, these SYNC_x_EN bits must be enabled along with the appropriate ADC_x_EN bits in the
ADC_CONTROL2 and ADC_CONTROL3 registers. If the digital microphone inputs are used, the SYNC_x_EN bits can be set without
setting ADC_x_EN.
