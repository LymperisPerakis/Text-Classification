        This interface connects to the SD memory card slot to communicate with the SD memory device.
        Supports the SPI mode.
        Supports SD, SDHC memory cards and MMC, mini-SD and micro-SD cards.
        Does not supports CPRM.
        Since the SD memory card slot needs to detect the insertion status of the SD memory device, be sure to use the slot
        having the SD memory card insertion status detection terminal. The SD_CON terminal is pulled up within the device
        and detects “SD card connect” when L is input.

5. Equalizers
           Selectable audio line output from 5 types of equalizers and 2 types of bus boosts, using commands.
           You can use a combination of an equalizer and bus boost 1.
           Even when line output is not selected, the equalizer setting is valid. However, for digital output, the equalizer cannot
           change the sound quality.
           Figure 9. - Figure 14.show frequency characteristics of each filter.
           Clipping may occur by the combination of volume and equalizer setting.

               One sub frame of SPDIF consists of synchronous preambles, 16-bit audio data, V bit (validity flag), U bit
               (user data), C bit (channel status) and P bit (parity bit).
               Output rate is fixed to 1X speed.
               SPDIF outputs synchronous preambles (source code 0-3) as they are, and other elements (source code
               4-31) as the biphase output. While the operation stops, L output is enabled.
               Synchronous preambles and C bit use 32 frames (≈4.4 ms) for one cycle. The data formats are shown in
               Tables.2 and 3 V bit is fixed to L. U bit uses 98 frames (≈13.3 ms) for one cycle

              P bit is set to 1 if the number of “1” contained in source codes 4-30 is odd, and set to 0 if the number is
              even. Therefore, the number of source codes to be set to 1 for one data must be even, SPDIF ends with
              L output, and preamble output always starts in the same direction.

         9.1   I C protocol
                When the I2C bus is in the IDLE state, SDA and SCL are set to H by the external Pull-up resistor.
                To start communications, the master sets SDA to L while SCL set to H (Start condition).
                To finish communications, the master sets SDA to H while SCL set to H (Stop condition). During transfer, the

        9.4  Protocol to read to the master
                                                                                                                   2
            When sending the received data from the slave to the master using the I C bus, be sure to conform to the transfer
            protocol shown in Figure 28. First, transfer the status read command (step1). Then, input SCL clock of required
            bytes in step2 to read the status.
                                                                                                                                                    2
            If the device status is BUSY when receiving the device status or the data within the memory, the I C bus may be
            occupied by the device in BUSY. This LSI transfers the data to the master to avoid such occupation of the bus.
            However, as the BUSY status still exists internally, the proper data may not be transferred in BUSY. To cope with
            this situation, the first byte of the transfer data (step2) is used to judge whether the transferred data is valid or
            invalid. After addressing from the master to the slave, if the 0 bit of the first byte of the transfer data immediately
            after requiring the data transfer is 0, the data transferred from the slave is valid. If the 0 bit of the first byte is 1, it
            shows the BUSY status. Thus, judge all the transferred data to be invalid. If this happens, retry Step1 to send
            commands to read the status.
            The first byte of the transferred data (step2) can be readable as the BUSY byte. Please read the status after
            sending the status read command (step1). In addition, internal statuses other than BUSY shown in Table 6. can
            be read.
            The first byte of the transferred data (step2) can be readable as the BUSY byte. Please read the status after
            sending the status read command (step1). In addition, internal statuses other than BUSY shown in Table.7 can
            be read.
            Figure 29. shows the relationship between the transferred data and BUSY.

10. Interrupt Signals to microprocessor
         10.1 BUSY
           BUSY status detection output
         Signal name        I/O                   Function                                        Remarks
             BUSY            O      BUSY status detection output signal      H: Busy, L: Not Busy
              This is output to indicate that the LSI is in the BUSY status.
              A BUSY signal outputs H until analyzing a command from the master and starting the command operation.
              The command input to this LSI in BUSY status is unacceptable.
              Connect it to the PIO port of the microcomputer.
         10.2 MCHNG
           Tune number change detection output
       Signal name I/O                           Function                                          Remarks
         MCHNG         O      Tune number change detection output signal H: During playing, L: At the end or stop of tune
               This signal outputs the information which tells that the file within the memory is being played or the file to be
               played is changed.
               Precisely, the signal outputs H during the internal decode sequence operation, and L at stop of the operation.
               Connect it to the interruption port of the microcomputer.
         10.3 SEARCH
           SEARCH status detection output
        Signal name I/O                         Function                                         Remarks
         SEARCH          O     SEARCH status detection output signal       H: SEARCH, L: Not SEARCH
               This is output to indicate that the LSI is in the SEARCH status.
               A SEARCH signal becomes H at the time of memory mount, file search, TAG analysis and TOC analysis.
               This signal is OR of the 2-bit SEARCH status.
               The LSI ignores command input during SEARCH. However, it can accept only ABORT, STOP and status read
               commands even during SEARCH and can execute them command.
               Connect it to the PIO port of the microcomputer.
         10.4 IRPTO
           Interrupt output to microcomputer
         Signal name       I/O                    Function                                        Remarks
            IRPTO           O      Interrupt output to microcomputer        H: Interrupt, L: Not Interrupt
                This is output to indicate that the LSI is now requiring interruption to the microcomputer.
                Change from L to H shows that an interruption has occurred.
                When signage is H, it is shown that interrupt occurs.
               Connect it to the interruption port of the microcomputer.

11. File search
          11.1 Function
               - The file search function supports file system of FAT32, FAT16 and FAT12. (NTFS is not supported.)
               - The number of maximum playable files per folder follows the specification of FAT.
                                              Table 8. Maximum Playable Files per Folder
                                                           Root folder            Sub folder
                                           FAT12              512                    1024
                                           FAT16              512                    1024
                                           FAT32             65535                   1024
               The number of the maximum files which can playback in throughout the memory is 65535.
               The number of the maximum folders which can playback in throughout the memory is 512. (include root folder)
               The file or folder beyond the maximum number cannot playback.
               Because the pass table of the folder is made to built-in memory beforehand, the search time for next music file is
               shortened.
               Less than 256 files in the order of FAT within each folder are sorted according to UNICODE. More than 256 files,
               if any, will be sorted in the FAT order. The same rule is applied when sorting sub-folders. More than 100
               sub-folders, if any, will be sorted in the FAT order. Sorting function can be selected valid or invalid with a
               command. The folder hierarchies up to 16 hierarchies whose full path including the file name is within 260
               characters can be searched.
          11.2 Playable file
              The playable file extension is *.WAV for the WAV file, *.M4A, *.3GP and *.MP4 for the AAC file, *.ASF and *.WMA
              for the WMA file, and *.MP3, *.MP2 and *.MP1 for the MP3 file. (There is no distinction between upper case
              letters and lower case letters.) Note that the file operation differs in the following cases
              ・Codec selection command: For details, please see
                                SET_MP3 / SET_WMA / SET_AAC / SET_WAV / SET_MP3_PLAY command specifications.
              ・Attribute: Files with hidden attributes are also playable. Files with system attributes cannot be played.
              ・File name: The file name, including its size, does not depend on playability.
              ・File size: A file with file size "0" is not recognized as a playable file.
          11.3 File playing sequence
             The file playing sequence depends on the following rules when sort function valid. See Figure 28.
            [1] Files of 1 to 256, in the order written to FAT (FAT order) in each folder, are sorted in the order of UNICODE.
                 Files more than 256 are played in the FAT order. The same rule is applied when sorting sub-folders.
                 All the folders including null ones and those to which no playable file is written are sorted (selectable setting by
                 command). If over 256 playable files or sub-folders are contained in the folder, they are played in the order
                 written to the FAT directory entries.
                 The writing method of directory entries will not help understand the file play order because the method depends
                 on the OS operation at writing.
            [2] When a playable file exists in the root folder (the top hierarchy), the file is to be played first.
            [3] After all the playable files within the root folder have been played, playable files in the folder in the lower
                 hierarchy, if any, are played.
            [4] If another folder exists in the lower hierarchy, playable files within this folder are played. If not, the LSI searches
                 other folders in the same hierarchy. If another folder exists there, the LSI plays that folder.
            [5] After playing all the files (MAX 1024 files), the LSI returns to the root folder as in [2] and play the files starting
                 with the top sorted one.

        11.4 Folder/File sort
             The LSI sorts the sub-folders and files in the following sequence:
           [1] Obtain up to 256 sub-folders and files each in the order written to FAT within selected folder.
           [2] Compare the obtained folder/file names for 8 characters (16 bytes) from the beginning in UNICODE (2-byte
               character) and sort them in the ascending order. *
           [3] If there are files/folders with same character strings: follow the order of MP3, WMA, AAC and WAV when the
               extension is different; and, otherwise, follow the order written to FAT.
           [4] 101 or more files or sub-folders follow the order written to FAT.
           * The processing of the file name and the folder name is shown in the following.
           1) When a LFN (long file name) entry exists, 2 bytes are treated as one character.
           2) When no LFN entry exists, the SFN(short file name) entry is processed as follows.
             2-a) When the first appeared character code is within the range of 0x00-0x7F (US-ASCII), the LSI treats one byte
                   as one character, and adds '0x00' to the upper of the character to expand the entire character to an
                   UNICODE.
             2-b) For a case other than 2-a), practically, the LSI treats these 2 bytes as one character.
           *For details on LFN and SFN, see the FAT file system specifications.

                                     21           Z.mp3         the playable files in E FOLDER in the

        11.5 Search within multi-drive and multi-partition
           If a device is a multi-drive type or multi partition type, the LSI can recognize the drive by selecting LUN (Logical Unit
           Number) for the supporting FAT.
           If particular LUN isn’t selected, the LSI mounts the device whose LUN detected first. (default)
              It is possible that Test Unit Ready of other LUNs is confirmed during the playback.
        11.6 External HUB search
           When the USB connector is connected to a HUB, and a FAT-supported drive is connected ahead of the HUB at
           mounting the USB for this LSI, only one drive is recognized.
           The LSI does not support external HUBs, it cannot detect plugging/unplugging of the drive ahead of the HUB after
           the USB is mounted.

12. Playing files
         12.1 Function
              For the files judged to be playable through the file search function, the LSI automatically switches the decoder
              using the file extension and decodes these files.
              Fast forward play and rewinding play operations are available.
              Also, repeat play and random play are available.
         12.2 Playable file formats
              12.2.1 MP3 file format
                 This format supports MPEG Audio 1, 2, 2.5 and Layer 1, 2, 3.
                 It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48kHz.
                 It supports bit rates of 8 to 320kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
              12.2.2 WMA file format
                 This format supports WMA Ver.9 Standard.
                 It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz , 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz.
                 It supports bit rates of 5 to 384kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
                 It does not support DRM.
                 It supports ASF files including audio streams only.
              12.2.3 AAC file format
                 This format supports MPEG4 AAC-LC.
                 It conforms to ITunes and 3GPP TS 26.244.
                 It supports file types of m4a, mp42 and 3gpX. (X is an arbitrary numeric value.)
                 ITunes is validated in the following versions: 4.*, 5.*, 6.* and 7.0-7.5.
                 It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48
                 kHz.
                 It supports bit rates of 8 to 320kbps and VBR (Variable Bit Rate).
                 It does not support DRM.
              12.2.4 WAV file format
                  This format supports RIFF WAVE.
                 It supports sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, 32 kHz, 11.025 kHz, 22.05 kHz, 44.1 kHz, 12 kHz, 24 kHz and 48k
                 Hz.
              If you try to play a file created in any format other than above, the LSI immediately terminates decoding it.
         12.3 Playing files having damaged data
               If the data section of the MP3 file is damaged, the LSI plays the music data in the possible range instead of
               ceasing to play the entire file. It mutes the unplayable section. However, AMUTE terminal remains H output.
               If the data section of the WAV file is damaged, noises are output.
               The LSI executes other files within the playable range and stops playing. Then, it searches to the next tune.
               If a part of the data header is damaged, the LSI immediately terminates playing and searches to the next tune.
               The movement after the next tune search depends on the setting of the "SET_NEXT_MODE_ON_ERR"
               command.
               If the file’s extension is playable but its file’s data does not have a format supporting to the extension, the LSI
               immediately terminates playing and searches to the next tune.
               If the file does not have a file format, the LSI immediately terminates playing and searches to the next tune.
               However, when the file data is structured in a format other than MP3 and its file extension is *.MP3, *.MP2 or
               *.MP1, the LSI plays it in the silence mode basically. However, if the LSI can read any playable data, it plays the
               file partially.
               In this case, the time information which is output as the serial status also becomes unstable. The time information
               is then partially output but you cannot obtain the correct information.

               You can select the operation as shown below depending on the next playing mode, repeat mode and random
               mode.
               Next playing mode
               [1]   PLAY_NEXT:            Automatically searches the next tune after the tune being played ends and starts
                                           playing the next tune.
               [2]   PLAY_ALL_STOP:        After the last tune being played within the memory ends, stops upon completion of
                                           search for the next tune.
                                           Starts playing the next tune by the play command issued subsequently.
               [3]   PLAY_FOL_STOP:        After the last tune being played within the folder ends, stops upon completion of
                                           search for the next tune.
                                           Starts playing the next tune by the play command issued subsequently.
               [4]   PLAY_TUN_STOP:        After the tune being played ends, stops upon completion of search for the next tune.
                                           Starts playing the next tune by the play command issued subsequently.
               Repeat mode
               Ⅰ：REPEAT_ALL:               After playing all the tunes within the memory in process, starts playing them from the
                                           beginning of the memory.
               Ⅱ：REPEAT_FOL:               Repeats playing tunes within the folder in process.
               Ⅲ：REPEAT_TUN:               Repeats playing the tune in process. The operation at the time of FF and FB
                                           command reception follows a setup of a SET_REPRAND command.
               Ⅳ：RANDOM_ALL:               Playback randomly selected from all tunes in the memory.
               Ⅴ：RANDOM_FOL:               Playback randomly selected from the playing folder now.
               Select one operation from next play mode and repeat mode respectively to determine the operation.
               When repeat mode is REPEAT_FOL, the PLAY_ALL_STOP becomes invalid, and serves as PLAY_NEXT.
               When repeat mode is [3][4], the PLAY_ALL_STOP and PLAY_FOL_STOP becomes invalid, and serves as
               PLAY_NEXT.

        13.2 Status output
                                                                                                                       2
         The operation information, such as internal statuses, play time, folders, files and Tags, is output using an I C interface.
         The statuses shown in Table 11. Status Register Map is output.
                                       2
         When reading status via I C, the OFFSET position is automatically incremented after reading byte data. However, by
                      2
         issuing the I C start condition, the OFFSET position is reset to OFFSET specified by the previous command.
         To read statuses, two methods are available: to specify OFFSET of the status register map and read any bytes
         continuously from the OFFSET position; and to read byte data by a command without specifying the OFFSET position.
         Table 12. shows the status output commands. Table 13 shows the effective state of the status output command.
                                           2
         Byte data, when reading via I C, is output in Little Endian format.
         When read over OFFSET=0x140, OFFSET does not return to 0x00, therefore the read value turns into an unfixed
         value.

14. System Operation MODE
          The LSI starts operation by setting up System Operation MODE after download of the program by IPL after a power
          supply and reset release.
          Possible operation changes with each modes of operation.
          Only the one mode can set up mode of operation with a command.
          The mode which is simultaneously different cannot be set up.
          A microcomputer sets up the change in System Operation MODE with a command.
          Please be sure to perform the changes to each mode via CONFIG mode.
          The changes between PLAYER mode and FILEREAD mode cannot be performed directly.
          The settlement of the following command is to do a re-setup because it is returned in the initial value when it passes
           through the CONFIG mode.
          REPEAT, RANDOM, SET_EQ, SET_NEXT, SET_REPRAND, SET_TAG, SET_PRM
          Command          CHG_SYSTEM_MODE
          N=0x00 ; CONFIG MODE
             It is in the state which changes after a power supply
             It is the mode which performs initial setting of a system.
             Please change to the mode of other operation after setting up with an initial-setting command.
             In this mode, even if it detects insertion of a memory, mount of a memory is not performed.
             The mount of a memory carried out behind each mode changes.
          N=0x01 ; PLAYER MODE
             It is the mode which performs decoding play of the file in a memory.
          N=0x02 ; FILE Read MODE
             It is the mode which Reading can perform about the specific file in a memory.
             A specific file can be deleted.
15. Resume information
          This LSI outputs the information for resume function, using READ_RESUME_INFO command.
                                            Table 14. Resume information register structure
                           The

         OFFSET
                          bytes
                                                           This data shows the information on the file being played and on
                                                           the play position.
                                    Resume information
        0x38-0x61           42                             The data has a LSI-unique structure.
                                            data
                                                           The resume information data is data of 42 bytes.
                                                           It outputs with a little endian.
          The above resume information has a LSI-unique structure and is used when executing resume play. Therefore, you
          should use the data contents as they are without rewriting.
          The resume function is implemented by writing the resume information read by READ_RESUME_INFO command to
          PLAY_RESUME command. After writing to PLAY_RESUME, the LSI automatically searches the resume. As for the
          action of the searches end, selectable from [Playback is started in the time when 「READ_RESUME_INFO」command
          was forwarded], [top (Pause) in the time when 「READ_RESUME_INFO」command was forwarded], [Playback is
          started from the front of the tune when 「READ_RESUME_INFO」command was forwarded], [Stop (Pause) the front
          of the tune when 「READ_RESUME_INFO」command was forwarded].
          After reading READ_RESUME_INFO command during file play, the LSI resumes the file from the time
          READ_RESUME_INFO has been read.
          The data contents read by READ_RESUME_INFO command cannot assure the operations when executing
          PLAY_RESUME which has been rewritten due to the positional information within the memory. If the resume
          information does not match because of change of memory, the LSI starts searches front file of memory.

21. Process information when a media mount error
        When media mount failure occurs, READ_MOUNT_ERROR command output the information on the stage of media
        mount operation.
        After being set to ERROR=1, the detailed information about in which process the error occurred can be read with this
        command.
        For example, when ERROR=1 and 1st byte=0x08 or 0x09, it turns out that mount error is caused by device response
        error for TEST UNIT READY or REQUEST SENSE.
        The details of an output value are shown below.
        1st byte (offset=0) of a read value outputs the process state of USB mount operation.
        A read value corresponds to the processing which went wrong.
        A read value is cleared at the start of a USB mount operation.
        A read value is updated irrespective of the success or failure of mount operation at the completion of mount operation.

23. Watch Dog Timer
      The LSI incorporates Watch Dog Timer, which monitors the system hang-up and resets whenever it occurs.
     After resetting hang-up. Can disable WDT using DIS_WDT command. Once WDT is disabled, it cannot be enabled until
     reset is input.
      When WDT, in the valid status, detects a hang-up within the LSI regardless of external situations (on the microcomputer),
     the LSI resets the system internally.
      To monitor whether the LSI is reset by WDT from the master microcomputer (external), use SET_WDT command to write
     H to STATUS WDT_RFLG and monitor this status. After reset, this status is read as L. This helps you judge that WDT
     has reset the LSI by reading out L when reading the status regularly after writing H using SET_WDT command.

    is exceeded, LSI might be destroyed. Please apply neither voltage nor the temperature that exceeds the
    absolute maximum rating. Please execute physical measures for safety such as fuse when it is thought to
    exceed the absolute maximum rating, and examine it so that the condition to exceed the absolute maximum
    rating is not applied to LSI.
  (5) About GND Voltage
    In any state of operation must be the lowest voltage about the voltage of the terminal GND. Please actually confirm the
    voltage of each terminal is not a voltage that is lower than the terminal GND including excessive phenomenon.
  (6) About design of overheating malfunction preventive circuit
    Please design overheating malfunction preventive circuit with an enough margin in consideration of a permissible loss in the
    state of using actually.
    Use a thermal design that allows for a sufficient margin in light of the power dissipation (Pd) in actual operating conditions.
    VQFN040V6060 package(BU94502CMUV)exposes its frame of the backside of package. Note that this part is assumed to
    use after providing heat dissipation treatment to improve heat dissipation efficiency. Try to occupy as wide as possible with
    heat dissipation pattern not only on the board surface but also the backside.
  (7) About the short between terminals and the mounting by mistake
    Please note the direction and the gap of position of LSI enough about LSI when you mount on the substrate.
    LSI might be destroyed when mounting by mistake and energizing. Moreover, LSI might be destroyed when short-circuited
    by entering of the foreign substances between the terminal and GND, between terminals, between the terminal and the
    power supply of LSI.
  (8) About operation in strong electromagnetic field
    Use in strong electromagnetic field has the possibility of malfunctioning and evaluate it enough, please.
  (9) Playing time of MP3 file
    The playing time when it can be acquired at the time of playing the MP3 file, may shift when fast forward playing, rewinding
    playing, and VBR playing.
  (10) About WMA
    Windows Media Audio is the music compression technology which Microsoft Corp. developed.
    Windows Media is the registered trademark of U.S. Microsoft Corporation in the U.S., and other countries.

  (11) About I C format I/F
                                           2
    Although this LSI has adopted the I C format, the level shifter circuit is not built in.
    For this reason, level shifter is needed for connection with the device besides the range of operating power supply voltage
    of this LSI.

                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
