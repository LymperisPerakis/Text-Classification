or beyond these limits. Device functional operating limits and guaranteed performance specifications are given under Electrical
Characteristics at the test conditions specified.
                    ESD Sensitive Device. This device is manufactured on a CMOS process. It is therefore generically susceptible
                    to damage from excessive static voltages. Proper ESD precautions must be taken during handling and storage
                    of this device.
Wolfson tests its package types according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020B for Moisture Sensitivity to determine acceptable storage
conditions prior to surface mount assembly. These levels are:
MSL1 = unlimited floor life at <30°C / 85% Relative Humidity. Not normally stored in moisture barrier bag.
MSL2 = out of bag storage for 1 year at <30°C / 60% Relative Humidity. Supplied in moisture barrier bag.

Notes:
1.    Ratio of output level with 1kHz full scale input, to the output level with all zeros into the digital input, measured ‘A’
      weighted.
2.    All performance measurements done with 20kHz low pass filter, and where noted an A-weight filter. Failure to use
      such a filter will result in higher THD+N and lower SNR and Dynamic Range readings than are found in the Electrical
      Characteristics. The low pass filter removes out of band noise; although it is not audible it may affect dynamic
      specification values.
3.    VMID decoupled with 10uF and 0.1uF capacitors (smaller values may result in reduced performance).
TERMINOLOGY
1.    Signal-to-noise ratio (dB) - SNR is a measure of the difference in level between the full scale output and the output
      with no signal applied. (No Auto-zero or Automute function is employed in achieving these results).
2.    Dynamic range (dB) - DNR is a measure of the difference between the highest and lowest portions of a signal.
      Normally a THD+N measurement at 60dB below full scale. The measured signal is then corrected by adding the 60dB
      to it. (e.g. THD+N @ -60dB= -32dB, DR= 92dB).
3.    THD (dB) - THD is a ratio, of the rms values, of Distortion/Signal.
4.    Stop band attenuation (dB) - Is the degree to which the frequency spectrum is attenuated (outside audio band).
5.    Channel Separation (dB) - Also known as Cross-Talk. This is a measure of the amount one channel is isolated from
      the other. Normally measured by sending a full scale signal down one channel and measuring the other.
6.    Pass-Band Ripple - Any variation of the frequency response in the pass-band region.

                The WM8569 includes an internal Power-On-Reset Circuit, as shown in Figure 7, which is used reset
                the digital logic into a default state after power up. The POR circuit is powered from DVDD and
                monitors DVDD. It asserts PORB low if DVDD is below a minimum threshold.

                Figure 8 shows a typical power-up sequence. When DVDD goes above the minimum threshold,
                Vpord, there is enough voltage for the circuit to guarantee PORB is asserted low and the chip is held
                in reset. In this condition, all writes to the control interface are ignored. When DVDD rises to
                Vpor_on, PORB is released high and all registers are in their default state and writes to the control
                interface may take place.
                On power down, PORB is asserted low whenever DVDD drops below the minimum threshold
                Vpor_off.

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION
                WM8569 is a complete 2-channel audio codec, including digital interpolation and decimation filters,
                multi-bit sigma delta stereo ADC, and switched capacitor multi-bit sigma delta DAC with volume
                control and output smoothing filter.
                The device is implemented as a separate stereo DAC and a stereo ADC in a single package and
                controlled by a single 3-wire software or hardware interface.
                The DAC has its own data input DIN, DAC word clock DACLRC, DAC bit clock DACBCLK and DAC
                master clock DACMCLK while the stereo ADC has its own data output DOUT, word clock ADCLRC,
                bit clock ADCBCLK and ADC master clock ADCMCLK. This allows the ADC and DAC to operate
                independently.
                The Audio Interface may be configured to operate in either master or slave mode. In Slave mode
                DACLRC/ADCLRC and DACBCLK/ADCBCLK are all inputs. In Master mode DACLRC/ADCLRC and
                DACBCLK/ADCBCLK are all outputs.
                The DAC has its own digital volume control that is adjustable in 0.5dB steps. A zero cross detect
                circuit is provided. The digital volume control detects a transition through the zero point before
                updating the volume. This minimises audible clicks and ‘zipper’ noise as the gain values change.
                Control of internal functionality of the device is by 3-wire serial or pin programmable control interface.
                Operation using master clocks of 128fs, 192fs, 256fs, 384fs, 512fs or 768fs is provided for the DAC,
                for operation of both the ADC and DAC master clocks of 256fs, 384fs, 512fs and 768fs is provided.
                In Slave mode, selection between clock rates is automatically controlled. In master mode, the
                sample rate is set by control bits DACRATE and ADCRATE. Audio sample rates (fs) from less than
                8kHz up to 192kHz are allowed for the DAC and from less than 32kHz up to 96kHz for the ADC,
                provided the appropriate master clock is input.
                The audio data interface supports right-justified, left-justified and I2S interface formats along with a
                highly flexible DSP serial port interface.
 AUDIO DATA SAMPLING RATES
                In a typical digital audio system there is only one central clock source producing a reference clock to
                which all audio data processing is synchronised. This clock is often referred to as the audio system’s
                Master Clock. The external master system clock can be applied directly through the ADC and DAC
                MCLK input pin(s) with no software configuration necessary. In a system where there are a number
                of possible sources for the reference clock it is recommended that the clock source with the lowest
                jitter be used to optimise the performance of the ADC and DAC.
                The DAC master clock for WM8569 supports audio sampling rates from 128fs to 768fs, where fs is
                the audio sampling frequency (DACLRC) typically 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz or 192kHz. The
                ADC master clock for WM8569 supports audio sampling rates from 256fs to 768fs, where fs is the
                audio sampling frequency (ADCLRC) typically 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz or 96kHz. The master clock is
                used to operate the digital filters and the noise shaping circuits.
                In Slave mode the WM8569 has a master clock detection circuit that automatically determines the
                relationship between the system clock frequency and the sampling rate (to within +/- 32 master
                clocks). If there is a greater than 32 clocks error the interface defaults to 768fs mode. The master
                clocks must be synchronised with LRC, although the WM8569 is tolerant of phase variations or jitter
                on this clock. Table 6 shows the typical master clock frequency inputs for the WM8569.
                The signal processing for the WM8569 typically operates at an oversampling rate of 128fs for both
                ADC and DAC. The exception to this for the DAC is for operation with a 128/192fs system clock, e.g.
                for 192kHz operation, when the oversampling rate is 64fs. For ADC operation at 96kHz it is
                recommended that the user set the ADCOSR bit. This changes the ADC signal processing
                oversample rate to 64fs.

HARDWARE CONTROL MODES
                When the MODE pin is held high, the following hardware modes of operation are available.
                Note: When in hardware mode the ADC and DAC will only run in slave mode.
                MUTE AND AUTOMUTE OPERATION
                In both hardware and software modes, MUTE controls the selection of MUTE directly, and can be
                used to enable and disable the automute function. This pin becomes an output when left floating and
                indicates infinite ZERO detect (IZD) has been detected.
                                                                    DESCRIPTION

                                      L=IZD detected, H=IZD not detected.
                Table 7 Mute and Automute Control
                Figure 9 shows the application and release of MUTE whilst a full amplitude sinusoid is being played
                at 48kHz sampling rate. When MUTE (lower trace) is asserted, the output (upper trace) begins to
                decay exponentially from the DC level of the last input sample. The output will decay towards VMID
                with a time constant of approximately 64 input samples. If MUTE is applied to all channels for 1024
                or more input samples the outputs will be connected directly to VMID if IZD is set. When MUTE is de-
                asserted, the output will restart immediately from the current input sample.

       The MUTE pin is an input to select mute or not mute. MUTE is active high; taking the pin high
       causes the filters to soft mute, ramping down the audio signal over a few milliseconds. Taking MUTE
       low again allows data into the filter.
       The automute function detects a series of ZERO value audio samples of 1024 samples long being
       applied to both channels. After such an event, a latch is set whose output (AUTOMUTED) is wire
       OR’d through a 10kΩ resistor to the MUTE pin. Thus if the MUTE pin is not being driven, the
       automute function will assert mute.
       If MUTE is tied low, AUTOMUTED is overridden and will not mute unless the IZD register bit is set. If
       MUTE is driven from a bi-directional source, then both MUTE and automute functions are available. If
       MUTE is not driven, AUTOMUTED appears as a weak output (10kΩ source impedance) and can be
       used to drive external mute circuits. AUTOMUTED will be removed as soon as any channel receives
       a non-ZERO input.
       A diagram showing how the various Mute modes interact is shown below.

DIGITAL AUDIO INTERFACE
                 MASTER AND SLAVE MODES
                 The audio interface operates in either Slave or Master mode, selectable using the DACMS and
                 ADCMS control bits. In both Master and Slave modes DIN is always an input to the WM8569 and
                 DOUT is always an output. The default is Slave mode.
                 In Slave mode, DACLRC, ADCLRC, DACBCLK and ADCBCLK are inputs to the WM8569 (Figure
                 11). DIN and DACLRC are sampled by the WM8569 on the rising edge of DACBCLK. ADC data is
                 output on DOUT and changes on the falling edge of ADCBCLK.
                 By setting the control bit DACBCP the polarity of DACBCLK may be reversed so that DIN is sampled
                 on the falling edge of DACBCLK. By setting the control bit ADCBCP, the polarity of ADCBCLK may
                 be reversed so that DOUT changes on the rising edge of ADCBCLK.
                 Figure 11 Slave Mode
                 In Master mode, DACLRC, ADCLRC, DACBCLK and ADCBCLK are outputs from the WM8569
                 (Figure 12). DACLRC, ADCLRC, DACBCLK and ADCBCLK are generated by the WM8569. DIN is
                 sampled by the WM8569 on the rising edge of DACBCLK so the controller must output DAC data
                 that changes on the falling edge of DACBCLK. ADC data is output on DOUT and changes on the
                 falling edge of ADCBCLK.
                 By setting the control bit DACBCP the polarity of DACBCLK may be reversed so that DIN is sampled
                 on the falling edge of DACBCLK. By setting the control bit ADCBCP, the polarity of ADCBCLK may
                 be reversed so that DOUT changes on the rising edge of ADCBCLK.

       AUDIO INTERFACE FORMATS
       Audio data is applied to the internal DAC filters or output from the ADC filters, via the Digital Audio
       Interface. 5 popular interface formats are supported:
       •      Left Justified mode
       •      Right Justified mode
       •      I2S mode
       •      DSP Mode A
       •      DSP Mode B
       All 5 formats send the MSB first and support word lengths of 16, 20, 24 and 32 bits, with the
       exception of 32 bit right justified mode, which is not supported.
       In left justified, right justified and I2S modes, the digital audio interface receives DAC data on the DIN
       input and outputs ADC data on DOUT. Audio Data for each stereo channel is time multiplexed with
       DACLRC/ADCLRC indicating whether the left or right channel is present. DACLRC/ADCLRC is also
       used as a timing reference to indicate the beginning or end of the data words.
       In left justified, right justified and I2S modes, the minimum number of BCLKs per LRC period is 2
       times the selected word length. LRC must be high for a minimum of word length BCLKs and low for a
       minimum of word length BCLKs. Any mark to space ratio on LRC is acceptable provided the above
       requirements are met.
       In DSP mode A or B, the DAC channels are time multiplexed onto DIN. LRC is used as a frame sync
       signal to identify the MSB of the first word. The minimum number of DACBCLKs per DACLRC period
       is 6 times the selected word length. Any mark to space ratio is acceptable on DACLRC provided the
       rising edge is correctly positioned. The ADC data may also be output in DSP mode A or B, with
       ADCLRC used as a frame sync to identify the MSB of the first word. The minimum number of
       ADCBCLKs per ADCLRC period is 2 times the selected word length if only the ADC is being
       operated.
       LEFT JUSTIFIED MODE
       In left justified mode, the MSB of DIN is sampled by the WM8569 on the first rising edge of
       DACBCLK following a DACLRC transition. The MSB of the ADC data is output on DOUT and
       changes on the same falling edge of ADCBCLK as ADCLRC and may be sampled on the rising edge
       of BCLK. LRC is high during the left samples and low during the right samples (Figure 13).

       The MSB of the left channel ADC data is output on DOUT and changes on the same falling edge of
       ADCBCLK as the low to high ADCLRC transition and may be sampled on the rising edge of
       ADCBCLK. The right channel ADC data is contiguous with the left channel data (Figure 19).

POWERDOWN MODES
                The WM8569 has powerdown control bits allowing specific parts of the WM8569 to be powered off
                when not being used. Control bit ADCPD powers off the ADC. The three stereo DACs each have a
                separate powerdown control bit, DACPD[2:0] allowing individual stereo DACs to be powered off when
                not in use. Setting ADCPD and DACPD[2:0] will powerdown everything except the references VMID
                and REFADC. These may be powered down by setting PDWN. Setting PDWN will override all other
                powerdown control bits. It is recommended that the ADC and DACs are powered down before setting
                PDWN.
ZERO DETECT
                The WM8569 has a zero detect circuit for each DAC channel that detects when 1024 consecutive
                zero samples have been input. The MUTE pin output may be programmed to output the zero detect
                signal which may then be used to control external muting circuits. A ‘1’ on MUTE indicates a zero
                detect. The zero detect may also be used to automatically enable DAC mute by setting IZD.
SOFTWARE CONTROL INTERFACE OPERATION
                The WM8569 is controlled using a 3-wire serial interface in software mode or pin
                programmable in hardware mode.
                The control mode is selected by the state of the MODE pin.
                3-WIRE (SPI COMPATIBLE) SERIAL CONTROL MODE
                SDIN/DM is used for the program data, SCLK/IWL is used to clock in the program data and CSB/IDF
                is used to latch the program data. SDIN/DM is sampled on the rising edge of SCLK/IWL. The 3-wire
                interface protocol is shown in Figure 20.

                ATTENUATOR CONTROL MODE
                Setting the ATC register bit causes the left channel attenuation settings to be applied to both the left
                and right channel of the DAC from the next audio input sample. No update to the attenuation
                registers is required for ATC to take effect.

                Setting the IZD register bit will enable the internal infinite zero detect function:

                With IZD enabled, applying 1024 consecutive zero input samples each stereo channel will cause that
                stereo channel outputs to be muted to VMID. Mute will be removed as soon as that stereo channel
                receives a non-zero input.

       In left justified, right justified or I2S modes, the DACLRP register bit controls the polarity of DACLRC.
       If this bit is set high, the expected polarity of DACLRC will be the opposite of that shown Figure 13,
       Figure 14 and Figure 15. Note that if this feature is used as a means of swapping the left and right
       channels, a 1 sample phase difference will be introduced. In DSP modes, the DACLRP register bit is
       used to select between modes A and B.

        By default, DACLRC and DIN are sampled on the rising edge of DACBCLK and should ideally
        change on the falling edge. Data sources that change DACLRC and DIN on the rising edge of
        DACBCLK can be supported by setting the DACBCP register bit. Setting DACBCP to 1 inverts the
        polarity of DACBCLK to the inverse of that shown in Figure 13 to Figure 19.

       Note: 32-bit right justified mode is not supported.
       In all modes, the data is signed 2's complement. The digital filters always input 24-bit data. If the
       DAC is programmed to receive 16 or 20 bit data, the WM8569 pads the unused LSBs with zeros. If
       the DAC is programmed into 32 bit mode, the 8 LSBs are ignored.
                            2
       Note: In 24 bit I S mode, any width of 24 bits or less is supported provided that LRC is high for a
       minimum of 24 BCLKs and low for a minimum of 24 BCLKs.
       A number of options are available to control how data from the Digital Audio Interface is applied to
       the DAC channels.

                The Digital volume control also incorporates a zero cross detect circuit which detects a transition
                through the zero point before updating the digital volume control with the new volume. This is
                enabled by control bit ZCD.

                Refer to Figure 9 for the plot of application and release of soft mute.
                Note that all other means of muting the DAC channels: setting the PL[3:0] bits to 0, setting the
                PDWN bit or setting attenuation to 0 will cause much more abrupt muting of the output.

        In left justified, right justified or I S modes, the ADCLRP register bit controls the polarity of ADCLRC.
        If this bit is set high, the expected polarity of ADCLRC will be the opposite of that shown in Figure
        13, Figure 14 and Figure 15. Note that if this feature is used as a means of swapping the left and
        right channels, a 1 sample phase difference will be introduced. In DSP modes, the ADCLRP register
        bit is used to select between modes A and B.

        By default, ADCLRC and DOUT are sampled on the rising edge of ADCBCLK and should ideally
        change on the falling edge. Data sources that change ADCLRC and DOUT on the rising edge of
        ADCBCLK can be supported by setting the ADCBCP register bit. Setting ADCBCP to 1 inverts the
        polarity of ADCBCLK to the inverse of that shown in Figure 13 to Figure 19

       MUTE PIN DECODE
       The MUTE pin can either be used an output or an input. As an output it indicated 1024 consecutive
       zero samples to the DAC. By default selecting the MUTE to represent if the DAC has received more
       than 1024 midrail samples will cause the MUTE to be asserted as a softmute on the DAC. Disabling
       the decode block will cause any logical high on the MUTE pin to apply a softmute to the DAC.

SUGGESTED ANALOGUE LOW PASS POST DAC FILTERS
It is recommended that a lowpass filter be applied to the output from each DAC channel for Hi Fi applications. Typically a
second order filter is suitable and provides sufficient attenuation of high frequency components (the unique low order, high
bit count multi-bit sigma delta DAC structure used in WM8569 produces much less high frequency output noise than
normal sigma delta DACs. This filter is typically also used to provide the 2x gain needed to provide the standard 2Vrms
output level from most consumer equipment.
Wolfson Application Note WAN0171 provides details of suitable post-DAC filter circuits.
