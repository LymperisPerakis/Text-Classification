ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS
Absolute Maximum Ratings are stress ratings only. Permanent damage to the device may be caused by continuously operating at
or beyond these limits. Device functional operating limits and guaranteed performance specifications are given under Electrical
Characteristics at the test conditions specified.
                    ESD Sensitive Device. This device is manufactured on a CMOS process. It is therefore generically susceptible to
                    damage from excessive static voltages. Proper ESD precautions must be taken during handling and storage of
                    this device.
Cirrus Logic tests its package types according to IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020B for Moisture Sensitivity to determine acceptable storage
conditions prior to surface mount assembly. These levels are:
MSL1 = unlimited floor life at <30C / 85% Relative Humidity. Not normally stored in moisture barrier bag.
MSL2 = out of bag storage for 1 year at <30C / 60% Relative Humidity. Supplied in moisture barrier bag.
MSL3 = out of bag storage for 168 hours at <30C / 60% Relative Humidity. Supplied in moisture barrier bag.
The Moisture Sensitivity Level for each package type is specified in Ordering Information.

POWER CONSUMPTION
The power consumption of the WM9714L depends on the following factors:
           Supply voltages: Reducing the supply voltages also reduces digital supply currents, end therefore results in significant
            power savings especially in the digital sections of the WM9714L.
           Operating mode: Significant power savings can be achieved by always disabling parts of the WM9714L that are not used
            (e.g. audio ADC, DAC, AUXADC).
           Sample rates: Running at lower sample rates will reduce power consumption significantly. The figures below are for 48kHz
            (unless otherwise specified), but in many scenarios it is not necessary to run at this frequency, e.g. 8kHz PCM voice call
            scenario uses only 11.4mW (see below).

DEVICE DESCRIPTION
INTRODUCTION
               The WM9714L is a largely pin-compatible upgrade to WM9712, with a PCM voice CODEC added.
               This CODEC is interfaced via a PCM type audio interface which makes use of GPIO pins for
               connection.
               It is designed to meet the mixed-signal requirements of portable and wireless smartphone systems. It
               includes audio recording and playback, battery monitoring, auxiliary ADC and GPIO functions, all
               controlled through a single 5-wire AC-Link interface. Additionally, PCM voice CODEC functions are
               supported through provision of an additional voice DAC and a PCM audio serial interface.
               A PLL is included to allow unrelated reference clocks to be used for generation of the AC link system
               clock. Typically 13MHz or 2.048MHz clock sources might be used as a reference.
               SOFTWARE SUPPORT
               The basic audio features of the WM9714L are software compatible with standard AC’97 device
               drivers. However, to better support additional functions, Cirrus Logic supplies custom device drivers
               for selected CPUs and operating systems. Please contact your local Cirrus Logic representative for
               more information.
               AC’97 COMPATIBILITY
               The WM9714L uses an AC’97 interface to communicate with a microprocessor or controller. The
               audio and GPIO functions are largely compliant with AC’97 Revision 2.2. The following differences
               from the AC’97 standard are noted:
                         Pinout: The function of some pins has been changed to support device specific features.
                          The PHONE and PCBEEP pins have been moved to different locations on the device
                          package.
                         Package: The default package for the WM9714L is a 77mm leadless QFN package.
                         Audio mixing: The WM9714L handles all the audio functions of a smartphone, including
                          audio playback, voice recording, phone calls, phone call recording, ring tones, as well as
                          simultaneous use of these features. The AC’97 mixer architecture does not fully support
                          this. The WM9714L therefore uses a modified AC’97 mixer architecture with three separate
                          mixers.
                         Tone Control, Bass Boost and 3D Enhancement: These functions are implemented in the
                          digital domain and therefore affect only signals being played through the audio DACs, not all
                          output signals as stipulated in AC’97.
               Some other functions are additional to AC’97:
                         On-chip BTL loudspeaker driver for mono or stereo speakers
                         On-chip BTL driver for ear speaker (phone receiver)
                         Auxiliary mono DAC for ring tones, system alerts etc.
                         Auxiliary ADC Inputs
                         2 Analogue Comparators for Battery Alarm
                         Programmable Filter Characteristics for Tone Control and 3D Enhancement
                         PCM interface to additional Voice DAC and existing audio ADCs
                         PLL to create AC’97 system clock from unrelated reference clock input
               PCM CODEC
               The PCM voice CODEC functions typically required by mobile telephony devices are provided by an
               extra voice DAC on the WM9714L, which is interfaced via a standard PCM type data interface, which
               is constructed through optional use of 4 of the GPIO pins on WM9714L. The audio output data from
               one or both of the audio ADCs can also be output over this PCM interface, allowing a full voice
               CODEC function to be implemented. This PCM interface supports sample rates from 8 to 48ks/s using
               the standard AC’97 master clock.

CLOCK GENERATION
                WM9714L supports clocking from 2 separate sources, which can be selected via the AC’97 interface:
                      External clock input MCLKA
                      External clock input MCLKB
                The source clock is divided to appropriate frequencies in order to run the AC’97 interface, PCM
                interface, voice DAC and Hi-fi DSP by means of a programmable divider block. Clock rates may be
                changed during operation via the AC’97 link in order to support alternative modes, for example low
                power mode when voice data is being transmitted only. A PLL is present to add flexibility in selection
                of input clock frequencies, typical choices being 2.048MHz, 4.096MHz or 13MHz.
                INITIALISING THE AC’97 LINK
                By default, the AC’97 link is disabled and therefore will not be running after power on or a COLD reset
                event. Before any register map configuration can begin, it is necessary to start the AC’97 link. This is
                achieved by sending a WARM reset to the CODEC as defined in Figure 6.
                Default mode on power-up also assumes a clock will be present on MCLKA with the PLL powered
                down. After a WARM reset the CODEC will start the AC’97 link using MCLKA as a reference. This
                enables data to be clocked via the AC’97 link to define the desired clock divider mode and whether
                PLL needs to be activated.
                Note: MCLKA can be any available frequency.
                When muxing between MCLKA and MCLKB both clocks must be active for at least two clock cycles
                after the switching event.
CLOCK DIVISION MODES
                Figure 10 shows the clocking strategy for WM9714L. Clocking is controlled by CLK_MUX, CLK_SRC
                and S[6:0].
                          CLKAX2, CLKBX2 – clock doublers on inputs MCLKA and MCLKB.
                          CLK_MUX - selects between MCLKA and MCLKB.
                          CLK_SRC – selects between external or PLL derived clock reference.
                          S[3:0] – sets the voice DAC clock rate and PCM interface clock when in master mode
                           (division ratio 1 to 16 available).
                          S[6:4] - sets the hi-fi clocking rate (division ratio 1 to 8 available).
                The registers used to set these switches can be accessed from register address 44h (see Table 3).
                If a mode change requires switching from an external clock to a PLL generated clock then it is
                recommended to set the clock division ratios required for the PLL clock scheme prior to switching
                between clocks. This option is accommodated by means of two sets of registers. SPLL[6:0] is used to
                set the divide ratio of the clock when in PLL mode and SEXT[6:0] is used to divide the clock when it is
                derived from an external source. If the PLL is selected (CLK_SRC = 0), S[6:0] = SPLL[6:0]. SPLL[6:0] is
                defined in register 46h (see Table 4) and is written to using the page address mode. More details on
                page address mode for controlling the PLL are found on page 24. Register 46h also contains a
                number of separate control bits relating to the PLL’s function. If an external clock is selected
                (CLK_SRC = 1) S[6:0] = SEXT[6:0]. SEXT[6:0] is defined in register address 44h. Writing to registers 44h
                and 46h enables pre-programming of the required clock mode before the PLL output is selected.

         AUXADC
         The clock for the AUXADC nominally runs at 768kHz and is derived from BITCLK. The divisor for the
         clock generator is set by PENDIV. This enables the AUXADC clock frequency to be set according to
         power consumption and conversion rate considerations.
         Clock mode and division ratios are controlled by register 44h as shown in Table 3.

PLL MODE
         The PLL operation is controlled by register 46h (see Table 4) and has two modes of operation:
                  Integer N
                  Fractional N
         The PLL has been optimized for nominal input clock (PLL_IN) frequencies in the range 8.192MHz –
         19.661MHz (LF=0) and 2.048MHz – 4.9152MHz (LF=1). Through use of a clock divider (div by 2 / 4)
         on the input to the PLL frequencies up to 78.6MHz can be accommodated. The input clock divider is
         enabled by DIVSEL (0=Off) and the division ratio is set by DIVCTL (0=div2, 1=div4).

                                                                                           WM9714L
        INTEGER N MODE
        The nominal output frequency of the PLL (PLL_OUT) is 98.304MHz which is divided by 4 to achieve a
        nominal system clock of 24.576MHz.
        The integer division ratio (N) is determined by: FPLL_out / FPLL_IN , and is set by N[3:0] and must be in the
        range 5 to 12 for integer N operation (0101 = div by 5, 1100 = div by 12). Note that setting LF=1
        enables a further division by 4 required for input frequencies in the range 2.048MHz – 4.096MHz.
        Integer N mode is selected by setting SDM=0.
        FRACTIONAL N MODE
        Fractional N mode provides a divide resolution of 1/222 and is set by K[21:0] (register 46h, see
        section). The relationship between the required division X, the fractional division K[21:0] and the
        integer division N[3:0] is:
                    K  2 22  X  N 
                   where 0 < (X – N) < 1 and K is rounded to the nearest whole number.
        For example, if the PLL_IN clock is 13MHz and the desired PLL_OUT clock is 98.304MHz then the
        desired division, X, is 7.5618. So N[3:0] will be 7h and K[21:0] will be 23F488h to produce the desired
        98.304MHz clock (see Table 5).

                 register 46h using a sub-page address system. The 3-bit pager address allows 8 blocks of 4-bit data
                 words to be accessed whilst the register address is set to 46h. This means that when register address
                 46h is selected a further 7 cycles of programming are required to set all of the page data bits. Control
                 bit allocation for these page addresses is described in Table 6.

DIGITAL INTERFACES
                 The WM9714L has two interfaces, a data and control AC’97 interface and a data only PCM interface.
                 The AC’97 interface is available through dedicated pins (SDATAOUT, SDATAIN, SYNC, BITCLK and
                 RESETB) and is the sole control interface with access to all data streams on the device except for the
                 Voice DAC. The PCM interface is available through the GPIO pins (PCMCLK, PCMFS, PCMDAC and
                 PCMADC) and provides access to the Voice DAC. It can also transmit the data from the Stereo ADC.
                 This can be useful, for example, to allow both sides of a phone conversation to be recorded by mixing
                 the transmit and receive paths on one of the ADC channels and transmitting it over the PCM interface.

AC97 INTERFACE
               INTERFACE PROTOCOL
               The WM9714L uses an AC’97 interface for both data transfer and control. The AC-Link has 5 wires:
                         SDATAIN (pin 8) carries data from the WM9714L to the controller
                         SDATAOUT (pin 5) carries data from the controller to the WM9714L
                         BITCLK (pin 6) is a clock, derived from either MCLKA or MCLKB inputs and supplied to the
                          controller.
                         SYNC is a synchronization signal generated by the controller and passed to the WM9714L
                         RESETB resets the WM9714L to its default state

               The SDATAIN and SDATAOUT signals each carry 13 time-division multiplexed data streams (slots 0
               to 12). A complete sequence of slots 0 to 12 is referred to as an AC-Link frame, and contains a total of
               256 bits. The frame rate is 48kHz. This makes it possible to simultaneously transmit and receive
               multiple data streams (e.g. audio, AUXADC, control) at sample rates up to 48kHz.
               Detailed information can be found in the AC’97 (Revision 2.2) specification, which can be obtained at
               www.intel.com/design/chipsets/audio/
               Note:
               SDATAOUT and SYNC must be held low when RESETB is applied. These signals must be held low
               for the entire duration of the RESETB pulse and especially during the low-to-high transition of
               RESETB. If SDATAOUT or SYNC is high during reset, the WM9714L may enter test modes.
               Information relating to this operation is available in the AC'97 specification and in Application Note
               WAN 0104.
PCM INTERFACE
               OPERATION
               WM9714L can implement a PCM voice CODEC function using the dedicated VXDAC and either one
               or both of the existing hi-fi ADC’s. In PCM CODEC mode, VXDAC input and ADC output are
               interfaced via a PCM style port via GPIO pins.
               This interface can support one ADC channel, or stereo/dual ADC channels if required, (two channels
               of data are sent per PCM frame as back to back words).
               In voice-only mode, the AC link is used only for control information, not audio data. Therefore it will
               generally be shut down (PR4=1), except when control data must be sent.
               The PCM interface makes use of 4 of the GPIO interface pins, for clock, frame, and data in/out. If the
               PCM CODEC function is not enabled then the GPIO pins may be used for other functions.

                                                                             WM9714L
   INTERFACE PROTOCOL
   The WM9714L PCM audio interface is used for the input of data to the Voice DAC and the output of
   data from the Stereo ADC. When enabled, the PCM audio interface uses four GPIO pins:
             GPIO1/PCMCLK: Bit clock
             GPIO3/PCMFS: Frame Sync
             GPIO4/PCMDAC: Voice DAC data input
             GPIO5/PCMADC: Stereo ADC data output
   Depending on the mode of operation (see “PCM Interface Modes”), at least one of these four pins
   must be set up as an output by writing to register 4Ch (see Table 57). When not enabled the GPIOs
   may be used for other functions on the WM9714L.
   PCM INTERFACE MODES
   The WM9714L PCM audio interface may be configured in one of four modes:
             Disabled Mode: The WM9714L disables and tri-states all PCM interface pins. Any clock
              input is ignored and ADC/DAC data is not transferred.
             Slave Mode: The WM9714L accepts PCMCLK and PCMFS as inputs from an external
              source.
             Master Mode: The WM9714L generates PCMCLK and PCMFS as outputs.
             Partial Master Mode: The WM9714L generates PCMCLK as an output, and accepts PCMFS
              as an external input.
   PCM AUDIO DATA FORMATS
   Four different audio data formats are supported:
             DSP mode
             Left justified
             Right justified
             I2S
   All four of these modes are MSB first. They are described below. Refer to “Signal Timing
   Requirements” for timing information.
   Note:
   PCMCLK and PCMFS must be synchronized with the BITCLK from the AC’97 interface.
   The PCM Interface may be configured for Mono mode, where only one channel of ADC data is output.
   In this mode the interface should be configured for DSP mode. A short or long frame sync is
   supported and the MSB is available on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A) rising edge of VXCLK.
   Note that when operating in stereo mode the mono Voice DAC always uses the left channel data as
   its input.

        In DSP mode, the left channel MSB is available on either the 1st (mode B) or 2nd (mode A) rising
        edge of PCMCLK (selectable by FSP) following a rising edge of PCMFS. Right channel data
        immediately follows left channel data. Depending on word length, PCMCLK frequency and sample
        rate, there may be unused PCMCLK cycles between the LSB of the right channel data and the next
        sample.

AUDIO ADCS
STEREO ADC
           The WM9714L has a stereo sigma-delta ADC to digitize audio signals. The ADC achieves high quality
           audio recording at low power consumption. The ADC sample rate can be controlled by writing to a
           control register (see “Variable Rate Audio / Sample Rate Conversion”). It is independent of the DAC
           sample rate.
           To save power, the left and right ADCs can be separately switched off using the Powerdown bits
           ADCL and ADCR (register 3Ch, bits 5:4), whereas PR0 disables both ADCs (see “Power
           Management”). If only one ADC is running, the same ADC data appears on both the left and right AC-
           Link slots.
           The output from the ADC can be sent over either the AC link as usual, or output via the PCM interface
           which may be configured on the GPIO pins.
           HIGH PASS FILTER
           The WM9714L audio ADC incorporates a digital high pass filter that eliminates any DC bias from the
           ADC output data. The filter is enabled by default. For DC measurements, it can be disabled by writing
           a ‘1’ to the HPF bit (register 5Ch, bit 3).
           This high pass filter corner frequency can be selected to have different values in WM9714L, to suit
           applications such as voice where a higher cutoff frequency is required.

           ADC SLOT MAPPING
           By default, the output of the left audio ADC appears on slot 3 of the SDATAIN signal (pin 8), and the
           right ADC data appears on slot 4. However, the ADC output data can also be sent to other slots, by
           setting the ASS (ADC slot select) control bits as shown below.

RECORD SELECTOR
               The record selector determines which input signals are routed into the audio ADC. The left and right
               channels can be selected independently. This is useful for recording a phone call: one channel can be
               used for the RX signal and the other for the TX signal, so that both sides of the conversation are
               digitized.

RECORD GAIN
            The amplitude of the signal that enters the audio ADC is controlled by the Record PGA
            (Programmable Gain Amplifier). The PGA gain can be programmed either by writing to the Record
            Gain register, or by the Automatic Level Control (ALC) circuit (see page 34). If the ALC is enabled,
            any writes to the Record Gain register have no effect.
            Two different gain ranges can be implemented: the standard gain range defined in the AC’97
            standard, or an extended gain range with smaller gain steps. The ALC circuit always uses the
            extended gain range, as this has been found to result in better sound quality.

            The output of the Record PGA can also be mixed into the phone and/or headphone outputs (see
            “Audio Mixers”). This makes it possible to use the ALC function for the microphone signal in a
            smartphone application.

AUTOMATIC LEVEL CONTROL
                The WM9714L has an automatic level control that aims to keep a constant recording volume
                irrespective of the input signal level. This is achieved by continuously adjusting the PGA gain so that
                the signal level at the ADC input remains constant. A digital peak detector monitors the ADC output
                and changes the PGA gain if necessary.

                                                                                      WM9714L
        HOLD TIME
        Hold time is the time delay between the peak level detected being below target and the PGA gain
        beginning to ramp up. It can be programmed in power-of-two (2n) steps, e.g. 2.67ms, 5.33ms,
        10.67ms etc. up to 43.7s. Alternatively, the hold time can also be set to zero. The hold time only
        applies to gain ramp-up, there is no delay before ramping the gain down when the signal level is
        above target.
        DECAY (GAIN RAMP-UP) TIME
        Decay time is the time that it takes for the PGA gain to ramp up across 90% of its range (e.g. from
        –15B up to 27.75dB). The time it takes for the recording level to return to its target value therefore
        depends on both the decay time and on the gain adjustment required. If the gain adjustment is small,
        it will be shorter than the decay time. The decay time can be programmed in power-of-two (2n) steps,
        from 24ms, 48ms, 96ms, etc. to 24.58s.
        ATTACK (GAIN RAMP-DOWN) TIME
        Attack time is the time that it takes for the PGA gain to ramp down across 90% of its range (e.g. from
        27.75dB down to –15B gain). The time it takes for the recording level to return to its target value
        therefore depends on both the attack time and on the gain adjustment required. If the gain adjustment
        is small, it will be shorter than the attack time. The attack time can be programmed in power-of-two
        (2n) steps, from 6ms, 12ms, 24ms, etc. to 6.14s.
        When operating in stereo, the peak detector takes the maximum of left and right channel peak values,
        and any new gain setting is applied to both left and right PGAs, so that the stereo image is preserved.
        However, the ALC function can also be enabled on one channel only. In this case, only one PGA is
        controlled by the ALC mechanism, while the other channel runs independently with its PGA gain set
        through the control register.
        When one ADC channel is unused, the peak detector disregards that channel. The ALC function can
        also operate when the two ADC outputs are mixed to mono in the digital domain, but not if they are
        mixed to mono in the analogue domain, before entering the ADCs.

   The MAXGAIN register sets the maximum gain value that the PGA can be set to whilst under the
   control of the ALC. This has no effect on the PGA when ALC is not enabled.

                                                                                        WM9714L
        PEAK LIMITER
        To prevent clipping when a large signal occurs just after a period of quiet, the ALC circuit includes a
        limiter function. If the ADC input signal exceeds 87.5% of full scale (–1.16dB), the PGA gain is ramped
        down at the maximum attack rate (as when ATK = 0000), until the signal level falls below 87.5% of full
        scale. This function is automatically enabled whenever the ALC is enabled.
        (Note: If ATK = 0000, then the limiter makes no difference to the operation of the ALC. It is designed
        to prevent clipping when long attack times are used).
        NOISE GATE
        When the signal is very quiet and consists mainly of noise, the ALC function may cause “noise
        pumping”, i.e. loud hissing noise during silence periods. The WM9714L has a noise gate function that
        prevents noise pumping by comparing the signal level at the input pins (i.e. before the record PGA)
        against a noise gate threshold, NGTH. Provided that the noise gate function is enabled (NGAT = 1),
        the noise gate cuts in when:
              Signal level at ADC [dB] < NGTH [dB] + PGA gain [dB] + Mic Boost gain [dB]
        This is equivalent to:
              Signal level at input pin [dB] < NGTH [dB]
        The PGA gain is then held constant (preventing it from ramping up as it normally would when the
        signal is quiet). If the NGG bit is set, the ADC output is also muted when the noise gate cuts in.
        Table 15 summarises the noise gate control register. The NGTH control bits set the noise gate
        threshold with respect to the ADC full-scale range. The threshold is adjusted in 1.5dB steps. Levels at
        the extremes of the range may cause inappropriate operation, so care should be taken with set–up of
        the function. Note that the noise gate only works in conjunction with the ALC function, and always
        operates on the same channel(s) as the ALC (left, right, both, or none).

AUDIO DACS
STEREO DAC
           The WM9714L has a stereo sigma-delta DAC that achieves high quality audio playback at low power
           consumption. Digital tone control, adaptive bass boost and 3-D enhancement functions operate on the
           digital audio data before it is passed to the stereo DAC. (Contrary to the AC’97 specification, they
           have no effect on analogue input signals or signals played through the auxiliary DAC. Nevertheless,
           the ID2 and ID5 bits in the reset register, 00h, are set to ‘1’ to indicate that the WM9714L supports
           tone control and bass boost.)
           The DAC output has a PGA for volume control. The DAC sample rate can be controlled by writing to a
           control register (see “Variable Rate Audio / Sample Rate Conversion”). It is independent of the ADC
           sample rate.
           When not in use the DACs can be separately powered down using the Powerdown register bits DACL
           and DACR (register 3Ch, bits [7:6]).
           STEREO DAC VOLUME
           The volume of the DAC output signal is controlled by a PGA (Programmable Gain Amplifier). Each
           DAC can be mixed into the headphone, speaker and mono mixer paths (see “Audio Mixers”)
           controlled by register 0Ch.
           Each DAC-to-mixer path has an independent mute bit. When all DAC-to-mixer paths are muted the
           DAC PGA is muted automatically.
           When not in use the DAC PGAs can be powered down using the Powerdown register bits DACL and
           DACR (register 3Ch, bits [7:6]).

        TONE CONTROL / BASS BOOST
        The WM9714L provides separate controls for bass and treble with programmable gains and filter
        characteristics. This function operates on digital audio data before it is passed to the audio DACs.
        Bass control can take two different forms:
                  Linear bass control: bass signals are amplified or attenuated by a user programmable gain.
                   This is independent of signal volume, and very high bass gains on loud signals may lead to
                   signal clipping.
                  Adaptive bass boost: The bass volume is amplified by a variable gain. When the bass
                   volume is low, it is boosted more than when the bass volume is high. This method is
                   recommended because it prevents clipping, and usually sounds more pleasant to the
                   human ear.
        Treble control applies a user programmable gain, without any adaptive boost function.
        Treble, linear bass and 3D enhancement can all produce signals that exceed full-scale. In order to
        avoid limiting under these conditions, it is recommended to set the DAT bit to attenuate the digital
        input signal by 6dB. The gain at the outputs should be increased by 6dB to compensate for the
        attenuation. Cut-only tone adjustment (i.e. bass and treble gains ≤ 0) and adaptive bass boost cannot
        produce signals above full-scale and therefore do not require the DAT bit to be set.

          3D STEREO ENHANCEMENT
          The 3D stereo enhancement function artificially increases the separation between the left and right
          channels by amplifying the (L-R) difference signal in the frequency range where the human ear is
          sensitive to directionality. The programmable 3D depth setting controls the degree of stereo
          expansion introduced by the function. Additionally, the upper and lower limits of the frequency range
          used for 3D enhancement can be selected using the 3DFILT control bits.

VOICE DAC
          VXDAC is a 16-bit mono DAC intended for playback of Rx voice signals input via the PCM interface.
          Performance has been optimised for operating at 8ks/s or 16ks/s. The VXDAC will function at other
          sample rates up to 48ks/s, but this is not recommended.
          The analogue output of VXDAC is routed directly into the output mixers. The signal gain into each
          mixer can be adjusted at the mixer inputs using control register 18h.
          When not in use the VXDAC can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit VXDAC (register
          3Ch, bit 12).

AUXILIARY DAC
              AUXDAC is a simple 12-bit mono DAC. It can be used to generate DC signals (with the numeric input
              written into a control register), or AC signals such as telephone-quality ring tones or system beeps
              (with the input signal supplied through an AC-Link slot). In AC mode (XSLE = 1), the input data is
              binary offset coded; in DC mode (XSLE = 0), there is no offset.
              The analogue output of AUXDAC is routed directly into the output mixers. The signal gain into each
              mixer can be adjusted at the mixer inputs using control register 12h. In slot mode (XSLE = 1), the
              AUXDAC also supports variable sample rates (See “Variable Rate Audio / Sample Rate Conversion”).
              When not in use the auxiliary DAC can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit AUXDAC
              (register 3Ch, bit 11).

VARIABLE RATE AUDIO / SAMPLE RATE CONVERSION
               By using an AC’97 Rev2.2 compliant audio interface, the WM9714L can record and playback at all
               commonly used audio sample rates, and offer full split-rate support (i.e. the DAC, ADC and AUXDAC
               sample rates are completely independent of each other – any combination is possible).
               The default sample rate is 48kHz. If the VRA bit in register 2Ah is set, then other sample rates can be
               selected by writing to registers 2Ch, 32h and 2Eh. The AC-Link continues to run at 48k frames per
               second irrespective of the sample rate selected. However, if the sample rate is less than 48kHz, then
               some frames do not carry an audio sample.

               Note:
               Changing the ADC and / or DAC sample rate will only be effective if the ADCs and DACs are enabled
               and powered up before the sample rate is changed. This is done by setting the relevant bits in
               registers 26h and 3Ch, as well as the VRA bit in register 2Ah.
               The process is as follows:
               1.    Enable and power up ADCs and or DACs in registers 26h and 3Ch.
               2.    Enable VRA bit in 2Ah, bit 0.
               3.    Change the sample rate in the respective register.

AUDIO INPUTS
               The following sections give an overview of the analogue audio input pins and their function. See
               “Applications Information” for more information on recommended external components.
LINE INPUT
               The LINEL and LINER inputs are designed to record line level signals, and/or to mix into one of the
               analogue outputs.
               Both pins are directly connected to the record selector. The record PGA adjusts the recording volume,
               controlled by register 12h or by the ALC function.
               For analogue mixing, the line input signals pass through a separate PGA, controlled by register 0Ah.
               The signals can be mixed into the headphone, speaker and mono mixer paths (see “Audio Mixers”).
               Each LINE-to-mixer path has an independent mute bit. When all LINE-to-mixer paths are muted the
               line PGA is muted automatically. When the line inputs are not used, the line PGA can be switched off
               to save power (see “Power Management”).
               LINEL and LINER are biased internally to the reference voltage VREF. Whenever the inputs are
               muted or the device placed into standby mode, the inputs remain biased to VREF using special anti-
               thump circuitry to suppress any audible clicks when changing inputs.

               Table 22 Line Input Control
               Additionally, line inputs can be used as single-ended microphone inputs through the record mux to
               provide a click-less ALC function by bypassing offset introduced through the microphone pre-amps.
               Note that the line inputs to the mixers should all be deselected if this is input configuration is used.
MICROPHONE INPUT
               MICROPHONE PRE-AMPS
               There are two microphone pre-amplifiers, MPA and MPB, which can be configured in a variety of ways
               to accommodate up to 3 selectable differential microphone inputs or 2 differential microphone inputs
               operating simultaneously for stereo or noise cancellation. The microphone input circuit is shown in
               Figure 20.

        Figure 20 Microphone Input Circuit
        The input pins used for the microphones are MIC1, MICCM, MIC2A and MIC2B. Note that input pins
        MIC2A and MIC2B are multi-function inputs and must be configured for use as microphone inputs
        when required. This is achieved using MICCMPSEL[1:0] in register 22h (see Table 23). The input to
        microphone pre-amp A can be selected from any of the three microphone inputs MIC1, MIC2A and
        MIC2B using MPASEL[1:0]. Each pre-amp has independent boost control from +12dB to +30dB in
        four steps. This is controlled by MPABST[1:0] and MPBBST[1:0].
        When not in use each microphone pre-amp can be powered down using the Powerdown register bits
        MPA and MPB (register 3Eh, bits [1:0]). If disabled, the inputs are tied to Vmid (for MIC2A and MIC2B,
        this only applies if they are selected as microphone inputs – otherwise, they are left floating).

        Up to three microphones can be connected in a single-ended configuration. Any one of the three MICs
        can be selected as the input to MPA using MPASEL[1:0] (Register 22h, bits 13:12). Only the
        microphone on MIC2B can be selected to MPB. Note that MPABST always sets the gain for the
        selected MPA input microphone. If MIC2B is the selected input for MPA it is recommended that MPB
        is disabled.

   Up to two microphones can be connected in a dual differential configuration. This is suitable for stereo
   microphone or noise cancellation applications. Mic1 is connected between the MIC2A and MICCM
   inputs and mic2 is connected between the MIC2B and MICCM inputs as shown in Figure 21.
   Additionally, another microphone can be supported on MIC1 selected through the MPA input mux.
   Note that the microphones can be connected in a single-ended configuration.

   MICROPHONE BIASING CIRCUIT
   The MICBIAS output provides a low noise reference voltage suitable for biasing electret type
   microphones and the associated external resistor biasing network. Refer to “Applications Information”
   for recommended external components. The MICBIAS voltage can be altered via MBVOL in register
   22h. When MBVOL=0, MICBIAS=0.9*AVDD and when MBVOL=1, MICBIAS=0.75*AVDD.
   The microphone bias is driven to a dedicated MICBIAS pin 28 and is enabled by MPOP1EN in
   register 22h. It can also be configured to drive out on GPIO8 pin 12 enabled by MPOP2EN in register
   22h.
   When not in use the microphone bias can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit
   MICBIAS (register 3Eh, bit 14).

        MICBIAS CURRENT DETECT
        The WM9714L includes a microphone bias current detect circuit with programmable thresholds for the
        microphone bias current, above which an interrupt will be triggered. There are two separate interrupt
        bits, MICDET to e.g. distinguish between one or two microphones connected to the WM9714L, and
        MICSHT to detect a shorted microphone (mic button press). The microphone current detect threshold
        is set by MCDTHR[2:0], for MICDET, and MCDSCTHR[1:0] for MICSHT. Thresholds for each code
        are shown in Table 25
        When not in use the microphone bias current detect circuit can be powered down using the
        Powerdown register bit MCD (register 3Eh, bit 15).
        See the GPIO and Interrupt Controller sections for details on the interrupt and status readback for

   MICROPHONE PGAS
   The microphone pre-amps MPA and MPB drive into two microphone PGAs whose gain is controlled
   by register 0Eh. The PGA signals can be routed into the headphone mixers and the mono mixer, but
   not the speaker mixer (to prevent forming a feedback loop) controlled by register 10h. If the PGA
   signals are not selected as an input to any of the mixers, the outputs of the PGAs are muted
   automatically.
   When not in use the microphone PGAs can be powered down using the Powerdown register bits MA
   and MB (register 3Eh, bits [3:2]).

MONOIN INPUT
             Pin 20 (MONOIN) is a mono input designed to connect to the receive path of a telephony device. The
             pin connects directly to the record selector for phone call recording (Note: to record both sides of a
             phone call, one ADC channel should record the MONOIN signal while the other channel records the
             MIC signal). The record PGA adjusts the recording volume, and is controlled by register 12h or by the
             ALC function (see “Record Gain” and “Automatic Level Control”).

             To listen to the MONOIN signal, the signal passes through a separate PGA, controlled by register
             08h. The signal can be routed into the headphone mixer (for normal phone call operation) and/or the
             speaker mixer (for speakerphone operation), but not into the mono mixer (to prevent forming a
             feedback loop). When the signal is not selected as an input to any of the mixers the output of the PGA
             is muted automatically.
             When not in use, the MONOIN PGA can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit MOIN
             (register 3Eh, bit 4).
             MONOIN is biased internally to the reference voltage VREF. Whenever the input is muted or the
             device placed into standby mode, the input remains biased to VREF using special anti-thump circuitry
             to suppress any audible clicks when changing inputs.

PCBEEP INPUT
             Pin 19 (PCBEEP) is a mono, line level input intended for externally generated signal or warning tones.
             It is routed directly to the record selector and all three output mixers, without an input amplifier. The
             signal gain into each mixer can be independently controlled, with a separate mute bit for each signal
             path.
             PCBEEP is biased internally to the reference voltage VREF. When the signal is not selected as an
             input to any of the mixers the input remains biased to VREF using special anti-thump circuitry to
             suppress any audible clicks when changing inputs.

DIFFERENTIAL MONO INPUT
                PCBEEP and MONOIN inputs can be configured to provide a differential mono input. This is achieved
                by mixing the two inputs together using the headphone mixers or the speaker mixer. Note that the
                gain of the MONOIN PGA must match the gain of the PCBEEP mixer input to achieve a balanced
                differential mono input.

AUDIO MIXERS
MIXER OVERVIEW
               The WM9714L has four separate low-power audio mixers to cover all audio functions required by
               smartphones, PDAs and handheld computers. These mixers are used to drive the audio outputs HPL,
               HPR, MONO, SPKL, SPKR, OUT3 and OUT4. There are also two inverters used to provide differential
               output signals (e.g. for driving BTL loads)
HEADPHONE MIXERS
               There are two headphone mixers, headphone mixer left and headphone mixer right (HPMIXL and
               HPMIXR). These mixers are the stereo output driver source. They are used to drive the stereo outputs
               HPL and HPR. They can also be used to drive SPKL and SPKR outputs and, when used in
               conjunction with OUT3 and OUT4, they can be configured to drive complementary signals through the
               two output inverters to support bridge-tied load (BTL) stereo loudspeaker outputs. The following
               signals can be mixed into the headphone path:
                         MONOIN (controlled by register 08h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         LINEL/R (controlled by register 0Ah, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         the output of the Record PGA (controlled by register 14h, see “Audio ADCs”, “Record Gain”)
                         the stereo DAC signal (controlled by register 0Ch, see “Audio DACs”)
                         the MIC signal (controlled by register 10h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         PC_BEEP (controlled by register 16h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         the VXDAC signal (controlled by register 18h, see “Audio DACs”)
                         the AUXDAC signal (controlled by register 1Ah, see “Auxiliary DAC”)
               In a typical smartphone application, the headphone signal is a mix of MONOIN / VXDAC and sidetone
               (for phone calls) and the stereo DAC signal (for music playback).
               If not in use, the headphone mixers can be powered down using the Powerdown register bits HPLX
               and HPRX (register 3Ch, bits [3:2]).
SPEAKER MIXER
               The speaker mixer (SPKMIX) is a mono source. It is typically used to drive a mono loudspeaker in
               BTL configuration. The following signals can be mixed into the speaker path:
                         MONOIN (controlled by register 08h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         LINEL/R (controlled by register 0Ah, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         the stereo DAC signal (controlled by register 0Ch, see “Audio DACs”)
                         PC_BEEP (controlled by register 16h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                         the VXDAC signal (controlled by register 18h, see “Audio DACs”)
                         the AUXDAC signal (controlled by register 1Ah, see “Auxiliary DAC”)
               In a typical smartphone application, the speaker signal is a mix of AUXDAC (for system alerts or ring
               tone playback), MONOIN / VXDAC (for speakerphone function), and PC_BEEP (for externally
               generated ring tones).
               Note that when selected the stereo input pairs LINEL/R and DACL/R are summed and attenuated by -
               6dB so that 0dBFS signals on each channel sum to give a 0dBFS mono signal.
               If not in use, the speaker mixer can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit SPKX
               (register 3Ch, bit 1).

MONO MIXER
                The mono mixer drives the MONO pin. The following signals can be mixed into MONO:
                           LINEL/R (controlled by register 0Ah, see “Audio Inputs”)
                           the output of the Record PGA (controlled by register 14h, see “Audio ADCs”, “Record Gain”)
                           the stereo DAC signal (controlled by register 0Ch, see “Audio DACs”)
                           the MIC signal (controlled by register 10h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                           PC_BEEP (controlled by register 16h, see “Audio Inputs”)
                           the VXDAC signal (controlled by register 18h, see “Audio DACs”)
                           the AUXDAC signal (controlled by register 12h, see “Auxiliary DAC”)
                In a typical smartphone application, the MONO signal is a mix of the amplified microphone signal
                (possibly with Automatic Gain Control) and (if enabled) an audio playback signal from the stereo DAC
                or the auxiliary DAC.
                Note that when selected the stereo input pairs LINEL/R and DACL/R are summed and attenuated by -
                6dB so that 0dBFS signals on each channel sum to give a 0dBFS mono signal.
                If not in use, the mono mixer can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit MX (register
                3Ch, bit 0).
MIXER OUTPUT INVERTERS
                There are two general purpose mixer output inverters, INV1 and INV2. Each inverter can be selected
                to drive HPMIXL, HPMIXR, SPKMIX, MONOMIX or { ( HPMIXL + HPMIXR ) / 2 }. The outputs of the
                inverters can be used to generate complimentary signals (to drive BTL configured loads) and to
                provide greater flexibility in output driver configurations. INV1 can be selected as the source for SPKL,
                MONO and OUT3 and INV2 as the source for SPKR and OUT4.
                The input source for each inverter is selected using INV1[2:0] and INV2[2:0] in register 1Eh (see Table
                31). If no input is selected, the inverter is powered down.

ANALOGUE AUDIO OUTPUTS
              The following sections give an overview of the analogue audio output pins. The WM9714L has three
              outputs capable of driving loads down to 16 (headphone / line drivers) – HPL, HPR and MONO - and
              four outputs capable of driving loads down to 8 (loudspeaker / line drivers) – SPKL, SPKR, OUT3
              and OUT4. The combination of output drivers, mixers and mixer inverters means that many output
              configurations can be supported.
              For examples of typical output and mixer configurations, see “Typical Output Configurations”. For
              more information on recommended external components, see “Applications Information”.
              Each output is driven by a PGA with a gain range of 0dB to -46.5dB in -1.5dB steps. Each PGA has
              an input source mux, mute and zero-cross detect circuit (delaying gain changes until a zero-cross is
              detected, or after time-out).
HEADPHONE OUTPUTS – HPL AND HPR
              The HPL and HPR outputs (pins 39 and 41) are designed to drive a 16 or 32 headphone load.
              They can also be used as line outputs. They can be used in and AC coupled or DC coupled (capless)
              configuration. The available input sources are HPMIXL/R and Vmid (see Table 32).

              Table 32 HPL / HPR PGA Input Source
              The signal volume on HPL and HPR can be independently adjusted under software control by writing
              to register 04h.
              When not in use HPL and HPR can be powered down using the Powerdown register bits HPL and
              HPR (register 3Eh, bits [10:9]). To minimise pops and clicks when the PGA is powered down / up it is
              recommended that the Vmid input is selected during the power down / up cycle. This ensures the
              same DC level is maintained on the output pin throughout.

            The signal volume on MONO can be independently adjusted under software control by writing to
            register 08h.
            When not in use MONO can be powered down using the Powerdown register bit MONO (register 3Eh,
            bit 13). To minimise pops and clicks when the PGA is powered down / up it is recommended that the
            Vmid input is selected during the power down / up cycle. This ensures the same DC level is
            maintained on the output pin throughout.

AUXILIARY OUTPUTS – OUT3 AND OUT4
                The OUT3 and OUT4 outputs (pins 37 and 33) are designed to drive a loudspeaker load down to 8
                and can also be used as line outputs and headphone outputs. They are designed to drive an 8 load
                AC coupled or in a BTL (cap-less) configuration and can be used as a mid-rail buffer to drive the
                headphone outputs in a cap-less DC configuration. The available input sources are INV1/2 and Vmid
                (see Table 38).

   The signal volume on OUT3 and OUT4 can be independently adjusted under software control by
   writing to register 06h.
   When not in use OUT3 and OUT4 can be powered down using the Powerdown register bits OUT3
   and OUT4 (register 3Eh, bits [11:12]). To minimise pops and clicks when the PGA is powered down /
   up it is recommended that the Vmid input is selected during the power down / up cycle. This ensures
   the same DC level is maintained on the output pin throughout.

THERMAL SENSOR
                The speaker and headphone outputs can drive very large currents. To protect the WM9714L from
                becoming too hot, a thermal sensor has been built in. If the chip temperature reaches approximately
                150C, and the TSHUT bit is cleared, and the GP11 bit is set, the WM9714L de-asserts TI, a virtual
                GPIO that can be set up to generate an interrupt to the CPU (see “GPIO and Interrupt Control”).

JACK INSERTION AND AUTO-SWITCHING
                In a phone application, a BTL ear speaker may be connected across MONO and HPL, a stereo
                headphone on HPL and HPR and stereo speakers on SPKL, SPKR, OUT3 and OUT4 (see Figure 23).
                Typically, only one of these three output devices is used at any given time: when no headphone is
                plugged in, the BTL ear speaker or stereo speakers are active, otherwise the headphone is used.

                Figure 23 Typical Output Configuration
                The presence of a headphone can be detected using one of GPIO1/6/7/8 (pins 44, 3, 11 & 12) and an
                external pull-up resistor (see Figure 35, page 114 for a circuit diagram). When the jack is inserted, the
                GPIO is pulled low by a switch on the socket. When the jack is removed the GPIO is pulled high by a
                resistor. If the JIEN bit is set, the WM9714L automatically switches between headphone and any other
                output configuration, typically ear speaker or stereo speaker that has been set up in the Powerdown
                and Output PGA Mux Select registers.

   Note: Please refer to Application Note WAN 0182 for further information on jack detect configuration.
   In addition to the typical configuration explained above, the WM9714L can also support automatic
   switching between the following three configurations set as BTL ear speaker and headphone.

   Table 41 Ear Speaker Configuration
   For example, if OUT4 and HPL is selected as the BTL ear speaker, the user should select
   EARSPKSEL = 3h, then OUT4 is tri-stated on jack insert to prevent sound across the ear speaker
   during headphone operation and HPL volume is set to OUT4 volume on jack out to ensure correct ear
   speaker operation. It should be noted that all other outputs except HPL, HPR and selected ear
   speaker driver are disabled and internally connected to VREF on jack insert. This maintains VREF at
   those outputs and helps prevent pops when the outputs are enabled.
   Finally if the user wishes to DC couple the headphone outputs the user needs to select between
   OUT3 and OUT4 as the mid-rail output buffer driver. The selected mid-rail output buffer is enabled on
   jack insert. On jack out it defaults to whatever configuration has been set up in the Powerdown and
   Output PGA Mux Select registers.

   In summary:
   JIEN not set: Outputs work as normal as selected in the Powerdown and Output PGA Mux Select
   registers.
   JIEN set: On jack insertion, GPIO1/6/7/8 is pulled low, HPL and HPR are enabled, DCDRVSEL
   decides if the headphones are DC or AC coupled and configures OUT3 or OUT4 to suit, EARSPKSEL
   decides if MONO, OUT3 or OUT4 need to be tri-stated to ensure no sound out on the ear-speaker and
   finally all other outputs are disabled as explained above to prevent pops on re-enabling.
   On jack removal, GPIO1/6/7/8 is pulled high, the outputs work as normal as selected in the
   Powerdown and Output PGA Mux Select registers except that HPL Volume is controlled by
   EARSPKSEL to ensure correct ear speaker operation.

                                                                                              WM9714L
DIGITAL AUDIO (S/PDIF) OUTPUT
                The WM9714L supports the S/PDIF standard. Pins 48 & 12 can be used to output the S/PDIF data.
                Note that pins 48 & 12 can also be used as GPIO pins. The GE5 & GE8 bits (register 56h, bit 5 & bit
                8) select between GPIO and S/PDIF functionality for pins 48 & 12 respectively (see “GPIO and
                Interrupt Control”).
                Register 3Ah is a read/write register that controls S/PDIF functionality and manages bit fields
                propagated as channel status (or sub-frame in the V case). With the exception of V, this register
                should only be written to when the S/PDIF transmitter is disabled (S/PDIF bit in register 2Ah is ‘0’).
                Once the desired values have been written to this register, the contents should be read back to
                ensure that the sample rate in particular is supported, then S/PDIF validity bit SPCV in register 2Ah
                should be read to ensure the desired configuration is valid. Only then should the S/PDIF enable bit in
                register 2Ah be set. This ensures that control and status information start up correctly at the beginning
                of S/PDIF transmission.

AUXILIARY ADC
                The WM9714L includes a very low power, 12-bit successive approximation type ADC which can be
                used for battery and auxiliary measurements. Three pins that can be used as auxiliary ADC inputs:
                          MIC2A / COMP1 / AUX1 (pin 29)
                          MIC2B / COMP2 / AUX2 (pin 30)
                          AUX4 (pin 12)
                Pins 29 and 30 are also used as comparator inputs (see “Battery Alarm and Analogue Comparators”),
                but auxiliary measurements can still be taken on these pins at any time.
                Additionally, the speaker supply (SPKVDD) can be used as an auxiliary ADC input through an on-chip
                potential divider giving an input to the auxiliary ADC of SPKVDD/3. This input is referred to as the
                AUX3 input.

        To save power, the AUXADC can be independently disabled when not used.
        The AUXADC is powered-down using PADCPD, register 3Ch bit 15.

        INITIATION OF MEASUREMENTS
        The WM9714L AUXADC interface supports both polling routines and DMA (direct memory access) to
        control the flow of data from the AUX ADC to the host CPU.
        In a polling routine, the CPU starts each measurement individually by writing to the POLL bit (register
        74h, bit 9). This bit automatically resets itself when the measurement is completed.

        Table 47 AUX ADC Control (Initiation of Measurements)
        In continuous mode (CTC = 1), the WM9714L autonomously initiates measurements (or sets of
        measurements) at the rate set by CR, and supplies the measured data to the CPU on one of the
        unused AC’97 time slots. DMA-enabled CPUs can write the data directly into a FIFO without any
        intervention by the CPU core. This reduces CPU loading and speeds up the execution of user
        programs in handheld systems.
        Note that the measurement frequency in continuous mode is also affected by the DEL bits (see
        “Register Bits by Address”, Register 76h). The faster rates achieved when DEL = 1111 may be useful
        when the ADC is used for multiple measurements.

   MEASUREMENT TYPES
   The ADCSEL control bits determine which type of measurement is performed (see below).

      Note: Only one bit in 74h[7:4] should be set at any one time
   Table 48 AUX ADC Control (Measurement Types)
   The WM9714L performs a single measurement – either in polling mode or continuously, as indicated
   by the CTC bit. The type of measurement is specified by the ADCSEL[7:4] bits. Only one of the
   ADCSEL[7:4] bits should be set.
   CONVERSION RATE
   The AUXADC conversion rate is specified by the CR bits (reg 76h).
   CR may be set to 93.75Hz (every 512 AC-Link Frames), 120Hz (every 400 AC-Link Frames),
   153.75Hz (every 312 AC-Link frames) or 187.5Hz (every 256 AC-Link frames).
   If only one ADRSEL[7:1] bit is set, each individual conversion occurs at the rate specified by CR.
   If multiple ADRSEL[7:1] bits are set, the complete set of conversions requested is completed at the
   rate specified by CR.
   DATA READBACK
   AUXADC measured data is stored in register 7Ah, and can be retrieved by reading the register in the
   usual manner (see “AC97 Interface”). Additionally, the data can also be passed to the controller on
   one of the AC-Link time slots not used for audio functions.
   The output data word of the AUX ADC interface consists of three parts:
              1 Unused bit (Ignore).
              Output data from the AUX ADC (12 bits)
              ADCSRC: 3 additional bits that indicate the source of the ADC data.

        If the data is being read back using the polling method, there are several ways to determine when a
        measurement has finished:
                  Reading back the POLL bit. If it has been reset to ‘0’, then the measurement has finished.
                  Monitoring the ADA signal (see “GPIO and Interrupt Control”). ADA goes high after every
                   single conversion.
                  Reading back 7Ah until the new data appears

        Table 49 AUX ADC Data
        To avoid losing data that has not yet been read, the WM9714L can delay overwriting register 7Ah with
        new conversions until the old data has been read. This function is enabled using the WAIT bit. If the
        SLEN bit is set to ‘1’, then the ADC data appears on the AC-Link slot selected by the SLT control bits,
        as shown below. The Slot 0 ‘tag’ bit corresponding to the selected time slot is asserted whenever
        there is new data on that slot.

   MASK INPUT CONTROL
   Sources of glitch noise, such as the signals driving an LCD display, may feed through to the AUX
   ADC inputs and affect measurement accuracy. In order to minimise this effect, a signal may be
   applied to MASK (pin 47 / pin 3) to delay or synchronise the sampling of any input to the ADC. The
   effect of the MASK signal depends on the MSK bits of register 78h, as described in Table 51.

                       by an amount set in the DEL[3-0] register. Conversions are asynchronous to the
                       MASK signal.
            11         Synchronous mode; conversions wait until rising or falling edge on MASK initiates
                       cycle; screen starts to be driven when the edge arrives, the conversion sample
                       being taken a period set by DEL[3-0] after the edge.
   Table 52 Controlling the MASK Feature
   Note that pin 47 / pin 3 can also be used as a GPIO (see “GPIO and Interrupt Control”), or to output
   the ADA signal (see below).
   ADA (ADC DATA AVAILABLE) SIGNAL
   Whenever data becomes available from the AUXADC, the internal ADA (ADC Data Available) signal
   goes high and remains high until the data has been read from register 7Ah (if SLEN = 0) or until it has
   been sent out on an AC-Link slot (if SLEN = 1).
   ADA goes high after every AUXADC conversion (in normal mode, COO=0)
   ADA can be used to generate an interrupt, if the AW bit (register 52h, bit 12) is set (see “GPIO and
   Interrupt Control”).
   It is also possible to output the ADA signal on pin 47 / pin 3, if this pin is not used as a GPIO. The
   GE4/6 bit must be set to ‘0’ to achieve this (see “GPIO and Interrupt Control”).
   Alternatively, ADA can be read from bit 12 in register 54h.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES
BATTERY ALARM AND ANALOGUE COMPARATORS
               The battery alarm function differs from battery measurement in that it does not actually measure the
               battery voltage. Battery alarm only indicates “OK”, “Low” or “Dead”. The advantage of the battery
               alarm function is that it does not require a clock and can therefore be used in low-power sleep or
               standby modes.

               Figure 25 Battery Alarm Example Schematic
               The typical schematic for a dual threshold battery alarm is shown above. This alarm has two
               thresholds, “dead battery” (COMP1) and “low battery” (COMP2). R1, R2 and R3 set the threshold
               voltages. Their values can be up to about 1M in order to keep the battery current [IALARM = VBATT /
               (R1+R2+R3)] to a minimum (higher resistor values may affect the accuracy of the system as leakage
               currents into the input pins become significant).
               Dead battery alarm: COMP1 triggers when VBATT < VREF  (R1+R2+R3) / (R2+R3)
               A dead battery alarm is the highest priority of interrupt in the system. It should immediately save all
               unsaved data and shut down the system. The GP15, GS15 and GW15 bits must be set to generate
               this interrupt.
               Low battery alarm: COMP2 triggers when VBATT < VREF  (R1+R2+R3) / R3
               A low battery alarm has a lower priority than a dead battery alarm. Since the threshold voltage is
               higher than for a dead battery alarm, there is enough power left in the battery to give the user a
               warning and/or shut down “gracefully”. When VBATT gets close to the low battery threshold, spurious
               alarms are filtered out by the COMP2 delay function.
               The purpose of the capacitor C is to remove from the comparator inputs any high frequency noise or
               glitches that may be present on the battery (for example, noise generated by a charge pump). It forms
               a low pass filter with R1, R2 and R3.
                           Low pass cutoff fc [Hz] = 1/ (2 C  (R1 || (R2+R3)))
               Provided that the cutoff frequency is several orders of magnitude lower than the noise frequency fn,
               this simple circuit can achieve excellent noise rejection.
                           Noise rejection [dB] = 20 log (fn / fc)

   The circuit shown above also allows for measuring the battery voltage VBATT. This is achieved simply
   by setting the AUXADC input to be either COMP1 (ADCSEL = 100) or COMP2 (ADCSEL = 101) (see
   also Auxiliary ADC Inputs).
   The WM9714L has two on-chip comparators that can be used to implement a battery alarm function,
   or other functions such as a window comparator. Each comparator has one of its inputs tied to
   COMP1 (pin 29) or COMP2 (pin 30), and the other tied to a voltage reference. The voltage reference
   can be either internally generated (VREF = AVDD/2) or externally connected on AUX4 (pin 12).
   The comparator output signals are passed to the GPIO logic block (see “GPIO and Interrupt Control”
   section), where they can be used to send an interrupt to the CPU via the AC-Link or via the IRQ pin,
   and / or to wake up the WM9714L from sleep mode. COMP1/AUX1 (pin 29) corresponds to GPIO bit
   15 and COMP2/AUX2 (pin30) to bit 14.

        COMP2 DELAY FUNCTION
        COMP2 has an optional delay function for use when the input signal is noisy. When COMP2 triggers
        and the delay is enabled (i.e. COMP2DEL is non-zero), then GPIO bit 14 does not change state
        immediately, and no interrupt is generated. Instead, the WM9714L starts a delay timer and checks
        COMP2 again after the delay time has passed. If COMP2 is still active, then the GPIO bit is set and
        an interrupt may be generated (depending on the state of the GW14 bit). If COMP2 is no longer
        active, the GPIO bit is not set, i.e. all register bits are as if COMP2 had never triggered.

GPIO AND INTERRUPT CONTROL
                The WM9714L has eight GPIO pins that operate as defined in the AC’97 Revision 2.2 specification.
                Each GPIO pin can be set up as an input or as an output, and has corresponding bits in register 54h
                and in slot 12. The state of a GPIO output is determined by sending data through slot 12 of outgoing
                frames (SDATAOUT). Data can be returned from a GPIO input by reading the register bit, or
                examining slot 12 of incoming frames (SDATAIN). GPIO inputs can be made sticky, and can be
                programmed to generate an interrupt, transmitted either through the AC-Link or through a dedicated,
                level-mode interrupt pin (GPIO2/IRQ, pin 45).
                In addition, the GPIO pins 1, 3, 4 and 5 can be used for the PCM interface by setting bit 15 of register
                36h (see “PCM Audio Data Formats” section). Setting this bit disables any GPIO functions selected on
                these pins.

                Table 55 GPIO Additional Function Control
                GPIO pins 2 to 8 are multi-purpose pins that can also be used for other (non-GPIO / -PCM) purposes,
                e.g. as a S/PDIF output. This is controlled by register 56h (see Table 58).
                Note that GPIO6/7/8 each have an additional function independent of the GPIO / auxiliary functions
                discussed above. If these pins are to be used as GPIO then the independent function needs to be
                disabled using its own control registers, e.g. to use pin 11 as a GPIO then the RESETB function
                needs to be disabled (RSTDIS, register 5Ah, bit 8).
                Independently of the GPIO pins, the WM9714L also has seven virtual GPIOs. These are signals from
                inside the WM9714L, which are treated as if they were GPIO input signals. From a software
                perspective, virtual GPIOs are the same as GPIO pins, but they cannot be set up as outputs, and are
                not tied to an actual pin. This allows for simple, uniform processing of different types of signals that
                may generate interrupts (e.g. battery warnings, jack insertion, high-temperature warning, or GPIO
                signals).

   Note 1: Excludes GP11. For Thermal Sensor Polarity Control (GP11) see Table 40 on page 59.
   The following procedure is recommended for handling interrupts:
   When the controller receives an interrupt, check register 54h. For each GPIO bit in descending order
   of priority, check if the bit is ‘1’. If yes, execute corresponding interrupt routine, then write ‘0’ to
   corresponding bit in 54h. If no, continue to next lower priority GPIO. After all GPIOs have been
   checked, check if interrupt still present or no. If yes, repeat procedure. If no, then jump back to
   process that ran before the interrupt.
   If the system CPU cannot execute such an interrupt routine, it may be preferable to switch internal
   signals directly onto the GPIO pins. However, in this case the interrupt signals cannot be made sticky,
   and more GPIO pins are tied up both on the WM9714L and on the CPU.

POWER MANAGEMENT
INTRODUCTION
               The WM9714L includes the standard power down control register defined by the AC’97 specification
               (register 26h). Additionally, it also allows more specific control over the individual blocks of the device
               through register Powerdown registers 3Ch and 3Eh. Each particular circuit block is active when both
               the relevant bit in register 26h AND the relevant bit in the Powerdown registers 3Ch and 3Eh are set
               to ‘0’.
               Note that the default power-up condition is all OFF.

                Mixer output inverters: see “Mixer Output Inverters” section. Inverters are disabled by default.
                SLEEP MODE
                Whenever the PR4 bit (reg. 26h) is set, the AC-Link interface is disabled, and the WM9714L is in
                sleep mode. There is in fact a very large number of different sleep modes, depending on the other
                control bits. For example, the low-power standby mode described below is a sleep mode. It is
                desirable to use sleep modes whenever possible, as this will save power. The following functions do
                not require a clock and can therefore operate in sleep mode:
                           Analogue-to-analogue audio (DACs and ADCs unused), e.g. phone call mode
                           GPIO and interrupts
                           Battery alarm / analogue comparators
                The WM9714L can awake from sleep mode as a result of
                           A warm reset on the AC-Link (according to the AC’97 specification)
                           A signal on a GPIO pin (if the pin is configured as an input, with wake-up enabled – see
                            “GPIO and Interrupt Control” section)
                           A virtual GPIO event such as battery alarm, etc. (see “GPIO and Interrupt Control” section)
                LOW-POWER STANDBY MODE
                If all the bits in registers 26h, 3Ch and 3Eh are set except VMID1M (register 3Ch, bit 14), then the
                WM9714L is in low-power standby mode and consumes very little current. A 1M resistor string
                remains connected across AVDD to generate VREF. This is necessary if the on-chip analogue
                comparators are used (see “Battery Alarm and Analogue Comparators” section), and helps shorten
                the delay between wake-up and playback readiness. If VREF is not required, the 1M resistor string
                can be disabled by setting the VMID1M bit, reducing current consumption further.
                SAVING POWER AT LOW SUPPLY VOLTAGES
                The analogue supplies to the WM9714L can run from 1.8V to 3.6V. By default, all analogue circuitry
                on the IC is optimized to run at 3.3V. This set-up is also good for all other supply voltages down to
                1.8V. However, at lower voltages, it is possible to save power by reducing the internal bias currents
                used in the analogue circuitry. This is controlled as shown below.

POWER-ON RESET (POR)
                The WM9714L has an internal power on reset (PORB) which ensures that a reset is applied to all
                registers until a supply threshold has been exceeded. The POR circuitry monitors the voltage for both
                AVDD and DCVDD and will release the internal reset signal once these supplies are both nominally
                greater than 1.36V. The internal reset signal is an AND of the PORB and RESETB input signal.
                It is recommended that for operation of the WM9714L, all device power rails should be stable before
                configuring the device for operation.

               The headphone outputs, HPL and HPR, can be used as stereo line outputs. The speaker outputs,
               SPKL and SPKR, can also be used as line outputs. Recommended external components are shown
               below.

               The DC blocking capacitors and the load resistance together determine the lower cut-off frequency, fc.
               Assuming a 10 k load and C1, C2 = 10F:
                          fc = 1 / 2 (RL+R1) C1 = 1 / (2 x 10.1k x 1F) = 16 Hz
               Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the bass response. Smaller values of C1 and C2 will
               diminish the bass response. The function of R1 and R2 is to protect the line outputs from damage
               when used improperly.
AC-COUPLED HEADPHONE OUTPUT
               The circuit diagram below shows how to connect a stereo headphone to the WM9714L.

               The DC blocking capacitors C1 and C2 together with the load resistance determine the lower cut-off
               frequency, fc. Increasing the capacitance lowers fc, improving the bass response. Smaller
               capacitance values will diminish the bass response. For example, with a 16 load and C1 = 220F:
                          fc = 1 / 2 RLC1 = 1 / (2 x 16 x 220F) = 45 Hz

DC-COUPLED (CAPLESS) HEADPHONE OUTPUT
                In the interest of saving board space and cost, it may be desirable to eliminate the 220F DC blocking
                capacitors. This can be achieved by using OUT3 as a headphone pseudo-ground, as shown below.
                                       HPL
                     WM9714L

                                       OUT3 = AVDD/2
                Figure 31 Capless Headphone Output Circuit Diagram
                As the OUT3 pin produces a DC voltage of AVDD/2, there is no DC offset between HPL/HPR and
                OUT3, and therefore no DC blocking capacitors are required. However, this configuration has some
                drawbacks:
                          The power consumption of the WM9714L is increased, due to the additional power
                           consumed in the OUT3 output buffer.
                          If the DC coupled output is connected to the line-in of a grounded piece of equipment, then
                           OUT3 becomes short-circuited. Although the built-in short circuit protection will prevent any
                           damage to the WM9714L, the audio signal will not be transmitted properly.
                          OUT3 cannot be used for another purpose
BTL LOUDSPEAKER OUTPUT
                SPKL and SPKR can differentially drive a mono 8 loudspeaker as shown below.

COMBINED HEADSET / BTL EAR SPEAKER
               In smartphone applications with a loudspeaker and separate ear speaker (receiver), a BTL ear
               speaker can be connected at the OUT3 pin, as shown below.

               The ear speaker and the headset play the same signal. Whenever the headset is plugged in, the
               headphone outputs are enabled and OUT3 disabled. When the headset is not plugged in, OUT3 is
               enabled (see “Jack Insertion and Auto-Switching”).
COMBINED HEADSET / SINGLE-ENDED EAR SPEAKER
               Instead of a BTL ear speaker, a single-ended ear speaker can also be used, as shown below.

JACK INSERT DETECTION
                The circuit diagram below shows how to detect when a headphone or headset has been plugged into
                the headphone socket. It generates an interrupt, instructing the controller to enable HPL and HPR and
                disable OUT3.

                Figure 35 Jack Insert Detection Circuit
                The circuit requires a headphone socket with a switch that closes on insertion (for using sockets with
                a switch that opens on insertion, please refer to Application Note WAN0182). It detects both
                headphones and phone headsets. Any GPIO pin can be used, provided that it is configured as an
                input.
HOOKSWITCH DETECTION
                Alternatively a headphone socket with a switch that opens on insertion can be used. For this mode of
                operation the GPIO input must be inverted.
                The circuit diagram below shows how to detect when the “hookswitch” of a phone headset is pressed
                (pressing the hookswitch is equivalent to lifting the receiver in a stationary telephone).

                The circuit uses a GPIO pin as a sense input. The impedance of the microphone and the resistor in
                the MICBIAS path must be such that the potential at the GPIO pin is above 0.7DBVDD when the
                hookswitch is open, and below 0.3DBVDD when it is closed.

TYPICAL OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS
                The WM9714L has three outputs capable of driving loads down to 16 (headphone / line drivers) –
                HPL, HPR and MONO - and four outputs capable of driving loads down to 8 (loudspeaker / line
                drivers) – SPKL, SPKR, OUT3 and OUT4. The combination of output drivers, mixers and mixer
                inverters means that many output configurations can be supported. Below are some examples of
                typical output configurations for smartphone applications.

                given operating scenario. (Note the inverted mixer outputs can be achieved using the mixer output
                inverters INV1 and INV2).
