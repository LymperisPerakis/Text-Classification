Product Description
   The PACUSB−D1/D2 is a single−channel USB downstream−port
termination network. It integrates EMI/RFI filter components R1 and                                  http://onsemi.com

PACUSB−D1/D2 provides a very high level of protection for sensitive
electronic components that may be subjected to electrostatic discharge
(ESD). The device pins will safely dissipate ESD strikes of 15 kV,                           SOT23−5                    SC70−5

international standard. Using the MIL−STD−883D (Method 3015)
specification for Human Body Model (HBM) ESD, all pins are                                      ELECTRICAL SCHEMATIC
protected from contact discharges to 20 kV.                                                                    R1
   There are three options for the value of the series resistor R1: 15 W,              1                                                5

                                                                                                             C1    R2
resistance, must be close to the USB cable’s characteristic impedance
of 45 W (each side) to minimize transmission line reflections.                         2
   The PACUSB−D1/D2 is manufactured in a 5−pin SC70 or a 5−pin                         GND

1. Electrical operating characteristics guaranteed over standard operating conditions unless specified otherwise.
2. ESD voltage applied to pins with respect to GND, one at a time; unused pins are left open.
3. Pins 1 and 3 are not connected to the USB port connector, and therefore are not exposed to external ESD hazards. Thus, they do not require
   the high ESD protection levels provided for pins 4 and 5.
4. ESD Clamping Voltage is measured at the opposite end of R1 from the pin to which the ESD discharge is applied (e.g., if ESD is applied
   to pin 6, then the clamping voltage is measured at pin 1).

  The PACUSB−D1/D2 provides a complete interface for a single downstream USB port typically found in computers and
USB hubs. It integrates the series resistors (R1) and the 15 kW pull−down resistors (R2) for both USB data lines (D+ and D−)
as well as the capacitors to ground for EMI suppression. Zener diodes provide ESD protection up to 15 kV contact discharge
per the IEC 61000−4−2 standard and protect the USB controller on both data lines.
  The PACUSB−D1/D2 should be placed on the PCB between the USB controller and the USB connector, as shown on the
Connection Diagram, Figure 4.

  To guarantee the best ESD and filtering performance, it is recommended to physically locate the PACUSB−D1/D2 close to
the USB connector. Also, the trace lengths between the PACUSB−D1/D2 and the USB controller should be kept as short as
possible.
