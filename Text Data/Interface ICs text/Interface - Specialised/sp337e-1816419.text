GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The SP337E is a dual mode serial transceiver                 FEATURES
containing both RS-232 and RS-485/422 line drivers            3.3V to 5V Single Supply Operation
and receivers. The RS-232 mode provides three
drivers and five receivers to support all eight signals       Robust ±15kV ESD Protection
commonly used in the DB9 serial port connector                   ■  Human Body Model
(3TX/5RX). In RS-485 mode the device features two
independent high speed RS-485/422 transmit and                Max Data Rate of 15Mbps in RS-485 mode
receive channels (2TX/2RX). The default RS-485                 and up to 1Mbps in RS-232 mode (SP337EU)
configuration is full-duplex, but half-duplex operation       3 Drivers, 5 Receivers RS-232/V.28
can be obtained by tying together the TX and RI pins,
and the TXEN and RXEN signals.                                2 Drivers, 2 Receivers RS-485/RS-422
                                                                 ■  Full-Duplex Configuration
The SP337E is pin compatible to MaxLinear’s SP334.
                                                                 ■  1/8th Unit Load, up to 256 receivers on bus
The SP337EB features a maximum data rate of
250kbps in RS-232 mode and a maximum data rate                RS-485 Advanced Failsafe on Open, Short or
of 15Mbps in RS-485. However, the SP337EU                      Terminated Lines
features a maximum data rate of 1Mbps in RS-232               Full Differential Driver Tri-State (Hi-Z) Control
mode and a maximum data rate of 15Mbps in RS-485
mode.                                                         Receiver Output Tri-State Control
The MaxLinear-patented high efficiency charge                 WSOIC-28 or TSSOP-28 Package
pumps (5,306,954) deliver true RS-232 driver output
voltages from a single power supply from 3.3V to 5V.
Charge pump outputs are self-monitored to minimize           TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
power consumption. The SP337E requires only four              Dual Protocol Serial Ports (RS-232 or RS-485)
0.1F capacitors for complete functionality.
                                                              Industrial Computers
All RS-485 receivers or transceivers feature high
impedance inputs which allow up to 256 transceivers           Industrial and Process Control Equipment
on a single shared bus. When configured in RS-485             Point-Of-Sales Equipment
mode, each driver may be individually enabled or put
into tri-state, simplifying use on shared buses or for        Networking Equipment
bidirectional communication. The RS-485/422 drivers           HVAC Controls Equipment
can be disabled (high-Z output) by the TXEN enable
pin. The RS-232 receiver outputs can be disabled by           Building Security Equipment
the RXEN enable pin.
All receivers have advanced failsafe protection to
prevent oscillation when inputs are un-connected. In
RS-232 mode, each receiver input has a 5k pull-
down to ground. in RS-485 mode, receivers will
default to output logic 1 if inputs are floating, shorted,
or open but terminated.
All driver outputs and receiver inputs are protected
against ESD strikes up to ±15,000 volts.
