The SP508E is a monolithic device that supports eight (8) popular serial interface standards
for Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity. The SP508E is fabricated using a low power
BiCMOS process technology, and incorporates an Exar regulated charge pump allowing +5V
only operation. Exar's patented charge pump provides a regulated output of +5.8V, which
will provide enough voltage for compliant operation in all modes. Eight (8) drivers and eight
(8) receivers can be configured via software for any of the above interface modes at any
time. The SP508E requires no additional external components for compliant operation for
all of the eight (8) modes of operation other than four capacitors used for the internal charge
pump. All necessary termination is integrated within the SP508E and is switchable when
V.35 drivers and V.35 receivers, or when V.11 receivers are used. The SP508E provides the
controls and transceiver availability for operating as either a DTE or DCE.
Additional features with the SP508E include internal loopback that can be initiated in any
of the operating modes by use of the LOOPBACK pin. While in loopback mode, receiver
outputs are internally connected to driver inputs creating an internal signal path bypassing
the serial communications controller for diagnostic testing. The SP508E also includes a latch
enable pin with the driver and receiver address decoder. The internal V.11 or V.35 receiver
termination can be switched off using a control pin (TERM_OFF) for monitoring applications.
All eight (8) drivers and receivers in the SP508E include separate enable pins for added
convenience. The SP508E is ideal for WAN serial ports in networking equipment such as
routers, access concentrators, network muxes, DSU/CSU's, networking test equipment, and
other access devices.

LOOPBACK FUNCTION
The SP508E contains a LOOPBACK pin that
invokes a loopback path. This loopback path
is illustrated in Figure 46. LOOPBACK has
an internal pull-up resistor that defaults to
normal mode during power up or if the pin is
left floating. During loopback, the driver out-
put and receiver input characteristics will still
adhere to its appropriate specifications.
DECODER AND D_LATCH FUNCTION
The SP508E contains a D_LATCH pin
that latches the data into the D0, D1,
and D2 decoder inputs. If tied to a
logic LOW (“0”), the latch is transpar-
ent, allowing the data at the decoder
inputs to propagate through and program
the SP508E accordingly. If tied to a logic
HIGH(“1”), the latch locks out the data and
prevents the mode from changing until this
pin is brought to a logic LOW.
