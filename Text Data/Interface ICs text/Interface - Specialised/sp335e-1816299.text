GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                          FEATURES
The SP335 is an advanced multiprotocol transceiver                            Pin-Selectable Cable Termination
supporting RS-232, RS-485, and RS-422 serial                                  No External Resistors Required for RS-485/422
standards. Integrated cable termination and multiple                           Termination or Biasing
configuration modes allow all three protocols to be
used interchangeably over a single cable or                                   Robust ESD Protection:
connector with no additional switching components.                               ■  ±15kV IEC 61000-4-2 Air Gap Discharge
Full operation requires only four external charge                                ■  ± 8kV IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge
pump capacitors.
                                                                                 ■  ±15kV Human Body Model (HBM)
The RS-485/RS-232 mode pin selects RS-485 mode
when high, and RS-232 mode when low. In RS-485                                20Mbps RS-485 and 1Mbps RS-232 Data Rates
mode, the TERM pin enables the differential 120                              Pin-Selectable 250kbps Slew Limiting
termination, and the HALF/FULL pin configures the
transceiver as either half or full duplex.                                    Single Supply Operation from 3V to 5.5V
The high speed drivers operate up to 20Mbps in RS-                            1.65V to 5.5V Logic Interface VL pin
485/422 modes, and up to 1Mbps in RS-232 mode.                                2 Drivers, 2 Receivers RS-232/V.28
All drivers can be slew limited to 250kbps in any
mode to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI)                           1 Driver, 1 Receiver RS-485/422
by setting the dedicated SLEW pin low.                                           ■  Full or Half Duplex Configuration
All transmitter outputs and receiver inputs feature                              ■  1/8th Unit Load, up to 256 receivers on bus
robust electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection to                           RS-485/422 Enhanced Receiver Fail-safe for open,
±15kV IEC 61000-4-2 Airgap, ±15kV Human Body                                   shorted, or terminated but idle inputs
Model (HBM) and ±8kV IEC 61000-4-2 Contact. Each
receiver output has full fail-safe protection to avoid                        10nA Shutdown Supply Current (typical)

defaulting to logic-high output level when the inputs
are open, shorted, or terminated but undriven. No
external biasing resistors are required.                                     TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
The RS-232 receiver inputs include a 5k pull-down                            Software Programmable Serial Ports
to ground when in RS-232 mode. The RS-485/422                                  (RS-232, RS-422, RS-485)
receiver inputs are high impedance (>96k when
                                                                              Industrial and Single Board Computers

on a single communication bus (1/8th unit load).                              Industrial and Process Control Equipment
The SP335 operates from a single power supply,                                Point-Of-Sale Equipment
either 3.3V or 5V, with low idle current. The shutdown

PRODUCT SUMMARY
The SP335 is an advanced multiprotocol transceiver supporting RS-232, RS-485, and RS-422 serial
standards. Integrated cable termination and multiple configuration modes allow all three protocols to be used
interchangeably over a single cable or connector with no additional switching components. Full operation
requires only four external charge pump capacitors.
INTERNALLY SWITCHED CABLE TERMINATION
Enabling and disabling the RS-485/422 termination resistor is one of the largest challenges system designers
face when sharing a single connector or pair of lines across multiple serial protocols. A termination resistor
may be necessary for accurate RS-485/422 communication, but must be removed when the lines are used for
RS-232. SP335 provides an elegant solution to this problem by integrating the termination resistor and
switching control, and allowing it to be switched in and out of the circuit with a single pin. No external switching
components are required. Termination on the receiver inputs will be enabled if both TERM and RS-485/RS-232
are high.
ENHANCED FAILSAFE
The enhanced failsafe feature of the SP335 guarantees a logic-high receiver output when the receiver inputs
are open, shorted, or terminated but idle/undriven. The enhanced failsafe interprets 0V differential as a logic
high with a minimum 50mV noise margin, while maintaining compliance with the EIA/TIA-485 standard of
±200mV. No external biasing resistors are required, further easing the usage of multiple protocols over a single
connector.
±15kV ESD PROTECTION
ESD protection structures are incorporated on all pins to protect against electrostatic discharges encountered
during handling and assembly. The bus pins (driver outputs and receiver inputs) have extra protection
structures, which have been tested up to ±15kV without damage. These structures withstand high ESD in all
states: normal operation, in shutdown, and when powered off.
ESD protection is be tested in various ways. Exar uses the following methods to qualify the protection
structures designed into SP335:
         ±8kV using IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge
         ±15kV using IEC 61000-4-2 Airgap Discharge
         ±15kV using the Human Body Model (HBM)
The IEC 61000-4-2 standard is more rigorous than HBM, resulting in lower voltage levels compared with HBM
for the same level of ESD protection. Because IEC 61000-4-2 specifies a lower series resistance, the peak
current is higher than HBM. The SP335 has passed both HBM and IEC 61000-4-2 testing without damage.
VARIABLE LOGIC LEVEL VOLTAGE
The SP335 includes a VL pin, which reduces the logic level thresholds to interface with processors operating at
reduced supply voltages. This pin should be connected to the supply voltage of the processor, or can be
connected to VCC for typical logic levels.
