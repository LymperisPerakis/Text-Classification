                         The GH65C11-X is designed to receive input                  (especially advantageous in battery powered                       modes are: magnitude and direction, up and
                         from standard quadrature optical encoders.                  systems). Sample rate is a nominal 4K per                         down count, and standard quadrature.
                         The power management feature allows power                   second allowing high speed quadrature input.                      Debouncing of an integral pushbutton switch
