                 Rev. 3.1 — 30 June 2016                                              Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TDA8035 is the cost efficient successor of the established integrated contact smart
              card reader IC TDA8024. It offers a high level of security for the card by performing
              current limitation, short-circuit detection, ESD protection as well as supply supervision.
              The current consumption during the standby mode of the contact reader is very low as it
              operates in the 3 V supply domain. The TDA8035 is therefore the ideal component for a
              power efficient contact reader.
2. Features and benefits
          2.1 Protection of the contact smart card
               Thermal and short-circuit protection on all card contacts
               VCC regulation:
                   5 V, 3 V, 1.8 V  5 % on 2 220 nF multilayer ceramic capacitors with low ESR
                   Current spikes of 40 nA/s (VCC = 5 V and 3 V) or 15 nA/s (VCC = 1.8 V) up to
                     20 MHz, with controlled rise and fall times. Filtered overload detection is
                     approximately 120 mA.
               Automatic activation and deactivation sequences initiated by software or by hardware
                 in the event of a short-circuit, card take-off, overheating, falling VREG VDD(INTF),VDDP
               Enhanced card-side ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) protection of (> 8 kV)
               Supply supervisor for killing spikes during power on and off:
                   threshold internally fixed
                   externally by a resistor bridge
          2.2 Easy integration into your contact reader
               SW compatible to TDA8024 and TDA8034
               5 V, 3 V, 1.8 V smart card supply

8. Functional description
                       Remark: The ISO 7816 terminology convention has been adhered to throughout this
                       document, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with this convention.
                   8.1 Power supply
                       Power supply voltage VDDP is from 2.7 V to 5.5 V
                       All interface signals with the system controller are referenced to VDD(INTF). All card
                       contacts remain inactive during powering up or powering down.
                       Internal regulator VREG is 1.8 V
                       After powering the device, OFFN remains low until CMDVCCN is set high and PRESN is
                       low.
                       During power off, OFFN falls low when VDDP is below the threshold voltage falling.
                       While the card is not activated, CMDVCCN is kept at high level. To save power
                       consumption, the frequency of the internal oscillator (fosc(int)) used for the activation
                       sequences is put in low frequency mode.
                       This device includes a DC-to-DC converter to generate the 5 V, 3 V or 1.8 V card supply
                       voltage (VCC). The DC-to-DC converter is separately supplied by VDDP and GNDP. The
                       DC-to-DC converter operates as a voltage tripler, doubler or follower according to the
                       respective values of VCC and VDDP.
                       Special care has to me made in the selection of the capacitors of the DC/DC converter
                       specially with respect to capacitor value versus voltage and ESR (see Table 7)
                       The operating mode is as follows (see Figure 3):
                         •  VCC = 5 V and VDDP > 3.8 V; voltage doubler
                         •  VCC = 5 V and VDDP < 3.6 V; voltage tripler
                         •  VCC = 3 V and VDDP > 3.8 V; voltage follower
                         •  VCC = 3 V and VDDP < 3.6 V; voltage doubler
                         •  VCC = 1.8 V and VDDP > 3.8 V; voltage doubler
                         •  VCC = 1.8 V and VDDP < 3.6 V; voltage tripler

                        Fig 3.      Block voltage supervisor
                       The voltage supervisor is used as a power-on reset, and also as supply drop detection
                       during a card session. The threshold of the voltage supervisor is set internally in the IC for
                       VDDP and VREG. The threshold can be adjusted externally for VDD(INTF) using the
                       PORADJ pin. As long as VREG is less than Vth(VREG) + Vhys(VREG), the IC remains inactive
                       whatever the levels on the command lines are. The inactivity lasts for the duration of tw
                       after VREG has reached a level higher than Vth(VREG) + Vhys(VREG). The outputs of the
                       VDDP, VREG and VDD(INTF) supervisors are combined and sent to a digital controller in
                       order to reset the TDA8035. The reset pulse of approximately 5.7 ms (tw = 2048 
                       1/(fosc(int)_Low) is used internally for maintaining the IC in an inactive mode during the
                       supply voltage power-on (see Figure 4 and Figure 5). A deactivation sequence is
                       performed when:
                         • VREG falls below Vth(VREG)
                         • VDD(INTF) falls below Vth(PORADJ)
                         • VDDP falls below Vth(VDDP)

                         Fig 6.    Switch external clock
                       To generate the card clock CLK, the TDA8035 can either use an external clock provided
                       on XTAL1 pin or a crystal oscillator connected on both XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins. The
                       TDA8035 automatically detects when an external clock is provided on XTAL1.
                       Consequently, there is no need for an extra pin to configure the clock source (external
                       clock or crystal).
                       The automatic clock source detection is performed on each activation command
                       (CMDVCCN pin falling edge). During a time window defined by the internal oscillator, the
                       presence of an external clock on XTAL1 pin is checked. If a clock is detected, the crystal
                       oscillator is kept stopped, else, the crystal oscillator is started. It is mandatory when an
                       external clock is used, that the clock is applied on XTAL1 before CMDVCCN falling edge
                       signal.
                       The frequency is chosen as fXTAL, fXTAL/2, fXTAL/4 or fXTAL/8 via the pins CLKDIV1 and
                       CLKDIV2. Both selection inputs are not changed simultaneously. A minimum of 10 ns is
                       required between changes on CLKDIV1 and CLKDIV2.
                       The frequency change is synchronous, which means that during transition, no pulse is
                       shorter than 45 % of the smallest period. This ensures that the first and last clock pulse
                       around the change has the correct width. When changing the frequency dynamically, the
                       change is effective for only 10 periods of XTAL1 after the command.
                       The duty cycle on pin CLK is between 45 % and 55 %:
                         • When an external clock is used on XTAL1 pin and fXTAL is used, the duty cycle is
                            between 48 % and 52 %. The subsequent rise and fall times (tr(i) and tf(i)) conform to
                            values listed in Table 7. It has to connect a 56 pF serial capacitor (see Figure 13).
                         • CLK frequency is fXTAL, fXTAL/2, fXTAL/4 or fXTAL/8:
                            It is guaranteed between 45 % and 55 % of the period by the frequency dividers.

                                                                              High integrated and low power smart card interface
                   8.4 I/O circuitry
                       The three data lines I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are identical.
                       To enter the idle state, both lines (I/O and I/OUC) are pulled HIGH via a 10 k resistor (I/O
                       to VCC and I/OUC to VDD(INTF)).
                       I/O is referenced to VCC, and I/OUC to VDD(INTF) which allows operation with
                       VCC  VDD(INTF).
                       The first side on which a falling edge occurs becomes the master. An anti-latch circuit
                       disables the detection of falling edges on the other line, which becomes the slave.
                       After a time delay td(edge), the logic 0 present on the master side is transmitted to the slave
                       side.
                       When the master side returns to logic 1, the slave side transmits the logic 1 during the
                       time delay tpu and both sides return to their idle states.
                       The active pull-up feature ensures fast Low to High transitions. It is able to deliver more
                       than 1 mA to an output voltage of 0.9 VCC on an 80 pF load. At the end of the active
                       pull-up pulse, the output voltage depends on the internal pull-up resistor and on the load
                       current.
                       The current to and from the cards I/O lines is internally limited to 15 mA.
                       The maximum frequency on these lines is 1.5 MHz.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                  TDA8035
                                                                                   High integrated and low power smart card interface
                   8.5 CS control
                       The CS (Chip Select) input allows multiple devices to operate in parallel. When CS is
                       high, the system interface signals operate as described. When CS is low, the signals
                       CMDVCCN, RSTIN, CLKDIV1, CLKDIV2, EN_5V/3VN and EN_1.8VN are latched.
                       I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are set to high impedance pull-up mode and data is no
                       longer passed to or from the smart card. The OFFN output is a 3-state output.
                   8.6 Shutdown mode and Deep Shutdown mode
                       After power-on reset, the circuit enters the Shutdown mode if CMDVCCN input pin is set
                       to a logic high. A minimum number of circuits are active while waiting for the
                       microcontroller to start a session.
                         1. All card contacts are inactive (approximately 200  to GND).
                         2. I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are high impedance (10 kW pull-up resistor connected
                            to VDD(INTF)).
                         3. Voltage generators are stopped.
                         4. Voltage supervisor is active.
                         5. The internal oscillator runs at its low frequency.
                       A Deep Shutdown mode can be entered by forcing CMDVCCN input pin to a logic-High
                       state and EN_5V/3VN, EN_1.8VN input pins to a logic-Low state. Deep Shutdown mode
                       can only be entered when the smart card reader is inactive. In Deep Shutdown mode, all
                       circuits are disabled. The OFFN pin follows the status of PRESN pin. To exit Deep

                       The following sequence then occurs with crystal oscillator (see Figure 8):
                       T = 64  Toscint (freq high)
                        1. CMDVCCN is pulled low (t0)
                        2. Crystal oscillator start-up time (t0).
                        3. The internal oscillator changes to its high frequency and DC-to-DC starts
                           t1 = t0 + 768  Tosc (freq low)
                        4. VCC rises from 0 to selected VCC value (5 V, 3 V, 1.8 V) with a controlled slope
                           (t2 = t1 + 3T/2)
                        5. I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are enabled (t3 = t1 + 10T), until now, they were pulled LOW
                        6. CLK is applied to the C3 contact (t4 = t3 + ×) with 200 ns < × < 10 × 1/fXtal
                        7. RST is enabled (t5 = t1 + 13T).

                   8.8 Deactivation sequence
                       When a session is completed, the microcontroller sets the CMDVCCN line to the HIGH
                       state. The circuit then executes an automatic deactivation sequence by counting the
                       sequencer back and ends in the inactive state (see Figure 9):
                        1. RST goes LOW (t11 = t10 + 3T/64)
                        2. CLK is stopped LOW (t12 = t11 +T/2)
                        3. I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are pulled LOW (t13 = t11 + T)
                        4. VCC falls to zero (t14 = t11 + 3T/2). The deactivation sequence is completed when VCC
                            reaches its inactive state
                        5. VUP falls to zero (t15 = t11 + 7T/2)
                        6. VCC < 0.4 V (tde = t11 + 3T/2 + VCC fall time)
                        7. All card contacts become low-impedance to GND. I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC
                            remain pulled up to VDD(INTF) via a 10 k resistor.
                        8. The internal oscillator reverts to its lower frequency.

                   8.9 VCC regulator
                       VCC buffer is able to deliver up to 65 mA continuously at VCC = 5 V and VCC = 3 V, and
                       35 mA at VCC = 1.8 V.
                       VCC buffer has an internal overload detection at approximately 125 mA.
                       This detection is internally filtered, allowing the card to draw spurious current pulses of up
                       to 200 mA for some milliseconds, without causing a deactivation. The average current
                       value must remain below the maximum.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                            TDA8035
                                                                             High integrated and low power smart card interface
                8.10 Fault detection
                     The circuit monitors the following fault conditions:
                       • short-circuit or high current on VCC
                       • Card removal during transaction
                       • VDDP or VDD(INTF) or Vreg dropping
                       • overheating.
                     There are two different cases (see Figure 10 on page 16):
                      1. CMDVCCN High (outside a card session): OFFN is Low when the card is not in the
                         reader, and High when the card is in the reader. The supply supervisor detects a
                         supply voltage drop on VDDP and generates an internal power-on reset pulse, but it
                         does not act upon OFFN. The card is not powered-up, so no short-circuit or
                         overheating is detected.
                      2. CMDVCCN Low (within a card session): OFFN falls Low in any of the previously
                         mentioned cases. As soon as the fault is detected, an emergency deactivation is
                         automatically performed. When the system controller sets CMDVCCN back to High, it
                         senses OFFN again. After a complete deactivation sequence, the system controller
                         sets CMDVCCN back to High and it senses OFFN again. This is to distinguish
                         between a hardware problem or a card extraction. OFFN reverts to High when the
                         card is still present.
                     A bounce can occur on the PRESN signal during card insertion or withdrawal. The bounce
                     depends on the type of card presence switch within the connector (normally closed or
                     normally open), and on the mechanical characteristics of the switch. To prevent this
                     bounce, a debounce function of approximately 4.05 ms (tdeb = 1280  1/(fosc(int)_Low) is
                     integrated in the device.
                     When the card is inserted, OFFN goes High only at the end of the debounce time (see
                     Figure 11 on page 16).
                     When the card is extracted, an automatic deactivation sequence of the card is performed
                     on the first true/false transition on PRESN. OFFN goes Low.

9. Limiting values
                       All card contacts are protected against a short-circuit with any other card contact.
                       Stress beyond the limiting values can damage the device permanently. The values are
                       stress ratings only and functional operation of the device under these conditions is not
                       implied.
