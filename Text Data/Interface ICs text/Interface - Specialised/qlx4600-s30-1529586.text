       DI         16     Serial data input, CMOS logic. Input for serial data stream to program internal registers controlling the boost for all four
                         equalizers. Synchronized with clock (CLK) on pin 46. Overrides the boost setting established on CP control pins. Internally
                         pulled down.
      DO          17     Serial data output, CMOS logic. Output of the internal registers controlling the boost for all four equalizers. Synchronized
                         with clock on pin 46. Equivalent to serial data input on DI but delayed by 21 clock cycles.
  CP3[A,B,C]  18, 19, 20 Control pins for setting equalizer 3. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set the boost level. A is the
                         MSB, and C is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled down through a 25kΩ resistor.
  CP4[A,B,C]  21, 22, 23 Control pins for setting equalizer 4. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set the boost level. A is the

                         CLK when set HIGH. Resets all internal registers to zero and uses boost levels set by CP pins when set LOW. If serial
                         programming is not used, this pin should be grounded.
      IS4         25     Impedance Select 4. CMOS logic input. When the voltage on this pin is LOW, the single-ended input impedance of IN4[P]
                         and IN4[N] each go above 200kΩ and powers down the channel. This pin should be connected to the Fundamental Reset
                         signal in PCI Express™. Otherwise, connect to VDD to hold the input impedance at 50Ω.
      IS3         26     Impedance Select 3. CMOS logic input. When the voltage on this pin is LOW, the single-ended input impedance of IN3[P]
                         and IN3[N] each go above 200kΩ and powers down the channel. This pin should be connected to the Fundamental Reset

  CP1[C,B,A]  42, 43, 44 Control pins for setting equalizer 1. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set the boost level. A is the
                         MSB, and C is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled down through a 25kΩ resistor.
      ENB         45     Serial data enable (active low), CMOS logic. Internal registers can be programmed with DI and CLK pins only when the
                         ENB pin is ‘LOW’. Internally pulled down.
      CLK         46     Serial data clock, CMOS logic. Synchronous clock for serial data on DI and DO pins. Data on DI is latched on the rising
                         clock edge. Clock speed is recommended to be between 10MHz and 20MHz. Internally pulled down.
 EXPOSED PAD       -     Exposed ground pad. For proper electrical and thermal performance, this pad should be connected to the PCB ground
                         plane.

NOTES:
 7. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design.
 8. After channel loss, differential amplitudes at QLX4600-S30 inputs must meet the input voltage range specified in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on
     page 5.
 9. Temperature = +25°C, VDD = 1.2V.
10. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted signal (as measured
     at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJP-P + 14.1 x RJRMS.
11. Measured using a PRBS (27-1) pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent, media-induced loss only.
12. Rise and fall times measured using a 1GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.
13. For active data mode, cable input amplitude is 400mVP-P (differential) or greater. For line silence mode, cable input amplitude is 20mVP-P
     (differential) or less.
14. Measured differentially across the data source.
15. During line silence, transmitter noise in excess of this voltage range may result in differential output amplitudes from the QLX4600 that are greater
     than 20mVP-P.
16. The data pattern preceding line silence mode is comprised of the PCIe Electrical Idle Ordered Set (EIOS). The data pattern following line silence mode
     is comprised of the PCIe Electrical Idle Exit Sequence (EIES).
17. The data pattern preceding or following line silence mode is comprised of the SAS-2 ALIGN (0) sequence for OOB signaling at 3Gb/s, and amplitude
     of 800mVP-P.

QLX4600-S30
Typical Performance Characteristics
VDD = 1.2V, TA = +25°C, unless otherwise noted. Performance was characterized using the system testbed shown in Figure 2. Unless otherwise noted,
the transmitter generated a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) PRBS-7 sequence at 800mVP-P (differential) with 10ps of peak-to-peak deterministic jitter. This
transmit signal was launched into twin-axial cable test channels of varying gauges and lengths. The loss characteristics of these test channels are plotted
as a function of frequency in Figure 3. The received signal at the output of these test channels was then processed by the QLX4600-S30 before being
passed to a receiver. Eye diagram measurements were made with 4000 waveform acquisitions and include random jitter.

high-speed interconnects. A functional diagram of one of the four
channels in the QLX4600-S30 is shown in Figure 23. In addition
to a robust equalization filter to compensate for channel loss and
restore signal fidelity, the QLX4600-S30 contains unique
integrated features to preserve special signaling protocols
typically broken by other equalizers. The signal detect function is
used to mute the channel output when the equalized signal falls
below the level determined by the Detection Threshold (DT) pin
voltage. This function is intended to preserve periods of line
silence (“quiescent state” in InfiniBand contexts).
As illustrated in Figure 23, the core of each high-speed signal
path in the QLX4600-S30 is a sophisticated equalizer followed by
a limiting amplifier. The equalizer compensates for skin loss,
dielectric loss, and impedance discontinuities in the
transmission channel. Each equalizer is followed by a limiting
amplification stage that provides a clean output signal with full
amplitude swing and fast rise-fall times for reliable signal

compensation levels are plotted in Figure 24. The flexibility of
this adjustable compensation architecture enables signal fidelity
to be optimized on a channel-by-channel basis, providing support
for a wide variety of channel characteristics and data rates
ranging from 2.5 to 6.25 Gb/s. Because the boost level is
externally set rather than internally adapted, the QLX4600-S30
provides reliable communication from the very first bit
transmitted. There is no time needed for adaptation and control
loop convergence. Furthermore, there are no pathological data
patterns that will cause the QLX4600-S30 to move to an
incorrect boost level.

Optimal Cable Boost Settings
The settable equalizing filter within the QLX4600 enables the
device to optimally compensate for frequency-dependent
attenuation across a wide variety of channels, data rates and
encoding schemes. For the reference channels plotted in Figure 3,
Table 4 shows the optimal boost setting when transmitting a
PRBS-7 signal. The optimal boost setting is defined as the
equalizing filter setting that minimizes the output residual jitter of
the QLX4600. The settings in Table 4 represent the optimal
settings for the QLX4600C across an ambient temperature range
of 0°C to +70°C. The optimal setting at room temperature (+20°C
to +40°C) is generally one to two settings lower than the values
listed in Table 5 on page 16.

according to the following steps:                                                within tD.
 1. The ENB pin is pulled ‘LOW’.
  - While this pin is ‘LOW’, the data input on DI are read into
     registers but not yet latched.
  - A setup time of tSCK is needed between ENB going ‘LOW’
     and the first rising clock edge.
 2. At least 21 values are read from DI on the rising edge of the
     CLK signal.
  - If more than 21 values are passed in, then only the last 21
     values are kept in a FIFO fashion.
  - The data on DI should start by sending the value destined for
     register 21 and finish by sending the value destined for
     register 1.
  - A range of clock frequencies can be used. A typical rate is
     10MHz. The clock should not exceed 20MHz.
  - Setup (tSDI) and hold (tHDI) times are needed around the
     rising clock edge.

QLX4600-S30
Detection Threshold (DT) Pin Functionality
                                                                                 1.2V
The QLX4600-S30 is capable of maintaining periods of line
silence on any of its four channels by monitoring each channel                       R1
for Loss Of Signal (LOS) conditions and subsequently muting the                              DT
outputs of a respective channel when such a condition is
detected. A reference current applied to the Detection Threshold     47nF           R2
(DT) pin is used to set the LOS threshold of the internal signal
detection circuitry. Current control on the DT pin is done via one
or two external resistors. Nominally, both a pull-up and pull-down
resistor are tied to the DT pin (Figure 33A), but if adequate             GND   GND
control of the supply voltage is maintained to within ±3% of 1.2V,            FIGURE 33A.
then a simple pull-down resistor is adequate (as in Figure 33B).
Resistors used should be at least 1/16W, with ±1% precision.
The internal bias point of the DT pin, nominally 1.05V, is used in
conjunction with the voltage divider (R1 and R2) shown in                                 DT
Figure 33A to set the reference current on the DT pin.
Case 1: Channels with less than or equal to 25dB loss at 2.5GHz
                                                                            R2
(1Gb/s to 6Gb/s):
   For signals transmitted on channels having less than or equal
   to 25dB of loss at 2.5GHz, the optimal DT reference current is
   0µA. This optimal reference current may be achieved by either        GND
   leaving the DT pin floating, or tying the DT pin to ground (GND)
   with a 10MΩ resistor.                                                      FIGURE 33B.

   For channels exhibiting more than 25dB of total loss (this
   includes cable or FR-4 loss) the DT pin should be configured for
                                                                                    42.2k

About Q:ACTIVE™
Intersil has long realized that to enable the complex server
clusters of next generation datacenters, it is critical to manage
the signal integrity issues of electrical interconnects. To address
this, Intersil has developed its groundbreaking Q:ACTIVE™
product line. By integrating its analog ICs inside cabling
interconnects, Intersil is able to achieve unsurpassed
improvements in reach, power consumption, latency and cable
gauge size as well as increased airflow in tomorrow’s
datacenters. This new technology transforms passive cabling into
intelligent “roadways” that yield lower operating expenses and
capital expenditures for the expanding datacenter.
Intersil Lane Extenders allow greater reach over existing cabling,
while reducing the need for thicker cables. This significantly
reduces cable weight and clutter, increases airflow and reduces
power consumption.
