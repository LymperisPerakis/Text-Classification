Description of Blocks
  State Transition Diagram
       BD41001FJ-C has “Power OFF Mode”, “Through Mode”, “RX Through Mode” other than “CODEC Mode” for power saving
       control. Each mode is controlled by the NSLP, BUS, and TXD pins.

       While using master, the CLK pin becomes input pin, and uses to input BUS clock in “CODEC Mode”.
  Power OFF Mode
       “Power OFF Mode” reduces power consumption by not supplying powers to any circuits other than necessary ones for
       “Wakeup pulse detection (the BUS pin)” and “Wakeup input detection (the TXD pin)”.
       When the TXD pin is “H”, Wakeup input is detected, and then changes to “Through Mode”. If shift to “Power OFF Mode”,
       set the TXD pin to “L” and then set the NSLP pin to “L”.
       “Through Mode” and “RX Through Mode” cannot change to “Power OFF Mode” directly. Change it via “CODEC Mode” by
       setting the NSLP pin to “H”.
  Through Mode
       “Through Mode” does not process Coding/Decoding. It only drives signals from the TXD pin to the BUS pin and from the
       BUS pin to the RXD pin directly.
       When sending Wakeup pulse, change to “Through Mode” with the TXD pin as “H”.
  RX Through Mode
       “RX Through Mode” reverses the RXD pin output at each rising edge of the BUS pin.
       When detecting Wakeup pulse in “Power OFF Mode”, monitor the change of the RXD pin
  CODEC Mode
       “CODEC Mode” is the mode of CXPI communication. NSLP should be “H” for the chip to enter “CODEC Mode”.
       The RXD output changes synchronized with the falling edge of the CLK pin when in the Master setting, and with the falling
       edge of the BUS pin when in the Slave setting. The BUS output is delayed for 2.0±0.5 Tbit from the TXD input, and the
       RXD output is delayed for 1.0±0.5 Tbit from the BUS input.
       For about the jitter of the clock signal supplying the CLK pin when in the Master setting, input the signal satisfies the CXPI
       standard (±1.0 %) considering the jitters occurs in the BD41001FJ-C (±0.2 %).

BD41001FJ-C
Description of Blocks – continued
  Sequence Diagram
       Show the examples of the BD41001FJ-C control sequence which corresponding to the mode management of CXPI
       standard, “Sleep Mode”, “Standby Mode” and “Normal Mode”.(Refer to the CXPI standard for specifications about the
       detail of mode management.)
    1.    The Sequence from “Normal Mode” to “Sleep Mode”
          When changing to “Sleep Mode”, the NSLP pin should be switched from “H” to “L”, and then turn the IC to “Power OFF
          Mode”. The TXD pin has built-in pull-down resistor in case of a fail-safe. Fix the TXD pin to “L” before BD41001FJ-C
          enters “Power OFF Mode” to prevent extra currents from MCU side while “Sleep Mode”.
          Fix the CLK pin to “L” just like the TXD pin, because the pull-down resister of the CLK pin is active in the case of Master
          setting.

    2.  The Sequence from “Sleep Mode” to “Normal Mode” (Master Node Trigger)
        To wakeup the node by an internal factor, switch the IC to “CODEC Mode” by setting the NSLP pin to “H”. The TXD pin
        should be “H” within 30 µs before changing from “Power OFF Mode” to “CODEC Mode” in order to prevent abnormal the
        BUS output or the RXD output.
        In the case of slave node, BD41001FJ-C reverses RXD output at every rising edge of the BUS signal after receiving the
        BUS clock. When start wakeup detecting at the RXD first falling edge, start micro controller initializing operation. To
        establish wakeup pulse, check if the RXD pin is “H” after initializing operation or detect RXD rising edge.
        To change from “Standby Mode” to “Sleep Mode” because the slave node cannot receive the second rising pulse within
        the specified time, return to “Power OFF Mode” with the NSLP pin as “L” again after the change to “CODEC Mode” with
        the NSLP pin as “H”.

        When waking up the slave node by an internal factor, shift to “Through Mode” by setting the TXD pin to “H” and then
        send wakeup pulse.
        After receiving the wakeup pulse in the Master Node, the RXD output reverses at every rising edge of the BUS signal.
        Master node should establish wakeup pulse at the RXD first falling edge.
        To change from “Standby Mode” to “Sleep Mode”, in case the master node cannot receive BUS clock within the

  Transmission and Reception Starting Effective Time after Shift to CODEC Mode
       After changing to “CODEC Mode” by setting the NSLP pin to “H”, BD41001FJ-C detect the clock period and then learn the
       LO width of logic value1. To secure the learning time of the LO width of logic value1, start to transmit and receive data after
       the time equal to 16 Tbit clocks at least. (After setting the NSLP pin to “H”, 6 Tbit (maximum) clocks are necessary to output
       clock signal to the BUS signal input or the CLK signal input.)

BD41001FJ-C
  Arbitration Function
       To carry out collision resolution functions that defined by CXPI specification, both micro controller and BD41001FJ-C
       share functions. Basically, BD41001FJ-C arbitrates the bit data in the UART flame and micro controller arbitrates the byte
       data between the UART flames.
    1. In case of collision is happened by transmitting from other node at the same time
       In the case of collision (arbitration defeat) is happened by transmitting from other node at the same time, it stops the
       transmission of remaining UART flame data after the collision from micro controller side. It is necessary to have the
       interval of 1 Tbit or more (BUS baud rate period) to transmit again after arbitration defeat. Set the wait time in consideration
       of the frequency deviation of the baud rate clock in micro controller side and BUS side and the delay at UART circuit in
       micro controller side.
                                                                                                                                            When arbitration defeat is detected,

BD41001FJ-C
  Arbitration Function – continued
    3. In case of arbitration function failure is happened because micro controller outputs transmission data to
       BD41001FJ-C at the out of range of BD41001FJ-C arbitration function.
       The BUS output is delayed for 2.5 Tbit(Maximum) from the TXD input and the RXD output is delayed for 1.5 Tbit(Maximum)
       from BUS input. When micro controller outputs transmission data to BD41001FJ-C at the timing that shown in Figure 17,
       CXPI frame of other node is destroyed because BD41001FJ-C outputs PID just after receive PID.
       Micro controller should stop transmission while receiving UART flame.
       Figure 17 shows the example in case of 2.0 Tbit delay from the TXD input to the BUS output and 1.0 Tbit delay from the
       BUS input to the RXD output.

       startbit of UART receive flame before transmitting PID, and then stop transmission of PID.
  Fail-safe Function
       BD41001FJ-C has built in fail-safe mode such as DTC (TXD Dominant Abnormal Detection Circuit), TSD (Abnormal
       Thermal Detection Circuit) and UVLO/POR (Under Voltage Lockout Circuit/Power ON Reset Circuit).
       The operations of each abnormal situation are as follows;

       (Note 13) In the case of TXD fixed L, Logical value0 is outputted only in first 10bit. Logical value1 is outputted before DTC abnormality is detected.
       When “L” time of the TXD pin is more than tDTC, DTC (Dominant Timeout Counter) detects abnormality, and then it stops
       output. It can return to normal status with the TXD pin as “H”
       When the junction temperature exceeds TTSD, TSD (Thermal Shutdown) circuit detects abnormality, and then it stops
       output. It can return to normal status when the temperature drops TTSD_HYS.
       Operations of UVLO (Under Voltage Lockout) and POR (Power ON Reset) are as follows;
       When supply voltage is VUVLO or less, UVLO abnormality is detected, and then the BUS, the RXD and the CLK outputs
       (only slave) are fixed Hi-Z(H).
       When power supply When power supply is VUVLO or more, transceiver restarts output. When supply voltage drops below
       VPOR, POR abnormality is detected, and then it changes to “Power OFF Mode”, and reset status.

   Caution 1: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
               between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is
               operated over the absolute maximum ratings.
   Caution 2: Should by any chance the maximum junction temperature rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in deterioration of the
               properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, design a PCB boards with thermal resistance taken into consideration by
               increasing board size and copper area so as not to exceed the maximum junction temperature rating.

Operational Notes
     1.    Reverse Connection of Power Supply
           Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
           connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
           supply pins.
     2.    Power Supply Lines
           Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at
           all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
           capacitors.
     3.    Ground Voltage
           Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
     4.    Ground Wiring Pattern
           When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
           connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
           ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
           on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
     5.    Recommended Operating Conditions
           The function and operation of the IC are guaranteed within the range specified by the recommended operating
           conditions. The characteristic values are guaranteed only under the conditions of each item specified by the electrical
           characteristics.
     6.    Inrush Current
           When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
           instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
           supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and
           routing of connections.
     7.    Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
           Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
     8.    Testing on Application Boards
           When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
           subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
           should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
           process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
           transport and storage.
     9.    Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
           Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
           damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
           Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
           unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
     10. Unused Input Pins
           Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
           extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
           charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
           cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
           power supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
     11. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
           This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
           isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
           parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
           Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
           interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
           operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be
           avoided.

     12. Ceramic Capacitor
           When using a ceramic capacitor, determine a capacitance value considering the change of capacitance with
           temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
     13. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
           Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and the maximum junction temperature rating are all within
           the Area of Safe Operation (ASO).
     14. Thermal Shutdown Circuit (TSD)
           This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
           be within the IC’s maximum junction temperature rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the
           junction temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF power output pins. When the Tj
           falls below the TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
           Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
           circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
           heat damage.

                                    CLASSⅣ                                CLASSⅢ
    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are not designed under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below.
        Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the
        use of any ROHM’s Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our
        Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent
        verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                  H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (Exclude cases where no-clean type fluxes is used.
                 However, recommend sufficiently about the residue.); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble
                 cleaning agents for cleaning residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse, is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in

    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
              [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl 2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
              [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
              [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
         may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton.
    4.   Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of
