1. General description
              The TJA1081 is a FlexRay node transceiver that is fully compliant with the FlexRay
              electrical physical layer specification V2.1 Rev. A (see Ref. 1). In addition, it incorporates
              features and parameters included in V3.0.1 (see Ref. 2 and Section 14). It is primarily
              intended for communication systems from 1 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s, and provides an
              advanced interface between the protocol controller and the physical bus in a FlexRay
              network.
              The TJA1081 features enhanced low-power modes, optimized for ECUs that are
              permanently connected to the battery.
              The TJA1081 provides differential transmit capability to the network and differential
              receive capability to the FlexRay controller. It offers excellent EMC performance as well as
              high ESD protection.
              The TJA1081 actively monitors system performance using dedicated error and status
              information (that can be read by any microcontroller), along with internal voltage and
              temperature monitoring.
              The TJA1081 supports mode control as used in the TJA1080A (see Ref. 3).

6. Functional description
                              The block diagram of the transceiver is shown in Figure 1.
                       6.1 Operating modes
                              The TJA1081 supports the following operating modes:
                                •  Normal (normal-power mode)
                                •  Receive-only (normal-power mode)
                                •  Standby (low-power mode)
                                •  Go-to-sleep (low-power mode)
                                •  Sleep (low-power mode)
                     6.1.1 Bus activity and idle detection
                              The following mechanisms for activity and idle detection are valid in normal-power modes:
                                • If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than Vi(dif)det(act) for
                                   tdet(act)(bus), activity is detected on the bus lines and pin RXEN is switched LOW which
                                   results in pin RXD being released:
                                   – If, after bus activity detection, the differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than
                                       VIH(dif), pin RXD will go HIGH
                                   – If, after bus activity detection, the differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than
                                       VIL(dif), pin RXD will go LOW
                                • If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than Vi(dif)det(act) for
                                   tdet(idle)(bus), then idle is detected on the bus lines and pin RXEN is switched to HIGH.
                                   This results in pin RXD being blocked (pin RXD is switched to HIGH or stays HIGH)
                       6.2 Mode control pins: STBN and EN
                              Control inputs STBN and EN are used to select the operating mode. See Table 3 for a
                              detailed description of pin signalling and Figure 3 for the timing diagram.
                              All mode transitions are controlled via the STBN and EN pins, unless an undervoltage
                              condition is detected. If VIO and (VCC or VBAT) are within their operating ranges, pin ERRN
                              indicates the status of the error flag. Operating ranges are: VBAT = 6.5 V to 60 V,
                              VCC = 4.75 V to 5.25 V and VIO = 2.2 V to 5.25 V.

                6.2.1 Normal mode
                      In Normal mode the transceiver is able to transmit and receive data via the bus lines BP
                      and BM. The output of the normal receiver is directly connected to pin RXD.
                      Transmitter behavior in Normal mode, with no time-out present on pins TXEN and BGE
                      and the temperature flag not set (TEMP HIGH = 0; see Table 9), is detailed in Table 8.
                      In this mode, pin INH is set HIGH.

                                                           LOW and BM is driven HIGH
                6.2.2 Receive-only mode
                      In Receive-only mode the transceiver can only receive data. The transmitter is disabled,
                      regardless of the voltage levels on pins BGE and TXEN.
                      In this mode, pin INH is set HIGH.
                6.2.3 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is a low-power mode featuring very low current consumption. In this mode,
                      the transceiver cannot transmit or receive data. The low-power receiver is activated to
                      monitor the bus for wake-up patterns.
                      A transition to Standby mode can be triggered by applying the appropriate levels on pins
                      EN and STBN (see Figure 5 and Table 4) or if an undervoltage is detected on pin VCC
                      (see Figure 5 and Section 6.2.5).
                      In this mode, pin INH is set HIGH.
                      If the wake flag is set, pins RXEN and RXD are driven LOW; otherwise pins RXEN and
                      RXD are set HIGH (see Section 6.3).
                6.2.4 Go-to-sleep mode
                      In this mode, the transceiver behaves as in Standby mode. If this mode is selected for a
                      time longer than the go-to-sleep hold time (th(gotosleep)) and the wake flag has been
                      previously cleared, the transceiver will enter Sleep mode, regardless of the voltage on
                      pin EN.
                6.2.5 Sleep mode
                      Sleep mode is a low-power mode. The only difference between Sleep mode and Standby
                      mode is that pin INH is set floating in Sleep mode. A transition to Sleep mode will be
                      triggered from all other modes if the UVVIO flag or the UVVBAT flag is set (see Table 6).
                      If an undervoltage is detected on pin VCC or VBAT while VIO is present, the wake flag is set
                      by a positive edge on pin STBN, provided that VIO and (VCC or VBAT) are present.

                       The undervoltage flags will be reset when the wake flag is set, and the transceiver will
                       enter the mode indicated by the levels on pins EN and STBN if VIO is present.
                   6.3 Wake-up mechanism
                       From Sleep mode (pin INH is switched off), the transceiver will enter Standby or
                       Go-to-sleep mode (depending on the level at pin EN) if the wake flag is set. Consequently,
                       pin INH is switched on.
                       If an undervoltage is not detected on pins VIO, VCC and VBAT, the transceiver will switch
                       immediately to the mode indicated by the levels on pins EN and STBN.
                       In Standby, Go-to-sleep and Sleep modes, pins RXD and RXEN are driven LOW if the
                       wake flag is set.
                6.3.1 Remote wake-up
               6.3.1.1 Bus wake-up via wake-up pattern
                       Bus wake-up is detected if two consecutive DATA_0 of at least tdet(wake)DATA_0 separated
                       by an idle or DATA_1 of at least tdet(wake)idle, followed by an idle or DATA_1 of at least
                       tdet(wake)idle are present on the bus lines within tdet(wake)tot.
                                                                                                                tdet(wake)tot

               6.3.1.2 Bus wake-up via dedicated FlexRay data frame
                       The reception of a dedicated data frame, emulating a valid wake-up pattern, as shown in
                       Figure 7, sets the wake-up flag of the TJA1081.
                       Due to the Byte Start Sequence (BSS), preceding each byte, the DATA_0 and DATA_1
                       phases for the wake-up symbol are interrupted every 1 s. For 10 Mbit/s the maximum
                       interruption time is 130 ns. Such interruptions do not prevent the transceiver from
                       recognizing the wake-up pattern in the payload of a data frame.
                       The wake-up flag will not be set if an invalid wake-up pattern is received.

                            edge on pin WAKE) a local wake-up event on pin WAKE is detected. At the same time,
                            the biasing of this pin is switched to pull-down.
                            If the voltage on pin WAKE is higher than Vth(det)(WAKE) for longer than twake(WAKE), the

                                                                                                                    FlexRay node transceiver
                   6.4 Fail-silent behavior
                       In order to be fail silent, undervoltage detection and a reset mechanism for the digital state
                       machine are implemented.
                       If an undervoltage is detected on pins VCC, VIO and/or VBAT, the transceiver will enter a
                       low-power mode. This ensures the passive and defined behavior of the transmitter and
                       receiver when an undervoltage is detected.
                       In the range between the minimum operating voltage and the undervoltage detection
                       threshold, the principle functions of the transmitter and receiver are maintained. However,
                       in this range parameters (e.g. thresholds and delays of the transmitter and receiver) may
                       deviate from the levels specified for the operating range.
                       The digital state machine is supplied by VCC, VIO or VBAT, depending on which voltage is
                       available. Therefore, the digital state machine will be properly supplied as long as the
                       voltage on pin VCC or pin VIO remains above 4.75 V or the voltage on pin VBAT remains
                       above 6.5 V.
                       If the voltage on all pins (i.e. VCC, VIO and VBAT) breaks down, a reset signal will be given
                       to the digital state machine as soon as the internal supply voltage for the digital state
                       machine becomes too low for the proper operation of the state machine. This ensures the
                       passive and defined behavior of the digital state machine in the event of an overall supply
                       voltage breakdown.
                6.4.1 VBAT undervoltage
                       If the UVVBAT flag is set, the transceiver will enter Sleep mode (pin INH is switched off)
                       regardless of the voltages present on pins EN and STBN. If the undervoltage recovers,
                       the wake flag will be set and the transceiver will enter the mode determined by the
                       voltages on pins EN and STBN.
                6.4.2 VCC undervoltage
                       If the UVVCC flag is set, the transceiver will enter Standby mode regardless of the voltages
                       present on pins EN and STBN. If the undervoltage recovers or the wake flag is set, mode
                       switching via pins EN and STBN is possible.
                6.4.3 VIO undervoltage
                       If the voltage on pin VIO is lower than Vuvd(VIO) (even if the UVVIO flag is reset) pins EN,
                       STBN, TXD and BGE are set LOW (internally) and pin TXEN is set HIGH (internally). If
                       the UVVIO flag is set, the transceiver will enter Sleep mode (pin INH is switched off). If the
                       undervoltage recovers or the wake flag is set, mode switching via pins EN and STBN is
                       possible.
                   6.5 Flags
                6.5.1 Local wake-up source flag
                       The local wake-up source flag can only be set in a low-power mode. When a wake-up
                       event is detected on pin WAKE (see Section 6.3.2), the local wake-up source flag is set.
                       The local wake-up source flag is reset by entering a low-power mode.

                6.5.2 Remote wake-up source flag
                      The remote wake-up source flag can only be set in a low-power mode if pin VBAT is within
                      its operating range. When a remote wake-up event is detected on the bus lines (see
                      Section 6.3.1), the remote wake-up source flag is set. The remote wake-up source flag is
                      reset by entering a low-power mode.
                6.5.3 Wake flag
                      The wake flag is set if one of the following events occurs:
                        • The local or remote wake-up source flag is set (edge sensitive)
                        • A positive edge is detected on pin STBN when VIO is present
                        • Recovery of the UVVBAT flag
                      The wake flag is reset by entering Normal mode, a low-power mode or by setting one of
                      the undervoltage flags.
                6.5.4 Power-on flag
                      The PWON power-on flag is set if the internal supply voltage for the digital part becomes
                      higher than the lowest value it needs to operate. Entering Normal mode resets the PWON
                      flag.
                6.5.5 Temperature medium flag
                      The temperature medium flag is set if the junction temperature exceeds Tj(warn)(medium) in a
                      normal-power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range. The temperature medium
                      flag is reset when the junction temperature drops below Tj(warn)(medium) in a normal-power
                      mode with pin VBAT within its operating range or after a read of the status register in a
                      low-power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range. No action will be taken if this
                      flag is set.
                6.5.6 Temperature high flag
                      The temperature high flag is set if the junction temperature exceeds Tj(dis)(high) in a
                      normal-power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range.
                      The temperature high flag is reset if a negative edge is applied to pin TXEN while the
                      junction temperature is lower than Tj(dis)(high) in a normal-power mode with pin VBAT within
                      its operating range.
                      If the temperature high flag is set, the transmitter will be disabled.
                6.5.7 TXEN_BGE clamped flag
                      The TXEN_BGE clamped flag is set if pin TXEN is LOW and pin BGE is HIGH for longer
                      than tdetCL(TXEN_BGE). The TXEN_BGE clamped flag is reset if pin TXEN is HIGH or pin
                      BGE is LOW. If the TXEN_BGE flag is set, the transmitter is disabled.
                6.5.8 Bus error flag
                      The bus error flag is set if pin TXEN is LOW and pin BGE is HIGH and the data received
                      from the bus lines (pins BP and BM) are different to that received on pin TXD. The
                      transmission of any valid communication element, including a wake-up pattern, does not
                      lead to bus error indication.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                           TJA1081
                                                                                                                      FlexRay node transceiver
                        The error flag is reset if the data on the bus lines (pins BP and BM) are the same as on pin
                        TXD or if the transmitter is disabled. No action will be taken if the bus error flag is set.
                 6.5.9 UVVBAT flag
                        The UVVBAT flag is set if the voltage on pin VBAT is lower than Vuvd(VBAT). The UVVBAT flag
                        is reset if the voltage is higher than Vuvd(VBAT) or by setting the wake flag; see
                        Section 6.4.1.
               6.5.10 UVVCC flag
                        The UVVCC flag is set if the voltage on pin VCC is lower than Vuvd(VCC) for longer than
                        tdet(uv)(VCC). The flag is reset if the voltage on pin VCC is higher than Vuvd(VCC) for longer
                        than trec(uv)(VCC) or the wake flag is set; see Section 6.4.2.
                6.5.11 UVVIO flag
                        The UVVIO flag is set if the voltage on pin VIO is lower than Vuvd(VIO) for longer than
                        tdet(uv)(VIO). The flag is reset if the voltage on pin VIO is higher than Vuvd(VIO) or the wake
                        flag is set; see Section 6.4.3.
               6.5.12 Error flag
                        The error flag is set if one of the status bits S4 to S10 is set. The error flag is reset if none
                        of the S4 to S10 status bits are set; see Table 9.
                   6.6 Status register
                        The status register can be read out on pin ERRN by using pin EN as clock; the status bits
                        are given in Table 9. The timing diagram is shown in Figure 9.
                        The status register is accessible if:
                          • UVVIO flag is not set and the voltage on pin VIO is between 4.75 V and 5.25 V
                          • UVVCC flag is not set and the voltage on pin VIO is between 2.2 V and 4.75 V
                        After reading the status register, if no edge is detected on pin EN for longer than tdet(EN),
                        the status bits (S4 to S12) will be cleared if the corresponding flag has been reset. Pin
                        ERRN is LOW if the corresponding status bit is set.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 15) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 14 and 15

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 15.
