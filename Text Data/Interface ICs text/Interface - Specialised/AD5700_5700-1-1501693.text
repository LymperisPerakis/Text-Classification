1 Temperature range: −40°C to +125°C; typical at 25°C.
2 Current consumption specifications are based on mean current values.
3 The demodulator and modulator currents are specified using an external clock. If using an external crystal oscillator, the crystal oscillator current specification must be
  added to the corresponding VCC and IOVCC demodulator/modulator current specification to obtain the total supply current required in this mode.
4
  The demodulator and modulator currents are specified using an external clock. If using the internal oscillator, the internal oscillator current specification must be
  added to the corresponding VCC and IOVCC demodulator/modulator current specification to obtain the total supply current required in this mode.
5
  Guaranteed by design and characterization, but not production tested.
6
  Specification set assuming a sinusoidal input signal containing preamble characters at the input and an ideal external filter (see Figure 23).

Table 6. Pin Function Descriptions
Pin No.   Mnemonic      Description
1         XTAL_EN       Crystal Oscillator Circuit Enable. A low state enables the crystal oscillator circuit, and an external crystal is
                        required. A high state disables the crystal oscillator circuit, and an external clock source or the internal oscillator
                        (AD5700-1only) provides the clock source. This pin is used in conjunction with the CLK_CFG0 and CLK_CFG1 pins
                        in configuring the required clock generation scheme.
2         CLKOUT        Clock Output. If using the crystal oscillator or the internal RC oscillator, a clock output can be configured at the
                        CLKOUT pin. Enabling the clock output consumes extra current to drive the load on this pin. See the CLKOUT
                        section for more details.
3         CLK_CFG0      Clock Configuration Control. See Table 7.
4         CLK_CFG1      Clock Configuration Control. See Table 7.
5         RESET         Active Low Digital Input. Holding RESET low places the AD5700/AD5700-1 in power-down mode. A high state on
                        RESET returns the AD5700/AD5700-1 to their power-on state. If not using this pin, tie this pin to IOVCC.
6         CD            Carrier Detect—Digital Output. A high on CD indicates a valid carrier is detected.
7         TXD           Transmit Data—Digital Input. Data input to the modulator.
8         RTS           Request to Send—Digital Input. A high state enables the demodulator and disables the modulator. A low state
                        enables the modulator and disables the demodulator.
9         DUPLEX        A high state on this pin enables full duplex operation. See the Theory of Operation section. A low state disables
                        this feature.
10        RXD           Receive Data—UART Interface Digital Data Output. Data output from the demodulator is accessed on this pin.
11        IOVCC         Digital Interface Supply. Digital threshold levels are referenced to the voltage applied to this pin. The applied
                        voltage can be in the range of 1.71 V to 5.5 V. IOVCC should be decoupled to ground with low ESR 10 μF and
                        0.1 μF capacitors (see the Supply Decoupling section).
12        DGND          Digital Circuitry Ground Reference Connection. For typical operation, it is recommended to connect this pin to
                        AGND.
13        REG_CAP       Capacitor Connection for Internal Voltage Regulator. Connect a 1 μF capacitor from this pin to ground. Connect
                        REG_CAP to VCC when VCC ≤ 1.98 V.
14        HART_OUT      HART FSK Signal Output. See the FSK Modulator section and Figure 30 for typical connections.
15        REF           Internal Reference Voltage Output, or External 2.5 V Reference Voltage Input. Connect a 1 μF capacitor from this
                        pin to ground. When supplying an external reference, the VCC supply requires a minimum voltage of 2.7 V.
16        HART_IN       HART FSK Signal. When using the internal filter, couple the HART input signal into this pin using a 2.2 nF series
                        capacitor. If using an external band-pass filter as shown in Figure 23, do not connect to this pin.
17        ADC_IP        If using the internal band-pass filter, connect 680 pF to this pin. Alternatively, this pin allows direct connection to
                        the ADC input, in which case an external band-pass filter network must be used, as shown in Figure 23.

Pin No. Mnemonic   Description
18      VCC        Power Supply Input. 1.71 V to 5.5 V can be applied to this pin. VCC should be decoupled to ground with low ESR
                   10 µF and 0.1 µF capacitors (see the Supply Decoupling section).
19      AGND       Analog Circuitry Ground Reference Connection.
20      XTAL2      Connection for External 3.6864 MHz Crystal. Do not connect to this pin if using the internal RC oscillator
                   (AD5700-1 only) or an external clock source.
21      XTAL1      Connection for External 3.6864 MHz Crystal or External Clock Source Input. Tie this pin to ground if using the
                   internal RC oscillator (AD5700-1 only).
22      DGND       Digital Circuitry Ground Reference Connection. For typical operation, it is recommended to connect this pin to
                   AGND.
23      REF_EN     Reference Enable. A high state enables the internal 1.5 V reference and buffer. A low state disables the internal
                   reference and input buffer, and a buffered external 2.5 V reference source must be applied at REF. If REF_EN is
                   tied low, VCC must be greater than 2.7 V.
24      FILTER_SEL Band-Pass Filter Select. A high state enables the internal filter and the HART signal should be applied to the
                   HART_IN pin. A low state disables the internal filter and an external band-pass filter must then be connected at
                   the ADC_IP input pin. In this case, the HART signal should be applied to the ADC_IP pin.
EPAD    EPAD       The exposed paddle must be connected to AGND or DGND, or, alternatively, it can be left electrically
                   unconnected. It is recommended that the paddle be thermally connected to a copper plane for enhanced
                   thermal performance.
