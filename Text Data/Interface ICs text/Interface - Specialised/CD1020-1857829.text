interface                                                                                                 CD1020
The CD1020 is a cost optimized switch detection interface device (MSDI)
designed to detect the closing and opening of up to 22 switch contacts. The
switch status, either open or closed, is transferred to the microprocessor unit          MULTIPLE SWITCH DETECTION INTERFACE
(MCU) through a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). This SMARTMOS device also
features a 22-to-1 analog multiplexer for reading the input channels as analog
inputs. The analog selected input signal is buffered and provided on the AMUX
output pin for the MCU to read.
The CD1020 device has two modes of operation, normal and low-power mode
(LPM). Normal mode allows programming of the device and supplies switch
contacts with pull-up or pull-down current as it monitors the change of state on
                                                                                                    ES SUFFIX (PB-FREE)
the switches. The LPM provides low quiescent current, which makes the                                    98ASA00656D
CD1020 ideal for automotive and industrial products requiring low sleep-state                       32-PIN QFN (WF-TYPE)

   6.   Junction temperature is a function of die size, on-chip power dissipation, package thermal resistance, mounting site (board) temperature, ambient
        temperature, air flow, power dissipation of other components on the board, and board thermal resistance.
   7.   Per JEDEC JESD51-2 with natural convection for horizontally oriented board. Board meets JESD51-9 specification for 1s or 2s2p board,
        respectively.
   8.   Thermal resistance between the die and the printed circuit board per JEDEC JESD51-8. Board temperature is measured on the top surface of the
        board near the package.
   9.   Thermal resistance between the die and the solder pad on the bottom of the package based on simulation without any interface resistance.
  10.   Thermal characterization parameter indicating the temperature difference between package top and the junction temperature per JEDEC

5            General description
The CD1020 is designed to detect the closing and opening of up to 22 switch contacts. The switch status, either open or closed, is
transferred to the microprocessor unit (MCU) through a serial peripheral interface (SPI). Individually selectable input currents are available
in normal and low-power (LPM) modes, as needed for the application.
The CD1020 also features a 22-to-1 analog multiplexer for reading inputs as analog. The analog input signal is buffered and provided on
the AMUX output pin for the MCU to read.
The CD1020 has two modes of operation, normal and Low-Power Mode (LPM). Normal mode allows programming of the device and
supplies switch contacts with pull-up or pull-down current as it monitors the change of state of switches. The LPM provides low quiescent
current, which makes the CD1020 ideal for products requiring low sleep-state currents.

6            General IC functional description
The CD1020 device interacts with many connections outside the module and near the end user. The IC detects changes in switch state
and reports the information to the MCU via the SPI protocol. The input pins generally connect to switches located outside the module and
in proximity to battery in car harnesses. Consequently, the IC must have some external protection including an ESD capacitor and series
resistors, to ensure the energy from the various pulses are limited at the IC.
The IC requires a blocking diode be used on the VBATP pin to protect from a reverse battery condition. The inputs are capable of surviving
reverse battery without a blocking diode, due to an internal blocking diode from the input to the power supply (VBATP). This arrangement
ensures that there is no backfeeding of voltage/current into the IC, when the voltage on the input is higher than the VBATP pin.
6.1          Battery voltage ranges
The CD1020 device operates from 6.0 V ≤ VBATP ≤ 36 V and is capable to withstand up to 40 V. Voltages in excess of 40 V must be
clamped externally in order to protect the IC from destruction. The VBATP pin must be isolated from the main battery node by a diode.
6.1.1          Load dump (overvoltage)
During load dump, the CD1020 operates properly up to the VBATP overvoltage. Voltages greater than load dump (~32 V) cause the current
sources to be limited to ~2.0 mA, but the register values are maintained. Upon leaving this overvoltage condition, the original setup is
returned and normal operation begins again.
6.1.2          Jump start (double battery)
During a jump start (double battery) condition, the device functions normally and meets all the specified parametric values. No internal
faults are set and no abnormal operation noted as a result of operating in this range.
6.1.3          Normal battery range
 The normal voltage range is fully functional with all parametrics in the given specification.
6.1.4          Undervoltage
In the undervoltage range, the SPI can work normally, but the device functions are not guaranteed.
6.1.5          Undervoltage lockout
During undervoltage lockout, the MISO output is tri-stated to avoid any data from being transmitted from the CD1020. Any CS_B pulses
are ignored in this voltage range. If the battery enters this range at any point (even during a SPI word), the CD1020 ignores the word and
enters lockout mode. A SPI bit register is available to notify the MCU that the CD1020 has seen an undervoltage lockout condition once
the battery is high enough to leave this range.
6.1.6          Power-On-Reset (POR) activated
The Power-On-Reset is activated when the VBATP is within the 2.7 V to 3.8 V range. During the POR all SPI registers are reset to default
values and SPI operation is disabled. The CD1020 is initialized after the POR is de-asserted. A SPI bit in the device configuration register
is used to note a POR occurrence and all SPI registers are reset to the default values.
6.1.7          No operation
The device does not function and no switch detection is possible.

6.2          Power sequencing conditions
The chip uses two supplies as inputs into the device for various usage. The pins are VBATP and VDDQ. The VBATP pin is the power
supply for the chip where the internal supplies are generated and power supply for the SG circuits. The VDDQ pin is used for the I/O buffer
supply to talk to the MCU or other logic level devices, as well as AMUX. The INT_B pin is held low upon POR until the IC is ready to
operate and communicate. Power can be applied in various ways to the CD1020. The following sections describe the possible states.
6.2.1          VBATP before VDDQ
The normal condition for operation is the application of VBATP and then VDDQ. The chip begins to operate logically in the default state but
without the ability to drive logic pins. When the VDDQ supply is available, the chip is able to communicate correctly. The IC maintains its
logical state (register settings) with functional behavior consistent with logical state. No SPI communications can occur.
6.2.2          VDDQ before VBATP
The VDDQ supply in some cases may be available before the VBATP supply is ready. In this scenario, there is no back feeding current into
the VDDQ pin that could potentially turn on the device into an unknown state. VDDQ is isolated from VBATP circuits and the device is off
until VBATP is applied; when VBATP is available the device powers up the internal rails and logic within tACTIVE time. Communication is
undefined until the tACTIVE time and becomes available after this time frame.
6.2.3          VBATP okay, VDDQ lost
After power up, it is possible that the VDDQ may turn off or be lost. In this case, the chip remains in the current state but is not able to
communicate. After the VDDQ pin is available again, the chip is ready to communicate.
6.2.4          VDDQ okay, VBATP lost
After power up, the VBATP supply could be lost. The operation is consistent as when VDDQ is available before VBATP.

7.1.1         State machine
After power up, the IC enters into the device state machine, as illustrated in Figure 11. The voltage on VBATP begins to power the internal
oscillators and regulator supplies. The POR is based on the internal 2.5 V digital core rail. When the internal logic regulator reaches
approximately 1.8 V (typically 3.3 V on the VBATP node), the IC enters into the UV range. Below the POR threshold, the IC is in RESET
mode where no activity occurs.

7.1.2           UV: undervoltage lockout
After the POR circuit has reset the logic, the IC is in undervoltage. In this state, the IC remembers all register conditions, but is in a lockout
mode, where no SPI communication is allowed. The AMUX is inactive and the current sources are off. The user does not receive a valid
response from the MISO, as it is disabled in this state. The chip oscillators (4.0 MHz for most normal mode activities, 192 kHz for LPM,
and limited normal mode functions) are turned on in the UV state. The chip moves to the Read fuses state when the VBATP voltage rises
above the UV threshold (~4.3 V rising). The internal fuses read in approximately 50 μs and the chip enters the normal mode.
7.1.3           Normal mode
In normal mode, the chip operates as selected in the available registers. Any command may be loaded in normal mode, although not all
(low-power mode) registers are used in the normal mode. All the LPM registers must be programmed in Normal mode as the SPI is not
active in LPM. The normal mode of the chip is used to:
           • Operate the AMUX
           • Communicate via the SPI
           • Interrupt the IC, wetting and sustain currents, and the thresholds available to use
The WAKE_B pin is asserted (low) in normal mode and can be used to enable a power supply (ENABLE_B). Various fault detections are
available in this mode including overvoltage, overtemperature, thermal warning, SPI errors, and Hash faults.
7.1.4           Low-power mode
When the user needs to lower the IC current consumption, a low-power mode is used. The only method to enter LPM is through a SPI
word. After the chip is in low-power mode, the majority of circuitry is turned off including most power rails, the 4.0 MHz oscillator, and all
the fault detection circuits. This mode is the lowest current consumption mode on the chip. If a fault occurs while the chip is in this mode,
the chip does not see or register the fault (does not report via the SPI when awakened). Some items may wake the IC in this mode,
including the interrupt timer, falling edge of INT_B, CS_B, or WAKE_B (configurable), or a comparator-only mode switch detection.
7.1.5           Polling mode
The CD1020 uses a polling mode that periodically (selectable in LPM config register) interrogates the input pins to determine in what state
the pins are, and decides if there was a change of state from when the chip was in normal mode. There are various configurations for this
mode, which allow the user greater flexibility in operation. This mode uses the current sources to pull up (SG) or pull down (SB) to
determine if a switch is open or closed. More information is available in section 7.2, “Low-power mode operation".
In the case of a low VBATP, the polling pauses and waits until the VBATP rises out of UV or a POR occurs. The pause of the polling ensures
all of the internal rails, currents, and thresholds are up at the required levels to accurately detect open or closed switches. The chip does
not wake-up in this condition and simply waits for the VBATP voltage to rise or cause a POR.
After the polling ends, the chip either returns to the low-power mode, or enters normal mode when a wake event is detected. Other events
may wake the chip as well, such as the falling edge of CS_B, INT_B, or WAKE_B (configurable). A comparator only mode switch detection
is always on in LPM or Polling mode, therefore, a change of state for those inputs would effectively wake the IC in Polling mode as well.
If the Wake-up enable bits are disabled on all channels (SG and SP), the device will not wake up with a change of state on any of the
input pins. In this case, the device will disable the polling timer to allow the lowest current consumption during low-power mode.
7.2           Low-power mode operation
Low-power mode (LPM) is used to reduce system quiescent currents. LPM may be entered only by sending the Enter Low-power mode
command. All register settings programmed in normal mode are maintained while in LPM.
The CD1020 exits LPM and enter normal mode when any of the following events occur:
    • Input switch change of state (when enabled)
    • Falling edge of WAKE_B (as set by the device configuration register)
    • Falling edge of INT_B (with VDDQ = 5.0 V)
    • Falling edge of CS_B (with VDDQ = 5.0 V)
    • Power-On-Reset (POR)
The VDDQ supply may be removed from the device during LPM, however removing VDDQ from the device disables a wake-up from falling
edge of INT_B and CS_B. The IC checks the status of VDDQ after a falling edge of WAKE_B (as selected in the device configuration
                                                                                                                                           CD1020
NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                            20


register), INT_B and CS_B. The IC returns to LPM and does not report a Wake event, if VDDQ is low. If the VDDQ is high, the IC wakes up
and reports the Wake event. In cases where CS_B is used to wake the device, the first MISO data message is not valid.
The LPM command contains setting of the polling timer, as shown in Table 23. The polling timer is used periodically to poll the inputs
during low-power mode to check for change of states. The tACTIVEPOLL time is the length of time the part is active during the polling timer
to check for change of state. The low-power mode voltage threshold allows the user to determine the noise immunity versus lower current
levels that polling allows. Figure 13 shows the polling operation.
When an input is determined to meet the condition Open (when entering LPM), yet while Open (on polling event) the chip does not
continue the polling event for that input(s) to lower current in the chip (Figure 12 shows SG, SB is logically the same).

7.3         Input functional block
The SGx pins are switch-to-ground inputs only (pull-up current sources).
The SPx pins are configurable as either switch-to-ground or switch-to-battery (pull-up and pull-down current sources).
The input is compared with a 4.0 V (input comparator threshold configurable) reference. Voltages greater than the input comparator
threshold value are considered open for SG pins and closed for SB configuration.
Voltages less than the input comparator threshold value are considered closed for SG pins and open for the SB configurations.
Programming features are defined in the SPI control register definition section of this data sheet.
The input comparator has hysteresis with the thresholds based on the closing of the switch (falling on SG, rising on SB).
The user must take care to keep power conditions within acceptable limits (package is capable of 2.0 W). Using many of the inputs with
continuous wetting current levels causes overheating of the IC and may cause an overtemperature (OT) event to occur.

7.4         Oscillator and timer control functional block
Two oscillators are generated in this block. A 4.0 MHz clock is used in normal mode only, as well as a low-power mode 192 kHz clock,
which is on all the time. All timers are generated from these oscillators. The oscillator accuracy is 15 % for both, the 4.0 MHz clock and
the 192 kHz clock. No calibration is needed and the accuracy is over voltage and temperature.
                                                                                                                                    CD1020

7.5          Temperature monitor and control functional block
The device has multiple thermal limit (tLIM) cells to detect thermal excursions in excess of 155 °C. The tLIM cells from various locations on
the IC are logically ORed together and communicated to the MCU as one tLIM fault. When the tLIM value is seen, the wetting current is
lowered to 2.0 mA until the temperature has decreased beyond the tLIM(HYS) value (the sustain current remains on or as selected). A
hysteresis value of 15 °C exists to keep the device from cycling.
 A thermal flag also exists to alert the system to increasing temperatures more than approximately 120 °C.
7.6          WAKE_B control functional block
The WAKE_B pin can operate as an open-drain output or a wake-up input. In the normal mode, the WAKE_B pin is LOW. In the low-
power mode, the WAKE_B pin is pulled HIGH. The WAKE_B pin has an internal pull-up to VDDQ supply with an internal series diode to
allow an external pull-up to VBATP if required.
As an input, in low-power mode with the WAKE_B pin pulled HIGH, when commanded LOW by MCU, the falling edge of WAKE_B places
the CD1020 in normal mode. In low-power mode if VDDQ goes low, the WAKE_B pin can still wake the device based on the status of the
WAKE_B bit in the device configuration register, this allows the user to pull the WAKE_B pin up to VBATP such that it can be used in
VDDQ off setup.
As an output, WAKE_B pin can drive either an MCU input or the EnableB of a regulator (possibly for VDDQ). WAKE_B is driven low during
normal mode regardless of the state of VDDQ. When the CD1020 is in LPM, the WAKE_B pin is released and is expected to be pulled up
internally to VDDQ or externally to VBATP. When a valid wake-up event is detected, the CD1020 wakes up from LPM and the WAKE_B is
driven Low (regardless of the state of VDDQ).
7.7          INT_B functional block
INT_B is an input/output pin in the CD1020 device to indicate an interrupt event has occurred, as well as receiving interrupts from other
devices when the INT_B pins are wired ORed. The INT_B pin is an open-drain output with an internal pull-up to VDDQ. In normal mode,
a switch state change triggers the INT_B pin (when enabled). The INT_B pin and INT_B bit in the SPI register are latched on the falling
edge of CS_B. This permits the MCU to determine the origin of the interrupt. When two CD1020 devices are used, only the device initiating
the interrupt has the INT_B bit set. The INT_B pin and INTflg bit are cleared 1.0 μs after the falling edge of CS B. The INT_B pin does not
clear with the rising edge of CS_B if a switch contact change has occurred while CS_B was Low.
In a multiple CD1020 device system with WAKE_B High and VDDQ on (low-power mode), the falling edge of INT_B places the device in
normal mode. The INT_B has the option of a pulsed output (pulsed low for INTpulse duration) or a latched low output. The default case is
the latched low operation; the pulsed option is selectable via the SPI.
An INT_B request by the MCU can be done by a SPI word and results in an INTPULSE of 100 μs duration on the INT_B pin.
The chip causes an INT_B assertion for the following cases:
          • A change of state is detected
          • Any Wake-up event
          • Any faults detected
          • After a POR, the INT_B pin states asserted during startup until the chip is ready to communicate
7.8          AMUX functional block
The analog voltage-on-switch inputs may be read by the MCU using the analog command. See Table 36. Internal to the IC is a 22-to-1
analog multiplexer. The voltage present on the selected input pin is buffered and made available on the AMUX output pin. The output pin
is clamped to a maximum of VDDQ, regardless of the higher voltages present on the input pin. After an input has been selected as the
analog, the corresponding bit in the next MISO data stream is logic [0]. When selecting a channel to be read as analog input, the user can
also set the current level allowed in the AMUX output. Current level can be set to the programmed wetting current for the selected channel
or set to high impedance as defined in Table 35.
When selecting an input to be sent to the AMUX output, that input is not polled or a wake-up enabled input from low-power mode. The
user should set the AMUX to ‘No input selected’ before entering low-power mode. The AMUX pin is not active during low-power mode.

7.9          Serial peripheral interface (SPI)
The CD1020 contains a serial peripheral interface consisting of Serial Clock (SCLK), Serial Data Out (MISO), Serial Data In (MOSI), and
Chip Select Bar (CS_B). The SPI interface is used to provide configuration, control, and status functions; the user may read the registers’
contents as well as read some status bits of the IC. This device is configured as a SPI slave.
All SPI transmissions to the CD1020 must be done in exact increments of 32 bits (modulo 0 is ignored as well). The CD1020 contains a
data valid method via SCLK input to keep non-modulo 32-bit transmissions from being written into the IC. The SPI module also provides
a daisy chain capability to accommodate MOSI to MISO wrap around (see Figure 20).
The SPI registers have a hashing technique to ensure that the registers are consistent with the programmed values. If the hashed value
does not match the register status, a SPI bit is set as well as an interrupt to alert the MCU to this issue.
7.9.1           Chip select low (CS_B)
The CS_B input selects this device for serial transfers. On the falling edge of CS_B, the MISO pin is released from tri-state mode, and all
status information are latched in the SPI shift register. While CS_B is asserted, register data is shifted in the MOSI pin and shifted out the
MISO pin on each subsequent SCLK. On the rising edge of CS_B, the MISO pin is tri-stated and the fault register reloaded (latched) with
the current filtered status data. To allow sufficient time to reload the fault registers, the CS_B pin must remain low for a minimum of tCSN
prior to going high again.
The CS_B input contains a pull-up current source to VDDQ to command the de-asserted state should an open-circuit condition occur.
This pin has threshold compatible voltages allowing proper operation with microprocessors using a 3.3 V to 5.0 V supply.
7.9.2           Serial clock (SCLK)
The SCLK input is the clock signal input for synchronization of serial data transfer. This pin has threshold-compatible voltages allowing
proper operation with microprocessors using a 3.3 V to 5.0 V supply.
When CS_B is asserted, both the Master Microprocessor and this device latch input data on the rising edge of SCLK. The SPI master
typically shifts data out on the falling edge of SCLK, while this device shifts data out on the rising edge of SCLK, to allow more time to
drive the MISO pin to the proper level.
This input is used as the input for the modulo 32-bit counter validation. Any SPI transmissions which are NOT exact multiples of 32 bits
(i.e. clock edges) is treated as an illegal transmission. The entire frame is aborted and no information is changed in the configuration or
control registers.
7.9.3           Serial data output (MISO)
The MISO output pin is in a tri-state condition when CS_B is negated. When CS_B is asserted, MISO is driven to the state of the MSB of
the internal register and start shifting out the requested data from the MSB to the LSB. This pin supplies a ‘rail to rail’ output, depending
on the voltage at the VDDQ pin.
7.9.4           Serial data input (MOSI)
The MOSI input takes data from the master microprocessor while CS_B is asserted. The MSB is the first bit of each word received on
MOSI and the LSB is the last bit of each word received on MOSI. This pin has threshold-level compatible input voltages allowing proper
operation with microprocessors using a 3.3 V to 5.0 V (VDDQ) supply.

A 32-bit SPI allows the system microprocessor to configure the CD1020 for each input as well as read out the status of each input. The
SPI also allows the Fault Status and INTflg bits to be read via the SPI. The SPI MOSI bit definitions are given in Table 8:

The 32-bit SPI word consists of a command word (8-bit) and three configure words (24-bit). The 8-MSB bits are the command bits that
select what type of configuration is to occur. The remaining 24-bits are used to select the inputs to be configured.
   • Bit 31 – 24 = Command word: Use to select what configuration is to occur (example: setting wake-up enable command)
   • Bit 23 – 0 = SGn input select word: Use these bits in conjunction with the command word to determine which input is set up.
Configuration registers may be read or written to. To read the contents of a configuration register, send the register address + ‘0’ on the
LSB of the command word; the contents of the corresponding register will be shifted out of the MISO buffer in the next SPI cycle. When
a Read command is sent. The answer (in the next SPI transaction) includes the Register address in the upper byte (see Figure 19).
Read example:
   • Send 0x0C00_0000 Receive: 8000_0000 (for example after a POR)
   • Send 0x0000_0000 Receive: 0C00_0000 (address + register data)
The first response from the device after a POR event is a Read Status register (0x3Exxxxxx where x is the status of the inputs). This is
the same for exiting the low-power mode (see Figure 17).

To write into a configuration register, send the register Address + ‘1’ on the LSB of the command word and the configuration data on the
next 24 bits. The new value of the register will be shifted out of the MISO buffer in the next SPI cycle, along with the register address.

7.10.1         SPI check
The MCU may check the communication with the IC by using the SPI Check register. The MCU sends the command, and the response
during the next SPI transaction will be 0x123456. The SPI Check command does not return Fault Status or INTflg bit, thus interrupts will
not be cleared.

7.10.2         Device configuration register
The device has various configuration settings that are global in nature. The configuration settings are as follows:
• When the CD1020 is in the overvoltage region, a Logic [0] on the VBATP OV bit limits the wetting current on all input channels to 2 mA,
   and the CD1020 will not be able to enter into the low-power mode. A Logic [1] allows the device to operate normally even in the
   overvoltage region. The OV flag will be set when the device enters in the OV region, regardless of the value of the VBATP OV bit.
• WAKE_B can be used to enable an external power supply regulator to supply the VDDQ voltage rail. When the WAKE_B VDDQ check
   bit is a Logic [0], the WAKE_B pin is expected to be pulled up internally or externally to VDDQ and VDDQ is expected to go low,
   therefore, the CD1020 does not wake up on the falling edge of WAKE_B. A Logic [1], assumes the user is using an external pull-up to
   VBATP or VDDQ (when VDDQ is not expected to be off) and the IC wakes up on a falling edge of WAKE_B.
• INT_B out is used to select how the INT_B pin operates when an interrupt occurs. The IC is able to pulse low [1] or latch low [0].
• Inputs SP0-7 may be programmable for switch-to-battery or switch-to-ground. These input types are defined using the settings
   command. To set a SPn input for switch-to-battery, a logic [1] for the appropriate bit must be set. To set a SPn input for switch-to-
   ground, a logic [0] for the appropriate bit must be set. The MCU may change or update the programmable switch register via software
   at any time in normal mode. Regardless of the setting, when the SPn input switch is closed a logic [1] is placed in the serial output
   response register.

7.10.3          Tri-state SP register
The tri-state command is use to set the input nodes as high-impedance (Table 13). By setting the tri-state register bit to logic [1], the input
is high-impedance regardless of the Wetting current setting. The configurable comparator (4.0 V default) on each input remains active.
The MCU may change or update the tri-state register via software at any time in normal mode. The tri-state register defaults to 1 (inputs
are tri-stated). Any inputs in tri-state are still polled in LPM, but the current source is not active during this time. The determination of
change of state occurs at the end of the tACTIVEPOLL and the wake-up decision is made.

7.10.8         Continuous wetting current SP register
Each switch input has a designated 20 ms timer. The timer starts when the specific switch input crosses the comparator threshold. When
the 20 ms timer expires, the contact current is reduced from the configured wetting current (16 mA) to the Sustain current. The wetting
current is defined to be an elevated level that reduces to the lower sustain current level after the timer has expired. With multiple wetting
current timers disabled, power dissipation for the IC must be considered.
The MCU may change or update the continuous wetting current register via software at any time in normal mode. This allows the MCU to
control the amount of time wetting current is applied to the switch contact. Programming the continuous wetting current bit to logic [0]
operates normally with a higher wetting current followed by sustain current after 20 ms (pulsed Wetting current operation). Programming
to logic [1] enables the continuous wetting current (Table 19) and results in a full time wetting current level. The continuous wetting current
register defaults to 0 (pulse wetting current operation).

7.10.13 Wake-up enable register SP
The wake-up register defines the inputs that are allowed to wake the CD1020 from low-power mode. Programming the wake-up bit to
logic [0] disables the specific input from waking the IC (Table 25). Programming the wake-up bit to logic [1] enables the specific input to
wake-up with switch change of state The MCU may change or update the wake-up register via software at any time in normal mode. The
Wake-up register defaults to logic [1] (wake-up enabled). If all channels (SG and SB) have the Wake-up bit disabled, the device disables
the polling timer to reduce the current consumption during low-power mode.

7.10.15 Comparator only SP
The comparator only register allows the input comparators to be active during LPM with no polling current. In this case, the inputs can
receive a digital signal on the order of the LPM clock cycle and wake-up on a change of state. This register is intended to be used for
signals that are driven by an external chip and drive to 5.0 V.

7.10.16 Comparator only SG
The comparator only register allows the input comparators to be active during LPM with no polling current. In this case, the inputs can
receive a digital signal on the order of the LPM clock cycle and wake-up on a change of state. This register is intended to be used for
signals that are driven by an external chip and drive to 5.0 V.

7.10.17 LPM voltage threshold SP configuration
The CD1020 is able to use different voltage thresholds to wake-up from LPM. When configured as SG, a Logic [0] means the input will
use the LPM delta voltage threshold to determine the state of the switch. A Logic [1] means the input uses the Normal threshold (VICTHR)
to determine the state of the switch. When configured as an SB, it only uses the 4.0 V threshold regardless of the status of the LPM voltage
threshold bit. The user must ensure that the correct current level is set to allow the crossing of the normal mode threshold (typically 4.0 V).

7.10.21 Enter low-power mode
Low-power mode (LPM) is used to reduce system quiescent currents. Low-power mode may be entered only by sending the low-power
command. When returning to normal mode, all register settings is maintained.
The Enter Low-power mode register is write only and has the effect of going to LPM and beginning operation as selected (polling, interrupt
timer). When returning form low-power mode, the first SPI transaction will return the Fault Status and the intflg bit set to high, as well as
the actual status of the Input pins.

7.10.22 AMUX control register
The analog voltage on switch inputs may be read by the MCU using the analog command (Table 34). Internal to the CD1020 is a 22-to-1
analog multiplexer. The voltage present on the selected input pin is buffered and made available on the AMUX output pin. The AMUX
output pin is clamped to a maximum of VDDQ volts regardless of the higher voltages present on the input pin. After an input has been
selected as the analog, the corresponding bit in the next MISO data stream is logic [0].
Setting the current to wetting current (configurable) may be useful for reading sensor inputs. The MCU may change or update the analog
select register via software at any time in normal mode. The analog select defaults to no input.

7.10.23 Read switch status
The Read switch status register is used to determine the state of each of the inputs and is read only. All of the inputs (SGn and SPn) are
returned after the next command is sent. A Logic [1] means the switch is closed while a Logic [0] is an open switch.
Included in the status register are two more bits, the Fault Status bit and intflg bit. The Fault Status bit is a combination of the extended
status bits and the wetting current fault bits. If any of these bits are set, the Fault Status bit is set. The intflg bit is set when an interrupt
occurs on this device.
After POR, both the Fault Status bit and the intflg bit are set high to indicate an interrupt due to a POR occurring. The intflg bit will be
cleared upon reading the Read Switch Status register, and the Fault Status bit will remain high until the Fault status register is read and
thus the POR fault bit and all other fault flags are cleared.
The Fault Status and Intflg bits are semi-global flags, if a fault or an interrupt occurs, these bit will be returned after writing or reading any
command, except for the SPICheck and the Wetting Current configuration registers, which use those bits to set/display the device
configuration.

                                                  STATUS
The fault/status diagnostic capability consists of one internal 24-bit register. The content of the fault/status register is shown in Table 38.
Bits 0 – 21 show the status of each input where logic [1] is a closed switch and logic [0] is an open switch. In addition to input status
information, fault status such as die over-temp, Hash fault, SPI errors, as well as interrupts are reported.
A SPI read cycle is initiated by a CS_B logic ‘1’ to ‘0’ transition, followed by 32 SCLK cycles to shift the fault/status registers out the MISO
pin. The INT_B pin is cleared 1.0 ms after the falling edge of CS_B. The fault is immediately set again if the fault condition is still present.
The Fault Status bit sets any time a Fault occurs, and the Fault register (Table 39) must be read in order to clear the Fault status flag.
The intflg bit sets anytime an interrupt event occurs (change of state on switch, any fault status bit gets set). Any SPI message that will
return intflg bit will clear this flag, even if the event is still occurring. For example an overtemp, will cause an interrupt. The interrupt can
be cleared but the chip will not interrupt again, based on the overtemp until that fault has gone away.

7.10.25 Interrupt request
The MCU may request an Interrupt pulse of duration 100 μs by sending the Interrupt request command. After an Interrupt request
command, the CD1020 returns the Interrupt request command word, as well as the Fault status and INTflg bits set if a fault/interrupt event
occurred. Sending an interrupt request command does not set the INTflg bit itself.

8.3           Abnormal operation
 The CD1020 could be subject to various conditions considered abnormal as defined within this section.
8.3.1          Reverse battery
This device with applicable external components will not be damaged by exposure to reverse battery conditions of –14 V. This test is
performed for a period of one minute at 25 °C. In addition, this negative voltage condition does not force any of the logic level I/O pins to
a negative voltage less than –0.6 V at 10 mA or to a positive voltage greater the 5.0 V. This ensures protection of the digital device
interfacing with this device.
8.3.2          Ground offset
The applicable driver outputs and/or current sense inputs are capable of operation with a ground offset of ±1.0 V. The device will not be
damaged by exposure to this condition and will maintain specified functionality. AMUX output voltage deviates when there are negative
ground offsets on other SGx/SPx pins.
8.3.3          Shorts to ground
All I/Os of the device that are available at the module connector are protected against shorts to ground with maximum ground offset
considered, i.e. –1.0 V referenced to device ground or other application specific value. The device will not be damaged by this condition.
8.3.4          Shorts to battery
All I/Os of the device that are available at the module connector are protected against a short to battery (voltage value is application
dependent, there may be cases where short to jump start or load dump voltage values are required). The device will not be damaged by
this condition.
8.3.5          Unpowered shorts to battery
All I/Os of the device that are available at the module connector are protected against unpowered (battery to the module is open) shorts
to battery per application specifics. The device will not be damaged by this condition, will not enable any outputs nor backfeed onto the
power rails (VBATP, VDDQ) or the digital I/O pins.
8.3.6          Loss of module ground
The definition of a loss of ground condition at the device level is that all pins of the IC detects very low impedance-to-battery. The
nomenclature is suited to a test environment. In the application, a loss of ground condition results in all I/O pins floating to battery voltage,
while all externally referenced I/O pins are, at worst case, pulled to ground. All applicable driver outputs and current sense inputs are
protected against excessive leakage current due to loads that are referenced to an external ground (high-side drivers).
8.3.7          Loss of module battery
The loss of battery condition at the parts level is that the power input pins of the IC see infinite impedance to the battery supply voltage
(depending upon the application) but there is some undefined impedance looking from these pins to ground. All applicable driver outputs
and current sense inputs are protected against excessive leakage current due to loads that are referenced to an external battery
