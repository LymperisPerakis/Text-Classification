                  Rev. 5 — 5 June 2014                                               Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PTN3392 is a DisplayPort to VGA adapter IC designed to connect a DisplayPort
              source to a VGA sink. The PTN3392 integrates a DisplayPort receiver and a high-speed
              triple video digital-to-analog converter that supports display resolutions from VGA to
              WUXGA (see Table 5). The PTN3392 supports either one or two DisplayPort v1.1a lanes
              operating at either 2.7 Gbit/s or 1.62 Gbit/s per lane. The PTN3392 has ‘Flash-over-AUX’
              capability enabling simple firmware upgradability in the field.
              The PTN3392 supports I2C-bus over AUX per DisplayPort v1.1a specification (Ref. 1),
              and bridges the VESA DDC channel to the DisplayPort Interface.
              The PTN3392 is designed for single supply and minimizes application costs. It can be
              powered directly from the DisplayPort source side 3.3 V supply without a need for
              additional core voltage regulator. The VGA output is powered down when there is no valid
              DisplayPort source data being transmitted. The PTN3392 also aids in monitor detection
              by performing load sensing and reporting sink connection status to the source.

7. Functional description
                       Referring to Figure 1 “Functional diagram”, the PTN3392 converts the DisplayPort
                       AC-coupled high-speed differential signaling protocol into a VESA VSIS 1.2 compliant
                       analog VGA signaling. The PTN3392 integrates a DisplayPort receiver (according to
                       VESA DisplayPort v1.1a specification, Ref. 1) and a high-speed triple 8-bit video
                       digital-to-analog converter that supports display resolution from VGA to WUXGA (see
                       Table 5 “Display resolution and pixel clock rate[1]”), up to a pixel clock rate of 240 MHz.
                       The PTN3392 supports one or two DisplayPort v1.1a Main Link lanes operating at either
                       in 2.7 Gbit/s or 1.62 Gbit/s per lane. The PTN3392 can drive up to 100 feet of analog
                       video cable.
                       The DisplayPort receiver comprises the following functional blocks:
                         •  Main Link
                         •  AUX CH (Auxiliary Channel)
                         •  DPCD (DisplayPort Configuration Data)
                         •  Monitor detection
                         •  EDID handling
                         •  Video DAC
                       The RGB video data with corresponding synchronization references is extracted from the
                       main stream video data. Main stream video attribute information is also extracted. This
                       information is inserted once per video frame during the vertical blanking period by the
                       DisplayPort source. The attributes describe the main video stream format in terms of
                       geometry, timing, and color format. The original clock and video stream are derived from
                       these main link data.
                       The PTN3392 internal DPCD registers can be accessed by the source via the auxiliary
                       channel. The monitor’s DDC control bus may also be controlled via the auxiliary channel.
                       A bridging conversion block translates the input DisplayPort auxiliary channel signals from
                       the source side to the DDC signals on the sink side. The PTN3392 passes through
                       sink-side status change (e.g., hot-plug events) to the source side, through HPD interrupts
                       and DPCD registers.
                   7.1 DisplayPort Main Link
                       The DisplayPort main link consists of doubly terminated, AC-coupled differential pair. The
                       50  internally calibrated termination resistors are integrated inside PTN3392.
                       The PTN3392 supports HBR at 2.7 Gbit/s and RBR at 1.62 Gbit/s per lane.
                   7.2 DisplayPort auxiliary channel
                       The AUX CH is a half-duplex, bidirectional channel between DisplayPort transmitter and
                       receiver. It consists of one differential pair transporting self-clocked data at 1 Mbit/s. The
                       PTN3392 integrates the AUX CH replier (or slave), and responds to transactions initiated
                       by the DisplayPort source AUX CH requester (or master).
                       The AUX CH uses the Manchester-II code for the self-clocked transmission of signals;
                       every ‘zero’ is represented by LOW-to-HIGH transition, and ‘one’ represented by
                       HIGH-to-LOW transition, in the middle of the bit time.

                     7.3 DPCD registers
                          DPCD registers that are part of the VESA DisplayPort v1.1a are described in detail in
                          Ref. 1. The following paragraphs only describe the specific implementation by PTN3392.
                          The PTN3392 DisplayPort receiver capability and status information about the link are
                          reported by DisplayPort Configuration Data (DPCD) registers, when a DisplayPort source
                          issues a read command on the AUX CH. The DisplayPort source device can also write to
                          the link configuration field of DPCD to configure and initialize the link. The DPCD is
                          DisplayPort v1.1a compliant.
                          It is the responsibility of the host to only issue commands within the capability of the
                          PTN3392 as defined in the ‘Receiver Capability Field’ in order to prevent undefined
                          behavior. PTN3392 specific DPCD registers are listed in Table 4.

                7.3.2 I2C over AUX CH registers
               7.3.2.1 I2C-bus speed control register (read only, 0000Ch)
                       Bit or bits are set to indicate I2C-bus speed control capabilities.
                       DisplayPort source reads register 0000Ch and sets the I2C-bus speed according to the
                       DPCD register 00109h setting. The PTN3392 then adapts its I2C-bus bit rate to the speed
                       set by the DisplayPort source.
               7.3.2.2 I2C-bus speed control/status register (read/write, 00109h)
                       Bit values in this register are assigned to I2C-bus speeds.
                       Prior to software writing to this register, PTN3392 defaults to the I2C-bus speed (either
                       50 kbit/s or 10 kbit/s) selected by the S2 pin (Table 3).
                       On read, the PTN3392 returns a value set to indicate the speed currently in use.
                       On write, software provides a mask to limit the speeds to be enabled:
                         • The PTN3392 uses the slowest speed enabled by the mask and the PTN3392 speed
                            capabilities.
                         • If the result of the mask with the speed capabilities is 0000 0000b, then the PTN3392
                            keeps the S2 setting I2C-bus speed that it is using before the software write (i.e., no
                            change).
                       Some specific examples are listed below for clarification purposes:
                         • If the source writes 1111 1111b, the PTN3392 uses the lowest speed of 1 kbit/s.
                         • If the source writes 0000 1100b, the PTN3392 uses the lower of 10 kbit/s and
                            100 kbit/s, i.e., 10 kbit/s.
                         • If the source writes 0011 0000b, the PTN3392 would stay using the same I2C-bus
                            speed that it is using before the software write (i.e., no change).
                       For DDC communication, the PTN3392 generates defer responses to the source while the
                       I2C-bus transfer is taking place as specified in the DisplayPort standard v1.1a. Note that
                       when the I2C-bus bit rate is set to 1 kbit/s, each bit takes 1 ms. One byte including
                       I2C_ACK takes 9 ms. Given this, the DisplayPort source should expect over
                       20 I2C_DEFER’s when requesting to read a byte over I2C-bus at the slowest rate.

                                                                                                                    2-lane DisplayPort to VGA adapter IC
                   7.4 Monitor detection
                          The PTN3392 assumes 75  double termination, as shown in Figure 6. The load sensing
                          circuit of the PTN3392 senses a 37.5  or 75  termination respectively, when the
                          monitor is connected or disconnected. The load-sensing circuit is active during the vertical
                          blanking period (never during the horizontal retrace period), so that there is no
                          disturbance to the screen image caused by the load-sensing circuit.
                          Upon detection of an RGB monitor being connected, the PTN3392 dynamically updates
                          DPCD register 00200h and 00204h, to indicate the presence of a sink device being
                          connected (see Section 7.3). After updating the DPCD register 00200h, the PTN3392
                          generates an IRQ request on HPD.
                          The PTN3392 implements two different ways to handle the HPD signal. The HPD
                          behavior is governed by the S0 pin value after the reset and initialization sequence is
                          completed (see Figure 3).
                             • If S0 is tied LOW, HPD is driven HIGH irrespective of whether a VGA monitor is
                                 detected.
                             • If S0 pin is tied HIGH, HPD is only driven HIGH when a monitor is detected.
                             S0 = LOW                                                                                     S0 = HIGH

                                                                                                                   2-lane DisplayPort to VGA adapter IC
                7.4.1 S0 = logic 0
                       If S0 is left open-circuit (internal pull-down) (DisplayPort v1.1a compliant behavior),
                       PTN3392 behaves as stated in VESA DisplayPort v1.1a, sections 7 and 8. PTN3392 will
                       keep HPD LOW during its internal initialization sequence after power-up. It will then
                       update DPCD register SINK_COUNT to the expected value, depending if a VGA monitor
                       is detected or not, and will then assert HPD HIGH whatever is the value of SINK_COUNT
                       register. Each time PTN3392 detects a change in the VGA monitor connection status, it
                       updates the SINK_COUNT register accordingly, set
                       DOWNSTREAM_PORT_STATUS_CHANGED register bit to 1 and generate IRQ_HPD
                       pulse to signal the source about the status change. Refer to Figure 3, S0 = LOW
                       flowchart.
                7.4.2 S0 = logic 1
                       If S1 is tied to HIGH with external pull-up (best interoperability behavior), the PTN3392 will
                       keep HPD LOW during its internal initialization sequence after power-up. It then waits for
                       a VGA monitor to be connected downstream before asserting HPD HIGH to force source
                       waiting for a VGA monitor before starting protocol negotiations. If a VGA monitor is
                       disconnected during normal operations, PTN3392 asserts HPD LOW so that the source
                       considers that no sink device is connected anymore. Refer to Figure 3, S0 = HIGH
                       flowchart.
                   7.5 EDID handling
                       Figure 4 shows a DisplayPort-to-analog video converter (or dongle) situated between the
                       DisplayPort source and a VGA monitor. The PTN3392 converts a DP I2C Over AUX
                       request to I2C on the monitor's DDC bus. The monitor's EDID read data is then returned to
                       the DP source via an I2C Over AUX response issued by the PTN3392.
                       It is the responsibility of the source to choose only video modes which are declared in the
                       EDID and to adjust the DisplayPort link capabilities (link rate and lane count) to provide
                       the necessary video bandwidth. The PTN3392 does not cache or modify the EDID to
                       match the capabilities of the DisplayPort link data.
                       If the DisplayPort source drives display modes that are not specified in the EDID mode
                       list, the PTN3392 does not detect such conditions, and displays at its output what it is
                       presented by the DisplayPort source.
                                                                              DisplayPort to VGA adapter IC                                  sink device

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                      PTN3392
                                                                                                               2-lane DisplayPort to VGA adapter IC
                   7.6 Triple 8-bit video DACs and VGA outputs
                       The triple 8-bit video DACs output a 700 mV (peak-to-peak) analog video output signal
                       into 37.5  load, as is the case of a doubly terminated 75  cable. The DAC is capable of
                       supporting the maximum pixel rate supported by a two-lane DP link (240 MHz).
                       The PTN3392 generates the RGB video timing and synchronization signals, RGB signals
                       are then sent to the DACs for conversion to analog signals.
                7.6.1 DAC reference resistor
                       An external reference resistor must be connected between pin RSET and analog ground.
                       This resistor sets the reference current which determines the analog output level, and is
                       specified as 1.2 k with a 1 % tolerance. This value allows a 0.7 V (peak-to-peak) output
                       into a 37.5  load, such as a double-terminated 75  coaxial cable.
8. Power-up and reset
                       PTN3392 has built-in power-on reset circuitry which automatically sequences the part
                       through reset and initialization.
                       For proper behavior, a capacitor should be connected from the RESET_N pin to ground to
                       slow down the internal reset pulse; 1 F capacitance is recommended.
                       Before link is established, the PTN3392 holds VSYNC and HSYNC signals LOW and
                       blanks the RGB signals.
                       While the PTN3392 performs initialization,
                         • The HPD signal is driven LOW, to indicate to the DisplayPort source that the
                            PTN3392 is not ready for link communication
                         • The RED, GRN, BLU and complementary outputs (RED_N, GRN_N, BLU_N) are
                            disabled
                         • The VSYNC and HSYNC outputs are driven LOW

                               We recommend the DAC outputs to use 75  double termination. Figure 6 shows an
                               example of VGA dongle application. A 75  termination is used to terminate inside the
                               dongle, and another 75  termination is typically used inside the RGB monitor. The load
                               sensing mechanism assumes this double termination.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 9) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 17 and 18

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 9.
