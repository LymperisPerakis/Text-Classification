contacts. The switch status, either open or closed, is transferred to the
microprocessor unit (MCU) through a serial peripheral interface (SPI).
The device also features a 22-to-1 analog multiplexer for reading
inputs as analog.
The 33975 device has two modes of operation, Normal and Sleep.
Normal mode allows programming of the device and supplies switch
contacts with pull-up or pull-down current as it monitors the switch
change of state. The Sleep mode provides low quiescent current,
which makes the 33975 ideal for automotive and industrial products
requiring low sleep state currents.
Improvements are a programmable interrupt timer for Sleep mode that
can be disabled, switch detection currents of 32 mA and 4.0 mA for                         EK SUFFIX (PB-FREE)
switch-to-ground inputs, and an interrupt bit that can be reset. This                          98ASA10556D
device is powered using SMARTMOS technology.                                                  32-PIN SOICW EP

 Notes
   13.   These parameters are guaranteed by design. Production test equipment uses 4.16 MHz, 5.0V SPI interface.
   14.   This parameter is guaranteed by design but not production tested.
   15.   Rise and Fall time of incoming SI, CS, and SCLK signals suggested for design consideration to prevent the occurrence of double pulsing.
   16.   Time required for valid output status data to be available on the SO pin.
   17.   Time required for output states data to be terminated at the SO pin.
   18.   Time required to obtain valid data out from SO following the rise of SCLK with a 200pF load.

WETTING CURRENT REGISTER
The 33975 has two levels of switch-to-ground contact
current, 32 and 4.0 mA, and two levels of switch-to-battery
contact current, 16 and 2.0 mA (see Figure 11). The metallic
command is used to set the switch contact current level (refer                         Switch Contact Voltage
to Table 8). Programming the metallic bit to logic [0] will set
the switch wetting current to 2.0 mA/4.0 mA. Programming
the metallic bit to logic [1] will set the switch contact wetting
current to 16 mA/32 mA. The MCU may change or update the

Wetting current is designed to provide higher levels of current
during switch closure. The higher level of current is designed                                        4.0 mA Switch Sustain Current
to keep switch contacts from building up oxides that form on
