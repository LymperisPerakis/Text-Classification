NCN5150
Wired M-BUS Slave
Transceiver
Description
   The NCN5150 is a single-chip integrated slave transceiver for use in
two-wire Meter Bus (M-BUS) slave devices and repeaters. The
transceiver provides all of the functions needed to satisfy the                           www.onsemi.com
European Standards EN 13757−2 and EN 1434−3 describing the
physical layer requirements for M-BUS. It includes a programmable
power level of up to 2 (SOIC version) or 6 (NQFP version) unit loads,
which are available for use in external circuits through a 3.3 V LDO
regulator.                                                                      NQFP−20                          SOIC−16

Furthermore, the ratio CSTC/CVDD must be larger than 9.
The voltage on the STC pin is clamped to VSTC, clamp by a
shunt regulator, which will dissipate any excess current that                                                               t

respond to the correct voltage levels. The NCN5150 will still                    −
be powered from the bus, but all communication will be
translated to the voltage level of VIO.

backup when the bus power supply fails, a PMOS transistor                                                           TX

to less than VT will the NCN5150 detect communication. A         M-BUS standard, RRIS should be 100 W. A simplified
simplified schematic of the receiver is shown in Figure 8.       schematic of the transmitter is shown in Figure 11.
The received data is transmitted on the pins TX and TXI, as
shown in the waveforms of Figure 7.
   An external capacitor must be connected to the SC pin to
store the mark voltage level. This capacitor is charged to VB.
Discharging of this capacitor is typically 40x slower, so that
the voltage on SC drops only a little during the time the
master is transmitting a space. The value of CSC must be
chosen it the range of 100 nF−330 nF.
