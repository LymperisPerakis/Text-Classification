3.1        Overview
           The L9659 is an integrated circuit to be used in air bag systems. Its main functions include
           deployment of air bags. The L9659 supports 8 deployment loops.
3.2        General functions
3.2.1      Power on reset (POR)
           The ASIC has a power on reset (POR) circuit, which monitors VDD voltage. When VDD
           voltage falls below VRST1 for longer than or equal to tPOR, all outputs are disabled and all
           internal registers are reset to their default condition. A second reset level, VRST2, also
           monitors VDD but uses no filter time and will disable all outputs and all internal registers are
           reset to their default condition when VDD falls below the reset threshold.

3.2.2      RESETB
           The RESETB pin is active low. The effects of RESETB are similar to those of a POR event,
           except during a deployment. When a deployment is in-progress, the L9659 will ignore the
           RESETB signal.
           However, it will shut itself down as soon as it detects a POR condition. When the
           deployment is completed and RESETB signal is asserted, the L9659 disables its outputs
           and reset its internal registers to their default states.
           A de-glitch timer is provided for the RESETB pin. The timer protects this pin against
           spurious glitches. The L9659 neglects RESETB signal if it is asserted for shorter than
           tGLITCH. RESETB has an internal pull-up in case of an open circuit.

Functional description                                                                                 L9659
3.2.3       Reference resistor
            IREF pin shall be connected to VDD supply through a resistor, RIREF. When the L9659
            detects the resistor on IREF pin is larger than RIREF_H or smaller than RIREF_L, it goes
            into a reset condition. All outputs are disabled and all internal registers are reset to their
            default conditions.
3.2.4       Loss of ground
            GND
            When the GND pin is disconnected from PC-board ground, the L9659 goes in reset
            condition. All outputs are disabled and all internal registers are reset to their default
            conditions.
            GND0-GND7
            A loss of power-ground (GND0 – GND7) pin/s disables the respective low side driver/s on
            SQLx. However, the high side driver of the respective channel will still be able to be turned
            on. Thus under the scenario where the low side is shorted to ground the L9659 will be able
            to provide the programmed firing current for the specified time.
            An open GNDx connection on any channel has no affect on the other channels. An open
            GNDx condition will be detected using the low side MOS diagnostics.
            AGND
            The AGND pin is a reference for AOUT pin. When AGND loses its connection, the voltage
            on AOUT pin is pulledup to VDD voltage and L9659 goes in reset condition. All outputs are
            disabled and all internal register are reset to their default conditions.
3.2.5       VRESx capacitance
            To ensure all diagnostics function properly a typical capacitor of equal to or greater than
            68nF is required close to the firing supply pins. Thus minimum of 4 capacitors are required
            with one placed close to the VRES0 and VRES1 pins and a second capacitor will be close
            to the VRES2 and VRES3 pins and a third capacitor will be close to the VRES4 and VRES5
            pins and a forth capacitor will be close to the VRES6 and VRES7 pins.
3.2.6       Supply voltages
            The primary current sources for the different functions of the ASIC are as follows:
            ●    VRESx - Firing currents along with HSS and HS FET diagnostic currents
            ●    VSDIAG - Squib resistance and HSS diagnostics
            ●    VDD will be used for all internal functions as well as short to battery/ground and high
                 squib resistance diagnostics.
3.2.7       Ground connections
            GND pin (6) is not connected internally to other ground pins (AGND or power ground
            GNDx). A ground plane is needed to directly connect the GND pin. This ground plane needs
            to be isolated from the high current ground for the squib drivers to prevent voltage shifts.
            AGND pin should be connected to ground plane too to minimize drop versus ground
            reference of ADC that capture AOUT voltage.

      The software reset accessed over SPI will reset squib functions. The L9659 has a counter to
      verify the number of clocks in SCLK. If the number of clocks in SCLK is not equal to 16
      clocks while CS_D is asserted, it ignores the SPI message and sends a SPI fault response.
      L9659 computes SPI error length flag through counting the number ofSCLK rising edges
      occurring when CS_D is active. If the first SCLK rising edge occurs when CS_D is inactive
      and the falling edge occurs when CS_D is low, it is considered as valid edge.
      MOSI commands contain several bits not used, all those bits must be 0. Commands are not
      recognized valid if one or more not used bits are not 0.
3.3.1 SPI pin descriptions
      Chip select (CS_D)
      Chip-select inputs select the L9659 for serial transfers. CS_D can be asserted at any given
      time and are active low. When chip-select is asserted, the respective MISO pin is released
      from tri-state mode, and all status information is latched into the SPI shift register. While
      chip-select is asserted, register data is shifted into MOSI pin and shifted out of MISO pin on
      each subsequent SCLK. When chip-select is negated, MISO pin is tri-stated. To allow
      sufficient time to reload the registers; chip-select pin shall remain negated for at least tCSN.
      The chip-select inputs have current sinks which pull these pins to the negated state when
      there is an open circuit condition. These pins have TTL level compatible input voltages
      allowing proper operation with microprocessors using a 3.3 to 5.0 volt supply.
      Serial clock (SCLK)
      SCLK input is the clock signal input for synchronization of serial data transfer. This pin has
      TTL level compatible input voltages allowing proper operation with microprocessors using a
      3.3 to 5.0 volt supply. When chip select is asserted, both the SPI master and L9659 will latch
      input data on the rising edge of SCLK. The L9659 shifts data out on the falling edge of
      SCLK.
      Serial data output (MISO)
      MISO output pins shall be in one tri-state condition when chip select is negated. When chip
      select is asserted, the MSB is the first bit of the word/byte transmitted on MISO and the LSB
      is the last bit of the word/byte transmitted. This pin supplies a rail to rail output, so if
      interfaced to a microprocessor that is using a lower VDD supply, the appropriate
      microprocessor input pin shall not sink more than IOH(min) and shall not clamp the MISO
      output voltage to less than VOH(min) while MISO pin is in a logic “1” state. When connecting
      to a micro using a lower supply, such as 3.3V, a resistor divider shall be used with high
      enough impedance to prevent excess current flow.

            Serial data input (MOSI)
            MOSI inputs take data from the master processor while chip select is asserted. The MSB
            shall be the first bit of each word/byte received on MOSI and the LSB shall be the last bit of
            each word/byte received.
            This pin has TTL level compatible input voltages allowing proper operation with
            microprocessors using a 3.3 to 5.0 volt supply.
3.4         Squib drivers
3.4.1       Firing
            The on-chip deployment drivers are designed to deliver 1.2A (min) for 2ms (min) and 1.75A
            (min) for 1ms (min)and 1.75A (min) for 0.65ms (min) with VRESx voltages between 7V and
            37V. In addition the L9659 can provide 1.5A minimum for 2ms for VRESx voltages between
            7V and 25V. The firing condition is selectable via the SPI. At the end of a deployment, a
            deploy success flag is asserted and can be read using the appropriate SPI command. Each
            VRESx and GNDx connection is used to accommodate 8 loops that can be deployed
            simultaneously.
            Upon receiving a valid deployment condition, the respective SQHx and SQLx drivers are
            turned on. The only other activation of the SQHx and SQLx drivers is momentarily during a
            MOS diagnostic. Otherwise, SQHx and SQLx are inactive under any normal, fault, or
            transient conditions. Upon a successful deployment of the respective SQHx and SQLx
            drivers, a deploy command success flag is asserted via SPI. Refer to Figure 8. for the valid
            conditions and the deploy success flag timing.
            The L9659 is protected against inadvertent turn on of the firing drivers unless the
            appropriate conditions are present. Non-typical conditions will not cause driver activation.
            This includes the case where VRESx and/or VSDIAG pins are connected to a supply up to
            40V and VDD is between 0V and VDD min. Under these conditions the L9659 will ensure
            that driver activation will not occur. No flow of current shall be allowed through the SQHx
            and SQLx pins.

      Driver activation
      The firing of a squib driver requires the appropriate FEN function to be active and two
      separate sixteen bit writes be made over the SPI. The FEN function is defined as the result
      of the FENx pin OR’d with the internal FENx latch. The FENx pin going high initiates the
      FEN function. With the FEN 1 function being active and the appropriate Arm and Fire
      commands sent then Squib_0 & 1 drivers would be activated. With the FEN 2 function being
      active and the appropriate Arm and Fire commands sent then Squib_2 & 3 drivers would be
      activated. With the FEN 3 function being active and the appropriate Arm and Fire
      commands sent then Squib_4 & 5 drivers would be activated. With the FEN 4 function being
      active and the appropriate Arm and Fire commands sent then Squib_6 & 7 drivers would be
      activated.
      The first write is to ARM the drivers in preparation of receiving the fire command. The Arm
      command will stop on all channels any diagnostics that are active. Any combination of
      squibs can be armed. The second write is a FIRE command that must directly follow the
      Arm command and will activate the desired driver pairs assuming the FEN function is valid.
      If there is a parity mismatch the data bits will be ignored and the squib drivers will not have
      their status changed, and the two write sequence must then be started again. If there is a
      mismatch in channels selected then only those channels selected in both the Arm and Fire
      commands will be activated.

            During the first write, when the drivers are armed, all diagnostic functions are cleared. The
            FIRE command must follow the ARM command along with the FEN function active for driver
            activation. If a command is between the ARM and FIRE command then the sequence must
            be restarted. An error response will be received for the Fire command if the ARM/FIRE
            sequence is not followed.
            The ARM/FIRE commands and FEN function are independent from each other. The L9659
            will begin the tDEPLOY timer once a valid ARM/FIRE sequence has been received. If a valid
            ARM/FIRE command has been sent and the FEN function is inactive then the drivers will not
            be activated but the tDEPLOY timer will start. If the FEN function becomes active before
            tDEPLOY has expired then the drivers will become active for the full tDEPLOY time. If the FEN
            does not become active before tDEPLOY has expired then the sequence would need to be
            restarted. A diagram illustrating this is shown in Figure 8.

            Only the channels selected in the ARM and, directly following, the FIRE command will be
            able to be activated.
            By reading the appropriate registers a status of the deployment is provided. If a valid
            Arm/Fire sequence has been provided the status flag will become active. This flag will
            remain active for as long as the TDEPLOY timer is counting. Depending on the state of the
            FEN function the DEPLOY_STATUS flag will be active a minimum of TDEPLOY and a
            maximum of 2 x TDEPLOY. If driver activation did occur (both a valid Arm/Fire sequence and
            the appropriate FEN function active within the appropriate time) then the
            DEPLOY_SUCCESS flag will be active following the completion of the driver activation
            period. This flag will be active until cleared by software. If a valid Arm/Fire sequence did
            occur but the FEN function was never activated within the TDEPLOY time then the
            DEPLOY_SUCCESS flag will remain ‘0’.
            Once the Deploy Success Flag is set, it will inhibit the subsequent deployment command
            until a SPI command to clear this deployment success flag is received. Bits D7 through bit
            D0 are used to clear/keep the deploy success flag. When these bits are set to ‘1,’ the flag

      cleared to allow re-activation of the drivers.
      During driver activation the respective high side (SQHx) and low side (SQLx) drivers will turn
      on for tDEPLOY.
      L9659 driver activation will not occur or, if firing is in process, will terminate under the
      following conditions:
      ●     Power On Reset (POR)
      ●     IREF resistance is larger than RIREF_H or smaller than RIREF_L
      ●     Loss of ground condition on GND pin
      The following conditions are ignored when driver activation is in-progress:
      ●     RESETB
      ●     Valid soft reset sequences
      ●     SPI commands except as noted below. Response for ignored commands will be
            0xD009
      ●     FEN function

      The L9659 can only deploy a channel when the FEN function is active. Once the drivers are
      active the L9659 will keep the drivers on for the required duration regardless of the FEN
      state. Once complete a status bit will be set to indicate firing is complete.
3.4.2 Firing current measurement
      All channels have a 7 bit current measurement register that is used to measure the amount
      of time the current is above IMEAS during firing. The maximum measurement for each
      channel is 3.175ms nominal based on a bit weight of 25µs. The current measurement
      register will not increment outside the deployment time. The current measurement will begin
      incrementing once the current has exceeded 95% of the nominal target value. The count will
      continue to increment from the stored value until either a clear command has been issued
      for that channel or all ‘1’s are present in the corresponding channel measurement register. If
      all ‘1’s are present for a channel’s measurement register and another firing sequence has
      been issued the register will remain all ‘1’s. Only if a clear command has been issued will
      that particular register be reset to all ‘0’s. All other channels shall keep the stored
      measurement count. During firing the current measurement register cannot be cleared.
      After a clear command has been issued for a channel then the channel is ready to count if

Functional description                                                                                L9659
            the current exceeds the specified level. After a POR or software reset the L9659 will reset all
            8 measurement registers to all ‘0’s.
            A “real-time” current measurement status of all the channels is available. If a current limit
            status request is sent then the L9659 will report in the next SPI transfer whether the current
            is above or below IMEAS for each of the channels. The current status results can be read at
            any time and will correctly report whether current is flowing. The content of the internal
            current status register is captured on the falling edge of chip select during the SPI response.
            The internal status register is updated at a nominal sample time of 25µs and is independent
            of SPI transfers.
            For this circuit there is continuously being performed compensation of the comparator to
            remove offset errors, which is independent from SPI commands. The compensation is being
            performed every 12.8µs based on the internal clock.
3.4.3       Fire enable (FEN) function description
            The Fire Enable (FEN) function is the result of the FENx input OR’d with the internal FEN
            latch. If the FEN latch is not enabled and the FENx pin is low then activation of the FET
            drivers are disabled except as indicated during the MOS test. All internal diagnostic
            functions, and results, will be available through the serial interface. This pin must be pulled
            high to initiate the FEN latch function (if programmed) and enable firing of the FET drivers.
            There are four FEN function blocks
            ●    FEN Function 1 is FEN1 input OR’d with FEN1 latch timer and used for enabling
                 channels 0 & 1
            ●    FEN Function 2 is FEN1 input OR’d with FEN2 latch timer and used for enabling
                 channels 2 & 3
            ●    FEN Function 3 is FEN1 input OR'd with FEN3 latch timer and used for enabling
                 channels 4 & 5
            ●    FEN Function 4 is FEN1 input OR'd with FEN4 latch timer and used for enabling
                 channels 6 & 7
            The FEN function will be considered active when the pin is active (‘1’ or high) for more than
            12 microseconds. Tolerance range for the filter used is 12 to 16 µsecs.
            When the FENx input is active, ‘1’, the FEN function will be active. When the FENx input
            state transitions from ‘1’ to ‘0’, the programmable latching function will hold the FEN
            function active until the timeout of the FEN timer. The programmable latch and hold
            function will be capable of delays of 0ms, 128 ms, 256 ms, and 512 ms. There are 4
            independent timers with the timer for FEN1 associated with channels 0 & 1, timer for FEN2
            associated with channels 2 & 3, timer for FEN3 associated with channels 4 & 5, timer for
            FEN4 associated with channels 6 & 7. The timer is reset to the programmed time when
            the FENx pin transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’. The programmable counter delay will be set
            through a SPI command.

                   The leakage diagnostic includes a short to battery, a short to ground and a short between
                   loop tests. The test will be run for each SQHx and SQLx pin so that shorts can be detected
                   regardless of the resistance between the squib pins.
                   Normal short to battery/ground diagnostics.
                   For the test the internal VRCM is switched on and connected to the selected pin (SQHx or
                   SQLx) pin. The IPD bit will be selected to be OFF which will deactivate the pulldown current
                                                                                     Doc ID 022048 Rev 2                                                                                           27/51


Functional description                                                                                                   L9659
            on the channel under test and all other channels. During the test with no leakage present
            the voltage on the selected SQHx or SQLx pin will be equal to VBIAS and no current is sunk
            or sourced by VRCM. If a leakage to ground, battery or to SQLy is present, the VRCM will
            sink or source a current less then ISVRCM trying to keep VBIAS. Two current comparators,
            ISTB and ISTG, will detect the abnormal current flow.
            Loop to loop diagnostics
            For this test the same procedure is followed except the pulldown current (IPD) is selected to
            be ON which will deactivate the pulldown current only on the channel under test with all
            other channel pulldown currents active. If a short to ground fault is active, assuming it was
            not active during normal short to battery/ground diagnostics, then that particular channel
            has a short to another squib loop. To detect loop to loop shorts between ASICs in the
            system the Stop diagnostics command with IPD enabled needs to be sent to the other
            ASICs before running the loop to loop diagnostics on the channel to be monitored. If the
            channel being monitored has a short to ground fault active, assuming it was not active
            during normal short to battery/ground diagnostics, then that particular channel has a short
            to another squib loop in the system.

                 and the other has a normal squib connection then the fault will be indicated on the channel that is open.
                 Assumes both pins are tested
            Once the command is issued the state of the comparators will be captured on the next
            falling edge of CS_D. The results are valid after TSHORTDIAG time, which is mainly
            dependant on the external capacitors on the squib lines.
            Squib resistance measurement
            During a resistance measurement, both ISRC and ISINK are switched on and connected to
            the selected SQHx and SQLx channel. A differential voltage is created between the SQHx
            and SQLx pin based in the ISRC current and resistance between the pins. The analog
            output pin, AOUT, will provide the resistance-measurement voltage based on the scaling
            factor indicated in the electrical parameters section. The tri-state output, AOUT, will be
            connected to an ADC input of a microprocessor. When not running squib resistance
            diagnostics the AOUT pin will be high impedance.
            To increase accuracy of the squib resistance measurements the offset of the internal
            amplifier can be provided on the AOUT pin. This is done by setting the appropriate
            calibration bit, waiting the required time, and reading the converted AOUT voltage
            connected to the microprocessor ADC.
            The normal measurement method for squib resistance is to take a single ended analog
            output measurement for a channel (VAOUT with AMC bit=0) and use the tolerances and

L9659                                                                         Functional description
      equation shown in the parametric table. The L9659 is also capable of improving the
      tolerance at resistances below 3.5 Ohms by removing the offset of the differential
      comparator. This method works taking the single ended analog output results for a channel
      (VAOUT with AMC bit=0) and subtracting the internal comparator offset measurement of
      VAOUT_CAL (VAOUT with AMC bit=1). The summary of the equation for this is as follows:
                                       AOUT_CAL = (VAOUT – VAOUT_CAL)/VDD
                                           AOUT_CAL typical = 0.08 x RSQUIB
      High squib resistance diagnostics
      During a high squib resistance diagnostic, VRCM and ISINK are switched ON and
      connected to SQHx and SQLx on the selected channel. Current flowing on SQHx will be
      measured and compared to IHR threshold to identify if resistance is above or below
      RSQHZ. The results will be reported in the next SPI message. Once the command is issued
      the state of the squib resistance will be valid after THSR captured on the next falling edge of
      CS_D. The voltage source for this test will be VBIAS which is based on the VDD supply.
      A way to reduce the time required until valid results are available is to perform a leakage
      diagnostics prior to this test. The leakage diagnostics will bias the voltage on the squibs to
      around 3.5V, which is the same bias voltage required for the high squib resistance
      diagnostic. By following running this sequence of diagnostics will reduce the test time to
      from 1.5ms to 200µs.
      High and low side FET diagnostics
      Prior to either the HS or LS FET diagnostics being run it is required to have the VRCM
      switched ON. Running the leakage diagnostics with the appropriate delay time prior to either
      the HS or LS FET diagnostics can do this. When the FET diagnostic command is issued the
      flags will initially be cleared. If the VRMC is not active or some leakage is present then the
      MOS will not be turned ON, the test will be aborted and Fault Present (FP) bit will be set.
      The FEN function must be inactive to run test. The test will not start if FEN function is active
      on channel under test and it will result in the Fault Present (FP) bit to set.
      If no leakage is present and FEN function is inactive, the MOS (High side or Low Side) is
      turned ON. The L9659 will monitor the current sink or sourced by VRCM. If the MOS is
      working properly, this current will exceed ISTB (HS test) or ISTG (LS test) and the L9659 will
      turn off the driver under test within the specified time TSHUTOFF. If the current does not
      exceed ISTB or ISTG then the test will be terminated and the MOS will be switched off by
      the L9659 within TFETTIMEOUT. During the TFETTIMEOUT period the FET Timeout bit will be
      set (FT=1) and will be cleared at the expiration of the timer.
      The results must be compared with the leakage diagnostic results to distinguish between a
      real leakage/short versus a FET fault. For high side FET diagnostics if no faults were
      indicated in the preceding leakage diagnostics then a normal result would be STB=1;STG=0
      (with FT=0;FP=0). If the returned results for the high side FET test is not STB=1;STG=0
      (with FT=0;FP=0) then either the FET is not functional, a short occurred during the test, or
      there is a missing VRESx connection for that channel. For low side FET diagnostics if no
      faults were indicated in the preceding leakage diagnostics then a normal result would be
      STB=0;STG=1 (with FT=0;FP=0). If the returned results for the low side FET test is not
      STB=0;STG=1 (with FT=0;FP=0) then either the FET is not functional, a short occurred
      during the test, or there is a missing GNDx connection for that channel. If the test is in
      progress then a bit (FT) is used in the response to indicate this status.
      Once the command is issued, output of comparators will be latched.

            On the next falling edge of CS_D, comparator latched data are captured and reported to
            MISO response. The results will remain latch until the next test is initiated (diagnostic write
            command). If the test is in progress then a bit is used in the response to indicate the test
            completion. If the FET under test is working properly then the results will indicate a “Short to
            Ground” for LS test and “Short to Battery” for HS test. If a leakage is present prior to the test
            or FENx is asserted then both “Short to Ground” and Short to Battery” will be indicated in
            the response for either a LS or HS FET test.
            For all conditions the current on SQHx/SQLx will never exceed ISVRCM. On the squib lines
            there will be highertransient currents due to the presence of the filter capacitor.
            High side safing diagnostics
            When the command is received the L9659 will activate IHSS on the selected VRESx. The
            diagnostics will measure the difference between VSDIAG and VRESx. The internal
            comparator will detect open, short or normal condition based on the differential voltage
            between VSDIAG and VRESx.
            The results will be reported in the next SPI message using bits HSS1 and HSS0 as
            indicated in the following table. Once the command is issued the voltages will be captured
            on the next falling edge of CS_D.

            The results will be reported in the next SPI message. Once the command is issued the
            voltages will be captured on the next falling edge of CS_D.

            Loss of power ground
            When any of the power grounds (GND0 – 7) are lost, no deployment can occur on the
            respective deployment channels because the low side driver will be inactive. The high side
            driver for the respective channel can still be activated.
            A loss of ground condition on one or several channels will not affect the operation of the
            remaining channels. When a loss of ground condition occurs, the source of the low side
            MOS will be floating. In this case, no current will flow through the low side driver.

      This condition will be detected as a fault by a low side MOS diagnostic. No additional faults
      will be reported from any other diagnostic due to this condition.
3.4.5 SPI register definition for squib functions
      The SPI provides access to read/write to the registers internal to the L9659. All commands
      and responses sent to/from the L9659 on SPI will use set D13 as required for odd parity on
      the 16 bit word. The responses to the commands are sent in the next valid CS_D.
      The table below summarizes the MISO register mode response of various events and MOSI
      messages. After POR event, RESETB negated, and loss of GND, the L9659 sends 0x0000
      in MISO for the first SPI transmission.
      The MISO response shown here is the one received in the next valid SPI transmission after
      each event or MOSI write.

Functional description                                                                                       L9659
                                    subsequent 16-bit SPI transmissions. If the sequence is broken, the
                                    processor will be required to re-transmit the sequence. The L9659 will
                                    not reset if the sequence is not completed within two subsequent 16- bit
                                    SPI transmissions. When soft reset command is received, the L9659
                                    reset its deployment driver’s internal logic and timers, including all
                                    internal registers. The effects of a soft reset is the same as a of POR
                                    event, except MISO response.
             Bit [D1]              First response after POR (or equivalent) the PU bit is set to ‘0’. All
                                    responses following the bit is set to ‘1’.
             Bit [D0]              Bit D0 used to report the soft reset sequence status. If valid soft reset
                                    sequences are received, bit D0 is set to ‘1.’ Otherwise, bit D0 is set to
                                    ‘0.’ When L9659 receives valid soft reset sequences, it will send a MISO
                                    configuration mode response containing 0x2003 in the next SPI
                                    transmission.

              Bits [D9:D8]             Bits are used to set the period of the FEN latch timer. The L9659 has
                                       4 independent timers. A valid FENx input will start the pulse stretch
                                       timer. These bits will set the timer duration. These values default to
                                       ‘00’ after a POR event.
              Deployment commands
              The deployment mode is used to activate the drivers. Two consecutive commands are
              required to activate the drivers. Any combination of channels can be fired as long as the
              prerequisite conditions are met as indicated in the previous section.

      The Deploy Status becomes ‘1’ when there is a valid fire sequence. Once active it will
      become ‘0’ when the time out has expired waiting FEN activation or when squib driver has
      turned off for fire completion. The same information is available when receiving a response
      from Monitor Mode 1.
      For the drivers to be fire capable the command mode 1 (Arming) must be sent followed by
      command mode 2 (Firing). With this sequence valid and FEN active then firing will begin. A
      break in the sequence will require the process to be restarted. All other bit patterns for D12-
      D8 wil be ignored and the L9659 will respond with $D005.
      To begin a deployment 2 consecutive commands need to be sent along with the FEN active
      (external or internal latch). An example of a firing sequence for channel 0 would be as
      follows
      FENx active or inactive
      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – Based on previous command
      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x6001 – Firing on Channel 0 is started on if FEN is active
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored – sequence is not allowed
      RX – 0x6001
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored
      RX – 0xD005
      Alternatively, if the sequence is broken the response will be as in the following example
      FENx active
      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – Based on previous command
      TX – 0x2000 – Read of Register Mode 1
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored – sequence is not allowed
      RX – contents of register

            TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored – sequence is not allowed
            RX – 0xD005
            If, for example, channel 0 and 1 bits are set in the Arm command and channel 0 and 7 bits
            are set in the fire command then the result will be the drivers on channel 0 will be activated
            (assuming FEN function is active) and there will be no effect on channel 7.
            During a deployment, any commands directed to the channel that are in deployment are
            ignored and the response shall be 0xD009.

            1     Clear Deploy Success Flag Channel 0          DEPLOY_SUCCESS0
            The DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag indicates if the corresponding channel’s drivers were
            activated and that the activation period has completed. This bit is set when the activation
            period has expired. The DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag will be ‘1’ until it is cleared by writing a
            ‘1’ to the appropriate channel(s) (bits D7-D0).
            The DEPLOY_STATUSx bit will become ‘1’ when there is a valid Arm and Fire sequence for
            the corresponding channel. The DEPLOY_STATUSx bit transitioning from a ‘0’ to a ‘1’ does
            not depend on the state of the FEN function. It will become ‘0’ when time out has expired.
            Depending on the state of FEN the DEPLOY_STATUSx flag could be ‘1’ for a minimum of 1x
            tDEPLOY and a maximum of up to 2 x tDEPLOY (see Figure 8.). The Deployment status is
            captured on the falling edge of CS_D.
            Bit D8 is used to select the meaning of bit D7 through bit D0 in the status response
            message. When this bit is set to ‘1,’ bits D7 through D0 in the status response message will
            report the state of the DEPLOY_STATUSx flag.
            When this bit is ‘0,’ bit D7 through bit D0 in the status response message will report the
            DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag. The following table shows the conditions for the
            DEPLOY_STATUSx flag and the DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag.

            Once the Deploy Success Flag is set, it will inhibit the subsequent deployment command
            until a SPI command to clear this deployment success flag is received. Bits D7 through bit
            D0 are used to clear/keep the deploy success flag. When these bits are set to ‘1,’ the flag
            can be cleared. Otherwise, the state of these flags is not affected. The Success flag must
            be cleared to allow re-activation of the drivers

Note: The FEN status is the result of the state of the FEN input pin OR’d with the FEN latch timer.
      The FEN latch timer will remain inactive until a transition of ‘1’ to ‘0’ on the FEN input
      (assuming the pin was high for a minimum of 16µs). At that time the FEN latch timer will be
      active and keep the internal FEN signal active based on the programmed time (0ms, 128ms,
      256ms or 512ms) for that particular FEN function.
