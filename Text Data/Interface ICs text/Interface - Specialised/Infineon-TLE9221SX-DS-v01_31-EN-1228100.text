TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Overview
The TLE9221SX FlexRay transceiver is a FlexRay bus driver (BD) and it accomplishes the physical interface
between the Communication Controller and the bus medium. Fully compliant with the FlexRay Electrical
Physical Layer Specification, version 3.0.1 (acronym EPL) and ISO 17458.
The TLE9221SX supports the following functional classes:
•   Functional class “bus driver voltage regulator control”
•   Functional class “bus driver bus guardian interface”
•   Functional class “bus driver logic level adaption”
•   Functional class “bus driver remote wake-up”
The TLE9221SX supports data transmission rates from 1 Mbit/s up to 10 Mbit/s. Besides the transmit and
receive capability of the bus, the TLE9221SX provides arrangements for low power supply management,
supply voltage monitoring and bus failure detection.
In BD_Sleep mode, the TLE9221SX quiescent current decreases to a typical, total current consumption of
47.5 mA, while the device is still able to wake up by a dedicated wake-up pattern on the FlexRay data bus or
by a local wake-up event on the pin WAKE. The INH output pin allows the control of external circuitry
depending on the selected mode of operation.
Fail-safe features, like bus failure detection or the power supply monitoring, combined with an easy accessible
Status Information Register support the requirements of safety-related applications with extended diagnostic
features.
The TLE9221SX is internally protected against transients on all global pins. Global pins are BP, BM, WAKE and
VBAT. It is possible to use the TLE9221SX without any additional external protection circuitry while the
TLE9221SX meets the ESD and ISO pulse requirements of the car manufactures.
The TLE9221SX is designed on the latest Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, which combines power
devices with a highly integrated logic process. Based on its digital design concept, the TLE9221SX provides
very high immunity against RF disturbances over a wide frequency range.
Based on the high symmetry of the BP and BM signals, the TLE9221SX provides the lowest level of
electromagnetic emission (EME) within a wide frequency range.
The TLE9221SX is integrated in a RoHS compliant PG-SSOP-16 package. The TLE9221SX and the Infineon
Smart Power Technology SPT are especially tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the automotive
environment and qualified according to the AEC-Q100 standard.

FlexRay Transceiver
Functional Overview

4.1               Functional Description
FlexRay is a differential bus system. The data is exchanged via a dual wire bus medium on the wires BP (Bus
Line Plus) and BM (Bus Line Minus).
Three different bus symbols are supported: “Data_0”, “Data_1” and bus “Idle”. An active Transmitter of the
TLE9221SX drives “Data_0” or “Data_1” to the bus medium, depending on the TxD input signal. To sustain an
“Idle” signal on the FlexRay bus, the Transmitter is turned off, the voltage difference between BP and BM is
below 30 mV, and the absolute voltage level on both bus lines, BP and BM depends on the Bus Biasing (see
Figure 3):
•   “Data_1”: uBus = uBP - uBM ≥ 300 mV → positive voltage between BP and BM
•   “Data_0”: uBus = uBP - uBM ≤ - 300 mV → negative voltage between BP and BM
•   “Idle”: |uBus| = |uBP - uBM| ≤ 30 mV

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional Overview
4.2             Modes of Operation
The FlexRay bus driver TLE9221SX supports four different modes of operation:
•    BD_Normal mode
•    BD_ReceiveOnly mode
•    BD_Standby mode
•    BD_Sleep mode
Each mode has specific characteristics in terms of quiescent current, data transmission or failure diagnostic.
To enter the BD_Sleep mode, the TLE9221SX provides an intermediate mode, the so-called BD_GoToSleep
command.
Mode changes on the TLE9221SX are either triggered by:
•    The Host Interface and a host command on the input pins EN and STBN.
•    The Power Supply Interface and an undervoltage event on one of the two power supplies or the reference
     supply uVIO.
•    The Wake-up Detector and wake-up events either on the FlexRay bus or on the local wake-up pin WAKE.
While all power supplies are turned off, the transceiver TLE9221SX is in BD_Off condition or also called
“without supply”.
In BD_Sleep mode and in BD_Standby mode the quiescent current consumption at all three supplies is
tailored to reach the minimum, and therefore only a limited set of the functions of the TLE9221SX is available.
BD_Sleep mode and BD_Standby mode are also called low power modes. Conversely the modes BD_Normal
and BD_ReceiveOnly are called non-low power modes.
4.3             Behavior of Unconnected Digital Input Pins
The integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors at the digital input pins force the TLE9221SX into a secure, fail
safe behavior if the input pins are not connected and floating (see Table 2 for details).
If the TxEN pin or the BGE pin is not connected in BD_Normal mode, the Transmitter is disabled. If the TxD
input pin is open in BD_Normal mode and the Transmitter is active, the transceiver TLE9221SX drives a
“Data_0” signal to the bus.
If the mode control input pins of the Host Interface are not connected, the pull-down resistors on the EN pin
and on the STBN pin set the TLE9221SX by default to BD_Standby mode.

1) In BD_Sleep, BD_Standby, and also in BD_ReceiveOnly mode, the inputs TxD, TxEN and BGE are blocked by the
     internal logic. To optimize the total quiescent current consumption, the pull-up and pull-down structures are
     disabled in BD_Sleep mode, BD_Standby mode and BD_ReceiveOnly mode.
The Power Supply Interface detects missing supply voltages or a missing reference supply. The Central State
Machine sets the TLE9221SX into a fail safe mode when a supply is not available (details see Chapter 8.3).

FlexRay Transceiver
Overview Functional Blocks
5            Overview Functional Blocks
5.1          Transmitter
The Transmitter is the output driver for the FlexRay bus. It is based on a “high” side and “low” side push-pull
unit. The push-pull units are supplied by the power supply uVCC (see Figure 4).
While driving a “Data_1” or “Data_0” signal on to the FlexRay bus, the transceiver is active and enabled. During
an “Idle” signal, the transceiver is turned off.

The Transmitter is protected by an internal temperature sensor against overheating in terms of a short circuit
on the bus lines BM or BP. The Transmitter is controlled by the Communication Controller Interface (see
Chapter 5.3). The Transmitter is only active in BD_Normal mode.
5.2          Receiver
The Receiver detects communication elements, like “Idle”, “Data_1” and “Data_0”, when it is not in low power
mode. It is connected to the BP and BM I/O pins of the TLE9221SX, together with the Transmitter, the Bus-
Failure Detector, and the Wake-up Detector (see Figure 1). Based on a digital sampling concept, the Receiver
is optimized to withstand the RF immunity requirements of the automotive industry.
The low pass input filter is tailored to support analog bit times down to 60 ns. Data bits below 60 ns may not
be detected as valid communication elements. When the Receiver detects activity on the FlexRay bus behind
the input filter, the differential Receiver distinguishes whether “Data_0” or “Data_1” is signaled by the
differential bus voltage. The bus activity information is provided to the Bus Guardian Interface. The
information regarding the FlexRay data bits is provided to the Communication Controller (see Figure 5).
The thresholds and the timings of the Receiver are available in Figure 44 and Figure 45.

Figure 5     Block diagram of the Receiver
Apart from receiving data, the Receiver is responsible for biasing the FlexRay bus. The biasing of the FlexRay
bus depends on the selected mode of operation.
In BD_Normal mode and BD_ReceiveOnly mode, the voltage uBias is connected to the BP and BM pins across
the common mode resistors RCM1 and RCM2. In BD_Sleep mode, BD_Standby mode and in the BD_GoToSleep
command the I/O pins BP and BM are connected to GND via the common mode resistors RCM1 and RCM2.
When TLE9221SX is not supplied, the bus biasing is open and is neither switched to uBias nor to GND, the BP
and BM pins appear to the FlexRay bus as a high-impedance input (see Table 3 and Figure 5).

5.3          Communication Controller Interface
The Communication Controller Interface is the interface between the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX and the
FlexRay Communication Controller (CC). It comprises three digital signals:
•   The TxEN (Transmit Data Enable Not) input pin
•   The TxD (Transmit Data) input pin
•   The RxD (Receive Data) output pin

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Overview Functional Blocks
The logical I/O levels of all three digital pins are adapted to the reference voltage uVIO. In case uVIO is not
available or in an undervoltage condition, the RxD output is set to logical “low” and the input pins TxD and
TxEN are set to their default condition (see Table 2).
The Communication Controller logic block handles the interlock between TxD and TxEN. The Central State
Machine provides the interface to other TLE9221SX function blocks and handles the dependency based on the
selected mode of operation (see Figure 6).
                                                                                uVIO

Figure 6     Block diagram of the Communication Controller Interface
The TxD input of the Communication Controller Interface is active only when the Transmitter is activated. To
activate the Transmitter, the transceiver TLE9221SX needs to be in BD_Normal mode, the TxEN input must be
at logical “low” and the BGE input pin must be at logical “high” (see Table 4).
The FlexRay transceiver shall never start data transmission with the communication element “Data_1”.
Therefore, the activation of the Transmitter via the TxEN signal is only possible while the TxD signal is at logical
“low” (see Figure 7).
While the Transmitter is enabled, the Communication Controller Interface drives the serial digital data stream
available at the TxD input pin to the FlexRay bus via the Transmitter. A logical “high” signal at the TxD pin
drives a “Data_1” signal to the FlexRay bus and a logical “low” signal drives a “Data_0” signal (see Table 4).

Figure 7        FlexRay physical layer bus signals with Bus Guardian Interface
The Receiver of the TLE9221SX is active in all non-low power operating modes. Similar to the TxD input, the
RxD output indicates a “Data_1” signal on the FlexRay bus by a logical “high” signal and the “Data_0” signal
by a logical “low” signal.
In every low power mode, the TxD and TxEN input pins are disabled. The RxD output pin is used to indicate the
wake-up flag, while the transceiver is in low power mode (see Table 5).
5.4             Bus Guardian Interface
The Bus Guardian Interface comprises two digital signals:
•    The BGE (Bus Guardian Enable) input pin.
•    The RxEN (Receive Enable Not) output pin.
The logical I/O levels of the input and the output pin are adapted to the reference voltage uVIO. In case uVIO is
not available or in undervoltage condition, the RxEN output is set to logical “low” and the input pin BGE is set
to its default condition (see Table 2).
The Bus Guardian logic block handles the connection to the Transmitter and the Receiver. The Central State
Machine provides the interface to other TLE9221SX function blocks and handles the dependency on the
selected mode of operation (see Figure 8).

The BGE input is an additional fail safe input, allowing external hardware to block the data stream driven to
the FlexRay bus medium. Switching the BGE input to logical “low” disables the Transmitter of TLE9221SX
regardless of the signals on all the other digital input pins. The BGE input is active only in BD_Normal mode
(see Table 4 and Figure 7).

The RxEN (Receive Enable Not) indicates the activity on the FlexRay bus. In case the FlexRay bus is “Idle”, the
logical signal on the RxEN is “high”. Any active data signal on the FlexRay bus, regardless of whether it is
“Data_0” or “Data_1”, is indicated by a logical “low” signal on the RxEN output pin. Like the RxD output pin,
the RxEN output pin indicates also the wake-up flag while the transceiver is in low power mode (see Table 5
and Figure 7).

5.5           Host Interface
The Host Interface is the interface between the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX and the FlexRay host
controller. It allows the host to control the operating modes and to read status and diagnostics information.
It comprises three digital signals:
•   The EN (Enable) input pin
•   The STBN (Stand-By Not) input pin
•   The ERRN (Error Not) output pin
The logical I/O levels of the pins are adapted to the reference voltage uVIO. In case uVIO is not available or in
undervoltage condition, the ERRN output is set to logical “low” and the input pins EN and STBN are set to their
default condition (see Table 2).
                                                                             uVIO

The EN and STBN pins control the modes of operation. The pins are connected to the Central State Machine
via an input filter. The input filter protects the transceiver TLE9221SX against unintentional mode changes
caused by spikes on the EN and STBN.

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Overview Functional Blocks
The ERRN output signals failures, diagnostic and status information to the external host controller. The
TLE9221SX also contains a Status Information Register. Access to the Status Information Register is given by
the Host Interface (see details Chapter 6).

1) No undervoltage flag and no wake-up flag is set.
5.6          Wake-up Detector
The Wake-up Detector is a separate internal function block to detect wake-up events, be it a local or a remote
wake-up event. The Wake-up Detector also enables the filtering unit to differentiate between real wake-up
signals and floating signals or glitches on the wake-up lines. Active in every operation mode, and also in the
BD_Normal or BD_ReceiveOnly mode, the Wake-up Detector ensures that no wake-up signal gets lost due to
a concurrent change of the operating mode. The Wake-up Detector provides feedback on the wake-up
information to the Central State Machine for further processing (details see Chapter 7).
5.7          Power Supply Interface
The Power Supply Interface is the interface from the bus driver to the external supply voltages. It hosts the
inputs to the power supplies VBAT and VCC and also the level shift input to the reference voltage VIO.
To enable the control of external circuitry, like a voltage regulator for example, the Power Supply Interface of
the TLE9221SX provides an INH output.
All power supplies and the reference voltage are monitored and undervoltage conditions are indicated via the
ERRN output on the Host Interface (details see Chapter 8).
5.8          Bus Failure Detector
The Bus Failure Detector monitors the data stream on the BM and BP I/O pins and compares the bus data with
the digital data stream available at the Communication Controller Interface. Discrepancies between the bus
data and the digital data are interpreted as a bus failure. The Bus Failure Detector is active only in BD_Normal
mode. All detected failures are signaled on the ERRN output by the Host Interface (see Chapter 10).
5.9          Central State Machine
The Central State Machine is the main logic block of the TLE9221SX. It controls all functions of the TLE9221SX,
the failure management as well as the power-up and power-down operations. The Central State Machine also
provides some internal registers to store status, diagnostic and failure information.
•   Information about the operating mode handling (see Chapter 9)
•   Information about the Status Information Register (see Chapter 6)
•   Information about the power management (see Chapter 8)
•   Information about the bus failure flag (see Chapter 10)

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Host Interface and Status Information Register
6             Host Interface and Status Information Register
The Host Interface is the main interface for:
•    Selecting and controlling the operation modes of the TLE9221SX by host commands.
•    Receiving status information of the TLE9221SX at the ERRN output pin.
•    Retrieving diagnostics information of the TLE9221SX by reading the Status Information Register.
The Host Interface is operational when the reference voltage uVIO is in its functional range. In case the supply
uVIO is in undervoltage condition, the Host Interface is blocked and the operating mode of the TLE9221SX
FlexRay transceiver is automatically set to BD_Sleep mode (compare with Chapter 9.3).
6.1           Host Commands
The digital inputs EN and STBN have dual functionality:
•    EN and STBN are used to select the operating mode.
•    EN and STBN are used to trigger the read-out of the Status Information Register.
The STBN, EN and all other digital inputs of the TLE9221SX are level-triggered and protected with a glitch input
filter. Additionally, a digital input filter is provided at the mode selection pins STBN and EN.
To get a valid host command, which triggers a change of the operating mode, the external signals at the pins
EN and STBN need to be stable at least for time t ≥ dBDLogicFilter. Signal changes with a smaller pulse width
than the internal filter time t < dBDLogicFilter are not considered valid host commands and the TLE9221SX
remains in its previous operating mode.
Within the time for mode change t = dBDModeChange the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX changes to the selected
mode of operation (see Figure 10). All output signals are valid after the mode transition and when the time for
mode change t = dBDModeChange has expired.

6.2.2         SIR Readout Mechanism
The SIR is a “read-only” register and the data can be read out serially by using EN input as a data clock. While
the SIR readout procedure is running, no operation mode change applies to the TLE9221SX. This allows
regular data communication and read-out of the SIR at the same time.
Like all the other functions using the Host Interface, the reference supply uVIO needs to be operational to read
out the SIR.
The SIR readout is possible in all non-low power modes and in BD_Standby mode (see Table 8).

Note:              The SIR readout depends on the current operating mode selected and not on the host command
                   applied. In case of undervoltage events, the host command could be BD_Normal mode, but the
                   operating mode is BD_Sleep mode. In BD_Sleep mode, no SIR read-out is possible.

Figure 11          Timing diagram for the SIR readout in BD_Normal mode
During the SIR readout, the EN input acts as the clock and the ERRN output pin acts as the serial “data_out”.
Irrespective of the digital signal at the STBN input, the SIR readout is always initialized by a signal change at
the EN input pin. When the host command BD_Normal is applied to the Host Interface, the SIR read-out starts
with the falling edge at the EN input (see Figure 11). For the host commands BD_Standby and
BD_ReceiveOnly the read-out starts with the rising edge at the EN pin (see Figure 12).
After initialization, the internal timer starts and the TLE9221SX awaits the next signal change within the timing
window dENCLOCK(min) < t < dENCLOCK(max). The next rising edge1) enables the SIR and the bits can be clocked
out.
If no signal change occurs after the initialization within the time frame t < dENTimeout, the TLE9221SX exits the
SIR readout procedure and changes the operating mode according to the host command applied.
1) While the TLE9221SX is in BD_Normal mode, the rising edge is the first signal change after initialization and enables the SIR
     readout. For the BD_ReceiveOnly and the BD_Standby mode, there is an additional falling edge between initialization and the SIR
     being enabled (compare with Figure 11 and Figure 12).

When the SIR is enabled, every falling edge at the EN input serially shifts out the SIR information at the ERRN
output pin. With the first falling edge of the clock at the EN input, the least significant bit, bit 0, is clocked out
to the ERRN output successively followed by bit 1, bit 2, etc, with every successive falling edge of the clock at
the EN input.The SIR bits are “low” active, meaning that the ERRN signal = “low” when the SIR bit is set.
Note:              The STBN input pin has no function when the SIR readout is enabled and the readout procedure is
                   running. Nevertheless, it is recommended to keep the STBN pin stable (“high” or “low”) during the
                   SIR readout procedure.

The SIR readout procedure can be terminated at any time by stopping the clock at the EN input pin. While the
signal at the EN pin is stable for the time t > dENTimeout, the TLE9221SX exits the SIR and changes to the
operating mode according to the host command applied.
Note:              It is recommended to leave the SIR read out procedure with the same EN signal that was present
                   when the read out procedure was started. When time t = dENTimeout expires, the mode change is
                   triggered immediately.
6.2.3              Clearing Sequence of SIR
Failure and status information is latched in the SIR and the bits need to be cleared by a host command. In
order to avoid any status bit from being cleared, while the root cause of the bit entry is still present, the
TLE9221SX is equipped with a dedicated sequence to clear the bits of the Status Information Register. Before
clearing any bits, the TLE9221SX checks, if the root cause of the bit entry is resolved. Only if the root cause of
the bit entry has disappeared, the bit will be cleared.

The sequence to clear the bits of the SIR is started by:
•   Entering BD_Normal mode via a host command.
•   A complete readout of all 16 bits in the SIR.
In case the readout of the SIR is incomplete, for instance, due to a microcontroller interrupt during the readout
procedure, the bits in the SIR remain set.
In case the SIR readout continues after the last bit (bit 15) has been clocked out, the TLE9221SX continues and
clocks out the first bit (bit 0) again. On the second readout the bits in the SIR have been cleared. The bits will
only be cleared if the root cause of setting them has been resolved.
Note:         Applying TLE9221SX the host command BD_Normal does not necessarily clear the SIR, since
              entering BD_Normal mode can be prevented by an undervoltage event (see Table 13).
6.3           Status Information at the ERRN Output Pin
The ERRN output pin functions as a serial “data-out” during the SIR readout procedure. In any other case, the
ERRN output pin indicates the status information. The ERRN pin indicates failure, wake-up events and the
wake-up source.
The host command applied determines the incident that is signed at the ERRN output pin. The ERRN output
pin is active “low” (details see Table 9).

              selection of the operation mode doesn’t implicitly depend on the host command but also on failure
              cases and wake-up events, it is possible that the TLE9221SX is in BD_Sleep mode while the host

6.3.1        Reset the ERRN Output Pin
The ERRN output depends directly on the status bits in the SIR. Resetting the bits in the SIR automatically also
clears the ERRN output and, vice versa, one bit in SIR sets the ERRN output.
As described in Chapter 6.2.3 the SIR can be reset by a dedicated host command or by the readout of the SIR.
Since the SIR and consequently also the ERRN output can only be reset by a dedicated host command,
toggling at the ERRN pin is not possible.

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Wake-up Detector
7             Wake-up Detector
The FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX can detect different wake-up events via the central Wake-up Detector.
These can be either remote wake-up events provided by the FlexRay bus or local wake-up events provided to
the local wake-up pin WAKE.
Wake-up signals are:
•   A falling edge at the local wake-up pin WAKE (see Chapter 7.1.1).
•   A rising edge at the local wake-up pin WAKE (see Chapter 7.1.2).
•   A dedicated wake-up pattern at the FlexRay bus (see Chapter 7.2.1 and Chapter 7.2.2).
•   A wake-up pattern implemented in a standard FlexRay frame (see Chapter 7.2.3).
The Wake-up Detector is active in every mode of operation and works over the entire operating range as long
as uVBAT is in its functional range (see Table 20).
Detected wake-up events are analyzed by the Central State Machine and are compared with the overall device
status. They may cause a change of the operation mode (details see Chapter 9.5) and they may set a wake-up
flag or a wake-up bit (details see Chapter 7.3).
7.1           Local Wake-up
The TLE9221SX provides a local wake-up input WAKE, tailored to withstand voltages up to uVBAT(Max). Positive
and negative signal changes on the WAKE pin trigger the Wake-up Detector.
The WAKE input is provided with an internal pull-up and pull-down structure and an internal wake pulse filter
(see Figure 14).

Figure 14     Block diagram of the WAKE input
Depending on the signal at the WAKE input, either the pull-up structure or the pull-down structure is
connected to the WAKE input. While a voltage uVWAKE > uBDWakeThr is applied to the WAKE input, the internal
pull-up structure is connected to the WAKE input. Conversely, while a voltage uVWAKE < uBDWakeThr is applied
to the WAKE input, the internal pull-down structure is activated (see Figure 15).

Figure 16     Local wake-up falling edge
The TLE9221SX detects a falling edge (signal change from uVBAT to GND) at the WAKE pin, followed by a “low”
signal for the time period dBDWakePulseFilter as a local wake-up event (see Figure 16). The implemented
filter time dBDWakePulseFilter avoids that spikes at the WAKE signal are considered as valid wake-up events.
In BD_Sleep mode, BD_Standby mode and during the BD_GoToSleep command the state machine of the
TLE9221SX sets the local wake-up bit (bit 0) in the SIR (active logical “low”), when detecting a local wake-up
event. In non-low power modes, the detection of a local wake-up event is ignored and no status bit is set.
Together with the local wake-up bit, the TLE9221SX also sets the wake-up flag (active logical “low”). The wake-
up source bit (bit 12) remains at logical “high”, when a local wake-up event is detected.
In low power modes or in the BD_GoToSleep command an active wake-up flag is indicated at the RxD and
RxEN output within the time period dBDWakeupReactionlocal (see Table 5). In case the transceiver is in

BD_Sleep mode, an active wake-up flag also triggers a mode change to BD_Standby mode (for details see
Table 17).
A local wake-up signal can be detected by the TLE9221SX only if the power supply uVBAT is available. The
detection of a local wake-up is working over the whole operating range of uVBAT (for details see Table 20).
The ERRN output indicates the wake-up event after the time dBDWakeLocal:
dBDWakeLocal = dBDWakePulseFilter + dBDWakeupReactionlocal
7.1.2        Local Wake-up Rising Edge
The WAKE input on the TLE9221SX is a bi-sensitive input and also a rising edge (signal change from GND to
uVBAT) at the pin WAKE is detected as a wake-up event (see Figure 17).
As on a local wake-up, triggered by a falling edge at the input pin WAKE, a rising edge also sets the local wake-
up bit and the wake-up flag respectively.
The internal state machine does not differentiate between a local wake-up triggered by a rising edge and a
falling edge at the pin WAKE. There is no possibility of distinguishing between the rising and falling edge, since
only one SIR entry is available.

7.2          Remote Wake-up
For a remote wake-up, also called bus wake-up, a dedicated wake-up pattern is defined in FlexRay systems. A
wake-up pattern consists of at least two wake-up symbols. A wake-up symbol on the FlexRay bus is defined as
a phase of “Data_0” followed by a phase of “Idle” or alternatively a phase of “Data_0” followed by a phase of
“Data_1”. Bus wake-up patterns are detected by the Wake-up Detector and fed to the internal state machine.
The remote wake-up bit (bit 1) in the SIR is set, if the TLE9221SX detects a remote wake-up event in a low
power mode or during the BD_GoToSleep command, regardless of whether the wake-up was triggered by a
standard wake-up pattern or triggered by an alternative wake-up pattern or by a wake-up signal via payload.
At the same time that it sets the remote wake-up bit, the TLE9221SX also sets the wake-up flag and the wake-
up source bit. In non-low power modes, the detection of a remote wake-up event is ignored and neither the
remote wake-up bit nor the wake-up flag is set.

In low power modes or in the BD_GoToSleep command, an active wake-up flag is indicated at the RxD and
RxEN outputs within the time period dBDWakeupReactionremote (see Figure 18 and Table 5). In case the
transceiver remains in BD_Sleep mode an active wake-up flag also triggers a mode change to BD_Standby
mode (for details see Table 20).
To detect a remote wake-up event, at least one of the two power supplies needs to be available.
7.2.1         Standard Wake-up Pattern
The standard wake-up pattern is defined by at least two wake-up symbols starting with “Data_0”, followed by
an “Idle” signal. The pulse width for the “Data_0” needs to be at least t = dWU0Detect or longer. The pulse width
for the “Idle” phase shall not be below t = dWUIdleDetect. The maximum time for the standard wake-up pattern
shall not exceed t = dWUTimeout (see Figure 18). The pulse width for “Data_0” may vary between the two wake-
up symbols as long as the pulse width is not below t = dWU0Detect and the standard wake-up pattern does not
exceed t = dWUTimeout. Variation of the pulse width of the “Idle” phase is possible with the same limitations. The
standard wake-up pattern is independent of the data transmission rate.
The Wake-up Detector of the TLE9221SX distinguishes between “Data_0” and “Idle” by the differential bus
voltage. The bus voltage below the threshold uDATA0_LP is identified as a “Data_0” signal and the bus voltage
above the threshold uDATA0_LP is identified as an “Idle” or a “Data_1” signal. The Wake-up Detector does not
differentiate between an “Idle” or a “Data_1” signal.

7.2.2         Alternative Wake-up Pattern
The definition of the alternative wake-up pattern is similar to that of the standard wake-up pattern, the only
difference is that the wake-up symbols have no “Idle” signal. The “Idle” signal is replaced by a “Data_1” signal
(see Figure 19). The timing requirements for pulse width and time-out are the same as for the standard wake-
up pattern. The alternative wake-up pattern is also independent of the data rate.

7.2.3         Wake-up by Payload
Besides sending a dedicated wake-up pattern on the FlexRay bus, it is also possible to wake up the TLE9221SX
with a wake-up message hidden in the data field of the standard FlexRay frame, called wake-up by payload.
In comparison to the wake-up by standard pattern or to the wake-up with an alternative pattern, the wake-up
by payload is limited to a data transmission rate of 10 Mbit/s.
A dedicated Byte Start Sequence is transmitted before each byte of the payload within the FlexRay data
frame.The Byte Start Sequence (BSS) consists of one “high” bit followed by one “low” bit. To transmit a
“Data_0” byte to the FlexRay bus, the FlexRay controller sends 10 bits. First a “high” bit as part of the Byte Start
Sequence, followed by a “low” bit which also belongs to the Byte Start Sequence and after the Byte Start
Sequence, the controller sends eight “low” bits (HL= BSS; LLLLLLLL= “Data_0”). Sending a “Data_1” byte the
FlexRay controller sends a “high” bit followed by a “low” bit and then sends eight consecutive “high” bits (HL=
BSS; HHHHHHHH= “Data_1”) (see Figure 20).
At a data rate of 10 Mbit/s, one bit in the FlexRay data frame has a bit length of 100 ns. This means that each
data byte in a wake-up pattern has one glitch of 100 ns.
The Wake-up Detector of TLE9221SX has an analog input filter implemented, which filters out the glitches on
the wake-up pattern for glitches shorter than t = dWUInterrupt.
Receiving a complete wake-up by payload, the TLE9221SX sets the remote wake-up bit, the wake-up flag and
also the wake-up source bit. The wake-up flag is set in case the following data pattern is detected in a FlexRay
frame.

7.3           Wake-up Flag and Wake-up Bits
The wake-up flag and the SIR latch the wake-up event and allow an external microcontroller to read out the
wake-up source. The TLE9221SX provides three bits in the SIR for the wake-up information:
•   The local wake-up bit (bit 0)
•   The remote wake-up bit (bit 1)
•   The wake-up source bit (bit 12)
Even if the Wake-up detector is active in every operation mode, the wake-up bits can only be set in low power
mode or in the BD_GoToSleep command. In every other operation mode no wake-up bit is set (see Table 11).
The local wake-up bit is set in case the TLE9221SX detects a local wake-up event and in case of a remote wake-
up event the remote wake-up bit is set. A remote wake-up can be a wake-up either by a standard pattern, a
wake-up by an alternative pattern or a wake-up by payload.
In case the TLE9221SX detects a local and a remote wake-up event, both entries in the SIR bits are set.

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Wake-up Detector
Concurrent with the local wake-up bit or with the remote wake-up bit, the wake-up source bit and the wake-
up flag are set. The wake-up source bit is “high” when detecting a local wake-up event and “low” when a
remote wake-up event is detected. Only the first wake-up event is indicated in the wake-up source bit. In case
the TLE9221SX detects a local and a remote wake-up event simultaneously, the wake-up source bit output
indicates the remote wake-up event.
The SIR is reset either after a complete read-out of the SIR (see Chapter 6.2.3) or when the TLE9221SX enters
into BD_Normal mode. The wake-up flag is reset if both bits, the local wake-up bit and the remote wake-up bit
are reset.
The wake-up flag and the wake-up source bit are indicated at the ERRN output pin of the Host Interface (see
Table 9).

Figure 21   Block diagram of Power Supply Interface
The Central State Machine is the main logic control unit of the TLE9221SX. All functions, including operation
mode management, the diagnostic function and failure management are controlled and handled by the
Central State Machine. To ensure correct failure management, the Central State Machine is the first function
block which is powered up and the last function block which is powered down. For this reason, the Central
State Machine is supplied by an internal supply uVIN (see Figure 21).
The internal supply uVIN is in its operational range, if at least one of the two power supplies, uVCC or uVBAT, is
above their power-down threshold, uBDBPVBAT or uVBDPDVCC.
Note:       The reference voltage uVIO is the level shift supply for all digital inputs and outputs. It is not
            connected with the internal supply of the central state machine. Nevertheless, if the reference
            voltage uVIO is not available or in undervoltage condition, the internal state machine blocks all host
            commands and changes the mode of operation to a low power mode.

8.1          INH Output
The INH output signal is intended to control an external voltage regulator. When the FlexRay transceiver
TLE9221SX is in BD_Sleep mode, the INH output is open and floating. In every other operation mode the INH
output voltage is uINH1Not-Sleep. The voltage uINH1Not-Sleep is derived from the power supply uVBAT by an internal
open drain transistor (see Figure 22).
The transceiver TLE9221SX signals “Sleep” at the INH pin, while the device is in BD_Sleep mode and
“Not_Sleep” in any other mode of operation (BD_Standby, BD_Normal, BD_ReceiveOnly and the
BD_GoToSleep command).

8.2          BD_Off and Undervoltage
The FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX monitors the two power supplies uVCC and uVBat and also the reference
voltage uVIO. In case one of the three voltages falls below its dedicated undervoltage detection threshold, the
TLE9221SX changes its mode of operation to low power mode (see Figure 23). For undervoltage condition, the
Central State Machine is still functional.

The BD_Off state of the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX is reached, if both power supplies, uVBAT and uVCC are
below the power-down thresholds uBDPDVBAT and uBDPDVCC. In comparison to undervoltage detection the
reference supply uVIO has no effect on the BD_Off state. Regardless of whether the uVIO voltage is available or
not, the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX always changes over to the power-down state BD_Off in case uVBAT
and uVCC are not present (see Figure 24).

Note:        When the transceiver TLE9221SX is in BD_Off state, the Central State Machine is powered down. All
             registers in TLE9221SX are built of volatile memory and therefore, all status, diagnostic, and failure
             information is reset.
8.3          Undervoltage Events
8.3.1        Undervoltage Flags and Undervoltage Bits
Detected undervoltage events are stored using a dedicated undervoltage bit and they are visible in the SIR.
Along with the undervoltage bit a summary bit, the error bit (bit 11), is set. The error bit is indicated at the
ERRN output, depending on the selected operation mode (see Table 9 and the example in Figure 25).
The TLE9221SX provides three bits in the SIR to signal undervoltage events:
•   uVBAT undervoltage bit (bit 8)
•   uVCC undervoltage bit (bit 9)
•   uVIO undervoltage bit (bit 10)
Undervoltage bits are used to store the information for further use. Therefore undervoltage bits get cleared
only by a power-down or by clearing the SIR (see Chapter 6.2.3).
In comparison to the undervoltage bits, undervoltage flags are not latched and they are only used to trigger
the changes of the operation mode. Undervoltage flags are not visible externally.
An undervoltage event on any supply line directly sets the dedicated undervoltage bit and also the error bit.
The undervoltage flags are set by internal timers. An internal undervoltage detection timer is available for
every supply, uVBAT, uVCC and uVIO. While setting the undervoltage bit, the appropriate undervoltage detection
timer is also triggered. When the undervoltage detection timer expires, while the undervoltage event is still
present, the undervoltage flag is set (see Figure 25).
In case the undervoltage situation gets cleared while the undervoltage detection timer is running, the
TLE9221SX does not set the undervoltage flag. According to the mode change table, an active undervoltage
flag changes the mode of operation to low power mode (see
 and Table 16).

Figure 25      Example of setting the undervoltage flag
Besides the undervoltage detection timer, each supply is also equipped with an undervoltage recovery timer.
The undervoltage recovery timer starts when the external power supply recovers. When the undervoltage
recovery timer expires, the undervoltage flag gets reset (see Figure 25). If the external power supply recovers
only temporarily and the supply line falls back to the undervoltage situation while the undervoltage recovery
timer is still running, the undervoltage flag remains set. Clearing the undervoltage flag allows the transceiver
TLE9221SX to return from low power mode to the previous operational mode selected by the host command
(see Chapter 9.4 and Table 17).
Note:          Undervoltage bits are set by an undervoltage event. Undervoltage bits are stored in the SIR and also
               indicated at the ERRN output.
               Undervoltage flags are set by the undervoltage detection timer. Undervoltage flags are not visible
               in the SIR and they are not indicated at the ERRN output. Undervoltage flags are only used to change
               the mode of operation after the undervoltage detection timer has expired!
8.3.2          Undervoltage Event at uVBAT
The FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX considers a voltage fluctuation on the power supply uVBAT, which falls
below the detection threshold uBDUVVBAT and exceeds the blanking time dBDUVBAT_BLK, as an undervoltage
event. Voltage fluctuations on uVBAT shorter than dBDUVBAT_BLK are ignored and not recognized by the Power
Supply Interface. To indicate the undervoltage event on the supply voltage uVBAT, the uVBAT undervoltage bit
(bit 8) and the error bit (bit 11) are set (see Figure 26). After the uVBAT undervoltage detection timer dBDUVVBAT
expires, the uVBAT undervoltage flag is set and the mode of operation changes to BD_Sleep mode.
The Host Interface and the Communication Controller Interface are active while the dBDUVVBAT undervoltage
detection timer is running and the reference supply uVIO is present. When the dBDUVVBAT undervoltage
detection timer expires and the uVBAT undervoltage flag is set, the Host Interface and the Communication

Figure 26      Undervoltage event at uVBAT in non-low power mode
8.3.3          Undervoltage Event at uVCC
Power supply voltage fluctuations on the uVCC power supply, falling below the threshold uBDUVVCC for a time
longer than the blanking time dBDUVVCC_BLK, are considered as undervoltage events. Voltage fluctuations on
uVCC shorter than the time dBDUVCC_BLK are ignored and not recognized by the Power Supply Interface.
Detecting an undervoltage event on uVCC, the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX sets the uVCC undervoltage bit
(bit 9) and the error bit (bit 11) (see Figure 27). After the uVCC undervoltage detection timer dBDUVVCC expires,
the uVCC undervoltage flag is set, the mode of operation changes to BD_Standby mode.
The Host Interface remains active while the uVCC undervoltage detection timer is running and the reference
supply uVIO is present. Setting the uVCC undervoltage flag blocks the Host Interface and forces the mode of
operation to BD_Standby mode (compare also with Chapter 9.3 and Table 16).
While the power supply uVCC is in undervoltage condition, the TLE9221SX also disables the Transmitter and
sets the bus error bit (bit 4).

8.3.4           Undervoltage Event at uVIO
The Central State Machine of the TLE9221SX handles an undervoltage event at the reference supply uVIO in a
manner identical to an undervoltage event on the power supply uVBAT.
The supply on the level shift input VIO is the main reference for all digital inputs and outputs of the TLE9221SX.
It is also connected to the pad supply of the external microcontroller (see Figure 50). An undervoltage event
on the level shift input VIO could lead to a misinterpretation of the digital input levels and could generate a
false signal at the digital outputs.
For fail-safe reasons, the TLE9221SX blocks the Host Interface, the Communication Controller Interface and
the Bus Guardian Interface after a small processing time (dReactionTimeERRN) when an undervoltage event has
been detected on the reference supply uVIO (see Figure 28). According to Table 2, all digital inputs are set to
their default level. All digital outputs are set to logical “low”.
The transceiver TLE9221SX detects an undervoltage event, if the supply at the pin VIO drops for the time period
t > dBDUVVIO_BLK below the undervoltage detection threshold uUVIO (see Figure 28). Voltage fluctuations on
uVIO shorter than dBDUVCC_BLK are ignored and not recognized by the Power Supply Interface.
Although the Host Interface is blocked and the SIR is not accessible while the reference supply uVIO is in
undervoltage condition, the transceiver sets the uVIO undervoltage bit (bit 10) and the error bit (bit 11) (see
Figure 28). After the uVIO undervoltage detection timer dBDUVVIO expires, the uVIO undervoltage flag is set and
the mode of operation changes to BD_Sleep mode (compare also to Chapter 9.3 and Table 16).

Note:           While the TLE9221SX is in undervoltage condition at the reference supply uVIO, all digital outputs are
                set to “low”. The outputs do not reflect the status of the transceiver anymore.
                For example, wake-up events cannot be indicated at the ERRN, RxD, and RxEN output anymore,
                since these outputs are set permanently to “low”.
8.4             Power-up and Power-down
8.4.1           BD_Off State
BD_Off state is reached, when the transceiver does not receive any supply.
The transceiver TLE9221SX is in BD_Off state when the internal supply voltage uVIN is turned off and the
Central State Machine is powered down. When both power supplies, uVCC and uVBAT fall below their power-
down thresholds (uBDPDVBAT and uBDPDVCC), the internal supply is off and the BD_Off state is reached (see
Figure 29).
The status of the reference supply uVIO has no influence on the power-down sequence of the Flexray
transceiver TLE9221SX.
When the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX is in BD_Off state, all outputs are logical “low”, the Transmitter and
the Receiver are turned off and the wake-up functions are not operational. If the reference supply uVIO is
available, the inputs are set to their default values (compare with Table 2).

For the power-up, only the power supplies uVBAT and uVCC are significant. As soon as at least one power supply
is above its reset threshold the internal supply uVIN is available and the Central State Machine gets powered
up. The device TLE9221SX enters into BD_Standby mode within the time period dBDPowerUp as soon as the
voltage values of the power supplies uVBAT and uVCC are above their undervoltage detection threshold limits
uBDUVVBAT and uBDUVVCC (see Figure 30).

8.4.3       Interim BD_Standby Mode
As a safety measure, the TLE9221SX provides an Interim BD_Standby mode. Changeover to the
Interim_BD_Standby mode takes place during an incomplete power-up procedure (see Figure 31).
In Interim_BD_Standby mode, the TLE9221SX provides the same functions as in BD_Standby mode, except for
the host commands. The host commands are blocked in Interim BD_Standby mode. Therefore, a host
command cannot be used to change the mode of the TLE9221SX, while the power-up has not completed. With
switching over to the interim BD_Standby mode, at least one undervoltage detection timer is started. In case
the power-up is completed before the undervoltage detection timer expires, the TLE9221SX changes the
mode of operation to BD_Standby mode. In case the undervoltage detection timer expires before the power-
up is completed, the undervoltage flag is set depending on which power supply is missing, and the mode of
operation changes to low power mode (compare with Chapter 9.3).

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Operating Mode Description
9            Operating Mode Description
The FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX provides several different operating modes. The four main operating
modes are implemented to handle the requirements of a FlexRay ECU. Two product-specific interim operation
modes are implemented to guarantee secure mode changes even under failure conditions. The BD_Off state
describes the behavior of the TLE9221SX, while it is not supplied (see Table 12).
Table 12     Operating modes overview

9.1          Operating Mode Transitions Overview
Depending on the currently selected operating mode, several events can trigger a change of the operating
mode. The options are:
•   A valid host command at the Host Interface.
•   Setting an undervoltage flag, either for the power supplies uVBAT and uVCC or for the reference voltage uVIO.
•   Recovery from an undervoltage event, either for the power supplies uVBAT and uVCC or for the reference
    voltage uVIO.
•   Wake-up detection either on the FlexRay bus or on the local wake-input WAKE.
•   A power-up event at the power supplies uVBAT and uVCC.
It is not possible to change over to every operating mode by a trigger event. There are limitations and

Changeover can be made to every operation mode, except the BD_Sleep mode by a valid host command,
when no undervoltage flag is set. Changeover to BD_Sleep mode can be made only via the BD_GoToSleep
command (see Figure 32 and Table 14).

1) The table describes the states and signals of flags, operating modes and output pins. This table does not contain any timing information. Time for mode changes or the response
    time of the digital outputs are specified in the electrical characteristics (compare with Table 22).
2) All flags are “low” active. “L” means the flag is set. “X” = “don’t care”.
    The color red stands for the event which triggered the mode transition.
    For example: set “L” or set “H”.
    The color blue stands for the consequence of the trigger event.
    The numbers, “1 =>”, “2 =>” indicate the order of the consequences.
    For example: “1=> BD_Normal” means the transceiver TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Normal mode.
                   “2=> H” means the flag is cleared after the TLE9221SX has changed over to BD_Normal mode.
    “FB” stands for “Follow Bus” and means that depending on the signal on the FlexRay bus, the pins RxD and RxEN can either be “high” or “low”.
3) The wake-up flag stands for a detected wake-up event (compare with Chapter 7.3 and Table 10).
    The uVBAT flag is the same as the uVBAT undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVBAT undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
    The uVIO flag is the same as the uVIO undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVIO undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
    The uVCC flag is the same as the uVCC undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVCC undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
4) The ERRN output indicates the wake-up flag, the wake-up source bit and the error bit (compare with Table 9). The error bit is set only by the undervoltage bits, such as the uVBAT
    undervoltage bit (bit 8), the uVCC undervoltage bit (bit 9) and the uVIO undervoltage bit (bit 10). All other possible sources setting the error bit, such as, for example a bus failure or
    an overtemperature event, are considered as not set in this table.
5) The signal at the ERRN output pin depends on the host command applied and not on the current operating mode (compare with Chapter 6.3).
6) The signals at the RxD and RxEN outputs depend on the current operation mode, and are independent of the host command applied (compare with Table 5).
7) While TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Normal mode, the wake-up flag is cleared. Moreover, the wake-up flag cannot be set in non-low power mode, and therefore the wake-up flag
    is always “high” in BD_Normal mode (see Chapter 7.3).
8) The wake-up flag was set during a previous wake-up event while the TLE9221SX was in low power mode.
9) The interim mode will automatically be left to BD_Sleep when the timer dBDSleep expires. If the host command does not change within the time dBDSleep, the TLE9221SX changes
    over by default to BD_Sleep mode (see Chapter 9.2.1).
10) The BD_GoToSleep command cannot be executed while the wake-up flag is active (see Figure 34). The TLE9221SX changes over directly to BD_StandBy mode.

11) Since the BD_GoToSleep command can be executed only when the wake-up flag is cleared, the wake-up flag is always “high” while the TLE9221SX executes the BD_GoToSleep
    command.
12) If the host command BD_ReceiveOnly mode is applied, the ERRN output indicates the wake-up source bit (see Table 9).
13) The EN input pin of the Host Interface is disabled in BD_Sleep mode, as long the STBN input pin remains “low” (see Chapter 9.2.2).
14) A wake-up event would change the operation mode from BD_Sleep to BD_Standby, therefore, the wake-up flag is always “high” while the TLE9221SX remains in BD_Sleep mode.

FlexRay Transceiver
Operating Mode Description
9.2.1         Entering BD_Sleep Mode via the BD_GoToSleep Command
The BD_GoToSleep command can be executed from every non-low power mode and from BD_Standby mode
by applying the host command STBN = “L” and EN = “H”. The BD_GoToSleep command cannot be executed
from BD_Sleep mode (see Figure 32).
When the transceiver TLE9221SX recognizes the host command BD_GoToSleep, the TLE9221SX changes over
to the interim mode “BD_GoToSleep command” and starts an internal timer. In case the EN input and the
STBN input remain unchanged during the BD_Sleep mode detection window (t = dBDSleep), the operating
mode automatically changes over to BD_Sleep mode. The time for the mode change, dBDModeChange, is defined
as the time interval between applying the host command and changing over to BD_Sleep mode (see
Figure 33).

            All wake-up bits and the error bit are cleared, therefore the ERRN, RxD and RxEN outputs are “high”
Figure 33     Entering BD_Sleep mode
The BD_GoToSleep command can be executed only when the wake-up flag is cleared. When the wake-up flag
is cleared, the output pins RxD and RxEN are set to logical “high” in BD_Sleep mode and also during the
execution of the “BD_GoToSleep command”.
In case the changeover to BD_Sleep mode is made by a host command, the EN input is disabled in BD_Sleep
mode (see Figure 32, Figure 33 and Table 14).
Applying the BD_GoToSleep host command to the TLE9221SX, while the wake-up flag is active, changes the
operating mode directly to BD_Standby mode. The RxD and RxEN outputs are set to “low” and indicate a
previous wake-up event (see Figure 34 and Table 14).

Figure 34      Changing over to BD_Standby, with an active wake-up flag
9.2.2          Quitting BD_Sleep by Host Command
Changeover to BD_Sleep mode can be made by a host command or by an undervoltage event. In case
changeover to BD_Sleep was made by a host command via the BD_GoToSleep command, the EN input pin
gets disabled when the TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Sleep mode.
As long as the STBN input pin remains at logical “low”, any signal change at the EN input is ignored and does
not trigger any mode change. Signal change at the STBN input pin enables the EN input as well and a mode
change is possible.
Via a host command, BD_Sleep mode can only change to BD_Normal mode or to BD_ReceiveOnly mode (see
Figure 32 and Table 14).
9.3            Operating Mode Changeover by Undervoltage Flag
Besides a valid host command, any changeovers in the operating mode may also be triggered by setting the
undervoltage flag after the undervoltage detection timer has expired (compare with Chapter 8.3.1). Setting
the uVIO or the uVBAT undervoltage flag changes the mode of operation to BD_Sleep, and setting the uVCC
undervoltage flag changes the mode of operation to BD_Standby.
If the transceiver TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Sleep mode by setting the uVIO or uVBAT undervoltage flag,
the EN input pin remains active even in BD_Sleep mode.
In case any undervoltage flag becomes active, while the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX is executing the
BD_GoToSleep command, the mode of operation changes directly to BD_Sleep (see Table 15 and Figure 35).

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Operating Mode Description
1) The table describes the states and signals of flags, operating modes and output pins. This table does not contain any timing information. Time for mode changes or the response
    time of the digital outputs are specified in the electrical characteristics (compare with Table 22).
2) All flags are “low” active. “L” means the flag is set. “X” = “don’t care”.
    The color red stands for the event which triggered the mode transition.
    For example: set “L” or set “H”.
    The color blue stands for the consequence of the trigger event.
    The numbers, “1 =>”, “2 =>” indicate the order of the consequences.
    For example: “1=> BD_Normal” means the transceiver TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Normal mode.
                   “2=> H” means the flag is cleared after the TLE9221SX has changed over to BD_Normal mode.
    “FB” stands for “Follow Bus” and means that depending on the signal on the FlexRay bus, the pins RxD and RxEN can either be “high” or “low”.
3) The wake-up flag stands for a detected wake-up event (compare with Chapter 7.3 and Table 10).
    The uVBAT flag is the same as the uVBAT undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVBAT undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
    The uVIO flag is the same as the uVIO undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVIO undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
    The uVCC flag is the same as the uVCC undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVCC undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
4) The ERRN output indicates the wake-up flag, the wake-up source bit and the error bit (compare with Table 9). The error bit is set only by the undervoltage bits, such as the uVBAT
    undervoltage bit (bit 8), the uVCC undervoltage bit (bit 9) and the uVIO undervoltage bit (bit 10). All other possible sources setting the error bit, such as, for example a bus failure or
    an overtemperature event, are considered as not set in this table.
5) The signal at the ERRN output pin depends on the host command applied and not on the current operating mode (compare with Chapter 6.3).
6) The signals at the RxD and RxEN outputs depend on the current operation mode, and are independent of the host command applied (compare with Table 5).
7) While TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Normal mode, the wake-up flag is cleared. Moreover, the wake-up flag cannot be set in non-low power mode, and therefore the wake-up flag
    is always “high” in BD_Normal mode (see Chapter 7.3).
8) The uVBAT undervoltage flag overrules the uVCC undervoltage flag (see Chapter 9.3.1).
9) An undervoltage event at uVIO blocks the Host Interface at once and sets all outputs to logical “low” (see Chapter 8.3.4 and Figure 28). The transceiver TLE9221SX can not indicate
    the error bit and the wake-up flag.
10) The uVIO undervoltage flag overrules the uVCC undervoltage flag (see Chapter 9.3.1).
11) The wake-up flag was set during a previous wake-up event while the TLE9221SX was in low power mode.
12) If the host command BD_ReceiveOnly mode is applied, the ERRN indicates the wake-up source bit (see Table 9).
13) Since the BD_GoToSleep command can be executed only when the wake-up flag is cleared, the wake-up flag is always “high” while the TLE9221SX executes the BD_GoToSleep
    command.
14) The BD_GoToSleep command is considered as low power mode and the ERRN indicates the wake-up flag just as in the BD_Sleep or BD_Standby mode (see Table 9).

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Operating Mode Description
9.3.1        Priorities of Undervoltage Events
Even if there are undervoltage events on both power supplies uVBAT and uVCC, together with an undervoltage
event on the reference supply uVIO, the Central State Machine is operating and handles the undervoltage
events.
An undervoltage event on uVIO blocks the Host Interface at once and interrupts the communication before the
uVIO undervoltage timer expires. When the uVIO undervoltage timer expires, the TLE9221SX changes the mode
of operation to BD_Sleep. In case the uVCC undervoltage flag is set, the uVIO undervoltage flag overrules the
uVCC undervoltage flag.
If the uVCC undervoltage flag was set before the uVIO undervoltage flag, the mode of operation changes from
BD_Standby to BD_Sleep mode.
If the uVIO undervoltage flag was set before the uVCC undervoltage flag, the mode of operation remains in
BD_Sleep mode.
During an uVBAT undervoltage event, the Host Interface and also the Communication Controller Interface
continues to work until the undervoltage detection timer expires. The uVBAT undervoltage flag also overrules
a uVCC undervoltage flag and the transceiver TLE9221SX ends up in BD_Sleep mode. Simultaneous
undervoltage events at uVBAT and uVIO, additionally disable the Host Interface and the Communication
Controller Interface in comparison to a single uVBAT undervoltage event. After the undervoltage detection
timer expires, the TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Sleep mode.
The least significant undervoltage flag is the uVCC undervoltage flag. An active uVCC undervoltage flag changes
the mode of operation from non-low power mode to BD_Standby mode, when no other undervoltage flag is
set. During an uVCC undervoltage event the Transmitter is disabled.
9.4          Operating Mode Changes by Undervoltage Recovery
As stated in Chapter 8.3, any undervoltage flag causes a change in the operating mode and blocks the Host
Interface and the Communication Controller Interface.
After recovering from the undervoltage condition, and after the undervoltage flags are cleared, the FlexRay
transceiver TLE9221SX enables the Host Interface and also the Communication Controller Interface and the
host command applied at the inputs STBN and EN changes the mode of operation (see Figure 36 and
Table 16).
9.4.1        BD_Sleep Mode Entry Flag
A special case is the undervoltage recovery from BD_Sleep mode while the host command BD_Standby is
applied to the Host Interface.
The EN input pin will be disabled while the device is in BD_Sleep mode. A mode changeover via host command
from BD_Sleep mode to BD_Standby mode is not permitted (compare with Table 14). The transceiver
distinguishes the host command BD_Sleep from BD_Standby, after the transceiver recovers from an
undervoltage event.
The BD_Sleep mode entry flag indicates, how the changeover to BD_Sleep mode occurred. If changeover to
BD_Sleep mode took place by setting an undervoltage flag, the BDSME flag (BD_Sleep Mode Entry) is set to
“low” and the EN input pin remains active. If changeover to BD_Sleep mode took place by a host command,
the BDSME flag is set to logical “high” and the EN input pin gets disabled (see Table 16).
The BDSME is an internal flag and it is neither indicated at the ERRN output nor latched in the SIR.

1) The table describes the states and signals of flags, operating modes and output pins. This table does not contain any timing information. Time for mode changes or the response
   time of the digital outputs are specified in the electrical characteristics (compare with Table 22).
2) All flags are “low” active. “L” means the flag is set. “X” = “don’t care”.
   The color red stands for the event which triggered the mode transition.
   For example: set “L” or set “H”.
   The color blue stands for the consequence of the trigger event.
   The numbers, “1 =>”, “2 =>” indicate the order of the consequences.
   For example: “1=> BD_Normal” means the transceiver TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Normal mode.
                   “2=> H” means the flag is cleared after the TLE9221SX has changed over to BD_Normal mode.
   “FB” stands for “Follow Bus” and means that depending on the signal on the FlexRay bus, the pins RxD and RxEN can either be “high” or “low”.
3) The wake-up flag stands for a detected wake-up event (compare with Chapter 7.3 and Table 10).
   The uVBAT flag is the same as the uVBAT undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVBAT undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
   The uVIO flag is the same as the uVIO undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVIO undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
   The uVCC flag is the same as the uVCC undervoltage flag, which is set after the uVCC undervoltage detection timer expires (compare with Chapter 8.3.1).
4) The ERRN output indicates the wake-up flag, the wake-up source bit and the error bit (compare with Table 9). The error bit is set only by the undervoltage bits, such as the uVBAT
   undervoltage bit (bit 8), the uVCC undervoltage bit (bit 9) and the uVIO undervoltage bit (bit 10). All other possible sources setting the error bit, such as, for example, a bus failure or an
   overtemperature event, are considered as not set in this table.
5) BD_Sleep mode entry flag disables the EN input pin when set to logical “low” (see Chapter 9.4.1)
6) The signal at the ERRN output pin depends on the host command applied and not on the current operating mode (compare with Chapter 6.3).
7) The signals at the RxD and RxEN outputs depend on the current operating mode, and are independent of the host command applied (compare with Table 5).
8) While TLE9221SX changes over to BD_Normal mode the wake-up flag is cleared. Moreover, the wake-up flag cannot be set in non-low power mode, and therefore, the wake-up flag
   is always “high” in BD_Normal mode (see Chapter 7.3).

FlexRay Transceiver
Operating Mode Description
9) Changing over to BD_Normal mode clears the SIR, including the undervoltage bits and therefore sets the ERRN output to “high” (compare with Chapter 6.3.1).
10) BD_Sleep mode was either entered by a host command or by setting the uVBAT or uVIO undervoltage flag (see Table 15).
11) If the host command BD_ReceiveOnly mode is applied, the ERRN output indicates the wake-up source bit (see Table 9).
12) This assumes no wake-up event was detected and the wake-up flag is cleared.
13) The BDSME flag is cleared, changeover to BD_Sleep mode was made by a host command (see Chapter 9.4.1).
14) The BDSME flag is set, changeover to BD_Sleep mode was made by setting one or more undervoltage flags (see Chapter 9.4.1).
15) In BD_Standby mode, only the uVCC undervoltage flag could be active, since any other active undervoltage flag would change the mode of operation to BD_Sleep mode (compare
    with Table 15).
16) A wake-up flag could have been set by a wake-up event while the transceiver was in BD_Standby mode.

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Operating Mode Description
9.5          Operation Mode Changes by the Wake-up Flag
Setting the wake-up flag triggers a mode change to BD_Standby mode, regardless of the transceiver being in
BD_Sleep mode or in the BD_GoToSleep command. While the transceiver TLE9221SX remains in BD_Standby
mode, a wake-up event sets the wake-up bit and the wake-up flag. The wake-up flag is indicated at the ERRN,
RxD and RxEN outputs. No mode change by the wake-up event is applied (for details see Figure 37 and
Table 17).
The wake-up flag can be set only in BD_Sleep mode, BD Standby mode or while the BD_GoToSleep command
is being executed (for details see “Wake-up Flag and Wake-up Bits” on Page 29).
While the wake-up flag is active, the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX cannot change over to BD_Sleep mode
again (see Figure 34). To reset the wake-up flag, either change the operating mode of the TLE9221SX to
BD_Normal mode or read out the SIR.

Figure 37    Operating mode change by wake-up flag
Setting the wake-up flag triggers not only a change in the operating mode, but also clears all undervoltage
flags. The undervoltage bits available in the SIR remain active.
In case the undervoltage event remains present, setting the wake-up flag clears the undervoltage flag. The
undervoltage detection timer is restarted and the undervoltage flag is set again when the undervoltage
detection timer expires.
Note:        Setting the wake-up flag clears only the undervoltage flag, not the undervoltage bit. The
             undervoltage bit remains active and is visible in the SIR.

TLE9221SX
FlexRay Transceiver
Bus Error Indication
10             Bus Error Indication
In case the TLE9221SX is not able to drive the correct data to the FlexRay bus, the transceiver sets the bus error
bit (bit 4). The bus error bit indicates faulty data by setting the ERRN output to “low” (compare with Table 9).
Therefore, three different detection mechanisms are implemented:
•   uVCC undervoltage detection
•   RxD and TxD bit comparison
•   Overcurrent detection
Just as any other SIR entry, the bus error bit is reset either by a SIR read-out or by changing over to BD_Normal
mode (compare with Chapter 6.3.1 “Reset the ERRN Output Pin”).
Setting the bus error bit disables the Transmitter of the TLE9221SX in order to avoid corrupt data on the
FlexRay bus. An active bus error bit does not trigger any change in the mode of operation.
10.1           Setting the Bus Error Bit by uVCC Undervoltage
The Transmitter of the TLE9221SX is fed by the power supply uVCC (compare with Figure 2). In case uVCC is in
undervoltage condition, the TLE9221SX cannot drive the correct bus levels to the FlexRay bus. Therefore, the
transceiver sets the uVCC undervoltage bit together with the bus error bit and the error bit.
In BD_Normal mode, the active uVCC undervoltage bit and the active bus error bit disable the Transmitter. The
uVCC undervoltage bit starts the uVCC undervoltage timer and if the timer expires, the undervoltage flag is set
and a mode changeover is initiated (see also Chapter 8.3.3 “Undervoltage Event at uVCC”).
10.2           Setting the Bus Error Bit by RxD and TxD Comparison
The transceiver TLE9221SX compares the digital input signal at TxD with the signal received from the FlexRay
bus at the RxD output. If the data transmit signal at the TxD input is different from the signal received at the
RxD output, the TLE9221SX sets the bus error bit.
The RxD to TxD bit comparison is active only, when the transceiver TLE9221SX is in BD_Normal mode and the
Transmitter is active (TxEN = “low”; BGE = “high”). Both, the rising and the falling edge at the TxD input signal
trigger an internal comparator to compare the TxD signal with the RxD signal. The results are stored in an
internal error counter. When the internal error counter exceeds 10 reported comparison failures, the bus error
bit is set.
The error counter is reset when the Transmitter is reset.
10.3           Setting the Bus Error Bit by Overcurrent Detection
Four different current sensors monitor the output current and the input current at the pins BP and BM. In case
the TLE9221SX detects an overcurrent caused by a bus short-circuit either to GND or to one of the power
supplies, the TLE9221SX sets the bus error bit.

Overtemperature Protection
11           Overtemperature Protection
The Transmitter of TLE9221SX is protected against overheating with an internal temperature sensor (compare
with Figure 4). The temperature sensor provides two temperature thresholds: TJ(Warning) and TJ(Shut_Down).
On exceeding the lower threshold TJ(Warning), the transceiver sets the overtemperature warning bit (bit 6),
indicating a “high” temperature situation. On exceeding the upper threshold TJ(Shut_Down), the transceiver
TLE9221SX sets the overtemperature shut down bit (bit 5), indicating a critical temperature situation. On
reaching the TJ(Shut_Down) threshold, the transceiver TLE9221SX also disables the Transmitter (see Figure 38).
The overtemperature detection of the Transmitter is active only in BD_Normal mode. An overtemperature
detection event does not trigger any change in the operating mode.
Both bits, the overtemperature shut down bit and the overtemperature warning bit set the error bit (bit 11) in
the SIR. The error bit is indicated at the ERRN output (compare with Chapter 6.3 “Status Information at the
ERRN Output Pin”).
The Transmitter can be enabled again after an overtemperature event by clearing the SIR (see also
Chapter 6.2.3 “Clearing Sequence of SIR”).

Transmitter Time-out
12              Transmitter Time-out
To ensure that an active Transmitter blocks the FlexRay bus permanently, a time-out function is implemented
within the TLE9221SX. In case the Transmitter is active for the time period t > dBDTxActiveMax, the
Transmitter will be disabled automatically (see Figure 39). The Transmitter time-out sets the Transmitter
time-out bit (bit 7) in the SIR and also the error bit. In BD_Normal mode, the Transmitter time-out is indicated
at the ERRN output by a logical “low” signal. To reset the TxEN or BGE time-out, either change over again to
BD_Normal mode or read out the SIR (see Chapter 6.3.1 “Reset the ERRN Output Pin”).

Mode Indication, Power-up and Parity Information
13              Mode Indication, Power-up and Parity Information
13.1            Power-up Bit
After switching on the power supplies uVCC and uVBAT, the FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX sets the power-up
bit (bit 3) in the SIR. The power-up bit is visible only by reading out the SIR and will be reset by clearing the SIR
(see Chapter 6.2.3 “Clearing Sequence of SIR”).
13.2            Mode Indication Bit EN and Mode Indication Bit STBN
Two bits in the SIR are reserved for the indication of the operating mode. The SIR indicates the current mode
of operation, regardless of whether the mode is selected via host command, undervoltage flag or wake-up
flag. The mode indication bits have the same order as the host commands. Bit 13 of the SIR reflects the related
host command at the EN pin of the actual mode of operation and bit 14 indicates the related host command
at the STBN pin (compare with Table 18).

BD_GoToSleep                       no read-out possible                        no read-out possible
13.3            Even Parity Bit
The even parity bit (bit 15) can be used to check the transmission of the SIR. The even parity bit is set to logical
“low” if the sum of all status bits is even, and it is logical “high” if the sum of all status bits is odd.

16.4            Operating Temperature
The FlexRay transceiver TLE9221SX is qualified for temperature Grade 1 (-40°C to +125°C ambient operating
temperature) according to AEC - Q100. Grade 1 according AEC - Q100 is equivalent to the ambient
temperature for class 1 TAMB_Class1 .
Infineon specifies for the electrical characteristics (see Table 21) the junction temperature TJunction. The
ambient temperature can be calculated with the power dissipation and the thermal resistance RthJA (see
Figure 49).
                          TJ = TA + RthJA x Pd
                          TA = TJ - RthJA x Pd
                          with:
                          TA          = ambient temperature
                          TJ          = junction temperature
                          Pd          = power dissipation of the FlexRay transceiver
                          RthJA       = thermal resistance junction to ambient
