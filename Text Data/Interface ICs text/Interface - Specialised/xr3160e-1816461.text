GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                          FEATURES
The XR3160 is an advanced multiprotocol transceiver                           Pin Compatible Upgrade for MAX3160 (20 SSOP)
supporting RS-232, RS-485, and RS-422 serial                                  IEC Level 4 ESD Protection
standards. Full operation requires only four external
charge pump capacitors.                                                          ■  ±15kV IEC 61000-4-2 Air Gap Discharge
                                                                                 ■  ± 8kV IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge
The RS-485/RS-232 pin selects RS-485 mode when
high and RS-232 mode when low. The HALF/FULL                                     ■  ±15kV Human Body Model (HBM)
pin configures the RS-485 modes as either half or full                        20Mbps RS-485 and 1Mbps RS-232 Data Rates
duplex.
                                                                              Pin-Selectable 250kbps Slew Limiting
The high speed drivers operate up to 20Mbps in RS-
485/422 modes, and up to 1Mbps in RS-232 mode.                                Single Supply Operation from +3V to +5.5V
All drivers can be slew limited to 250kbps in any                             2 Drivers, 2 Receivers RS-232/V.28
mode to minimize electromagnetic interference (EMI)
by setting the dedicated SLEW pin low.                                        1 Driver, 1 Receiver RS-485/422
                                                                                 ■  Full or Half Duplex Configuration
All transmitter outputs and receiver inputs feature
robust electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection to                              ■  1/8th Unit Load, up to 256 receivers on bus
±15kV IEC 61000-4-2 Airgap, ±15kV Human Body                                  RS-485/422 Enhanced Receiver Fail-safe for open,
Model (HBM) and ±8kV IEC 61000-4-2 Contact. Each                               shorted, or terminated but idle inputs
receiver output has full fail-safe protection to avoid
system lockup, oscillation, or indeterminate states by                        10nA Shutdown Supply Current (typical)
defaulting to logic-high output level when the inputs
are open, shorted, or terminated but undriven. No
external biasing resistors are required.                                     TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
The RS-232 receiver inputs include a 5k pull-down                            Software Programmable Serial Ports
to ground when in RS-232 mode. The RS-485/422                                  (RS-232, RS-422, RS-485)
receiver inputs are high impedance (>96k), allowing                          Embedded and Industrial PCs (IPC)
up to 256 devices on a single communication bus
(1/8th unit load).                                                            Process Control Equipment
The XR3160 operates from a single power supply,                               Point-Of-Sales Equipment
3V to 5.5V, with low idle current. The shutdown mode                          Networking Equipment
consumes less than 1µA in low power standby
operation with RS-232 receivers enabled.                                      HVAC Controls Equipment
                                                                              Building Security and Automation

PRODUCT SUMMARY
The XR3160 is an advanced multiprotocol transceiver supporting RS-232, RS-485, and RS-422 serial
standards. Full operation requires only four external charge pump capacitors.
ENHANCED FAILSAFE
The enhanced failsafe feature of the XR3160 guarantees a logic-high receiver output when the receiver inputs
are open, shorted, or terminated but idle/undriven. The enhanced failsafe interprets 0V differential as a logic
high with a minimum 50mV noise margin, while maintaining compliance with the EIA/TIA-485 standard of
±200mV. No external biasing resistors are required, further easing the usage of multiple protocols over a single
connector.
±15kV ESD PROTECTION
ESD protection structures are incorporated on all pins to protect against electrostatic discharges encountered
during handling and assembly. The bus pins (driver outputs and receiver inputs) have extra protection
structures, which have been tested up to ±15kV without damage. These structures withstand high ESD in all
states: normal operation, in shutdown, and when powered off.
ESD protection is be tested in various ways. MaxLinear uses the following methods to qualify the protection
structures designed into XR3160:
          ±8kV using IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge
          ±15kV using IEC 61000-4-2 Airgap Discharge
          ±15kV using the Human Body Model (HBM)
The IEC 61000-4-2 standard is more rigorous than HBM, resulting in lower voltage levels compared with HBM
for the same level of ESD protection. Because IEC 61000-4-2 specifies a lower series resistance, the peak
current is higher than HBM. The XR3160 has passed both HBM and IEC 61000-4-2 testing without damage.
