Serial Control Interface
The HMC677LP5(E) contains a 3-wire SPI compatible digital interface (DATA, CLK, LE). It is activated when P/S
is kept high. The 6-bit serial word must be loaded MSB first. The positive-edge sensitive CLK and LE requires
clean transitions. Standard logic families work well. When LE is high, 6-bit data in the serial input register is transferred
to the outputs. When LE is high CLK is masked to prevent data transition during output loading.
When P/S is low, 3-wire SPI interface inputs (DATA, CLK, LE) are disabled and the serial input register is loaded
asynchronously with parallel digital inputs (I0-I5). When LE is high, 6-bit parallel data is transferred.
For all modes of operations, the outputs will stay constant while LE is kept low.

Parallel Mode (Direct Parallel Mode & Latched Parallel Mode)
Note: The parallel mode is enabled when P/S is set to low.
Direct Parallel Mode - Outputs are changed by the Control Voltage Inputs directly. The LE (Latch Enable) must be at
a logic high to control in this manner.
Latched Parallel Mode - Outputs are selected using the Control Voltage Inputs and set while the LE is in the Low
state. This will not change state while LE is Low. Once all Control Voltage Inputs are at the desired states the LE is
pulsed. See timing diagram above for reference.
