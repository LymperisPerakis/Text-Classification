                  Rev. 6 — 28 November 2012                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1080A is a FlexRay transceiver that is fully compliant with the FlexRay electrical
              physical layer specification V2.1 Rev. A (see Ref. 1). In addition, it incorporates features
              and parameters included in V3.0.1 (see Ref. 2 and Section 14). It is primarily intended for
              communication systems from 1 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s, and provides an advanced interface
              between the protocol controller and the physical bus in a FlexRay network.
              The TJA1080A can be configured to be used as an active star transceiver or as a node
              transceiver.
              The TJA1080A provides differential transmit capability to the network and differential
              receive capability to the FlexRay controller. It offers excellent EMC performance as well as
              high ESD protection.
              The TJA1080A actively monitors the system performance using dedicated error and
              status information (readable by any microcontroller), as well as internal voltage and
              temperature monitoring.
              The TJA1080A supports the mode control as used in NXP Semiconductors TJA1054
              (see Ref. 3) and TJA1041 (see Ref. 4) CAN transceivers.
              The TJA1080A is the next step up from the TJA1080 FlexRay transceiver (Ref. 5). Being
              fully pin compatible and offering the same excellent ESD protection, the TJA1080A also
              features:
                •  Improved power-on reset concept
                •  Improved ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME)
                •  Support of 60 ns minimum bit time
                •  Improved bus error detection functionality
              This makes the TJA1080A an excellent choice in any kind of FlexRay node.
              See Section 14 for a detailed overview of differences between the TJA1080 and the
              TJA1080A.

6. Functional description
                       The block diagram of the total transceiver is illustrated in Figure 1.
                   6.1 Operating configurations
                6.1.1 Node configuration
                       In node configuration the transceiver operates as a stand-alone transceiver.
                       The transceiver can be configured as node by connecting pins TRXD0 and TRXD1 to
                       ground during a power-on situation (PWON flag is set). The configuration will be latched
                       when the PWON flag is reset, see Section 6.7.4.
                       The following operating modes are available:
                          •  Normal (normal power mode)
                          •  Receive-only (normal power mode)
                          •  Standby (low power mode)
                          •  Go-to-sleep (low power mode)
                          •  Sleep (low power mode)
                6.1.2 Star configuration
                       In star configuration the transceiver operates as a branch of a FlexRay active star.
                       The transceiver can be configured as star by connecting pin TRXD0 or TRXD1 to VBUF
                       during a PWON situation (PWON flag is set). The configuration will be latched when the
                       PWON flag is reset, see Section 6.7.4 “Power-on flag”.
                       It is possible to redirect data from one branch to other branches via the inner bus. It is also
                       possible to send data to all branches via pin TXD, if pins TXEN and BGE have the correct
                       polarity.
                       The following operating modes are available:
                          •  Star-idle (normal power mode)
                          •  Star-transmit (normal power mode)
                          •  Star-receive (normal power mode)
                          •  Star-sleep (low power mode)
                          •  Star-standby (low power mode)
                          •  Star-locked (normal power mode)
                       In the star configuration all modes are autonomously controlled by the transceiver, except
                       in the case of a wake-up.

                     6.1.3 Bus activity and idle detection
                              The following mechanisms for activity and idle detection are valid for node and star
                              configurations in normal power modes:
                                • If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than Vi(dif)det(act) for
                                   tdet(act)(bus), then activity is detected on the bus lines and pin RXEN is switched to
                                   LOW which results in pin RXD being released:
                                   – If, after bus activity detection, the differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than
                                       VIH(dif), pin RXD will go HIGH
                                   – If, after bus activity detection, the differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than
                                       VIL(dif), pin RXD will go LOW
                                • If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than Vi(dif)det(act) for
                                   tdet(idle)(bus), then idle is detected on the bus lines and pin RXEN is switched to HIGH.
                                   This results in pin RXD being blocked (pin RXD is switched to HIGH or stays HIGH)
                              Additionally, in star configuration, activity and idle can be detected (see Figure 6 for state
                              transitions due to activity/idle detection in star configuration):
                                • If pin TXEN is LOW for longer than tdet(act)(TXEN), activity is detected on pin TXEN
                                • If pin TXEN is HIGH for longer than tdet(idle)(TXEN), idle is detected on pin TXEN
                                • If pin TRXD0 or TRXD1 is LOW for longer than tdet(act)(TRXD), activity is detected on
                                   pins TRXD0 and TRXD1
                                • If pin TRXD0 and TRXD1 is HIGH for longer than tdet(idle)(TRXD), idle is detected on
                                   pins TRXD0 and TRXD1
                       6.2 Operating modes in node configuration
                              The TJA1080A provides two control pins STBN and EN in order to select one of the
                              modes of operation in node configuration. See Table 3 for a detailed description of the pin
                              signalling in node configuration, and Figure 3 for the timing diagram.
                              All mode transitions are controlled via pins EN and STBN unless an undervoltage
                              condition is present.
                              If VIO and (VBUF or VBAT) are within their operating ranges, pin ERRN indicates the status
                              of the error flag. Operating ranges are: VBAT = 6.5 V to 60 V, VCC = 4.75 V to 5.25 V,
                              VBUF = 4.75 V to 5.25 V and VIO = 2.2 V to 5.25 V.

                                                                                                                  FlexRay transceiver
                6.2.1 Normal mode
                      In Normal mode the transceiver is able to transmit and receive data via the bus lines BP
                      and BM. The output of the normal receiver is directly connected to pin RXD.
                      The transmitter behavior in Normal mode of operation, with no time-out present on pins
                      TXEN and BGE and the temperature flag not set, is given in Table 8.
                      In this mode pins INH1 and INH2 are set HIGH.
                      Table 8.   Transmitter function table
                       BGE     TXEN        TXD             Transmitter
                       L       X           X               transmitter is disabled
                       X       H           X               transmitter is disabled
                       H       L           H               transmitter is enabled; the bus lines are actively driven; BP is driven
                                                           HIGH and BM is driven LOW
                       H       L           L               transmitter is enabled; the bus lines are actively driven; BP is driven
                                                           LOW and BM is driven HIGH
                6.2.2 Receive-only mode
                      In Receive-only mode the transceiver can only receive data. The transmitter is disabled,
                      regardless of the voltages on pins BGE and TXEN.
                      In this mode pins INH1 and INH2 are set HIGH.
                6.2.3 Standby mode
                      In Standby mode the transceiver has entered a low power mode which means very low
                      current consumption. In the Standby mode the device is not able to transmit or receive
                      data and the low power receiver is activated to monitor for bus wake-up patterns.
                      Standby mode can be entered if the correct polarity is applied to pins EN and STBN (see
                      Figure 5 and Table 4) or an undervoltage is present on pin VCC; see Figure 5.
                      In this mode, pin INH1 is set HIGH.
                      If the wake flag is set, pin INH2 is set to HIGH and pins RXEN and RXD are set to LOW,
                      otherwise pin INH2 is floating and pins RXEN and RXD are set to HIGH; see Section 6.5.
                6.2.4 Go-to-sleep mode
                      In this mode the transceiver behaves as in Standby mode. If this mode is selected for a
                      longer time than the go-to-sleep hold time parameter (minimum hold time) and the wake
                      flag has been previously cleared, the transceiver will enter Sleep mode, regardless of the
                      voltage on pin EN.

                                                                                                                                             FlexRay transceiver
                     6.2.5 Sleep mode
                              In Sleep mode the transceiver has entered a low power mode. The only difference with
                              Standby mode is that pin INH1 is also set floating. Sleep mode is also entered if the UVVIO
                              or UVVBAT flag is set.
                              In case of an undervoltage on pin VCC or VBAT while VIO is present, the wake flag is set by
                              a positive edge on pin STBN.
                              The undervoltage flags will be reset by setting the wake flag, and therefore the transceiver
                              will enter the mode indicated on pins EN and STBN if VIO is present.
                              A detailed description of the wake-up mechanism is given in Section 6.5.
                       6.3 Operating modes in star configuration
                              In star configuration mode control via pins EN and STBN is not possible. The transceiver
                              autonomously controls the operating modes except in the case of wake-up.
                              The timing diagram of a transceiver configured in star configuration is illustrated in
                              Figure 7. The state diagram in star configuration is illustrated in Figure 6. A detailed
                              description of the pin signalling in star configuration is given in Table 9.
                              If VIO and (VBUF or VBAT) are within their operating ranges, pin ERRN indicates the status
                              of the error flag. Operating ranges are: VBAT = 6.5 V to 60 V, VCC = 4.75 V to 5.25 V,
                              VBUF = 4.75 V to 5.25 V and VIO = 2.2 V to 5.25 V.

[1]   Pin ERRN provides a serial interface for retrieving diagnostic information.

[3]   TRXD lines are switched as input if TRXD activity is the initiator for Star-transmit mode.
[4]   Valid if VIO and (VBUF or VBAT) are present.
                              Pin BGE must be HIGH in order to enable the transmitter via pin TXEN. If pin BGE is
                              LOW, it is not possible to activate the transmitter via pin TXEN. If pin TXEN is not used (no
                              controller connected to the transceiver), it has to be connected to pin GND in order to
                              prevent TXEN activity detection.
                              In all normal modes pin RXD is connected to the output of the normal mode receiver and
                              therefore represents the data on the bus lines.

                 6.3.1 Star-idle mode
                        This mode is entered if one of the following events occurs:
                          • From Star-receive mode and Star-transmit mode if idle is detected on the bus lines, on
                              pin TXEN and on pins TRXD0 and TRXD1.
                          • If the transceiver is in Star-locked mode and idle is detected on the bus lines and pin
                              TXEN for longer than tto(locked-idle).
                          • If the transceiver is in Star-standby mode and the wake flag is set or no undervoltage
                              is present.
                          • If the transceiver is in Star-sleep mode and the wake flag is set, the transceiver enters
                              Star-idle mode in order to obtain a stable starting point (no glitches on the bus lines
                              etc.).
                        In Star-idle mode the transceiver monitors pins TXEN, TRXD0 and TRXD1 and the bus
                        lines for activity. In this mode the transmitter is disabled.

                6.3.2 Star-transmit mode
                      This mode is entered if one of the following events occur:
                         • If the transceiver is in Star-idle mode and activity is detected on pin TXEN.
                         • If the transceiver is in Star-idle mode and activity is detected on pins TRXD0 and
                           TRXD1.
                      In Star-transmit mode the transmitter is enabled and the transceiver can transmit data on
                      the bus lines and on the TRXD lines. It transmits the data received on pins TXD or TRXD0
                      and TRXD1, depending on where activity is detected:
                         • If activity is detected on the TRXD lines, the transceiver transmits data from pins
                           TRXD0 and TRXD1 to the bus.
                         • If activity is detected on the TXEN, the transceiver transmits data from pin TXD to the
                           bus and to the TRXD lines.
                6.3.3 Star-receive mode
                      This mode is entered if the transceiver is in Star-idle mode and activity has been detected
                      on the bus lines.
                      In Star-receive mode the transceiver transmits data received on the bus via the TRXD0
                      and TRXD1 lines to other transceivers connected to the TRXD lines. The transmitter is
                      always disabled. RXD, which represents the data on the bus lines, is output at TRXD0 and
                      TRXD1.
                6.3.4 Star-standby mode
                      This mode is entered if one of the following events occur:
                         • From Star-idle, Star-transmit or Star-receive modes if the wake flag is set and an
                           undervoltage on pin VCC is present for longer than tto(uv)(VCC).
                         • If the PWON flag is set.
                      In Star-standby mode the transceiver has entered a low power mode. In this mode the
                      current consumption is as low as possible to prevent discharging the capacitor at pin
                      VBUF.
                      If pins VIO and VBUF are within their operating range, pins RXD and RXEN will indicate the
                      wake flag.

                                                                                                                    FlexRay transceiver
                6.3.5 Star-sleep mode
                       This mode is entered if one of the following events occur:
                          • From any mode if an undervoltage on pin VCC is present for longer than tdet(uv)(VCC).
                          • If the transceiver is in Star-idle mode and no activity is detected on the bus lines and
                            pins TXEN, TRXD0 and TRXD1 for longer than tto(idle-sleep).
                          • If Star-locked mode is active for longer than tto(locked-sleep).
                       In Star-sleep mode the transceiver has entered a low power mode. In this mode the
                       current consumption is as low as possible to prevent the car battery from discharging. The
                       inhibit switches are switched off.
                       In this mode the wake flag wakes the transceiver. A detailed description of the wake-up
                       mechanism is given in Section 6.5.
                       If pins VIO and VBUF are within their operating range, pins RXD and RXEN will indicate the
                       wake flag.
                6.3.6 Star-locked mode
                       This mode is entered if one of the following events occur:
                          • If the transceiver is in Star-transmit mode and activity on pin TXEN is detected for
                            longer than tto(tx-locked).
                          • If the transceiver is in Star-receive mode and activity is detected on the bus lines for
                            longer than tto(rx-locked).
                       This mode is a fail-silent mode and in this mode the transmitter is disabled.
                   6.4 Start-up
                       The TJA1080A initialization is independent of the way the voltage supplies VBAT, VCC and
                       VIO ramp up. A dedicated power-up sequence is not necessary.
                6.4.1 Node configuration
                       Node configuration can be selected by applying a voltage lower than 0.3VBUF to pins
                       TRXD0 and TRXD1 during power-on. Node configuration is latched by resetting the
                       PWON flag while the voltage on pins TRXD0 and TRXD1 is lower than 0.3VBUF; see
                       Section 6.7.4 for (re)setting the PWON flag.
                6.4.2 Star configuration
                       Star configuration can be selected by applying a voltage higher than 0.7VBUF to pins
                       TRXD0 or TRXD1 during power-on. Star configuration is latched by resetting the PWON
                       flag while one of the voltages on pins TRXD0 or TRXD1 is higher than 0.7VBUF. See

                   6.5 Wake-up mechanism
                6.5.1 Node configuration
                       In Sleep mode (pins INH1 and INH2 are switched off), the transceiver will enter Standby
                       mode or Go-to-sleep mode (depending on the value at pin EN), if the wake flag is set.
                       Consequently, pins INH1 and INH2 are switched on.
                       If no undervoltage is present on pins VIO and VBAT, the transceiver switches immediately
                       to the mode indicated on pins EN and STBN.
                       In Standby, Go-to-sleep and Sleep modes pins RXD and RXEN are driven LOW if the
                       wake flag is set.
                6.5.2 Star configuration
                       In Star-sleep mode (pins INH1 and INH2 are switched off), the transceiver will enter
                       Star-idle mode (pins INH1 and INH2 are switched on) if the wake flag is set. After entering
                       Star-idle mode the transceiver monitors for activity to choose the appropriate mode
                       transition (see Figure 6).
                6.5.3 Remote wake-up
               6.5.3.1 Bus wake-up via wake-up pattern
                       Bus wake-up is detected if two consecutive DATA_0 of at least tdet(wake)DATA_0 separated
                       by an idle or DATA_1 of at least tdet(wake)idle, followed by an idle or DATA_1 of at least
                       tdet(wake)idle are present on the bus lines within tdet(wake)tot.
                                                                                                                tdet(wake)tot

               6.5.3.2 Bus wake-up via dedicated FlexRay data frame
                       The reception of a dedicated data frame, emulating a valid wake-up pattern, as shown in
                       Figure 9, sets the wake-up flag of the TJA1080A.
                       Due to the Byte Start Sequence (BSS), preceding each byte, the DATA_0 and DATA_1
                       phases for the wake-up symbol are interrupted every 1 s. For 10 Mbit/s the maximum
                       interruption time is 130 ns. Such interruptions do not prevent the transceiver from
                       recognizing the wake-up pattern in the payload of a data frame.
                       The wake-up flag will not be set upon reception of an invalid wake-up pattern.

                            If the voltage on pin WAKE is lower than Vth(det)(WAKE) for longer than twake(WAKE) (falling
                            edge on pin WAKE) a local wake-up event on pin WAKE is detected. At the same time,
                            the biasing of this pin is switched to pull-down.
                            If the voltage on pin WAKE is higher than Vth(det)(WAKE) for longer than twake(WAKE), the

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  TJA1080A
                                                                                                                    FlexRay transceiver
                   6.6 Fail silent behavior
                       In order to be fail silent, undervoltage detection and a reset mechanism for the digital state
                       machine is implemented.
                       If an undervoltage is detected on pins VCC, VIO and/or VBAT, the transceiver will enter a
                       low power mode. This ensures a passive and defined behavior of the transmitter and
                       receiver in case of an undervoltage detection.
                       In the region between the minimum operating voltage and the undervoltage detection
                       threshold, the principle function of the transmitter and receiver is maintained. However, in
                       this region parameters (e.g. thresholds and delays of the transmitter and receiver) may
                       deviate from the range specified for the operating range.
                       The digital state machine is supplied by VCC, VIO or VBAT, depending on which voltage is
                       available. Therefore, the digital state machine will be properly supplied as long as the
                       voltage on pin VCC or pin VIO remains above 4.75 V or the voltage on pin VBAT remains
                       above 6.5 V.
                       If the voltage on all pins VCC, VIO and VBAT breaks down, a reset signal will be given to the
                       digital state machine as soon as the internal supply voltage for the digital state machine is
                       not sufficient for proper operation of the state machine. This ensures a passive and
                       defined behavior of the digital state machine in case of an overall supply voltage
                       breakdown.
                6.6.1 VBAT undervoltage
                          • Node configuration: If the UVVBAT flag is set the transceiver will enter Sleep mode
                            (pins INH1 and INH2 are switched off) regardless of the voltage present on pins EN
                            and STBN. If the undervoltage recovers the wake flag will be set and the transceiver
                            will enter the mode determined by the voltages on pins EN and STBN.
                          • Star configuration: The TJA1080A in star configuration is able to transmit and receive
                            data as long as VCC and VIO are within their operating ranges, regardless of the
                            undervoltage on VBAT.
                6.6.2 VCC undervoltage
                          • Node configuration: If the UVVCC flag is set the transceiver will enter the Standby
                            mode (pin INH2 is switched off) regardless of the voltage present on pins EN and
                            STBN. If the undervoltage recovers or the wake flag is set mode switching via pins EN
                            and STBN is possible.
                          • Star configuration: If the UVVCC flag is set the transceiver will enter the Star-sleep
                            mode.
                6.6.3 VIO undervoltage
                          • Node configuration: If the voltage on pin VIO is lower than Vuvd(VIO) (even if the UVVIO
                            flag is reset) pins EN, STBN, TXD and BGE are set LOW (internally) and pin TXEN is
                            set HIGH (internally). If the UVVIO flag is set the transceiver will enter Sleep mode
                            (pins INH1 and INH2 are switched off). If the undervoltage recovers or the wake flag is
                            set, mode switching via pins EN and STBN is possible.

                         • Star configuration: If an undervoltage is present on pin VIO (even if the UVVIO flag is
                            reset) pins EN, STBN, TXD and BGE are set LOW (internally) and pin TXEN is set
                            HIGH (internally). If the UVVIO flag is set, pin INH1 is switched off. If an undervoltage
                            is present on pin VIO and VCC is within the operating range, the TJA1080A will forward
                            the received data on TRXD or bus lines to all other branches.
                   6.7 Flags
                6.7.1 Local wake-up source flag
                       The local wake-up source flag can only be set in a low power mode. When a wake-up
                       event on pin WAKE is detected (see Section 6.5.4) it sets the local wake-up source flag.
                       The local wake-up source flag is reset by entering a low power mode.
                6.7.2 Remote wake-up source flag
                       The remote wake-up source flag can only be set in a low power mode if pin VBAT is within
                       its operating range. When a remote wake-up event is detected on the bus lines (see
                       Section 6.5.3) it sets the remote wake-up source flag. The remote wake-up source flag is
                       reset by entering a low power mode.
                6.7.3 Wake flag
                       The wake flag is set if one of the following events occurs:
                         •  The local or remote wake-up source flag is set (edge sensitive)
                         •  A positive edge is detected on pin STBN if VIO is present
                         •  Recovery of the UVVBAT flag (only in node configuration)
                         •  By recognizing activity on pins TRXD0 and TRXD1 (only in star configuration)
                       In node configuration the wake flag is reset by entering Normal mode, a low power mode
                       or setting one of the undervoltage flags. In star configuration the wake flag is reset by
                       entering a low power mode or by recovery of the UVVCC signal (without trec(uv)(VCC)).
                6.7.4 Power-on flag
                       The PWON flag is set if the internal supply voltage for the digital part becomes higher than
                       the lowest value it needs to operate. In node configuration, entering Normal mode resets
                       the PWON flag. In star configuration the PWON flag is reset when the UVVCC signal goes
                       LOW (no undervoltage detected).
                6.7.5 Node configuration flag
                       Configuration flag set means node configuration.
                6.7.6 Temperature medium flag
                       The temperature medium flag is set if the junction temperature exceeds Tj(warn)(medium) in a
                       normal power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range. The temperature medium
                       flag is reset when the junction temperature drops below Tj(warn)(medium) in a normal power
                       mode with pin VBAT within its operating range or after a read of the status register in a low
                       power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range. No action will be taken if this flag
                       is set.

                                                                                                                    FlexRay transceiver
                6.7.7 Temperature high flag
                      The temperature high flag is set if the junction temperature exceeds Tj(dis)(high) in a normal
                      power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range.
                      In node configuration the temperature high flag is reset if a negative edge is applied to pin
                      TXEN while the junction temperature is lower than Tj(dis)(high) in a normal power mode with
                      pin VBAT within its operating range. In star configuration, the temperature high flag is reset
                      by any activity detection (edge) while the junction temperature is lower than Tj(dis)(high) in a
                      normal power mode while pin VBAT is within its operating range.
                      If the temperature high flag is set the transmitter is disabled and pins TRXD0 and TRXD1
                      are switched off.
                6.7.8 TXEN_BGE clamped flag
                      The TXEN_BGE clamped flag is set if pin TXEN is LOW and pin BGE is HIGH for longer
                      than tdetCL(TXEN_BGE). The TXEN_BGE clamped flag is reset if pin TXEN is HIGH or pin
                      BGE is LOW. If the TXEN_BGE flag is set, the transmitter is disabled.
                6.7.9 Bus error flag
                      The bus error flag is set if pin TXEN is LOW and pin BGE is HIGH and the data received
                      from the bus lines (pins BP and BM) is different to that received on pin TXD. Additionally
                      in star configuration the bus error flag is also set if the data received on the bus lines is
                      different to that received on pins TRXD0 and TRXD1. The transmission of any valid
                      communication element, including a wake-up pattern, does not lead to bus error
                      indication.
                      The error flag is reset if the data on the bus lines (pins BP and BM) is the same as on pin
                      TXD or if the transmitter is disabled. No action will be taken if the bus error flag is set.
               6.7.10 UVVBAT flag
                      The UVVBAT flag is set if the voltage on pin VBAT is lower than Vuvd(VBAT). The UVVBAT flag
                      is reset if the voltage is higher than Vuvd(VBAT) or by setting the wake flag; see
                      Section 6.6.1.
               6.7.11 UVVCC flag
                      The UVVCC flag is set if the voltage on pin VCC is lower than Vuvd(VCC) for longer than
                      tdet(uv)(VCC). The flag is reset if the voltage on pin VCC is higher than Vuvd(VCC) for longer
                      than trec(uv)(VCC) or the wake flag is set; see Section 6.6.2.
               6.7.12 UVVIO flag
                      The UVVIO flag is set if the voltage on pin VIO is lower than Vuvd(VIO) for longer than
                      tdet(uv)(VIO). The flag is reset if the voltage on pin VIO is higher than Vuvd(VIO) or the wake
                      flag is set; see Section 6.6.3.
               6.7.13 Error flag
                      The error flag is set if one of the status bits S4 to S12 is set. The error flag is reset if none
                      of the S4 to S12 status bits are set; see Table 10.

                   6.8 TRXD collision
                        A TRXD collision is detected when both TRXD lines are LOW for more than the TRXD
                        collision detection time (tdet(col)(TRXD)) in star configuration.
                   6.9 Status register
                        The status register can be read out on pin ERRN by using pin EN as clock; the status bits
                        are given in Table 10. The timing diagram is illustrated in Figure 11.
                        The status register is accessible if:
                          • UVVIO flag is not set and the voltage on pin VIO is between 4.75 V and 5.25 V
                          • UVVCC flag is not set and the voltage on pin VIO is between 2.2 V and 4.75 V
                        After reading the status register, if no edge is detected on pin EN for longer than tdet(EN),
                        the status bits (S4 to S12) will be cleared if the corresponding flag has been reset. Pin
                        ERRN is LOW if the corresponding status bit is set.

[1]   Current flows from VCC to VBUF. This means that the maximum sum current ICC + IBUF is 35 mA.
[2]   These values are based on measurements taken on several samples (less than 10 pieces). These measurements have taken place in
      the laboratory and have been done at Tamb = 25 C and Tamb = 125 C. No characterization has been done for these parameters. No
      industrial test will be performed on production products.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 17) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 15 and 16

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 17.
