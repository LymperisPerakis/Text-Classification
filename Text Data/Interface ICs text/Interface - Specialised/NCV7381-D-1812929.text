NCV7381
FlexRay) Transceiver,
Clamp 30
  NCV7381 is a single−channel FlexRay bus driver compliant with
the FlexRay Electrical Physical Layer Specification Rev. 3.0.1,
                                                                                         www.onsemi.com
capable of communicating at speeds of up to 10 Mbit/s. It provides
differential transmit and receive capability between a wired FlexRay
communication medium on one side and a protocol controller and
a host on the other side.
  NCV7381 mode control functionality is optimized for nodes
permanently connected to car battery.
  It offers excellent EMC and ESD performance.

Internal Flags
  The NCV7381 control logic uses a number of internal flags (i.e. one−bit memories) reflecting important conditions or events.
Table 3 summarizes the individual flags and the conditions that lead to a set or reset of the flags.
