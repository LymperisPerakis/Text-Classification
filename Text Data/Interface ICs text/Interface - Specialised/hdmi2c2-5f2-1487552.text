1               Functional description
                The HDMI2C2-5F2 is a fully integrated ESD protection and signal conditioning device for control stage of HDMI
                receivers (sink).
                The component offers two bidirectional buffers, integrating signal conditioning dynamic pull-up on DDC bus for
                maximum system robustness and signal integrity. These buffers embed also a protection to prevent from
                connector backdrive current from connector.
                ENABLE_IC function is available to sense 5 V power supply presence from HDMI connector.
                On top of 5 V sensing, Enable_IC can be used to switch off our device even if 5V_IN is present.
                All these features are provided in a single 10 bumps WLCSP package featuring natural PCB routing, cost
                optimization and saving space on the board.
                The HDMI2C2-5F2 is a simple solution that provides HDMI designers with an easy and fast way to reach full
                compliance with the stringent HDMI CTS on a wide temperature range. STMicroelectronics proposes also a large
                range of High Speed ESD protections and common mode filter (ECMF series) dedicated to the TMDS lanes
                giving the flexibility to the designer to filter and protect these (high speed video link against ESD strikes and EMC
                issues.

2.1               DDC bus description
                  The DDC bus is described in the HDMI standards as the display data channel. The topology corresponds to an
                  I2C bus that must be compliant with the I2C bus specification UM10204 revision 5 (October 2012). The DDC bus
                  is made of 2 lines; data line (SDA) and clock line (SCL). It is used to create a point to point communication link
                  from the source to the sink. EEDID and HDCP protocols are especially flowing through this link, making this I2C
                  communication channel a key element in the HDMI application.
                  The DDC block integrated in the HDMI2C2-5F2 allows a bidirectional communication between the cable and the
                  ASIC. It is fully compliant with the HDMI 2.0 standard (I2C bus specification) and its CTS, and with the I2C bus
                  specification version 2.1. It is shifting the 5 V voltage from the cable (V5V_IN) down to the ASIC voltage level
                  (VDD_IC) that can be as low as 1.8 V.
                  The Figure 2. DDC buffer functional diagram (SCL and SDA lines) shows the functional diagram of the DDC block
                  integrated in the HDMI2C2-5F2 device.

                  Capacitance measured at the HDMI connector output is equal to the sum of HDMI2C2-5F2 capacitance plus bus
                  capacitance between HDMI2C2-5F2 and HDMI connector output. Thanks to the internal structure of the
                  integrated DDC block, measured capacitance is equal to the input capacitance and then independent from the IC
                  actual capacitance. For compliance test, capacitance on DDC bus must be measured with HDMI2C2-5F2
                  powered on.
                  The HDMI standard specifies that the max capacitance of the cable can reach up to 700 pF. Knowing that the max
                  capacitance of the source input can reach up to 50 pF, this means that the I2C buffer must be able to drive a load
                  capacitance up to 750 pF. On the other hand, the I2C standard specifies a maximum rise time (30%-70%) of the
                  signal must be lower than 1 µs in order to keep the signal integrity. Taking into account the max cable capacitance
                  of 750 pF, it is not possible to guarantee a rise time lower than 1µs in worst case.
                  Therefore, a dynamic pull-up has been integrated at the output of SDA and SCL lines and synchronized with the
                  I2C driver. This signal booster accelerates for a short period the charging time of the equivalent cable
                  capacitance, allowing driving any HDMI cable.
                  The Figure 4. Benefit of the dynamic pull-up on the DDC bus illustrates the benefit of the dynamic pull-up
                  integrated in the HDMI2C2-5F2 device.

                ENABLE_IC function is available to sense 5 V power supply presence from HDMI connector.
                On top of 5 V sensing, Enable_IC can be used to switch off our device even if 5V_IN is present.
                Following conditions are required:
                •     The Enable function senses the 5V_IN power supply and provides a logic flag on the ENABLE_IC pin:
                      –    ENABLE_IC = "1" (VDD_IC) : V5V_IN > VDD_5V_ON (VDD_5V_ON = 3.8 V (see Table 3))
                      –    ENABLE_IC = "0": V5V_IN > VDD_5V_ON
                •     The ENABLE_IC pin is also an enables / disables input:
                      –    ENABLE_IC = "1" (VDD_IC) : V5V_IN > VDD_5V_ON and the circuit is enabled
                      –    ENABLE_IC = forced at "0": The circuit is disabled (low quiescent) whatever V5V_IN

                Thanks to the innovative switch architecture, when the ENABLE_IC input is set at a low level, backdrive current is
                blocked when backdrive current is coming from DDC lines.
