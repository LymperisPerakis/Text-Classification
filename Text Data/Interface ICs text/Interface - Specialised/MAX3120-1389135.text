          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: All supply current measurements are made under the following conditions: no load at all outputs, input voltages at GND or
        VCC, no PIN diode input current.
Note 2: Equivalent input current noise is calculated by dividing the output noise of the transimpedance amplifier by the midband
        transimpedance gain.
Note 3: Sensitivity is measured with an IrDA-compliant input signal, where the data rate is within the Supported Data Rate, rise/fall
        times are less than 600ns, and pulse widths are between 1.41µs and 3/16 of the baud rate.

          system requirements, the Hewlett Packard HSDL-4220
          or the Temic TSHF5400 IR LEDs are two appropriate
          choices.
          Appropriate PIN photodiode selection is extremely
          important to system performance. The PIN diode must
          generate at least 200nA (minimum sensitivity of the
          MAX3120) of current when aimed ±15° off-axis with an
          incident irradiance of 4µW/cm2. Use the following equa-
          tion to determine if the Temic BPV22NF meets these
          requirements:
