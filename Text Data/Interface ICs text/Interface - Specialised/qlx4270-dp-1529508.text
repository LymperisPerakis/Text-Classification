      DT            1      Detection Threshold. Reference DC CURRENT threshold for input signal power detection. Data
                           output Out[k] is muted when the power of the equalized version of In[k] falls below the threshold.
                           Tie to ground to disable electrical idle preservation and always enable the limiting amplifier.
   IN1[P,N]       2, 3     Equalizer 1 differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least
                           4GHz frequency response is recommended.
     VDD     4, 7, 10, 29, Power supply. 1.2V supply voltage. The use of parallel 100pF and 10nF decoupling capacitors to
                32, 35     ground is recommended for each of these pins for broad high-frequency noise suppression.
   IN2[P,N]       5, 6     Equalizer 2 differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least
                           4GHz frequency response is recommended.

NOTES:
 4. After channel loss, differential amplitudes at QLx4270-DP inputs must meet the input voltage range specified in “Absolute
    Maximum Ratings” on page 4.
 5. Temperature = +25°C, VDD = 1.2V.
 6. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted
    signal (as measured at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJpp + 14.1 x RJRMS.
 7. Measured using a PRBS 27-1 pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent,
    media-induced loss only.
 8. Rise and fall times measured using a 1GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.

About Q:Active®
Historically, cable manufacturers have relied on
thick wire gauge cables to deliver Deep Color
images to the monitors and projectors. However,
these cables are bulky, unwieldy and esthetically
unappealing. To address this, Intersil has
developed its groundbreaking Q:ACTIVE® product
line. By integrating its analog ICs inside DisplayPort
cables, Intersil is able to achieve unsurpassed
improvements in cable gauges, reach and
transmitted image quality.
