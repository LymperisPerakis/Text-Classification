NCN8026A
Compact Low Power Smart
Card Interface IC
  The NCN8026A is a compact and cost−effective single SIM &
smart card interface IC. It can be used with 1.8 V, 3 V and 5 V IC
cards. The card VCC supply is provided by a built−in very low drop
out and low noise Regulator. The NCN8026A offers enhanced                                         www.onsemi.com

(QFN24)   Name    Type                                                  Description
   6       CI/O  Input/  This pin handles the connection to the serial I/O (C7) of the card connector. A bi−directional level
                 Output  translator adapts the serial I/O signal between the card and the micro controller. A 11 kW (typical) pull
                         up resistor to CVCC provides a High impedance state for the smart card I/O link.
   7     CAUX2   Input/  This pin handles the connection to the chip card’s serial auxiliary AUX2 I/O pin (C8). A bi−directional
                 Output  level translator adapts the serial I/O signal between the card and the micro controller. A 11 kW
                         (typical) pull up resistor to CVCC provides a High impedance state for the smart card C8 pin.
   8     CAUX1   Input/  This pin handles the connection to the chip card’s serial auxiliary AUX1 I/O pin (C4). A bi−directional
                 Output  level translator adapts the serial I/O signal between the card and the micro controller. A 11 kW
                         (typical) pull up resistor to CVCC provides a High impedance state for the smart card C4 pin.
   9      CCLK   Output  This pin is connected to the CLOCK card connector’s pin (Chip card’s pin C3). The Clock signal
                         comes from the CLKIN input through clock dividers and level shifter.
  10      CRST   Output  This pin is connected to the chip card’s RESET pin (C2) through the card connector. A level
                         translator adapts the external Reset (RSTIN) signal to the smart card.
   11     CVCC   Power   This pin is connected to the smart card power supply pin (C1). An internal low dropout regulator is
                 Output  programmable using the pins VSEL0 and VSEL1 to supply either 5 V or 3 V or 1.8 V output voltage.
                         An external distributed ceramic capacitor ranging from 80 nF to 1.2 mF recommended must be
                         connected across CVCC and CGND. This set of capacitor (if distributed) must be low ESR (<
                         100 mW).

                         unused.
  13    CMDVCC    Input  Command VCC pin. Activation sequence Enable/Disable pin (active Low). The activation sequence is
                         enabled by toggling CMDVCC High to Low and when a card is present. When CMDVCC = High, the
                         CVCC output is pulled low and the internal LDO is disabled unless the device has been latched by
                         the CS pin.
  14     RSTIN    Input  This Reset input connected to the host and referred to VDD (microcontroller side), is connected to
                         the smart card Reset pin through the internal level shifter which translates the level according to the
                         CVCC programmed value.
  15       VDD   Power   This pin is connected to the system controller power supply. It configures the level shifter input stage
                  input  to accept the signals coming from the controller. A 0.1 mF decoupling capacitor shall be used. When
                         VDD is below 1.45 V typical the card pins are disabled.
  16      GND   Ground   Ground
  17       INT   Output  The interrupt request is activated LOW on this pin. This is enabled when a card is present and the
                         card presence is detected by PRES or PRES pins. Similarly an interrupt is generated when CVCC is
                         overloaded. Inverter output (An open−drain output configuration with 50 kW pull−up resistor is
                         available under request (metal change)).

                 Output  serial I/O signal between the smart card and the external controller. A built−in constant 11 kW
                         (typical) resistor provides a high impedance state.
  20     AUX1uc  Input / This pin is connected to an external micro−controller. A bi−directional level translator adapts the
                 Output  serial C4 signal between the smart card and the external controller. A built−in constant 11 kW (typical)
                         resistor provides a high impedance state.
  21     AUX2uc  Input / This pin is connected to an external micro−controller. A bi−directional level translator adapts the
                 Output  serial C8 signal between the smart card and the external controller. A built−in constant 11 kW (typical)
                         resistor provides a high impedance state.
