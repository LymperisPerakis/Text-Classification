        Please refer to the following parameter of the electrical characteristic about (Note 1) and (Note 2).
        (Note 1): Wakeup pulse detection LO time, (Note 2): Wakeup input detection time (TXD)
        While using master, CLK becomes input pin, and uses to input BUS clock in CODEC mode
  Power OFF Mode
        “Power OFF Mode” reduces power consumption by not supplying powers to any circuits other than necessary ones for
        “Wakeup pulse detection (BUS)” and “Wakeup input detection (TXD)”.
        When TXD is “H”, Wakeup input is detected, and then changes to “Through mode”. In the case of shifts to “Power OFF
        Mode”, TXD is “L”, and then NSLP is “L”.
        “Through Mode” and “RX Through mode” cannot change to “Power OFF Mode” directly. Please change via “CODEC Mode”
        with NSLP as “H”.
  Through Mode
        “Through mode” does not process Coding/Decoding. It only drives signals from TXD to BUS and from BUS to RXD
        directly.
        Please change to “Through mode” with TXD as “H” to send Wakeup pulse.
  RX Through Mode
        “RX Through Mode” reverses RXD output at each rising edge of BUS.
        Please monitor the change of RXD to detect Wakeup pulse in “Power OFF Mode”,.
  CODEC Mode
        “CODEC Mode” is the mode of CXPI communication. NSLP should be “H” for the chip to enter “CODEC Mode”.
        Outputs in the case of Master setting are changed by the falling edge of CLK, and in the case of Slave setting are changed
        by the falling edge of BUS. BUS signal is delayed 2.0±0.5Tbit from TXD input, and RXD is delayed 1.0±0.5Tbit from BUS
        input.
        The jitter of CLK input should satisfy the CXPI standard (±1.0%) including the effect of BD41000AFJ-C (±0.05%) in the
        case of Master setting.

BD41000AFJ-C
  Sequence Diagram
       It shows the example of BD41000AFJ-C control sequence (“Sleep Mode”, “Standby Mode” and “Normal Mode”)
       corresponding to the CXPI standard. (Please refer to the CXPI standard for specifications about the detail of mode
       management.)
    1.    The Sequence from “Normal Mode” to “Sleep Mode”
          When changing to “Sleep Mode”, NSLP should be switched from “H” to “L”, and then the IC turns to “Power OFF Mode”.
          TXD has built-in pull-down resistor in case of a fail-safe. In “Sleep Mode”, set TXD to “L” before BD41000AFJ-C enters
          “Power OFF Mode” to prevent extra currents from MCU side.
          Set CLK to “L” just like TXD, because the pull-down resister of CLK is active in the case of Master setting.

    2.  The Sequence from “Sleep Mode” to “Normal Mode” (Master Node Trigger)
        To wake up the node by an internal factor, set NSLP to “H” for the chip to enter “CODEC Mode”. TXD should be “H” for
        about 30µs before changing from “Power OFF Mode” to “CODEC Mode” in order to prevent abnormal outputs of BUS or
        RXD.
        In the case of slave mode, BD41000AFJ-C reverses RXD output at every rising edge of BUS signal after receiving BUS
        clock. When detecting first RXD falling edge, please start micro controller initializing operation. To establish wakeup
        pulse, please check if RXD output is “H” or detect RXD rising edge after initializing operation.
        To change from “Standby Mode” to “Sleep Mode” because the slave node cannot receive the second rising pulse within
        the specified time, please return to “Power OFF Mode” with NSLP as “L” again after the change to “CODEC Mode” with
        NSLP as “H”.

    3.  The Sequence from “Sleep Mode” to “Normal Mode” (Slave Node Trigger)
        To wake up the slave node by an internal factor, set TXD to “H” for the chip to enter “Through Mode”.
        After receiving the wakeup pulse in the Master Node, RXD output reverses at every rising edge of the BUS signal. It is
        better to establish Wakeup at clock’s first falling edge.
        To change from “Standby Mode” to “Sleep Mode”, in case the master node cannot receive BUS clock within the
        specified time, set NSLP to “L” to return to “Power OFF Mode” then enter to “CODEC Mode” by setting NSLP to “H”.

BD41000AFJ-C
  Arbitration Function
      To carry out collision resolution functions that defined by CXPI specification, both micro controller and BD41000AFJ-C
      share functions. Basically, BD41000AFJ-C arbitrates between UART bit data and micro controller arbitrates between
      UART byte data.
  1.  In case of collision is happened by transmitting from other node at the same time
      In the case of collision (arbitration defeat) after data transmission by other node on BUS, it stops the transmission of
      remaining UART flame data at the collision. It is necessary to have the interval 1Tbit or more (BUS baud rate period) to

  2.  In case of collision is detected by receiving from other node before transmission is started.
      BD41000AFJ-C has built-in function to stop transmission upon detection of BUS data collision.
      When the signal is detected on BUS before the start of transmit data, BD41000AFJ-C stops to transmit data for 10 Tbit
      period, and then while stopping to transmit data, if TXD signal is inputted to BD41000AFJ-C, BD41000AFJ-C stops to
      transmit data for further 10 Tbit period of the transmit data.

BD41000AFJ-C
  3.  In case of collision function failure is happed when micro controller outputs transmission data to BD41000AFJ-C
      between the outside range of BD41000AFJ-C arbitration function.
      BUS output is delayed 2.5 Tbit(Max.) from TXD input and RXD output is delayed 1.5 Tbit(Max.) from BUS input.
      When micro controller outputs transmission data to BD41000AFJ-C at the timing that shown in Figure 17,
      CXPI frame of other node is destroyed because BD41000AFJ-C outputs PID just after receive PID.
      Micro controller should stop transmission data to BD41000AFJ-C while receiving UART data.
      Figure 17 shows the example in case of 2.0 Tbit delay from TXD input to BUS output and 1.0 Tbit delay from BUS input to
      RXD output.

  Fail-safe Mode
      BD41000AFJ-C has built in fail-safe mode such as DTC (TXD Dominant Abnormal Detection Circuit), TSD (Abnormal
      Thermal Detection Circuit) and UVLO/POR (Abnormal Under Voltage Detection Circuit).
      The operations of each abnormality situation are as follows;

     (Note 1) In the case of TXD fixed L, Logical value0 is outputted only in first 10bit. Logical value1 is outputted before DTC abnormality is detected.
      When “L” time of TXD is more than TDTC, DTC (Dominant Timeout Counter) detects abnormality, and then it stops output. It
      can retune to normal status with TXD as “H”
      When the junction temperature exceeds TTSD, TSD (Thermal Shutdown) circuit detects abnormality, and then it stops
      output. It can return to normal status when the temperature drops below TTSD_HYS.
      Operations of UVLO (Under Voltage Lockout) and POR (Power ON Reset) are as follows;
      When supply voltage drops below VUVLO, UVLO abnormality is detected, and then BUS, RXD and CLK outputs are fixed
      Hi-Z (H). (Only slave)
      When power supply exceeds VUVLO, transceiver restarts output. When supply voltage drops below VPOR, POR abnormality
      is detected, and then it changes to “Power OFF Mode”, and reset status.

    Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
    between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is operated over
    the absolute maximum ratings.

Operational Notes
     1.    Reverse Connection of Power Supply
           Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
           connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
           supply pins.
     2.    Power Supply Lines
           Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at
           all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
           capacitors.
     3.    Ground Voltage
           Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
     4.    Ground Wiring Pattern
           When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
           connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
           ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
           on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
     5.    Thermal Consideration
           Should by any chance the maximum junction temperature rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may
           result in deterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the
           board size and copper area to prevent exceeding the maximum junction temperature rating.
     6.    Recommended Operating Conditions
           These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained.
           The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
     7.    Inrush Current
           When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
           instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
           supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and
           routing of connections.
     8.    Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
           Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
     9.    Testing on Application Boards
           When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
           subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
           should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
           process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
           transport and storage.
     10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
           Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
           damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
           Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
           unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
     11. Unused Input Pins
           Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
           extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
           charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
           cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
           power supply or ground line.

     12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
           This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
           isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
           parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
           Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
           interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
           operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be
           avoided.

     13. Ceramic Capacitor
           When using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with
           temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
     14. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
           Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and the maximum junction temperature rating are all within
           the Area of Safe Operation (ASO).
     15. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
           This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
           be within the IC’s maximum junction temperature rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the
           junction temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF all output pins. When the Tj falls
           below the TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
           Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
           circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
           heat damage.

    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are not designed under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below.
        Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the
        use of any ROHM’s Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our
        Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent
        verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                  H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (Exclude cases where no-clean type fluxes is used.
                 However, recommend sufficiently about the residue.); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble
                 cleaning agents for cleaning residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse, is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification
