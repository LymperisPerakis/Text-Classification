The SP3508 is a monolithic device that supports eight (8) popular serial interface standards
for Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity. The SP3508 is fabricated using a low power
BiCMOS process technology, and incorporates a regulated charge pump allowing +3.3V only
operation. Exar's patented charge pump provides a regulated output of +5.5V, which will
provide enough voltage for compliant operation in all modes. Eight (8) drivers and eight (8)
receivers can be configured via software for any of the above interface modes at any time.
The SP3508 requires no additional external components for compliant operation for all of the
eight (8) modes of operation other than six capacitors used for the internal charge pump. All
necessary termination is integrated within the SP3508 and is switchable when V.35 drivers
and V.35 receivers, or when V.11 receivers are used. The SP3508 provides the controls and
transceiver availability for operating as either a DTE or DCE.
Additional features with the SP3508 include internal loopback that can be initiated in any of
the operating modes by use of the LOOPBACK pin. While in loopback mode, receiver outputs
are internally connected to driver inputs creating an internal signal path bypassing the serial
communications controller for diagnostic testing. The SP3508 also includes a latch enable
pin with the driver and receiver address decoder. The internal V.11 or V.35 termination can
be switched off using a control pin (TERM_OFF) for monitoring applications. All eight (8)
drivers and receivers in the SP3508 include separate enable pins for added convenience.
The SP3508 is ideal for WAN serial ports in networking equipment such as routers, access
concentrators, network muxes, DSU/CSU's, networking test equipment, and other access
devices.

Due to the relatively large package size of the 100-pin quad                                                     used within 48 hours or stored in an environment at or below
flat-pack, storage in a low humidity environment is preferred.                                                   20%RH. If the above conditions cannot be followed, the parts

Phase 4
-VDD transfer -The fourth phase of the clock connects the negative terminal of C2 to ground,
and transfers the generated 5.5V across C2 to CVDD, the VDD storage capacitor. This voltage
is regulated to +5.5V. At the regulated voltage, the internal oscillator is disabled and simulta-
neously with this, the positive side of capacitor C1 is switched to VCC and the negative side
is connected to ground, and the cycle begins again. The charge pump cycle will continue as
long as the operational conditions for the internal oscillator are present. Since both V+ and
V- are separately generated from VCC; in a no-load condition V+ and V- will be symmetrical.
Older charge pump approaches that generate V- from V+ will show a decrease in the mag-
nitude of V- compared to V+ due to the inherent inefficiencies in the design. The clock rate
for the charge pump typically operates at 250kHz. The external capacitors can be as low as
1µF with a 16V breakdown voltage rating.

Phase 1
Please refer to figure below: In the first phase of the clock cycle, switches S2 and S4 are
opened and S1 and S3 closed. This connects the flying capacitor, C3, from Vin to ground.
C3 charge up to the input voltage applied at Vcc.
Phase 2
In the second phase of the clock cycle, switches S2 and S4 are closed and S1 and S3 are
opened. This connects the flying capacitor, C3, in parallel with the output capacitor, CVSS2.
The Charge stored in C3 is now transferred to CVSS2. Simultaneously, the negative side of
CVSS2 is connected to VSS2 and the positive side is connected to ground. With the voltage
across CVSS2 smaller than the voltage across C3, the charge flows from C3 to CVSS2 until the
voltage at the VSS2 equals -VCC.

DECODER AND D_LATCH FUNCTION
The SP3508 contains a D_LATCH pin that
latches the data into the D0, D1 and D2
decoder inputs. If tied to a logic LOW ("0"),
the latch is transparent, allowing the data at
the decoder inputs to propagate through and
program the SP3508 accordingly. If tied to a
logic HIGH ("1"), the latch locks out the data
and prevents the mode from changing until
this pin is brought to a logic LOW.
