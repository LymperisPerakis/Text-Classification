HDMI2C1-14HD                                                                                                                  Functional description
1        Functional description
         The HDMI2C1-14HD is a fully integrated ESD protection and signal conditioning device for
         control links and TMDS data video channels of HDMI™ transmitters (source).
         The control stage provides a bidirectional buffer, integrating signal conditioning and dynamic
         pull-up on DDC bus for maximum system robustness and signal integrity. The HEAC (HDMI
         Ethernet and audio return channels) function is supported, making the component fully
         compliant with HDMI 2.0 version. A bidirectional CEC block is integrated, able to wake-up
         the application from stand-by mode (all power supply off, except the CEC power supply). All
         video format specified by HDMI™ 2.0 standard like 1080p60 3D, 4K/2K 60fps are
         supported, giving maximal flexibility to designers. The +5 V supplied to the cable is
         protected against accidental surge current and short circuit. All these features are provided
         in a single 36 leads QFN package featuring natural PCB routing and saving space on the
         board.
         The HDMI2C1-14HD is a simple solution that provides HDMI™ designers with an easy and
         fast way to reach full compliance with the stringent HDMI™ 2.0 on a wide temperature
         range. STMicroelectronics proposes a dual version dedicated for the sink interfaces: the
         HDMI2C2-14HD.

2.1      CEC line description
         The CEC bus is described in the HDMI™ standards as the consumer electronics control. It
         provides control functions between all the various audiovisual equipments chained in the
         user's environment.
         The CEC block integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HD implements a level shifter, shifting the
         cable CEC +3.3 V voltage (VDD_CEC) down to the ASIC power supply voltage (VDD_CEC_IC)
         that can be as low as 1.8 V. The Figure 3 shows the functional diagram of the integrated
         CEC block.

         In case of no activity on the CEC bus, or if the CEC driver is off (VDD_CEC_IC = 0), the CEC
         pin is put in high impedance mode (open circuit) protecting the circuitry and the application
         against hazardous back drive.
         The Figure 4 illustrates the normal operating mode of the CEC block when the IC from the
         source and when the sink drives the communication.

           In case the application is set in stand-by mode, the +5 V main supply of the application is
           generally powered off in order to reduce as much as possible the global power
           consumption. The CEC driver can be the only device still working in low power mode,
           allowing a wake up of the whole application through the CEC line. When the main power
           supply +5 V is switched off, and if the CEC bus is still active (VDD_CEC power in on state),
           the HDMI2C1-14HD keeps the CEC bus working properly while all other outputs of the
           component are put in high impedance mode.
           The CEC output (cable side) integrates a protection against ESD which is compliant with
           IEC61000-4-2 standard, level 4 (8kV contact).
2.2        DDC functional block description
           The DDC bus is described in the HDMI™ standards as the Display Data Channel. The
           topology corresponds to an I2C bus that must be compliant with the I2C bus specification
           version 5 (October 2012). The DDC bus is made of 2 lines: data line (SDA) and clock line
           (SCL). It is used to create a point to point communication link from the source to the sink.
           EEDID and HDCP protocols are flowing through this link, making this I2C communication
           channel a key element in the HDMI™ application.
           The DDC block integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HD allows a bidirectional communication
           between the cable and the ASIC. It is fully compliant with the HDMI™ 2.0 standard and its
           CTS, and with the I2C bus specification version 2.1. It is shifting the 5V voltage from the
           cable (V5V_OUT) down to the ASIC voltage level (VDD_IC) that can be as low as 1.8 V. The
           Figure 5 shows the functional diagram of the DDC block integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HD
           device.

         The HDMI™ standard specifies that the max capacitance of the cable can reach up to 700
         pF. Knowing that the max capacitance of the sink input can reach up to 50 pF, this means
         that the I2C driver must be able to drive a load capacitance up to 750 pF. On the other hand,
         the I2C standard specifies a maximum rise time of the signal must be lower than 1 µs in
         order to keep the signal integrity. Taking into account the max cable capacitance of 750 pF,
         it is not possible to guarantee a rise time lower than 1 µs in worst case. Therefore, a
         dynamic pull-up has been integrated at the output of SDA and SCL lines and synchronized
         with the I2C driver. This signal booster accelerates for a short period the charging time of
         the equivalent cable capacitance, allowing to drive any HDMI™ cable. The Figure 7
         illustrates the benefit of the dynamic pull-up integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HD device.

           In order to activate the DDC block, the VDD_5V has to reach the specified VDD_5V_ON
           threshold (see Table 4). In addition, the inputs and outputs of the bidirectional level shifters
           (SCL, SDA, SCL_IC, SDA_IC) must be set to a high level after the power-on, and the HPD
           line has to be activated one time.
           The DDC outputs (SCL and SDA on cable side) integrate a protection against ESD which is
           compliant with IEC61000-4-2 standard, level 4 (8 kV contact).

         This block simplifies the design and the PCB layout of the HPD and HEAC functions. Simply
         connect the 2 pins from the HDMI connector to one side of the device, and then use the 3
         dedicated outputs on the other side of the device to manage separately the HPD and the
         HEAC links.
         Both HPD and Utility inputs (cable side) integrate a protection against ESD which is
         compliant with IEC61000-4-2 standard, level 4 (8 kV contact).
2.3.1    HPD line description
         The HPD line is described in the HDMI™ standards as the Hot Plug Detect function. This
         line is used by the Source device in order to detect if a Sink device is connected through an
         HDMI cable.
         The integrated HPD block is pulling down the line via a current source. When the input
         voltage is detected to be higher than a threshold level VTH_HPD, the signal is converted into
         a high state level on the ASIC side, at the voltage level of the ASIC power supply VDD_IC.
         Otherwise, HPD_IC pin remains in low state.
         The electrical parameters relevant to the HPD block and specified by theTable 7 are
         illustrated in the Figure 9.

2.3.2       HEAC functional block description
            The HEAC link is described in the HDMI™ 1.4 and HDMI™ 2.0 standards as the HDMI™
            Ethernet and audio return channel. It corresponds physically to one differential wired pair
            made of the Utility line and the HPD line. Two signals are transmitted through this link.
            The first signal corresponds to the HDMI™ Ethernet channel (HEC). The signal is
            transmitted in differential mode (bidirectional) through the HEAC link. It is specified by the
            100Base-TX IEEE 802.3 standard (fast Ethernet 100Mbps over twisted pair). Therefore, the
            HEC integrates an Ethernet link into the video cable, enabling IP-based applications over
            the HDMI™ cable.
            The second signal corresponds to the Audio Return Channel (ARC). The signal is
            transmitted either in common mode (unidirectional, from sink to source) through the HEAC
            link. It is specified by the IEC 60958-1 standard. The ARC function integrates an upstream
            audio capability, simplifying the cabling of the audiovisual equipment. It is no more
            necessary to use a coaxial cable from TV to audio amplifier.
            The HDMI2C1-14HD helps the designer to implement this high added value HEAC function
            in the application, protecting the link against the ESD with no disturbance of the signal. It
            provides 2 distinct outputs HEAC+ and HEAC- in order to ease as much as possible the
            PCB layout.

2.4      +5V protection and fault line functional block description
         The +5 V power supply that the source device has to provide to the HDMI™ cable is
         described by the HDMI™ 2.0 standard. It must be protected against accidental short circuit
         that could occur on the cable side.
         The HDMI2C1-14HD device embeds a low drop current limiter. If an over-current is
         detected, the HDMI2C1-14HD limits the current through the +5 V power supply.If the current
         is too high (short circuit), the device opens the +5 V.
         Furthermore, the HDMI2C1-14HD device embeds also an over temperature protection
         (OTP). If the internal temperature of the device reaches a too high value, the +5 V supply is
         opened in order to protect the application.
         In case either the current limiter or the OTP is triggered, the fault pin switches down to low
         state level (open drain topology) in order to optionally inform the HDMI™ ASIC that an
         abnormal situation has been detected (option).
         An under voltage lockout (UVLO) is also integrated in the block. It checks the main +5 V
         power supply state, and enables the 5V_OUT only if the main power supply has reached a
         minimal value VDD_5V_ON.
         The Figure 10 shows the functional diagram of the current limiter block.

         To summarize, the short circuit protection and the over temperature protection features are
         providing a high robustness level of the application. On top of this, the fault line can be used
         in order to improve the user experience.
         The 5V_OUT pin integrates a protection against ESD which is compliant with IEC61000-4-2
         standard, level 4 (8 kV contact). The decoupling capacitance is mandatory, according to the
         power management state of the art.

            Thanks to the innovative switch architecture, back drive current is blocked whatever back
            drive current is coming from +5V_OUT and/or DDC lines (see figure 11).
            In case of no activity on CEC bus, or if the CEC driver is off (VDD_CEC = 0), the output CEC
            pin is put in high impedance mode (open circuit) protecting the circuitry and the application
            against hazardous back drive.
2.6         TMDS channels ESD protection
            The TMDS (Transient Minimized Differential Signaling) channels are described by the HDMI
            2.0 standard. A total of 4 unidirectional differential pairs are used to transmit the video data
            to the sink device. There are 3 channels dedicated to the video data, and 1 channel
            dedicated to the clock.
            The HDMI2C1-14HD provides a simple PCB layout solution, directly compliant with HDMI
            connector type A. It protects the application against the ESD according the IEC61000-4-2
            level 4 standard (+/-8 kV contact). The high bandwidth of this ESD protection allows to
            transmit HD video data with no disturbance of the signal up to 5.94 Gbps per channel.
            A capacitor can be optionally connected to the ESD_DISCH pin in order to enhance the
            ESD protection performances.

2.7      Application block diagrams
         The Figure 13 shows an application block diagram proposal, implementing all the possible
         options. The TMDS channels are simply connected to the connector and to the source
         HDMI ASIC. The diagram shows that the CEC driver can be totally independent from the
         HDMI ASIC. By this way, even if the +5 V power supply and/or if the HDMI ASIC is sleeping
         in stand-by mode, the CEC bus is still active in low power mode. The designer has then all
         the tools to optimize the power consumption of the global application in stand-by mode, and
         has the possibility to implement a smart wake-up through the CEC bus enhancing the final
         user experience.

          1. Use halide-free flux, qualification ROL0 according to ANSI/J-STD-004.
          2. “No clean” solder paste recommended.
          3. Offers a high tack force to resist component displacement during PCB movement.
          4. Use solder paste with fine particles: powder particle size 20-45 µm.
5.3       Placement
          1. Manual positioning is not recommended.
          2. It is recommended to use the lead recognition capabilities of the placement system, not
             the outline centering.
          3. Standard tolerance of ± 0.05 mm is recommended.
          4. 3.5 N placement force is recommended. Too much placement force can lead to
             squeezed out solder paste and cause solder joints to short. Too low placement force
             can lead to insufficient contact between package and solder paste that could cause
             open solder joints or badly centered packages.
          5. To improve the package placement accuracy, a bottom side optical control should be
             performed with a high resolution tool.
          6. For assembly, a perfect supporting of the PCB is recommended during solder paste
             printing, pick and place and reflow soldering by using optimized tools.
5.4       PCB design preference
          1. To control the solder paste amount, closed vias are recommended instead of open
             vias.
          2. The position of tracks and open vias in the solder area should be well balanced.
             Symmetrical layout is recommended, in case any tilt phenomena caused by
             asymmetrical solder paste amount due to the solder flow away.
