                  Rev. 1.2 — 30 June 2016                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TDA8037 is the cost efficient successor of the established integrated contact smart
              card reader IC TDA8035. It offers a high level of security for the card performing current
              limitation, short circuit detection, ESD protection as well as supply supervision. Operating
              in 3 V supply domain, the current consumption during the shutdown mode of the contact
              reader is very low. It is therefore the ideal component for a power efficient contact reader.

8. Functional description
                       Remark: The ISO 7816 terminology convention has been adhered to throughout this
                       document, and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with this convention.
                   8.1 Power supply
                       Power supply voltage VDD is from 3 V to 3.6 V.
                       All interface signals with the system controller are referenced to VDD. All card contacts
                       remain inactive during powering up or powering down.
                       Internal regulator VREG is 1.8 V.
                       After powering the device, OFFN remains low until CMDVCCN is set high and PRESN is
                       low.
                       During power off, OFFN falls low when VDD is below the threshold voltage falling.
                       The frequency of the internal oscillator (fosc(int)) used for the activation sequences is put in
                       low frequency mode. It is to save power consumption while CMDVCCN is kept at high
                       level (card not activated).

                       The voltage supervisor is used as a power-on reset, and also as supply drop detection
                       during a card session. The threshold of the voltage supervisor is set internally in the IC for
                       VDD and VREG. The threshold can be adjusted externally for VDDhost using the PORADJ
                       pin. As long as VDD is less than Vth(VDD) + Vhys(VDD), the IC remains inactive whatever the
                       levels on the command lines are. It lasts during tw after VDD has reached a level higher
                       than Vth(VDD) + Vhys(VDD).The outputs of the VDD, VREG and VDDhost supervisors, are
                       combined and sent to a digital controller in order to reset the TDA8037. The defined reset

                            maintaining the IC in an inactive mode during the supply voltage power-on (see Figure 5,
                            Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9). When VDD falls below Vth(VDD), Vth(VREG) or

                      8.3 Clock circuitry
                            To generate the card clock CLK, the TDA8037 uses an external clock provided on CLKIN
                            pin. Apply the external clock to CLKIN before CMDVCCN falling edge signal.
                            The frequency is chosen as fCLKIN, fCLKIN/2 via the pins CLKDIV.
                            The frequency change is synchronous, which means that during transition, no pulse is
                            shorter than 45 % of the smallest period. It ensures that the first and last clock pulse
                            around the change has the correct width. When changing the frequency dynamically, the
                            change is effective for only 10 periods of CLKIN after the command.
                            The duty cycle on pin CLK shall be between 45 % and 55 %.

                      8.4 I/O circuitry
                            The three data lines I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are identical.
                            By pulling both lines (I/O and I/OUC) HIGH via a 10 k resistor (I/O to VCC and I/OUC to
                            VDD), the idle state is realized.
                            I/O is referenced to VCC, and I/OUC to VDD, thus allowing operation with VCC  VDD.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                     TDA8037
                                                                                                                   Low power 3V smart card interface
                       The first side on which a falling edge occurs becomes the master. An anti-latch circuit
                       disables the detection of falling edges on the other line, which becomes a slave.
                       After a time delay td(edge), the logic 0 on the master side is transmitted to the slave side.
                       When the master side returns to logic 1, the slave side transmits the logic 1 during the
                       time delay tpu. After which, both sides return to their Idle states.
                       This active pull-up feature ensures fast Low to High transitions. It is able to deliver more
                       than 1 mA up to an output voltage of 0.9 VCC on an 80 pF load. At the end of the active
                       pull-up pulse, the output voltage only depends on the internal pull-up resistor, and on the
                       load current.
                       The current to/from the cards I/O lines, is internally limited to 15 mA.
                       The maximum frequency on these lines is 1.5 MHz.
                   8.5 CS control
                       The CS (Chip Select) input allows multiple devices to operate in parallel. When CS is
                       high, the system interface signals operate as described. When CS is low, the signals
                       CMDVCCN, RSTIN and CLKDIV are latched. I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are set to
                       high impedance pull-up mode and data is no longer passed to or from the smart card. The
                       OFFN output is a 3-state output.
                   8.6 Shutdown mode
                       After power-on reset, the circuit enters the Shutdown mode if CMDVCCN input pin is set
                       to a logic high. A minimum number of circuits are active while waiting for the
                       microcontroller to start a session.
                         1. All card contacts are inactive (approximately 200  to GND).
                         2. I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are high impedance (10 k pull-up resistor connected
                            to VDD).
                         3. Voltage generators are stopped.
                         4. Voltage supervisor is active.
                         5. The internal oscillator runs at its low frequency.

                        1. CMDVCCN is pulled Low (t0)
                        2. The internal oscillator changes to its high frequency (t1 = t0+~)
                        3. VCC rises from 0 to selected VCC value (3 V) with a controlled slope ((t2 = t1 + 3T/2)
                        4. I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are enabled (t3 = t1 + 10T); they were pulled LOW until this
                           moment
                        5. CLK is applied to the C3 contact (t4 = t3 + x) with 200 ns < x < 10  1/fCLKIN
                        6. RST is enabled (t5 = t1 + 13T).

                   8.8 Deactivation sequence
                       When a session is completed, the microcontroller sets the CMDVCCN line to the HIGH
                       state. The circuit then executes an automatic deactivation sequence by counting the
                       sequencer back and ends in the inactive state (see Figure 7):
                       Note: CMDVCCN line should not be set to High state until activation sequence has not
                       completed. Else, this deactivation command is not taken into account.
                         1. RST goes LOW (t11 = t10 + 3T/64)
                         2. CLK is stopped LOW (t12 = t11 +T/2)
                         3. I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are pulled LOW (t13 = t11 + T)
                         4. VCC falls to zero (t14 = t11 + 3T/2). The deactivation sequence is completed when VCC
                            reaches its inactive state
                         5. VCC < 0.4 V (tde = t11 + 3T/2 + VCC fall time)
                         6. All card contacts become low-impedance to GND. I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC
                            remain pulled up to VDD via a 10 k resistor.
                         7. The internal oscillator reverts to its lower frequency.

                       VCC buffer is able to deliver up to 65 mA continuously at VCC = 3 V.
                       It has an internal overload detection at approximately 125 mA.
                       This detection is internally filtered, allowing the card to draw spurious current pulses up to
                       200 mA for some ms, without causing a deactivation. The average current value must
                       stay below maximum.

                                                                                                                  Low power 3V smart card interface
                8.10 Fault detection
                     The circuit monitors the following fault conditions:
                       • short-circuit or high current on VCC
                       • Card removal during transaction
                       • VDD, VREG or VDDhost dropping
                       • overheating.
                     There are two different cases (see Figure 8 on page 12):
                      1. CMDVCCN High: (outside a card session) then, if the card is not in the reader, OFFN
                         is Low. It is High when the card is in the reader. The supply supervisor detects a
                         supply voltage drop on VDD. It generates an internal power-on reset pulse, but does
                         not act upon OFFN. The card is not powered-up, so no short-circuit or overheating is
                         detected.
                      2. CMDVCCN Low: (within a card session) then, OFFN falls Low in any of the
                         aforementioned cases. As soon as the fault is detected, an emergency deactivation is
                         automatically performed. When the system controller sets CMDVCCN back to High, it
                         may sense OFFN again after complete deactivation sequence. It does it to distinguish
                         between a hardware problem or a card extraction. If the card is still present, OFFN
                         then returns High.
                     A bounce may occur on PRESN signal during card insertion or withdrawal. It depends on
                     the type of card presence switch within the connector (normally close or normally open),
                     and on the mechanical characteristics of the switch. To counter the bounce, a debounce
                     feature of approximately 4.05 ms (tdeb = 1280  1/(fosc(int)_Low) is integrated in the device.
                     When the card is inserted, OFFN goes High only at the end of the debounce time (see
                     Figure 9 on page 12).
                     When the card is extracted, an automatic deactivation sequence of the card is performed
                     on the first True/False transition on PRESN, and OFFN goes Low.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 15) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 15.
