                  PCA9703
                  18 V tolerant SPI 16-bit GPI with maskable INT
                  Rev. 4 — 5 September 2014                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9703 is a low power 18 V tolerant SPI General Purpose Input (GPI) shift register
              designed to monitor the status of switch inputs. It generates an interrupt when one or
              more of the switch inputs change state but allows selected inputs to not generate
              interrupts using the interrupt masking feature. The input level is recognized as a HIGH
              when it is greater than 0.8  VDD and as a LOW when it is less than 0.55  VDD (minimum
              LOW threshold of 2.5 V at 5 V node). The PCA9703 can monitor up to 16 switch inputs.
              The falling edge of the CS pin samples the input port status and clears the interrupt. When
              CS is LOW, the rising edge of the SCLK loads the shift register and shifts the value out of
              the shift register. The serial input is sampled on the falling edge of SCLK. The contents of
              the shift register are loaded into the interrupt mask register of the device on the rising
              edge of CS.
              Each of the input ports has a 18 V breakdown ESD protection circuit, which dumps the
              ESD/overvoltage current to ground. When used with a series resistor (minimum 100 k),
              the input can connect to a 12 V battery and support double battery, reverse battery, 27 V
              jump start and 40 V load dump conditions in automotive applications. Higher voltages can
              be tolerated on the inputs depending on the series resistor used to limit the input current.
              The INT_EN pin is used to both enable the GPI pins and to enable the INT output pin to
              minimize battery drain in cyclically supplied pull-up or pull-down applications. The SDIN
              pull-down prevents floating nodes when the device is used in daisy-chain applications.
              With both the high breakdown voltage and high ESD, this device is useful for both
              automotive (AEC-Q100 compliance available) and mobile applications.

7. Functional description
                   PCA9703 is a 16-bit General Purpose Input (GPI) with an open-drain interrupt output
                   designed to monitor switch status. By putting an external 100 k series resistor at the
                   input port, the device allows the input to tolerate momentary double 12 V battery, reverse
                   battery, 27 V jump start or 40 V load dump conditions. The interrupt output is asserted
                   when an input port status changes, the input is not masked and the interrupt output is
                   enabled. The open-drain interrupt output is enabled when INT_EN is HIGH and disabled
                   when INT_EN is LOW. The INT_EN also enables the GPI pins when it is HIGH. In
                   cyclically supplied pull-up or pull-down applications, the GPI pull-ups or pull-downs should
                   be active before the INT_EN is taken HIGH and the INT output should only be sampled
                   after transient conditions have settled. Additionally, interrupts can be disabled in software
                   by using the interrupt mask feature. The input port status is accessed via the 4-wire SPI
                   interface.
                   Upon power-up, the power-up reset cell clears all the registers, resulting in all zeros in
                   both the input status register and the interrupt mask register. Since a zero in the interrupt
                   mask register masks the interrupt from that pin, there will not be any interrupts generated.
                   After power-up it is necessary to access the PCA9703 through the SPI pins in order to
                   activate the interrupt for any GPI pins. When the PCA9703 is read over the SPI wires, the
                   input conditions are clocked into the input status register on the CS falling edge. Since the
                   inputs and the input status register now match, no interrupt is generated and any
                   pre-existing interrupt is cleared. The input status register data is parallel loaded into the
                   shift register on the first rising edge of the SCLK. The serial input data is captured on the
                   opposite clock edge so that there is a 1⁄2 clock cycle hold time. The set-up time is
                   diminished by the propagation time so the SCLK falling edge to rising edge must be long
                   enough to provide sufficient set-up time. Successive clock cycles on the SCLK pin clock
                   the data out of the PCA9703 and new data from the SDIN into the shift register. There is
                   no limit to the number of clock cycles that can be applied with the CS LOW, however
                   sufficient clock cycles should be used to both shift out all of the GPI data and shift in the
                   new interrupt mask data to the correct position with the MSB first before the CS rising
                   edge.
                   For cyclic switch bias applications the switch bias should be applied first, then after the
                   input voltage is settled the general purpose inputs are switched on by taking the INT_EN
                   HIGH. This also enables the interrupt output, which will only indicate an interrupt if the GPI
                   data does not match the input status register on a bit that is enabled by the interrupt mask
                   register value. If an interrupt is generated, the pull-up or pull-down source should remain
                   active and the INT_EN should remain active and the SPI pins are used to update the input
                   status register and read the data out. They are also used to store the new interrupt mask
                   on the rising edge of CS. After the SPI transaction is complete the INT_EN is taken LOW
                   to turn the inputs off and disable the INT output. Then the GPI pull-ups or pull-downs can
                   be turned off. The GPI pins are specifically designed so that any ESD/overstress current
                   flows to ground, not VDD. They are also specifically designed so that if the input voltage
                   returns to the same value after pull-up or pull-down bias cycling as before the input pull-up
                   or pull-down bias cycling, before the input is enabled it will be detected as the same state.
                   If the Input Status register is read when INT_EN is LOW, the input state at the INT_EN
                   transition will be output regardless of the actual input levels since the GPI pins are turned
                   off.

                                                                                           18 V tolerant SPI 16-bit GPI with maskable INT
                       If the VDD falls below the 4.5 V minimum specified supply voltage, the input threshold will
                       move down since they are a function of the VDD voltage. The input status register and the
                       interrupt mask register retain their values to below VDD = 2.0 V and power-down can only
                       be used to generate a power-up reset if the VDD falls below 0.2 V before returning to the
                       operating range.
                       Multiple PCA9703 devices can be serially connected for monitoring a large number of
                       switches by connecting the SDOUT of one device to the SDIN of the next device. SCLK
                       and CS must be common among all devices and interrupt outputs may be tied together.
                       No external logic is necessary because all the devices’ interrupt outputs are open-drain
                       that function as ‘wired-AND’ and can simply be connected together to a single pull-up
                       resistor.
                   7.1 SPI bus operation
                       The PCA9703 interfaces with the controller via the 4-wire SPI bus that is comprised of the
                       following signals: chip select (CS), serial clock (SCLK), serial data in (SDIN), and serial
                       data out (SDOUT). To access the device, the controller asserts CS LOW, then sends
                       SCLK and SDIN. When reading is complete and the interrupt mask data is in place, the
                       controller de-asserts CS. See Figure 4 for register access timing.
                7.1.1 CS - chip select
                       The CS pin is the device chip select and is an active LOW input. The falling edge of CS
                       captures the input port status in the input status register. If the interrupt output is asserted,
                       the falling edge of CS will clear the interrupt. When CS is LOW, the SPI interface is active.
                       When CS transitions HIGH the interrupt mask is stored and when CS is HIGH, the SPI
                       interface is disabled.
                7.1.2 SCLK - serial clock input
                       SCLK is the serial clock input to the device. It should be LOW and remain LOW during the
                       falling and rising edge of CS. When CS is LOW, the first rising edge of SCLK parallel
                       loads the shift register from the input status register. The subsequent rising edges on
                       SCLK serially shifts data out from the shift register. The falling edge of SCLK samples the
                       data on SDIN.
                7.1.3 SDIN - serial data input
                       SDIN is the serial data input port. The data is sampled into the shift register on the falling
                       edge of SCLK. SDIN is only active when CS is LOW. This input has a 20 A pull-down
                       current source to prevent the SDIN node from floating when CS is HIGH.
                7.1.4 SDOUT - serial data output
                       SDOUT is the serial data output signal. SDOUT is high-impedance when CS is HIGH and
                       switches to low-impedance after CS goes LOW. When CS is LOW, after the first rising
                       edge of SCLK the most significant bit in the shift register is presented on SDOUT.
                       Subsequent rising edges of SCLK shift the remaining data from the shift register onto
                       SDOUT.

                     7.1.5 Register access timing
                                Figure 4 shows the waveforms of the device operation. Initially CS is HIGH and SCLK is
                                LOW. On the falling edge of CS, input port status, DATA[n:0] is captured into the input
                                status register, and subsequently the first rising edge of SCLK parallel loads the shift
                                register. The falling edge of SCLK samples the data on the SDIN. The MSB from the shift
                                register is valid and available on the SDOUT after the first rising edge of SCLK.

                     7.1.6 Software reset operation
                                Software reset will be activated by writing all zeroes into the shift register. This is identical
                                to having an interrupt mask value of 0X00. Such an operation will reset the device, clear
                                the input status register to zero and set the interrupt output to HIGH (no interrupt).
                        7.2 Interrupt output
                                INT is the open-drain interrupt output and is active LOW. A pull-up resistor of
                                approximately 10 k is recommended.
                                A user-defined interrupt mask bit pattern is shifted into the shift register via SDIN. The
                                value of bits in the mask pattern will determine which input pins will cause an interrupt.
                                Any bit that is = 0 will disable the input pin corresponding to that bit position from
                                generating an interrupt. Interrupts will be enabled for bits having value = 1. The mask bit
                                pattern is not automatically aligned with the desired input pins. It is the responsibility of the
                                programmer to shift the correct number of (mask) bits to the correct positions into the shift

                                                                                             18 V tolerant SPI 16-bit GPI with maskable INT
                       register. The interrupt mask bit pattern must be positioned into the shift register prior to the
                       CS rising edge. Misaligned mask pattern will result in unexpected activation of the
                       interrupt signal.
                       The interrupt output is asserted when the input status is changed, and the interrupt mask
                       bit corresponding to the input pin that caused the change is unmasked (bit value = 1), and
                       is cleared on the falling edge of CS or when the input port status matches the input status
                       register. When there are multiple devices, the INT outputs may be tied together to a single
                       pull-up.
                       Table 3 illustrates the state of the interrupt output versus the state of the input port and
                       input status register. The interrupt output is asserted when the input port and input status
                       register differ.

                   7.3 Interrupt enable
                       INT_EN is the interrupt output enable input and the general purpose input enable input. It
                       is an active HIGH input. When the INT_EN pin is LOW the GPI pins are turned off and the
                       input state is saved to minimize power loss when the input pull-ups or pull-downs are
                       cycled and the INT output is disabled. The cycled pull-ups or pull-downs should be active
                       sufficiently long before the INT_EN is taken active that the GPI pin voltage is completely
                       settled to prevent false or transient interrupt signals.
                   7.4 General Purpose Inputs
                       The General Purpose Inputs (GPI) are designed to behave like a typical input in the 0 V to
                       5.5 V range, but are also designed to have low leakage currents at elevated voltages. The
                       input structure allows for elevated voltages to be applied through a series resistor. The
                       series resistor is required when the input voltage is above 5.5 V. The series resistor is
                       required for two reasons: first, to prevent damage to the input avalanche diode, and
                       second, to prevent the ESD protection circuitry from creating an excessive current flow.
                       The ESD protection circuitry includes a latch-back style device, which provides excellent
                       ESD protection during assembly or typical 5.5 V applications. The series resistor limits the
                       current flowing into the part and provides additional ESD protection. The limited current
                       prevents the ESD latch-back device from latching back to a low voltage, which would
                       cause excessive current flow and damage the part when the input voltage is above 5.5 V.

                      The minimum required series resistance for applications with input voltages above 5.5 V
                      is 100 k. For applications requiring an applied voltage above 27 V, Equation 1 is
                      recommended to determine the series resistor. Failure to include the appropriate input
                      series resistor may result in product failure and will void the warranty.

                      The series resistor should be place physically as close as possible to the connected input
                      to reduce the effective node capacitance. The input response time is effected by the RC
                      time constant of the series resistor and the input node capacitance.

                      A minimum LOW threshold of 2.5 V is guaranteed for the logical switching points for the
                      inputs. See Figure 5 for details.

                      or more to the input (with VDD = 4.5 V), or as the voltage passes this threshold, they will
                      always see a HIGH.

                8.2.1 SBC wake port extension with cyclic biasing
                       System Basis Chips (SBC) offer many functions needed for in-vehicle networking
                       solutions. Some of the features built into SBC are:
                        •  Transceivers (HS-CAN, LIN 2.0)
                        •  Scalable voltage regulators
                        •  Watchdog timers; wake-up function
                        •  Fail-safe function
                       For more information on SBC, refer to

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 20.
