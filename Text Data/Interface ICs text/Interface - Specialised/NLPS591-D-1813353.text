NLPS591
Fully-Configurable Port
Companion for Displays
  The NLPS591 is a fully−configurable port companion for display
applications. The device supports 4 externally selectable modes: (1)
4−Ch autosensing logic level translator mode, (2) CRT mode, (3)
HDMI mode and (4) DisplayPort (DP) mode. The device provides                           www.onsemi.com
switchable power to the connected display and the level shifting
necessary for the different display modes. It also provides high−level
ESD protection on the connector side.
