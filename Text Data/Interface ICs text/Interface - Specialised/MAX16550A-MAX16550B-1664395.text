                                         connected to ground through a resistor. A capacitor parallel to the RILOAD resistor is

Layout Recommendations
VIN and VOUT
●● Minimize input and output trace inductance by using
   wide and multiple VIN and VOUT planes for optimal
   thermal performance.
●● Use multiple vias to connect interlaying power
   planes.
●● Place input capacitors (where applicable) as close to
   the IC as possible.
●● Place output capacitors as close to the IC as pos-
   sible.
●● Place TVS and Schottky diodes close to the IC for
   tighter coupling to VOUT, and GND; VIN, and GND.
Example                                                      Figure 7. Top Layer (Power)
The EV kit layout in Figure 7 shows use of large, wide
power planes for VIN and VOUT on the top layer. CIN and
COUT are close to the IC. The other VIN and VOUT power
layers are connected with multiple vias between the pins.
Ground
●● Use a trace approximately 1mm wide by 7mm long
   from the ground pin (pin 13) on the top layer to the
   underlying ground layers through at least two vias.
●● Use a keepout to eliminate all metals directly under
   the IC package on the second layer.
Example
The EV kit layout in Figure 8 and 9 show the appropriate
ground connection with vias and the ground keepout on
Layer 2 (ground). The keepout should extend approxi-
mately 30mils outside the IC package.                        Figure 8. Top Layer (Power) and Layer 2 (GND) with Keepout
VBST and SS
Place the VBST and SS capacitors on the top layer as
close to the pins as possible.
VDD
●● Add a VDD plane on the top layer to decouple the
   VDD caps close to the IC to form a tighter loop to
   ground.
●● Place VDD ground far away from the output capacitor
   ground.
ROCP and ILOAD
The ROCP and ILOAD resistors should be placed as
close to the IC as possible.
