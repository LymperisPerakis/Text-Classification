1. General description
              The NVT4555 device is built for interfacing a SIM card with a single low-voltage host side
              interface. The NVT4555 contains an LDO that can deliver two different voltages, 1.8 V or
              2.95 V from typical mobile phone battery voltages up to 5.25 V and three level translators
              to convert the data, RSTn and CLKn signals between a SIM card and a host
              microcontroller.
              The NVT4555 contains one voltage select pin (CTRL) to select either 1.8 V or 2.95 V for
              SIM card power supply and one active HIGH enable pin (EN) to enable normal operation.
              The NVT4555 is compliant with all ETSI, IMT-2000 and ISO-7816 SIM/Smart card
              interface requirements.

                   7.2 Shutdown sequence of NVT4555
                       The ISO 7816-3 specification specifies the shutdown sequence for the SIM card signals to
                       ensure that the card is properly disabled. Also during hot swap, the orderly shutdown of
                       these signals helps to avoid any improper write and corruption of data.
                       When the enable, EN, is asserted LOW, the shutdown sequence is initiated by powering
                       down the RST_SIM channel. Once the RST_SIM channel is powered down, CLK_SIM,
                       IO_SIM and VSIM are powered down sequentially one-by-one. An internal pull-down
                       resistor on the SIM pins is used to pull these channels LOW. The shutdown sequence is
                       completed in a few microseconds. It is important that EN is pulled LOW before VBAT and
                       VCC supplies go LOW to ensure that the shutdown sequence is properly initiated.

10. Application information
                       The application circuit for the NVT4555, which shows the typical interface with a SIM card,
                       is shown in Figure 6. The Low-DropOut (LDO) regulator, internal to the NVT4555, is
                       designed to supply the SIM card power with a high Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR)
                       at a very low drop-out voltage (VBAT  VO(reg)). The LDO regulator provides two levels of
                       fixed voltage regulation at 1.8 V or 2.95 V, which are selected with the CTRL pin of the
                       NVT4555.

                                                                     SIM card interface level translator and supply voltage LDO
                    10.1 Input/output capacitor considerations
                            It is recommended that a 1 F and 100 nF capacitors having low Equivalent Series
                            Resistance (ESR) are used respectively at the battery (VBAT) and VCC input terminals of
                            the NVT4555. X5R and X7R type multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) are preferred
                            because they have minimal variation in value and ESR over temperature. The maximum
                            ESR should be < 500 m(50 m typical).
                            Also, a 4.7 F capacitor is recommended at the Low Dropout regulator (LDO) output
                            terminal to ensure stability. X5R and X7R type are recommended for their minimal
                            variation over temperature and low ESR over frequency which avoids stability issues at
                            high frequencies. The maximum ESR should be < 1.0 . Furthermore, the decrease in
                            capacitance with an increase in the bias voltage should be considered to optimize LDO
                            stability. In addition, the trade-off in LDO stability versus the value and constraint in case
                            size of the capacitor determined by the application must be considered. As output load
                            capacitance decreases, the LDO stability becomes marginal. Given that a 4.7 F ceramic
                            capacitor may drop by 80 % in capacitance depending on the effects of bias voltage and
                            temperature, it is recommended to refer to the manufacturer’s characterization of a
                            capacitor based on case size, bias voltage and type. Figure 7 is an example of how a
                            4.7 F capacitor is affected by the above parameters.

                    10.2 Layout consideration
                            The capacitors should be placed directly at the terminals and ground plane. Since the
                            internal band gap regulator is the dominant noise source in a typical application,
                            connections and routing of the ground is very important to improve and optimize noise
                            performance, PSRR and transient response. It is recommended to design the PCB so that
                            the VCC, VBAT and VSIM pins are bypassed with a capacitor with each ground returning to
                            a common node at the GND pin of the NVT4555 such that ground loops are minimized.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                           NVT4555
                                                                    SIM card interface level translator and supply voltage LDO
                 10.3 Dropout voltage
                           The NVT4555 uses a PMOS pass transistor to achieve a very low dropout voltage. When
                           VBAT  VO(reg) (VSIM pin) is less than the dropout voltage, the PMOS transistor operates
                           in the linear region and the input-to-output resistance is RDSon of the PMOS device. The
                           dropout voltage, Vdo, will scale with the output current since the PMOS device behaves
                           like a resistor in the input-to-output path.
                 10.4 Level translator stage
                           The architecture of the NVT4555 I/O channel is shown in Figure 8. The device does not
                           require an extra input signal to control the direction of data flow from host to SIM or from
                           SIM to host. As a change of driving direction is just possible when both sides are in HIGH
                           state, the control logic is recognizing the first falling edge granting it control about the
                           other signal side. During a rising edge signal, the non-driving output is driven by a
                           one-shot circuit to accelerate the rising edge. In case of a communication error or some
                           other unforeseen incident that would drive both connected sides to be drivers at the same
                           time, the internal logic automatically prevents stuck-at situation, so both I/Os will return to
                           HIGH level once released from being driven LOW.
                           The channels RST and CLK just contain single direction drivers without the holding
                           mechanism of the I/O channel, as these are just driven from the host to the card side.
                                                                                                                             VSIM

                     thermal protection as well as an overcurrent protection are integrated to disable the output
                     in case of a permanent short that may result in excessive self-heating.

12. Soldering of WLCSP packages
                12.1 Introduction to soldering WLCSP packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering WLCSP (Wafer Level Chip-Size Packages) can be found in application note
                     AN10439 “Wafer Level Chip Scale Package” and in application note AN10365 “Surface
                     mount reflow soldering description”.
                     Wave soldering is not suitable for this package.
                     All NXP WLCSP packages are lead-free.
                12.2 Board mounting
                     Board mounting of a WLCSP requires several steps:
                       1. Solder paste printing on the PCB
                       2. Component placement with a pick and place machine
                       3. The reflow soldering itself
                12.3 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a PbSn process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues, such as smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature), and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic) while being low enough that the packages and/or boards are not
                          damaged. The peak temperature of the package depends on package thickness and
                          volume and is classified in accordance with Table 9.
                     Table 9.    Lead-free process (from J-STD-020D)
                      Package thickness (mm)                  Package reflow temperature (C)
                                                              Volume (mm3)
                                                              < 350                                  350 to 2000 > 2000
                      < 1.6                                   260                                    260         260
                      1.6 to 2.5                              260                                    250         245
                      > 2.5                                   250                                    245         245
                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.

               12.3.1 Stand off
                      The stand off between the substrate and the chip is determined by:
                        • The amount of printed solder on the substrate
                        • The size of the solder land on the substrate
                        • The bump height on the chip
                      The higher the stand off, the better the stresses are released due to TEC (Thermal
                      Expansion Coefficient) differences between substrate and chip.
               12.3.2 Quality of solder joint
                      A flip-chip joint is considered to be a good joint when the entire solder land has been
                      wetted by the solder from the bump. The surface of the joint should be smooth and the
                      shape symmetrical. The soldered joints on a chip should be uniform. Voids in the bumps
                      after reflow can occur during the reflow process in bumps with high ratio of bump diameter
                      to bump height, i.e. low bumps with large diameter. No failures have been found to be
                      related to these voids. Solder joint inspection after reflow can be done with X-ray to
                      monitor defects such as bridging, open circuits and voids.
               12.3.3 Rework
                      In general, rework is not recommended. By rework we mean the process of removing the
                      chip from the substrate and replacing it with a new chip. If a chip is removed from the
                      substrate, most solder balls of the chip will be damaged. In that case it is recommended

                          Device removal can be done when the substrate is heated until it is certain that all solder
                          joints are molten. The chip can then be carefully removed from the substrate without
                          damaging the tracks and solder lands on the substrate. Removing the device must be
                          done using plastic tweezers, because metal tweezers can damage the silicon. The
                          surface of the substrate should be carefully cleaned and all solder and flux residues
                          and/or underfill removed. When a new chip is placed on the substrate, use the flux
                          process instead of solder on the solder lands. Apply flux on the bumps at the chip side as
                          well as on the solder pads on the substrate. Place and align the new chip while viewing
                          with a microscope. To reflow the solder, use the solder profile shown in application note
