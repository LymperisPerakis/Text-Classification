Functional description                                                                             ST8024
5           Functional description
            Throughout this document it is assumed that the reader is familiar with ISO7816
            terminology.
5.1         Power supply
            The supply pins for the IC are VDD and GND. VDD should be in the range of 2.7 to 6.5 V. All
            signals interfacing with the system controller are referred to VDD, therefore VDD should also
            supply the system controller. All card reader contacts remain inactive during power-on or
            power-off.
            The internal circuits are maintained in the reset state until VDD reaches Vth2 +Vhys2 and for
            the duration of the internal power-on reset pulse, tW (see Figure 4). When VDD falls below
            Vth2, an automatic deactivation of the contacts is performed.
            A DC-DC converter is incorporated to generate the 5 or 3 V card supply voltage (VCC). The
            DC-DC converter should be supplied separately by VDDP and PGND. Due to the possibility
            of large transient currents, the two 100 nF capacitors of the DC-DC converter should be
            located as near as possible to the IC and have an ESR less than 100 mΩ.
            The DC-DC converter functions as a voltage doubler or a voltage follower according to the
            respective values of VCC and VDDP (both have thresholds with a hysteresis of 100 mV).
            The DC-DC converter function changes as follows:
            VCC = 5 V and VDDP > 5.8 V; voltage follower
            VCC = 5 V and VDDP < 5.7 V; voltage doubler
            VCC = 3 V and VDDP > 4.1 V; voltage follower
            VCC = 3 V and VDDP < 4.0 V; voltage doubler.
            Supply voltages VDD and VDDP may be applied to the IC in any sequence.
            After powering the device, OFF remains LOW until CMDVCC is set HIGH.
            During power off, OFF falls LOW when VDD is below the falling threshold voltage.
5.2         Voltage supervisor
5.2.1       Without external divider on pin PORADJ
            The voltage supervisor surveys the VDD supply. A defined reset pulse of approximately 8 ms
            (tW) is used internally to keep the IC inactive during power-on or power-off of the VDD supply
            (see Figure 4).
            As long as VDD is less than Vth2 + Vhys2, the IC remains inactive whatever the levels on the
            command lines. This state also lasts for the duration of tW after VDD has reached a level
            higher than Vth2 + Vhys2. When VDD falls below Vth2, a deactivation sequence of the
            contacts is performed.

       Figure 4.       Voltage supervisor
5.2.2  With an external divider on pin PORADJ
       If an external resistor bridge is connected to pin PORADJ (R1 and R2 in Figure 1), then the
       following occurs:
           – The internal threshold voltage Vth2 is overridden by the external voltage and by the
              hysteresis, therefore:
             Vth2(ext)(rise) = (1 + R1/R2) x (Vbridge + Vhys(ext)/2)
             Vth2(ext)(fall) = (1 + R1/R2) x (Vbridge - Vhys(ext)/2)
             where Vbridge = 1.25 V typ. and Vhys(ext) = 60 mV typ.
           – The reset pulse width tW is doubled to approximately 16 ms.
       Input PORADJ is biased internally with a pull-down current source of 4 µA which is removed
       when the voltage on pin PORADJ exceeds 1 V.
       This ensures that after detection of the external bridge by the IC during power-on, the input
       current on pin PORADJ does not cause inaccuracy of the bridge voltage.
       The minimum threshold voltage should be higher than 2 V. The maximum threshold voltage
       may be up to VDD.
5.2.3  Application examples
       The voltage supervisor is used as power-on reset and as supply dropout detection during a
       card session. Supply dropout detection is to ensure that a proper deactivation sequence is
       followed before the voltage is too low. For the internal voltage supervisor to function, the
       system microcontroller should operate down to 2.35 V to ensure a proper deactivation
       sequence. If this is not possible, external resistor values can be chosen to overcome the
       problem.
5.3    Clock circuitry
       The card clock signal (CLK) is derived from a clock signal input to pin XTAL1 or from a
       crystal operating at up to 26 MHz connected between pins XTAL1 and XTAL2.
       The clock frequency can be fXTAL, 1/2 x fXTAL, 1/4 x fXTAL or 1/8 x fXTAL. Frequency selection
       is made via inputs CLKDIV1 and CLKDIV2 (see Table 21).
                                                                                                  17/31

                              0                                   1                                   fXTAL/4

                              1                                   0                                    fXTAL
            1. The status of pins CLKDIV1 and CLKDIV2 must not be changed simultaneously; a delay of 10 ns minimum
                 between changes is needed; the minimum duration of any state of CLK is eight periods of XTAL1.
            The frequency change is synchronous, which means that during transition no pulse is
            shorter than 45 % of the smallest period, and that the first and last clock pulses about the
            instant of change have the correct width.
            When changing the frequency dynamically, the change is effective for only eight periods of
            XTAL1 after the command. The duty factor of fXTAL depends on the signal present at pin
            XTAL1. In order to reach a 45 to 55 % duty factor on pin CLK, the input signal on pin XTAL1
            should have a duty factor of 48 to 52 % and transition times of less than 5 % of the input
            signal period.
            If a crystal is used, the duty factor on pin CLK may be 45 to 55 % depending on the circuit
            layout and on the crystal characteristics and frequency. In other cases, the duty factor on pin
            CLK is guaranteed between 45 and 55 % of the clock period.
            The crystal oscillator runs as soon as the IC is powered up. If the crystal oscillator is used,
            or if the clock pulse on pin XTAL1 is permanent, the clock pulse is applied to the card as
            shown in the activation sequences shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6
            If the signal applied to XTAL1 is controlled by the system microcontroller, the clock pulse will
            be applied to the card when it is sent by the system microcontroller (after completion of the
            activation sequence).
5.4         I/O transceivers
            The three data lines I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are identical.The idle state is realized by both I/O
            and I/OUC lines being pulled HIGH via a 11 kΩ resistor (I/O to VCC and I/OUC to VDD). Pin
            I/O is referenced to VCC, and pin I/OUC to VDD, thus allowing operation when VCC is not
            equal to VDD. The first side of the transceiver to receive a falling edge becomes the master.
            An anti-latch circuit disables the detection of falling edges on the line of the other side, which
            then becomes a slave. After a time delay td(edge), an N transistor on the slave side is turned
            on, thus transmitting the logic 0 present on the master side. When the master side returns to
            logic 1, a P transistor on the slave side is turned on during the time delay tpu and then both
            sides return to their idle states. This active pull-up feature ensures fast LOW-to-HIGH
            transitions; it is able to deliver more than 1 mA at an output voltage of up to 0.9 VCC into an
            80 pF load. At the end of the active pull-up pulse, the output voltage depends only on the
            internal pull-up resistor and the load current. The current to and from the card I/O lines is
            limited internally to 15 mA and the maximum frequency on these lines is 1 MHz.

ST8024                                                                         Functional description
5.5    Inactive mode
       After a power-on reset, the circuit enters the inactive mode. A minimum number of circuits
       are active while waiting for the microcontroller to start a session:
            – All card contacts are inactive (approximately 200 Ω to GND)
            – Pins I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are in the high-impedance state (11 kΩ pull-up
               resistor to VDD)
            – Voltage generators are stopped
            – XTAL oscillator is running
            – Voltage supervisor is active
            – The internal oscillator is running at its low frequency.
5.6    Activation sequence
       After power-on and after the internal pulse width delay, the system microcontroller can
       check the presence of a card using the signals OFF and CMDVCC as shown in Table 22.
       If the card is in the reader (this is the case if PRES or PRES is active), the system
       microcontroller can start a card session by pulling CMDVCC LOW. The following sequence
       then occurs (see Figure 6):
             1. CMDVCC is pulled LOW and the internal oscillator changes to its high frequency (t0).
             2. The voltage doubler is started (between t0 and t1).
             3. VCC rises from 0 to 5 V (or 3 V) with a controlled slope (t2 = t1 + 1.5 x T) where T is
             64 times the period of the internal oscillator (approximately 25 µs).
             4. I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are enabled (t3 = t1 + 4T) (these were pulled LOW until this
             moment).
             5. CLK is applied to the C3 contact of the card reader (t4).
             6. RST is enabled (t5 = t1 + 7T).
             The clock may be applied to the card using the following sequence (see Figure 5):
             1. Set RSTIN HIGH.
             2. Set CMDVCC LOW.
             3. Reset RSTIN LOW between t3 and t5; CLK will start at this moment.
             4. RST remains LOW until t5, when RST is enabled to be the copy of RSTIN.
             5. After t5, RSTIN has no further affect on CLK; this allows a precise count of CLK
             pulses before toggling RST.
       If the applied clock is not needed, then CMDVCC may be set LOW with RSTIN LOW. In this
       case, CLK will start at t3 (minimum 200 ns after the transition on I/O), and after t5, RSTIN
       may be set HIGH in order to obtain an Answer To Request (ATR) from the card.
       Activation should not be performed with RSTIN held permanently HIGH

5.7    Active mode
       When the activation sequence is completed, the ST8024 will be in its active mode. Data are
       exchanged between the card and the microcontroller via the I/O lines.
       The ST8024 is designed for cards without VPP (the voltage required to program or erase the
       internal non-volatile memory).
5.8    Deactivation sequence
       When a session is completed, the microcontroller sets the CMDVCC line HIGH. The circuit
       then executes an automatic deactivation sequence by counting the sequencer back and
       finishing in the inactive mode (see Figure 7):
       1. RST goes LOW (t10).
       2. CLK is held LOW (t12 = t10 + 0.5 x T) where T is 64 times the period of the internal
       oscillator (approximately 25 µs).
       3. I/O, AUX1 and AUX2 are pulled LOW (t13 = t10 + T).
       4. VCC starts to fall towards zero (t14 = t10 + 1.5 x T).
       5. The deactivation sequence is complete at tde, when VCC reaches its inactive state.
       6. VUP falls to zero (t15 = t10 + 5T) and all card contacts become low-impedance to GND;
       I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC remain at VDD (pulled-up via a 11 kΩ resistor).
       7. The internal oscillator returns to its lower frequency.

       V. An internal overload detector operates at approximately 120 mA. Current samples to the
                                                                                               21/31


Functional description                                                                              ST8024
            detector are internally filtered, allowing spurious current pulses up to 200 mA with a duration
            in the order of µs to be drawn by the card without causing deactivation. The average current
            must stay below the specified maximum current value. For reasons of VCC voltage accuracy,
            a 100 nF capacitor with an ESR < 100 mΩ should be tied to CGND near to pin VCC, and 100
            nF capacitor with the same ESR should be tied to CGND near card reader contact C1.
5.10        Fault detection
            The following fault conditions are monitored:
                – Short-circuit or high current on VCC
                – Removal of a card during a transaction
                – VDD dropping
                – DC-DC converter operating out of the specified values (VDDP too low or current from
                    VUP too high)
                – Overheating.
                – There are two different cases (see Figure 8):
                – CMDVCC HIGH outside a card session. Output OFF is LOW if a card is not in the
                    card reader, and HIGH if a card is in the reader. A voltage drop on the VDD supply is
                    detected by the supply supervisor, this generates an internal Power-on reset pulse
                    but does not act upon OFF. No short-circuit or overheating is detected because the
                    card is not powered-up.
                – CMDVCC LOW within a card session. Output OFF goes LOW when a fault condition
                    is detected. As soon as this occurs, an emergency deactivation is performed
                    automatically (see Figure 9). When the system controller resets CMDVCC to HIGH it
                    may sense the OFF level again after completing the deactivation sequence. This
                    distinguishes between a hardware problem or a card extraction (OFF goes HIGH
                    again if a card is present).
            Depending on the type of card-present switch within the connector (normally-closed or
            normally-open) and on the mechanical characteristics of the switch, bouncing may occur on
            the PRES signals at card insertion or withdrawal.
            There is a debounce feature in the device with an 8 ms typical duration (see Figure 8).
            When a card is inserted, output OFF goes HIGH only at the end of the debounce time.
            When the card is extracted, an automatic deactivation sequence of the card is performed on
            the first true/false transition on PRES or PRES and output OFF goes LOW.

            (1) These capacitors must be of the low ESR-type and be placed near the IC (within 100 mm).
            (2) ST8024 and the microcontroller must use the same VDD supply.
            (3) Make short, straight connections between CGND, C5 and the ground connection to the capacitor.
            (4) Mount one low ESR-type 100 nF capacitor close to pin VCC.
            (5) Mount one low ESR-type 100 nF capacitor close to C1 contact.
            (6) The connection to C3 should be routed as far from C2, C7, C4 and C8 and, if possible, surrounded by
                   grounded tracks.
            (7) Optional resistor bridge for changing the threshold of VDD. If this bridge is not required pin 18 should be
                   connected to ground.
