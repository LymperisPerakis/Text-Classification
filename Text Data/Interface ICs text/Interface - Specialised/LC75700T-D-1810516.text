LC75700T
Key Scanning IC
Overview
  The LC75700T is a key scanning LSI that accepts input from up to 30 keys
  and can control up to four general purpose output ports. Therefore it can                                        www.onsemi.com
  reduce the number of lines to the front panel in application systems.
Features
    Key input function for up to 30 keys.
    General-purpose output ports for up to four pins.
    A key scan is performed only when a key is pressed, and thus power
     dissipation is reduced.
    Serial data I/O supports CCB* format communication with the system
     controller.
    Switching between the key scan output port and general purpose output                                 TSSOP20 4.4x6.5 / TSSOP20 (225 mil)
     port functions can be controlled by the control data.
    The RES pin is provided. This pin disables key scanning, and forces the
     general-purpose output ports to the low level.
    RC oscillator circuit

Key Scan Operation Functions
1.Key scan timing
  The key scan period is 288T (s). To reliably determine the on/off state of the keys, this LSI scans the keys twice and
  determines that a key has been pressed when the key data agrees. It outputs a key data read request (a low level on DO)
  615T (s) after starting a key scan. If the key data does not agree and a key was pressed at that point, it scans the keys
  again. Thus this LSI cannot detect a key press shorter than 615T (s).

2.Key scan operation
  •The pins KS1 to KS6 are set to the high or low state by the control data.
  •If a key on one of the lines corresponding to a KS1 to KS6 pin which is set high is pressed, the oscillator on the OSC
  pin is started and a key scan is performed. Keys are scanned until all keys are released. Multiple key presses are
  recognized by determining whether multiple key data bits are set.
  •If a key is pressed for longer than 615T (s) (where T = 1/fosc) this LSI outputs a key data read request (a low level on
  DO) to the controller. The controller acknowledges this request and reads the key data. However, if CE is high during a
  serial data transfer, Do will be set high.
  •After the controller reads the key data, the key data read request is cleared (DO is set high) and this LSI performs
  another key scan. Also note that DO being an open-drain output, requires a pull-up resistor (between 1 kΩ and 10 kΩ) .

                      only KS6 high, as in the above example. That is, these diodes prevent incorrect operations due to sneak currents

Multiple Key Presses
   Although this LSI is capable of key scanning without inserting diodes for dual key presses, triple key presses on the
   KI1 to KI5 input pin lines, or multiple key presses on the KS1 to KS6 output pin lines, multiple presses other than these
   cases may result in keys that were not pressed recognized as having been pressed. Therefore, a diode must be inserted
   in series with each key.Applications that do not recognize multiple key presses of three or more keys should check the
   key data for three or more 1 bits and ignore such data.
                                                                                                                                        Page 11

System Reset
When the power is first applied, the state of function is undefined, so it must be initialized by RES = “L”
1.Reset methods
  This LSI stopprts the reset methods described below.
  When a system reset is applied, key scanning is disabeled, the key data is reset, and the general-purpose output ports
  are set to and held at the low level (VSS).
  Set RES = “H” after the RES = “L” period. And key scanning become possible by the control data are transferred.

2.Internal block states during the reset period.
  • CLOCK GENERATOR
    Reset is applied and the basic clock is stopped. (The oscillator on the OSC pin is stopped.)
  • KEY SCAN, KEY BUFFER
    Reset is applied, the circuit is set to the initial state, and at the same time the key scan operation is disabled.
    And all the key data is set to Low. Then, when the control data are transferred, the key scanning operation is enabled.
  • GENERAL PORT
    Reset is applied and the outputs of P1 to P4 are all set to the low level.
  • CCB INTERFACE, SHIFT REGISTER, CONTROL REGISTER
    When a reset is applied, The CONTROL REGISTER is forcibly initialized internally. Then, when control data are
    transferred, the LSI operates according to the control data.

(3) Explanation
  In this technique, the controller uses a timer to determine key on/off states and read the key data. The controller must
  check the DO state when CE is low every t7 period without fail. If DO is low, the controller recognizes that a key has
  been pressed and executed the key data read operation.
  The period t7 in this technique must satisfy the following condition.
          t7 > t4 + t5 + t6
  If a keydata read operation is executed when DO is high, the read key data (KD1 to KD30) will be invalid.

(3) Explanation
  In this technique, the controller uses interrupts to determine key on/off states and read the key data. The controller
  must check the DO state when CE is low. If DO is low, the controller recognizes that a key has been pressed and
  executes the key data read operation. After that the next key on/off determination is performed after the time t8 has
  elapsed by checking the DO state when CE is low and reading the key data.
  The period t8 in this technique must satisfy the following condition.
         t8 > t4
  If a key data read operation is executed when DO is high, the read key data (KD1 to KD30) will be invalid.
