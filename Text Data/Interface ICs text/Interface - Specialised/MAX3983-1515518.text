Note 1:    Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 2:    Measured with 2in of FR4 through InfiniBand connector with TX_PE1 = TX_PE0 =1.
Note 3:    Measured at the chip using 0000011111 or equivalent pattern. TX_PE1 = TX_PE0 = 0 for minimum preemphasis.
Note 4:    All channels under test are not transmitting during test. Channel tested with XAUI CJPAT, as well as this pattern: 19 zeros,
           1, 10 zeros, 1010101010 (D21.5 character), 1100000101 (K28.5+ character), 19 ones, 0, 10 ones, 0101010101 (D10.2
           character), 0011111010 (K28.5- character).
Note 5:    Cables are unequalized, Amphenol Spectra-Strip 24AWG and 28AWG or equivalent equipped with Fujitsu “MicroGiga”
           connector or equivalent. All other channels are quiet. Residual deterministic jitter is the difference between the source jit-
           ter and the output jitter at the load. The deterministic jitter (DJ) at the output of the transmission line must be from media-
           induced loss and not from clock-source modulation. Depending upon the system environment, better results can be
           achieved by selecting different preemphasis levels.
Note 6:    Tested with a 1GHz sine wave applied at TX_IN under test with less than 5in of FR4.
Note 7:    Measured with 3in of FR4 with RX_PE = 1.
Note 8:    Measured at the chip using 0000011111 or equivalent pattern. RX_PE = low (minimum). Signal source is 1VP-P with 5m,
           28AWG InfiniBand cable.
Note 9:    All other receive channels are quiet. TX_ENABLE = 0. Channel tested with XAUI CJPAT as well as this pattern: 19 zeros,
           1, 10 zeros, 1010101010 (D21.5 character), 1100000101 (K28.5+ character), 19 ones, 0, 10 ones, 0101010101 (D10.2
           character), 0011111010 (K28.5- character).
Note 10:   FR4 board material: 6-mil-wide, 100Ω, edge-coupled stripline (tanδ = 0.022, 4.0 < εR < 4.4).
Note 11:   Tested with a 1GHz sine wave applied at RX_IN under test with less than 5in of FR4.
Note 12:   Channel tested with XAUI CJPAT as well as this pattern: 19 zeros, 1, 10 zeros, 1010101010 (D21.5 character), 1100000101
           (K28.5+ character), 19 ones, 0, 10 ones, 0101010101 (D10.2 character), 0011111010 (K28.5- character).
Note 13:   Cables are unequalized, Amphenol Spectra-Strip 24AWG or equivalent equipped with Fujitsu “MicroGiga” connector or
           equivalent. Residual deterministic jitter is the difference between the source jitter at point A and the load jitter at point B in
           Figure 2. The deterministic jitter (DJ) at the output of the transmission line must be from media-induced loss and not from
           clock-source modulation. Depending upon the system environment, better results can be achieved by selecting different
           preemphasis levels.
Note 14:   Valid with pattern generator deterministic jitter as high as 0.17UIP-P.

imperative to know the near-end crosstalk characteristics
of the cable assemblies. 10Gbase-CX4 has defined the
upper limit over frequency for near-end crosstalk (NEXT)
with single and multiple aggressors. InfiniBand has only
specified a percentage as measured in the time domain
relative to the transmitter output. Regardless of the spec-       RX_IN[1:4]+                              5pF

ground inductance and using controlled-impedance
transmission lines on the data signals. Power-supply

pins as possible. There should be sufficient supply fil-

care to isolate the input from the output signals to          Figure 6. RX_IN and TX_IN Equivalent Input Structure

is optimized for lossy environments. For best results,
use board material with a dielectric tangential loss of                         VCCX

High-speed materials with tangential loss of less than
