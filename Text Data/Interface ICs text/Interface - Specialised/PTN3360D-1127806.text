                 Rev. 4 — 29 June 2012                                               Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PTN3360D is a high-speed level shifter device which converts four lanes of low-swing
             AC-coupled differential input signals to DVI v1.0 and HDMI v1.4b compliant open-drain
             current-steering differential output signals, up to 3.0 Gbit/s per lane to support 36-bit
             deep color mode, 4K  2K video format or 3D video data transport. Each of these lanes
             provides a level-shifting differential buffer to translate from low-swing AC-coupled
             differential signaling on the source side, to TMDS-type DC-coupled differential
             current-mode signaling terminated into 50  to 3.3 V on the sink side. Additionally, the
             PTN3360D provides a single-ended active buffer for voltage translation of the HPD signal
             from 5 V on the sink side to 3.3 V on the source side and provides a channel with active
             buffering and level shifting of the DDC channel (consisting of a clock and a data line)
             between 3.3 V source-side and 5 V sink-side. The DDC channel is implemented using
             active I2C-bus buffer technology providing capacitive isolation, redriving and level shifting
             as well as disablement (isolation between source and sink) of the clock and data lines.
             The low-swing AC-coupled differential input signals to the PTN3360D typically come from
             a display source with multi-mode I/O, which supports multiple display standards, for
             example, DisplayPort, HDMI and DVI. While the input differential signals are configured to
             carry DVI or HDMI coded data, they do not comply with the electrical requirements of the
             DVI v1.0 or HDMI v1.4b specification. By using PTN3360D, chip set vendors are able to
             implement such reconfigurable I/Os on multi-mode display source devices, allowing the
             support of multiple display standards while keeping the number of chip set I/O pins low.
             See Figure 1.
             The PTN3360D main high-speed differential lanes feature low-swing self-biasing
             differential inputs which are compliant to the electrical specifications of DisplayPort
             Standard v1.2 and/or PCI Express Standard v1.1, and open-drain current-steering
             differential outputs compliant to DVI v1.0 and HDMI v1.4b electrical specifications. The
             I2C-bus channel actively buffers as well as level-translates the DDC signals for optimal
             capacitive isolation. The PTN3360D also supports power-saving modes in order to
             minimize current consumption when no display is active or connected.
             The PTN3360D is a fully featured HDMI as well as DVI level shifter. The PTN3360D
             supersedes PTN3360B, and provides a better high speed performance with a
             programmable equalizer.
             PTN3360D is powered from a single 3.3 V power supply consuming a small amount of
             power (230 mW typical) and is offered in a 48-terminal HVQFN48 package.

                                   GND pins and the exposed center pad must be connected to supply ground for proper device
                                   operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs
                                   to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat
                                   conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad
                                   region.

                                                                             HDMI/DVI level shifter supporting 3 Gbit/s operation
7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 2 “Functional diagram of PTN3360D”.
                       The PTN3360D level shifts four lanes of low-swing AC-coupled differential input signals to
                       DVI and HDMI compliant open-drain current-steering differential output signals, up to
                       3.0 Gbit/s per lane to support 36-bit deep color mode. It has integrated 50  termination
                       resistors for AC-coupled differential input signals. An enable signal OE_N can be used to
                       turn off the TMDS inputs and outputs, thereby minimizing power consumption. The TMDS
                       outputs are back-power safe to disallow current flow from a powered sink while the
                       PTN3360D is unpowered.
                       The PTN3360D's DDC channel provides active level shifting and buffering, allowing 3.3 V
                       source-side termination and 5 V sink-side termination. The sink-side DDC ports are
                       equipped with a rise time accelerator enabling drive of long cables or high bus
                       capacitance. This enables the system designer to isolate bus capacitance to meet/exceed
                       HDMI DDC specification. The PTN3360D offers back-power safe sink-side I/Os to
                       disallow backdrive current from the DDC clock and data lines when power is off or when
                       DDC is not enabled. An enable signal DCC_EN enables the DDC level shifter block.
                       The PTN3360D also provides voltage translation for the Hot Plug Detect (HPD) signal
                       from 0 V to 5 V on the sink side to 0 V to 3.3 V on the source side.
                       The PTN3360D does not re-time any data. It contains no state machines. No inputs or
                       outputs of the device are latched or clocked. Because the PTN3360D acts as a
                       transparent level shifter, no reset is required.
                   7.1 Enable and disable features
                       PTN3360D offers different ways to enable or disable functionality, using the Output
                       Enable (OE_N), and DDC Enable (DDC_EN) inputs. Whenever the PTN3360D is
                       disabled, the device will be in Standby mode and power consumption will be minimal;
                       otherwise the PTN3360D will be in active mode and power consumption will be nominal.
                       These two inputs each affect the operation of PTN3360D differently: OE_N controls the
                       TMDS channels, DDC_EN affects only the DDC channel, and HPD_SINK does not affect
                       either of the channels. The following sections and truth table describe their detailed
                       operation.
                7.1.1 Hot plug detect
                       The HPD channel of PTN3360D functions as a level-shifting buffer to pass the HPD logic
                       signal from the display sink device (via input HPD_SINK) on to the display source device
                       (via output HPD_SOURCE).
                       The output logic state of HPD_SOURCE output always follows the logic state of input
                       HPD_SINK, regardless of whether the device is in Active mode or Standby mode.

                                                                           HDMI/DVI level shifter supporting 3 Gbit/s operation
                7.1.2 Output Enable function (OE_N)
                      When input OE_N is asserted (active LOW), the IN_Dx and OUT_Dx signals are fully
                      functional. Input termination resistors are enabled and the internal bias circuits are turned
                      on.
                      When OE_N is de-asserted (inactive HIGH), the OUT_Dx outputs are in a
                      high-impedance state and drive zero output current. The IN_Dx input buffers are disabled
                      and IN_Dx termination is disabled. Power consumption is minimized.
                      Remark: Note that OE_N signal level has no influence on the HPD_SINK input,
                      HPD_SOURCE output, or the SCL and SDA level shifters. A transition from HIGH to LOW
                      at OE_N may disable the DDC channel for up to 20 s.
                7.1.3 DDC channel enable function (DDC_EN)
                      The DDC_EN pin is active HIGH and can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave. When
                      DDC_EN is LOW, the DDC channel is turned off. The DDC_EN input should never
                      change state during an I2C-bus operation. Note that disabling DDC_EN during a bus
                      operation may hang the bus, while enabling DDC_EN during bus traffic would corrupt the
                      I2C-bus operation. Hence, DDC_EN should only be toggled while the bus is idle. (See
                      I2C-bus specification).

                                                                              HDMI/DVI level shifter supporting 3 Gbit/s operation
                   7.2 Analog current reference
                       The REXT pin (pin 6) is an analog current sense port used to provide an accurate current
                       reference for the differential outputs OUT_Dx. For best output voltage swing accuracy,
                       use of a 10 k resistor (1 % tolerance) connected between this terminal and GND is
                       recommended.
                       If an external 10 k  1 % resistor is not used, this pin can be connected to GND or VDD

                   7.3 Equalizer

                   7.4 Backdrive current protection
                       The PTN3360D is designed for backdrive prevention on all sink-side TMDS outputs,
                       sink-side DDC I/Os and the HPD_SINK input. This supports user scenarios where the
                       display is connected and powered, but the PTN3360D is unpowered. In these cases, the
                       PTN3360D will sink no more than a negligible amount of leakage current, and will block
                       the display (sink) termination network from driving the power supply of the PTN3360D or
                       that of the inactive DVI or HDMI source.
                   7.5 Active DDC buffer with rise time accelerator
                       The PTN3360D DDC channel, besides providing 3.3 V to 5 V level shifting, includes
                       active buffering and rise time acceleration which allows up to 18 meters bus extension for
                       reliable DDC applications. While retaining all the operating modes and features of the
                       I2C-bus system during the level shifts, it permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing
                       bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) line as well as the
                       rise time accelerator on the sink-side port (SCL_SINK and SDA_SINK) enabling the bus
                       to drive a load up to 1400 pF or distance of 18 m on the sink-side port, and 400 pF on the
                       source-side port (SCL_SOURCE and SCA_SOURCE). Using the PTN3360D for DVI or
                       HDMI level shifting enables the system designer to isolate bus capacitance to
                       meet/exceed HDMI DDC specification. The SDA and SCL pins are overvoltage tolerant
                       and are high-impedance when the PTN3360D is unpowered or when DDC_EN is LOW.

                       PTN3360D has rise time accelerators on the sink-side port (SCL_SINK and SDA_SINK)
                       only. During positive bus transitions on the sink-side port, a current source is switched on
                       to quickly slew the SCL_SINK and SDA_SINK lines HIGH once the 5 V DDC bus VIL
                       threshold level of around 1.5 V is exceeded, and turns off as the 5 V DDC bus VIH
                       threshold voltage of approximately 3.5 V is approached.

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 5) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 13 and 14

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 5.
