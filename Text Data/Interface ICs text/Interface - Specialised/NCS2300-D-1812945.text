NCS2300
Headset Detection
Interface
  The NCS2300 is a compact and cost effective headset detection
interface IC. It integrates a comparator, OR gate, and N−channel
MOSFET to detect the presence of a stereo headset with a
microphone. Pull−up resistors for the detection pins are internalized.                     http://onsemi.com
A built in resistor divider provides the reference voltage for detecting
the left audio channel. The logic low output of the OR gate indicates                                               MARKING

    1         GND              Power        GND is connected to the system ground.
    2          MIC             Output       The open drain MIC output controls the bias on the MIC line. When the headset is not present,
                                            MIC is pulled low. When the headset is present, MIC is pulled up to the MIC bias voltage
                                            through an external pull−up resistor.
    3     GND_detect            Input       GND_detect is the OR gate input. An internal 1 MW pull−up resistor pulls this pin high when
                                            the headset is not present.
    4       L_detect            Input       L_detect is the comparator input. An internal 1 MW pull−up resistor pulls this pin high when the
                                            headset is not present.
    5         VDD              Power        VDD is connected to the system power supply. A 0.1 mF decoupling capacitor is
                                            recommended as close as possible to this pin.
    6         OUT              Output       OUT is a logic output that indicates whether the headset has been properly connected. OUT
                                            will be logic low only when GND_detect and L_detect are low.
