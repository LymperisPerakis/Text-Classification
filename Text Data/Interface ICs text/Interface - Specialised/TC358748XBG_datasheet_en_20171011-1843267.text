Overview
    The MIPI® CSI-2 to Parallel port and Parallel port to CSI-2
    (TC358746AXBG/TC358748XBG) is a bridge device that converts
    MIPI data transfers from devices such as a camera to an application
    processor over a Parallel port interface. All internal registers can be

1. Overview
   The MIPI CSI-2 to Parallel port and Parallel port to CSI-2 (TC358746AXBG/TC358748XBG) is a bridge device
   that converts MIPI data transfers from devices such as a camera to an application processor over a Parallel port
   interface. All internal registers can be access through I2C or SPI (in CSI out case only).
   There are several system configurations where TC358746AXBG/TC358748XBG are typically be used
    ● CSI-2 TX with Parallel Input mode for Analog TV, Tele-presence Type, and Specialty/Older Cameras
       application. In this mode, TC358746AXBG/TC358748XBG (Parallel to CSI-2 converter) is a bridge device that
       converts parallel data transfers to an application over a MIPI CSI-2 interface. Toshiba Bridge Chip provides a
       low power bridge solution to efficiently translate parallel transfers to serial transfers.
    ● CSI-2 RX with Parallel output mode for scanner application. In this mode, TC358746AXBG/TC358748XBG
       (CSI-2 to Parallel converter) is a bridge device that converts serial data transfers from devices such as a camera
       to an application processor over a parallel interface. Toshiba Bridge Chip provides a low power bridge solution
       to efficiently translate serial transfers to parallel transfers.
