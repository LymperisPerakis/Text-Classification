NCN5192
HART Modem
Description
  The NCN5192 is a single−chip, CMOS modem for use in highway
addressable remote transducer (HART) field instruments and masters.
The modem and a few external passive components provide all of the
functions needed to satisfy HART physical layer requirements
including modulation, demodulation, receive filtering, carrier detect,                   www.onsemi.com
and transmit−signal shaping. In addition, the NCN5192 also has an
integrated DAC for low-BOM current loop slave transmitter                                                       MARKING

  The NCN5192 uses phase continuous frequency shift keying (FSK)
at 1200 bits per second. To conserve power the receive circuits are                                         1

Stresses exceeding those listed in the Maximum Ratings table may damage the device. If any of these limits are exceeded, device functionality
should not be assumed, damage may occur and reliability may be affected.
1. CMOS devices are damaged by high−energy electrostatic discharge. Devices must be stored in conductive foam or with all pins shunted.
   Precautions should be taken to avoid application of voltages higher than the maximum rating. Stresses above absolute maximum ratings
   may result in damage to the device.

  CDREF      Carrier detect reference voltage     Carrier Detect Reference voltage. The value should be 85 mV below AREF to set
                                                  the carrier detection to a nominal of 100 mVp−p.
  RESETB     Reset digital logic                  When at logic low (VSS) this input holds all the digital logic in reset. During normal
                                                  operation RESETB should be at VDD.
  RTSB       Request to send                      Active−low input selects the operation of the modulator. TxA is enabled when this
                                                  signal is low. This signal must be held high during power−up.
  RxA        Analog receive input                 Receive Data Demodulator Input. Accepts a HART 1200 / 2200 Hz FSK modulated
                                                  waveform as input.

  TxD        Digital transmit input               Input to the modulator accepts digital data in NRZ form. When TxD is low, the modu-
                                                  lator output frequency is 2200 Hz. When TxD is high, the modulator output frequency
                                                  is 1200 Hz.
  XIN        Oscillator input                     Input to the internal oscillator must be connected to a parallel mode ceramic resonator
                                                  when using the internal oscillator or grounded when using an external clock signal.
  XOUT       Oscillator output                    Output from the internal oscillator must be connected to an external clock signal or to
                                                  a parallel mode ceramic resonator when using the internal oscillator.

  CBIAS      Comparator bias current              Connection to the external bias resistor. RBIAS should be selected such that AREF /
                                                  RBIAS = 2.5 mA ± 5 %
  CD         Carrier detect output                Output goes high when a valid input is recognized on RxA. If the received signal is
                                                  greater than the threshold specified on CDREF for four cycles of the RxA signal, the
                                                  valid input is recognized.

  RxD        Digital receive output               Signal outputs the digital receive data. When the received signal (RxA) is 1200 Hz,
                                                  RxD outputs logic high. When the received signal (RxA) is 2200 Hz, RxD outputs
                                                  logic low. The HART receive data stream is only active if Carrier Detect (CD) is high.

                                                  TxD. TxA is active when RTSB is low. TxA equals 0.5 V when RTSB is high.

                                                 DAC will jump to VSS or DACREF, depending on whether this pin is connected to
                                                 VSS or VDD respectively.
