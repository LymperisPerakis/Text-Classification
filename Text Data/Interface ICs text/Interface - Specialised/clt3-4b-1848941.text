1.1         Functional description
            The CLT3-4 is a quadruple input digital termination device designed for 24 V DC automation
            applications. It provides the front-end circuitry of a digital input module (I/O) in industrial
            automation, and drives an isolating opto-coupler.
            Available in a four channels configuration, it offers a high-density termination by minimizing
            the external components count. It is housed in a TSSOP20 surface mount package to
            reduce the printed board size.
            Made of an input voltage protection, a serial current limiting circuit and an opto-coupler
            driver, each channel circuit terminates the connection between the logic input and the
            associated high side sensor or switch.
            The CLT3-4 is a 3 mA quad channel device compatible the type 1 and 3 characteristics of
            the IEC 61131-2 standard.
            Each input voltage clamping block protects the module input against electromagnetic
            interferences such as those described in the IEC 61131-2 standard and IEC 61000-4-2
            (ESD), 4-4 (transient burst), 4-5 (voltage surge) standards. The supply input is also
            designed with such a protection structure.

CLT3-4B                                                                                 Characteristics
        The current limiting circuit connected between the input and the output pins is compensated
        all over the temperature range. Thanks to its low tolerance, the current limitation allows
        reducing drastically the dissipation of the input compared to a resistive input: the overall
        module requires less cooling capability and becomes smaller.
        The output block of each termination channel controls the operation of an opto-coupler that
        is enabled by a Light Emitting Diode.
        When the input current is less than 1.5 mA, this output circuit derivates the input current to
        maintain the opto-coupler off.
        The original structure of the CLT limiter allows its activation threshold to be low and
        insensitive to the output voltage up to a maximum value of 2.0 V.
        When the CLT input voltage VIN is higher than 5 V, or the module input voltage Vi higher
        than 11 V and a series resistor RI = 1.2 kΩ, the output current that is a share of the input
        current (3/4) is higher than 1.5 mA. The whole termination channel including the opto-
        coupler is on.
        Depending on the input type operation that is described by the IEC 61131-2 standard, the
        input resistance RI can be adjusted because of the different on-state threshold VON MIN.
        This document describes operation and characteristics for type 3 operation with
        VON MIN = 11 V and RI = 1.2 kΩ.
        In type 1 operation the on state threshold VON MIN is 12.34 V instead, and the input resistor
        RI is set 2.2 kΩ.

CLT3-4B                                                                        Application information
2       Application information
2.1     Application description
        The CLT device is used between the input module and the opto-coupler of an I/O module. To
        secure the coupler off state and the non-conduction of its diode, the maximum CLT output
        current is 40 µA with R opto = 15 kΩ. When the CLT input voltage VIN is higher than 5 V, a
        minimum CLT output current of 1.5 mA will secure the opto-coupler on state.
        The CLT limiter is insensitive to the output voltage up to 2.0V. Therefore, its output is able to
        drive any state of the art opto-coupler. Some additional device can be added in series with
        the opto-coupler if the output voltage remains within its functional limits.
        A stand-alone sensor is normally connected on the CLT input. For a good off state control,
        its quiescent current has to be less than 1.5 mA (EN60947-5-2 standard compatible)
        keeping then the opto-coupler off thanks to the CLT device (IOUT < 40 µA). And its maximum
        ON state voltage VS-ON will be lower than 8 V (EN60947-5-2 standard compatible)
        corresponding to the difference between the minimum supply voltage (VCC MIN = 19.2 V)
        and the maximum current limitation activation voltage:
        VCC MIN = VS-ON + VI
        VI = VIN + RI x IIN MAX
        (VI = 11 V when VIN = 5 V, RI = 1.2 kΩ, IIN < 3.7 mA).
2.2     Input reverse polarity robustness
        Each input of the CLT device may be biased to a reverse polarity. This case corresponds to
        a connection mistake or a reverse biasing that is generated by the demagnetization of a
        monitored inductive solenoid.
        The involved input can withstand the reverse current up to 20 mA (in the configuration
        shown in Figure 10) through its input protection diode while its opto-coupler remains OFF.
        Such a case is not critical for the CLT3-4 itself, as it represents less than 15 mW per
        disturbed input. But the input resistors should be designed with care regardless of their
        thermal characteristics (refer to Application note AN2527).
        When the reverse polarity operation is required in types 3 input mode, it is recommended to
        increase the input resistance RI to 1.8 kΩ in order to reduce its dissipation and keep the
        input current below its maximum allowed level (20 mA). The surge and transient immunity
        robustness of the CLT3 is then also increased.
        A 1.8 kΩ value allows the reverse input current to be reduced to 16.2 mA and the resistor
        dissipation to be reduced to 0.47 W, for 30 V VCC and a - 30 V VI voltages.
        The CLT3 normal operation in type 3 is fully compatible with this recommended resistance
        since its internal state threshold is monitored at VIN = 4.2 V and VC = 10V - corresponding to
        VI = 11 V and VCC = 19 V.
        In type 1 input operation where RI = 2.2 kΩ the dissipation of this resistor is less than
        0.39 W.
        The other inputs remain operational, as long as the power supply is working properly
        (VCC >19 V). Refer to Application note AN 2527 for representative application design case.
                                                                                                     7/13


Application information                                                                             CLT3-4B
            The CLT3-4 and the 24 V bus power supply have the same ground COM = GND. The
            reverse polarity of the power supply will shutdown the device. And the power supply resistor
            RC will limit the default current protecting the power supply pin VC. Its dissipation will be less
            than 0.2 W.
            Then, the whole module supply voltage rating is extended to from 0 to 30 V to -30 to +30 V.
2.3         EMC considerations
            Figure 9 gives a typical application diagram where output capacitors are used to increase
            CLT device immunity against fast transient bursts.
            Figure 11 gives the printed circuit board layout associated with this schematic.
            Refer to AN2527 for EMC considerations.

        The input and supply pins are designed to withstand electromagnetic interferences. As
        shown on the device block diagram, each channel input is protected by a clamping diode
        that is connected to the common pin COM. Combined with a serial input resistance
        RI = 1.2 kΩ, this clamping diode implements an effective protection against transient voltage
        burst (± 4 kV, IEC 61000-4-4) and voltage surge (± 1 kV, IEC 61000-4-5).
                                                                                                     9/13

            Depending on the input type operation the input resistance RI can be adjusted because of
            the different on-state threshold VON MIN. So the surge voltage is also increased from the
            minimum level of the type 3 to the type as shown in Table 6.

            This combination allows the surge voltage to be applied from each input to other inputs, the
            ground and the supply contacts in differential or common modes (see Figure 12).
            Thanks to its high resistance RC = 4.7 kΩ, the supply pin VC withstands IEC 61000-4-5 with
            ±1000 V surge voltage (see Figure 12).
            Finally, an external output capacitor may be placed in parallel with the opto-coupler diode to
            filter the transient disturbances injected in the inputs of the module and secure the immunity
            of the opto-coupler itself.
