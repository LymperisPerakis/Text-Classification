HDMI2C1-14HDS                                                                                            Functional description
1        Functional description
         The HDMI2C1-14HDS is a fully integrated ESD protection and signal conditioning device for
         control links and TMDS data video channels of HDMI transmitters (Source).
         The control stage provides a bidirectional buffer, integrating signal conditioning and dynamic
         pull-up on DDC bus for maximum system robustness and signal integrity. The HEAC (HDMI
         Ethernet and Audio return Channels) function is supported, making the component fully
         compliant with HDMI version. A bidirectional CEC block is integrated, able to wake-up the
         application from stand-by mode (all power supply off, except the CEC power supply). The
         integrated TMDS links ESD protection allows a video data rate up to 10.2 Gbps,
         corresponding to the maximal speed specified by the HDMI standard. All video format
         specified by HDMI standard (up to 1080p60) are supported, giving maximal flexibility to
         designers. The +5 V supplied to the cable is protected against accidental surge current and
         short circuit. All these features are provided in a single 24 leads QFN package saving space
         on the board.
         The HDMI2C1-14HDS is a simple solution that provides HDMI designers with an easy and
         fast way to reach full compliancy with the stringent HDMI CTS on a wide temperature range.

2.1        CEC line description
           The CEC bus is described in the HDMI standards as the consumer electronics control. It
           provides control functions between all the various audiovisual equipment chained in the
           user's environment.
           The CEC block integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HDS implements a level shifter, shifting the
           cable CEC line from +3.3 V CEC voltage (VDD_CEC) down to the ASIC power supply voltage
           (VDD_IC) that can be as low as 1.8 V. The Figure 2 shows the functional diagram of the
           integrated CEC block.

           In case of no activity on the CEC bus, or if the CEC driver is off (VDD_CEC = 0), the output
           CEC pin is put in high impedance mode (open circuit) protecting the circuitry and the
           application against hazardous backdrive.
           The Figure 3 illustrates the normal operating mode of the CEC functional block when either
           the IC from the source on the sink drives the communication.

         In case the application is set in stand-by mode, the +5 V main supply of the application is
         generally powered off in order to reduce as much as possible the global power
         consumption. The CEC driver can be the only device still working in low power mode,
         allowing a wake up of the whole application through the CEC line. When the main power
         supply +5 V is switched off, and if the CEC bus is still active (VDD_CEC power in on state),
         the HDMI2C1-14HDS keeps the CEC bus working properly while all other outputs of the
         component are put in high impedance mode.
         The CEC output (cable side) integrates a protection against ESD which is compliant with
         IEC61000-4-2 standard, level 4 (8 kV contact).
2.2      DDC bus description
         The DDC bus is described in the HDMI standards as the Display Data Channel. The
         topology corresponds to an I2C bus that must be compliant with the I2C bus specification
         version 2.1 (January 2000). The DDC bus is made of 2 lines: data line (SDA) and clock line
         (SCL). It is used to create a point to point communication link from the Source to the Sink.
         EEDID and HDCP protocols are especially flowing through this link, making this I2C
         communication channel a key element in the HDMI application.
         The DDC block integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HDS allows a bidirectional communication
         between the cable and the ASIC. It is fully compliant with the HDMI standard and its CTS,
         and with the I2C bus specification version 2.1. It is shifting the 5 V voltage from the cable
         (V5V_OUT) down to the ASIC voltage level (VDD_IC) that can be as low as 1.8 V. The Figure 4
         shows the functional diagram of the DDC block integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HDS device.

           The HDMI standard specifies that the max capacitance of the cable can reach up to 700 pF.
           Knowing that the max capacitance of the sink input can reach up to 50 pF, this means that
           the I2C driver must be able to drive a load capacitance up to 750 pF. On the other hand, the
           I2C standard specifies a maximum rise time of the signal must be lower than 1 µs in order to
           keep the signal integrity. Taking into account the max cable capacitance of 750 pF, it is not
           possible to guarantee a rise time lower than 1 µs in worst case. Therefore, a dynamic pull-
           up has been integrated at the output of SDA and SCL lines and synchronized with the I2C
           driver. This signal booster accelerates for a short period the charging time of the equivalent
           cable capacitance, allowing driving any HDMI cable. The Figure 6 illustrates the benefit of
           the dynamic pull-up integrated in the HDMI2C1-14HDS device.

         In order to activate the DDC lines, the VDD_5V has to reach the VDD_ON threshold (see
         Table 4). The inputs and outputs of the bidirectional level shifters (SDA, SCL, SDA_IC,
         SCL_IC) must be set to a high level after the power-on, and the HPD line has to be activated
         on time.
         The DDC outputs (SCL and SDA on cable side) integrate a protection against ESD which is
         compliant with IEC61000-4-2 standard, level 4 (8kV contact).

           This block simplifies the design and the PCB layout of the HPD and HEAC functions.
           Both HPD and Utility inputs (cable side) integrate a protection against ESD which is
           compliant with IEC61000-4-2 standard, level 4 (8 kV contact).
2.3.1      HPD line description
           The HPD line is described in the HDMI standard as the hot plug detect function. This line is
           used by the source device in order to detect if a sink device is connected through an HDMI
           cable.
           The integrated HPD block is pulling down the line via a current source. When the input
           voltage is detected to be higher than a threshold level VTH_HPD, the signal is converted into
           a high state level on the ASIC side, at the voltage level of the ASIC power supply VDD_IC.
           Otherwise, CEC_IC pin remains in low state.
           The electrical parameters relevant to the HPD block and specified by theTable 7 are
           illustrated in the Figure 8.

2.3.2     HEAC link
          The HEAC link is described in the HDMI 1.4 standards as the HDMI ethernet and audio
          return channel. It corresponds physically to one differential wired pair made of the Utility line
          and the HPD line. Two signals are transmitted through this link.
          The first signal corresponds to the HDMI ethernet channel (HEC). The signal is transmitted
          in differential mode (bidirectional) through the HEAC link. It is specified by the 100Base-TX
          IEEE 802.3 standard (fast ethernet 100Mbps over twisted pair). Therefore, the HEC
          integrates an ethernet link into the video cable, enabling IP-based applications over the
          HDMI cable.
          The second signal corresponds to the audio return channel (ARC). The signal is transmitted
          in common mode (unidirectional, from sink to source) through the HEAC link. It is specified
          by the IEC 60958-1 standard. The ARC function integrates an upstream audio capability,
          simplifying the cabling of the audiovisual equipment. It is no more necessary to use a
          coaxial cable from TV to audio amplifier.
          The HDMI2C1-14HDS helps the designer to implement this high added value HEAC
          function in the application, protecting the link against the ESD with no disturbance of the
          signal.
2.4       +5V protection and fault line
          The +5 V power supply that the source device has to provide to the HDMI cable is described
          by the HDMI standard. It must be protected against accidental short circuit that could occur
          on the cable side.
          The HDMI2C1-14HDS device embeds a low drop current limiter. If an overcurrent is
          detected, the HDMI2C1-14HDS limits the current through the +5 V power supply. If the
          current is too high (short circuit), the device opens the +5 V.
          Furthermore, the HDMI2C1-14HDS device embeds also an over temperature protection
          (OTP). If the internal temperature of the device is reaching a too high value, the +5 V supply
          is even opened in order to protect the application.

                                                                                                            28


Application information                                                                                                            HDMI2C1-14HDS
           In case either the current limiter or the OTP is triggered, the fault pin switches down to a low
           state level (open drain topology) in order to inform the HDMI ASIC that an abnormal
           situation has been detected (option).
           An under voltage lockout (UVLO) is also integrated in the block. It checks the main +5 V
           power supply state, and enable the +5V_OUT only if the main power supply has reach a
           minimal value VDD_5V_ON.
           The Figure 9 shows the functional diagram of the current limiter block.

2.5      TMDS channels
         The TMDS (Transient Minimized Differential Signaling) channels are described by the HDMI
         standard. A total of 4 unidirectional differential pairs are used to transmit the video data to
         the Sink device. There are 3 channels dedicated to the video data, and 1 channel dedicated
         to the clock. The frequency of the TMDS clock is 1/10 of the video data frequency.
         The HDMI2C1-14HDS provides a simple PCB layout solution, directly compliant with HDMI
         connector type A. It protects the application against the ESD according the IEC61000-4-2
         level 4 standard (+/-8 kV contact). The high bandwidth of this ESD protection allows to
         transmit HD video data with no disturbance of the signal up to 3.4Gbps per channel.

2.6      Application block diagrams
         The Figure 11 shows an application block diagram proposal implementing all the possible
         options. The diagram shows that the CEC driver can be totally independent from the HDMI
         ASIC. By this way, even if the +5 V power supply and/or if the HDMI ASIC is sleeping in
         stand-by mode, the CEC bus is still active in low power mode. By this way, the designer has
         then the tools to optimize the power consumption of the global application in stand-by mode,
         and in the same time, has the possibility to implement a smart wake-up through the CEC
         bus enhancing the final user experience.

             b)  General design rule
                 Stencil thickness (T) = 75 ~ 125 µm
                                      W
                     Aspect Ratio = ----- ≥ 1.5

                                      2T ( L + W )
          2. Reference design
             a)  Stencil opening thickness: 100 µm
             b)  Stencil opening for leads: Opening to footprint ratio is 90%.

Recommendation on PCB assembly                                                                 HDMI2C1-14HDS
5.2     Solder paste
        1.   Use halide-free flux, qualification ROL0 according to ANSI/J-STD-004.
        2.   “No clean” solder paste recommended.
        3.   Offers a high tack force to resist component displacement during PCB movement.
        4.   Use solder paste with fine particles: powder particle size 20-45 µm.
5.3     Placement
        1.   Manual positioning is not recommended.
        2.   It is recommended to use the lead recognition capabilities of the placement system, not
             the outline centering.
        3.   Standard tolerance of ± 0.05 mm is recommended.
        4.   3.5 N placement force is recommended. Too much placement force can lead to
             squeezed out solder paste and cause solder joints to short. Too low placement force
             can lead to insufficient contact between package and solder paste that could cause
             open solder joints or badly centered packages.
        5.   To improve the package placement accuracy, a bottom side optical control should be
             performed with a high resolution tool.
        6.   For assembly, a perfect supporting of the PCB is recommended during solder paste
             printing, pick and place and reflow soldering by using optimized tools.
5.4     PCB design preference
        1.   To control the solder paste amount, closed vias are recommended instead of open
             vias.
        2.   The position of tracks and open vias in the solder area should be well balanced.
             Symmetrical layout is recommended, in case any tilt phenomena caused by
             asymmetrical solder paste amount due to the solder flow away.
