1. General description
              The TJA1085 is a FlexRay active star coupler that can connect up to 4 branches of a
              FlexRay network. The TJA1085 is compliant with the FlexRay electrical physical layer
              specification V3.0.1/ISO17458-4 (see Ref. 1 and Ref. 2).
              Several TJA1085 devices can be connected via their TRXD0/1 interfaces to increase the
              number of branches in the network. A dedicated Communication Controller (CC) interface
              allows for integration into an ECU. The TJA1085 supports low-power management by
              offering bus wake-up capability along with battery supply and voltage regulator control.
              The TJA1085 meets industry standards for EMC/ESD performance and provides
              enhanced bus error detection, low current consumption and unmatched asymmetric delay
              performance.
              The TJA1085 also fulfills the JASPAR requirements as defined by the Japanese car
              industry.

                   6.1 Supply voltage
                       The TJA1085 state machine is adequately supplied if at least one of VBAT, VCC or VBUF is
                       available. The internal supply voltage to the state machine is denoted by VDIG. VBUF is an
                       auxiliary supply and is only needed for forwarding the wake-up pattern when VCC is not
                       available.
                   6.2 Host Control (HC) and Autonomous Power (AP) modes - APM flag
                       The APM flag determines whether the TJA1085 is host-controlled or is operating in
                       Autonomous Power mode. It is in AP mode by default.
                       The TJA1085 sets the APM flag:
                         •   at power-on
                         •   when a wake-up event is detected (on TXRD0/1, local or remote)
                         •   when a VCC undervoltage event is detected in AS_Normal mode
                         •   when a VIO undervoltage event lasts longer than tto(uvd)(VIO)
                       The host can set or reset the APM flag at any time.
                   6.3 Signal router
                       The signal router transfers data received on an input channel to all channels configured as
                       outputs. If data is being received on more than one input channel at the same time, the
                       channel that was first to signal activity is selected and data on the other channel/s is
                       ignored. Whether or not the data on an output channel is transmitted depends on whether
                       the output channel is enabled or disabled.
                       The TJA1085 contains the following data input channels:
                         • Branches 1 to 4
                         • TRXD0/1 interface (inner star interface)
                         • TXD/TXEN interface
                       The TJA1085 contains the following data output channels:
                         • Branches 1 to 4
                         • TRXD0/1 interface
                         • RXD pin
                6.3.1 TRXD collision
                       When the TRXD0/1 interface is configured as an output channel, a TRXD collision is
                       detected (COLL_TRXD = 1) if pins TRXD0 and TRXD1 are both LOW for longer than
                       tdet(col)(TRXD), generating a CLAMP_ERROR interrupt.
                       When a TRXD collision is detected, the TJA1085 transmits a DATA_0 to all other active
                       output channels (irrespective of the actual data on the selected input channel), until the
                       selected input channel detects idle state.

                   6.4 Wake-up
                       The TJA1085 supports the following wake-up mechanisms:
                         • Remote wake-up via the bus (wake-up pattern or dedicated wake-up frame)
                         • Local wake-up via pin LWU
                         • Activity on the inner star interface (pins TRXD0 and TRXD1)
                       Any wake-up event will generate a WU interrupt. A remote wake-up on a branch will
                       generate an EVENT_BRx interrupt to indicate the branch where the wake-up pattern or
                       dedicated data frame was detected.
                       The host can identify the wake-up source by polling the General Status register
                       (WU_TRXD = 1 for a TRXD0/1 wake-up; WU_LOCAL = 1 for a local wake-up) and the
                       Branch Status register (WU_BRx = 1 for a remote wake-up).
                6.4.1 Remote wake-up
                       When the TJA1085 is in AS_Standby or AS_Sleep, all branches are monitored for
                       wake-up events. When a valid wake-up pattern or data frame is detected on a branch, the
                       relevant WU_BRx status bit is set and the wake-up pattern/data frame is forwarded to all
                       other enabled branches.
                       A remote wake-up event occurring during an AS_Normal-to-AS_Standby or
                       AS_Normal-to-AS_Sleep transition will also be detected, setting the relevant WU_BRx
                       status bit and generating WU and EVENT_BRx interrupts.
               6.4.1.1 Bus wake-up via wake-up pattern
                       A wake-up pattern consists of at least two consecutive wake-up symbols. A wake-up
                       symbol consists of a DATA_0 phase lasting longer than tdet(wake)DATA_0, followed by an idle
                       phase lasting longer than tdet(wake)idle, provided both wake-up symbols occur within a time
                       span of tdet(wake)tot (see Figure 3). The transceiver also wakes up if the idle phases are
                       replaced by DATA_1 phases.
                       A wake-up event is not detected if an invalid wake-up pattern is received. See Ref. 1 for
                       more details on invalid wake-up patterns.

               6.4.1.2 Bus wake-up via dedicated FlexRay data frame
                       The TJA1085 detects a wake-up event when a dedicated data frame emulating a valid
                       wake-up pattern, as shown in Figure 4, is received.
                       The Data_0 and Data_1 phases of the emulated wake-up symbol are interrupted by the
                       Byte Start Sequence (BSS) preceding each byte in the data frame. With a data rate of
                       10 Mbit/s, the interruption has a maximum duration of 130 ns and does not prevent the
                       transceiver from recognizing the wake-up pattern in the payload.
                       For longer interruptions at lower data rates (5 Mbit/s and 2.5 Mbit/s), the wake-up pattern
                       should be used (see Section 6.4.1.1).

                 6.4.2 Local wake-up via pin LWU
                            Local wake-up is detected when the voltage on pin LWU is lower than Vth(wake)(LWU) for
                            longer than tdet(wake)(LWU) (falling edge on pin LWU). When local wake-up is detected, the
                            WU_LOCAL status bit is set and a WU interrupt is generated. At the same time, the
                            internal biasing of this pin is switched to pull-down.
                            If the voltage on pin LWU rises and remains above Vth(wake)(LWU) for longer than
                            tdet(wake)(LWU) (rising edge on pin LWU), local wake-up is not detected and the biasing on
                            pin LWU is switched to pull-up.
                                                                                               pull-up                    pull-down          pull-up

                     6.5.1 Bus activity and idle detection
                               The following mechanisms for activity and idle detection are valid in normal power modes:
                                  • If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than Vi(dif)det(act) for
                                     tdet(act)(bus), activity is detected on the bus lines
                                  • If, after bus activity detection, the differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than
                                     VIH(dif), pin RXD will go HIGH
                                  • If, after bus activity detection, the differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than
                                     VIL(dif), pin RXD will go LOW
                                  • If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than Vi(dif)det(act) for
                                     tdet(idle)(bus), then idle is detected on the bus lines (pin RXD is switched HIGH or
                                     remains HIGH)
                               Additionally, activity and idle can be detected:
                                  • if pin TXEN is LOW for longer than tdet(act)(TXEN), activity is detected on pin TXEN
                                  • if pin TXEN is HIGH for longer than tdet(idle)(TXEN), idle is detected on pin TXEN
                                  • if pin TRXD0 or TRXD1 is LOW for longer than tdet(act)(TRXD), activity is detected on the
                                     TRXD0/1 interface
                                  • if pins TRXD0 and TRXD1 are both HIGH for longer than tdet(idle)(TRXD), idle is
                                     detected on the TRXD0/1 interface

                   6.6 Bus error detection
                       The TJA1085 provides bus error detection on each branch during data transmission.
                       When a transmit error (TxE_BRx = 1) is detected on a branch, an EVENT_BRx interrupt is
                       generated to notify the host.
                       The following conditions trigger bus error detection:
                          •   Short circuit BP to BM
                          •   Short-circuit BP to GND
                          •   Short-circuit BM to GND
                          •   Short-circuit BP to VCC or VBAT
                          •   Short-circuit BM to VCC or VBAT
                   6.7 Interrupt generation
                       Interrupts are generated when specific events take place or associated status bits in the
                       General or Branch X status registers are set. When an interrupt is generated, the relevant
                       interrupt status bit is set in the Interrupt Status register (see Table 9) and pin INTN is
                       forced LOW.
                       Some interrupt status bits (PWON, WU, SPI_ERROR and HC_ERROR) are reset
                       immediately after the Interrupt Status register has been read successfully (i.e. a rising
                       edge on SCSN with no SPI_ERROR).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                  TJA1085
                                                                                                                     FlexRay active star coupler
                       The UV_ERROR, CLAMP_ERROR, TEMP_ERROR and EVENT_BRx status bits are
                       reset after the flag (or flags) that triggered the interrupt has been reset and a successful
                       read operation had been performed (these two events can occur in any order). Resetting
                       these bits triggers a further falling edge on INTN to indicate to the host that the issue that
                       triggered the interrupt has been resolved (except in the case of EVENT_BRx if a branch
                       wake-up event triggered the interrupt). See Section 6.10.2.3 for further details.
                       INTN signaling conforms to the FlexRay Electrical Physical Layer specification V3.0.1
                       (see Ref. 1).
                   6.8 Operating modes
                       The TJA1085 features five operating modes.
                       AS_PowerOff, AS_Sleep and AS_Standby are low-power modes in which the transceiver
                       is unable to transmit or receive data streams on the bus. In AS_PowerOff mode, only
                       power-on reset detection is active. The SPI, the low-power receiver and wake-up
                       detection are active in AS_Sleep mode. Undervoltage detection is enabled on VCC, VBAT
                       and VBUF in AS_Standby and AS_Normal modes. VIO undervoltage detection is always
                       enabled, except when the TJA1085 is in AS_PowerOff mode.
                       In AS_Normal mode, the TJA1085 can transmit and receive data streams on the bus.
                       Pin INH is HIGH in AS_Normal, AS_Standby and AS_Reset, and floating in AS_PowerOff
                       and AS_Sleep.
                       The dStarGoToSleep timer is started when the TJA1085 switches to AS_Standby or
                       AS_Normal, or when idle is detected on the bus. The timer is halted and reset when
                       activity is detected on the bus.
                6.8.1 Operating mode transitions
               6.8.1.1 AS_PowerOff
                       The TJA1085 switches to AS_PowerOff from any mode if the internal supply to the state
                       machine, VDIG, falls below the power-on detection threshold voltage (Vth(det)POR). It
                       remains in AS_PowerOff until VDIG rises above the power-on recovery threshold voltage
                       (Vth(rec)POR), when it switches to AS_Standby. Pins INTN and SDO are switched to a
                       high-impedance state in AS_PowerOff mode.
               6.8.1.2 AS_Reset
                       The TJA1085 switches to AS_Reset from any mode if pin RSTN goes LOW with no
                       undervoltage detected on VIO. It remains in AS_Reset until pin RSTN goes HIGH, when it
                       switches to AS_Standby.
               6.8.1.3 AS_Standby
                       The TJA1085 switches to AS_Standby:
                          - from AS_PowerOff when VDIG rises above the power-on recovery threshold voltage
                            (Vth(rec)POR)
                          - from AS_Reset when pin RSTN goes HIGH
                          - from AS_Normal when a VCC undervoltage event is detected (VCC < Vuvd(VCC) for
                            longer than tdet(uv)(VCC))

               6.8.1.4 AS_Sleep
                       A wake-up event will trigger a transition to AS_Standby (followed by a transition to
                       AS_Normal if VBUF > Vuvr(VBUF)).
                       The TJA1085 switches to AS_Sleep:

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                 TJA1085
                                                                                                                    FlexRay active star coupler
                   6.9 Branch operating modes
                       Each of the four branches in the TJA1085 features six branch operating modes:
                         • Branch_Off
                            All branches are in Branch_Off mode when the TJA1085 is in AS_PowerOff or
                            AS_Reset mode. The transmitter, normal receiver, low-power receiver and bus error
                            detection are disabled. The bus pins are floating.
                         • Branch_LowPower
                            All branches are in Branch_LowPower mode when the TJA1085 is in AS_Standby or
                            AS_Sleep mode. The transmitter, the normal receiver and bus error detection are
                            disabled. The low-power receiver is active (i.e. remote wake-up is possible). The bus
                            pins are biased to ground.
                         • Branch_Disabled
                            The TJA1085 switches to Branch_Disabled if an overtemperature is detected. The
                            ‘Branch_Disabled’ and ‘Branch_Normal’ commands allow the host to enable/disable a
                            branch without affecting the remaining branches. The transmitter, normal receiver and
                            bus error detection are disabled. Only the low-power receiver is active (remote
                            wake-up is possible). The bus pins are biased to Vo(idle)(BP) and Vo(idle)(BM).
                         • Branch_Normal
                            When a branch is in Branch_Normal, the TJA1085 will be in AS_Normal. The
                            transmitter, normal receiver and bus error detection are active. The bus pins are
                            biased to Vo(idle)(BP) and Vo(idle)(BM).
                         • Branch_TxOnly1
                            In Branch_TxOnly1 mode, the receiver is disabled, i.e. the received data is not
                            forwarded to the signal router. The transmitter is active and bus error detection is
                            active. The bus pins are biased to Vo(idle)(BP) and Vo(idle)(BM).
                         • Branch_TxOnly2
                            This mode is host-controlled only and is operationally identical to Branch_TxOnly1. It
                            allows the host to switch off the receiver in response to error conditions.
                         • Branch_FailSilent
                            The transmitter, the low-power receiver and bus error detection are disabled. Only the
                            receiver remains active to monitor the branch for idle or activity. Received data is not
                            forwarded to the signal router. The bus pins are biased to Vo(idle)(BP) and Vo(idle)(BM).
                6.9.1 Branch operating mode transitions
                       Branch-related host commands can only be issued when the TJA1085 is in AS_Normal
                       mode.
               6.9.1.1 Branch_Off
                       When the TJA1085 enters AS_PowerOff or AS_Reset, all four branches switch to
                       Branch-Off. When the TJA1085 subsequently switches to AS_Standby, all four branches
                       switch to Branch_LowPower.
               6.9.1.2 Branch_LowPower
                       All four branches switch to Branch_LowPower when the TJA1085 enters AS_Standby or
                       AS_Sleep. All branches remain in this mode until the TJA1085 enters AS_Normal. When
                       this transition happens, branches that were in Branch_Disabled before switching to
                       Branch_LowPower return to Branch_Disabled. The remaining branches switch to
                       Branch_Normal.

                                                                                                                   FlexRay active star coupler
               6.9.1.3 Branch_Disabled
                       An overtemperature event (TEMP_HIGH flag set) triggers a transition from
                       Branch_Normal to Branch_Disabled in all branches.
                       If an overtemperature event triggered the transition from Branch_Normal to
                       Branch_Disabled, all branches return to Branch_Normal when the overtemperature
                       problem has been resolved (TEMP_WARN flag reset).
                       The ‘Branch_Disabled’ and ‘Branch_Normal’ commands can be used to enable/disable
                       individual branches. A host command is also available to trigger a transition from
                       Branch_Disabled to Branch_TxOnly1 (‘Branch_TxOnly').
                       If a branch switches from Branch_Disabled to Branch_LowPower because the TJA1085
                       has entered AS_Standby or AS_Sleep, it will return to Branch_Disabled when the
                       TJA1085 enters AS_Normal.
               6.9.1.4 Branch_FailSilent
                       A branch switches to Branch_FailSilent:
                          - from Branch_Normal if a branch is clamped (Clamp_BRx flag set), provided
                            clamp-detection is enabled (bit CLAMP_DET set; see Table 8)
                          - from Branch_Normal if a transmit error (TxE_BRx = 1) is detected, provided
                            autonomous error confinement is enabled (bit AEC set; see Table 8)
                          - from Branch_TxOnly1 if a transmit error (TxE_BRx = 1) is detected.
                       The branch remains in Branch_FailSilent until idle is detected on all branches, when it
                       switches to Branch_TxOnly1 (a ‘Branch_TxOnly’ command is needed in HC mode).
               6.9.1.5 Branch_TxOnly1
                       A branch switches to Branch_TxOnly1:
                          - from Branch_Disabled in response to a ‘Branch_TxOnly’ command (HC mode)
                          - from Branch_FailSilent in response to a ‘Branch_TxOnly’ command when all branches
                          are idle (HC mode)
                          - from Branch_FailSilent when all branches are idle (AP mode)
                       A branch switches from Branch_TxOnly1:
                          - to Branch_Normal when a transmission ends without error
                          - to Branch_FailSilent if a transmit error is detected (TxE_BRx = 1)
               6.9.1.6 Branch_TxOnly2
                       This mode is purely host controlled. A branch switches to Branch_TxOnly2 only in
                       response to a ‘Branch_TxOnly’ command issued in Branch_Normal mode. The branch
                       remains in Branch_TxOnly2 mode until a ‘Branch_Normal’ command is received.
               6.9.1.7 Branch_Normal
                       A branch switches to Branch_Normal:
                          - from Branch_LowPower when the TJA1085 enters AS_Normal mode (provided it was
                            not in Branch_Disabled before the transition to Branch_LowPower mode)

                     - from Branch_TxOnly2 in response to a host ‘Branch_Normal’ command
                     - from Branch_TxOnly1 when a transmission ends without error
                     - from Branch_Disabled in response to a host ‘Branch_Normal’ command
                     - from Branch_Disabled when an overtemperature is resolved (TEMP_WARN = 0),
                       provided the overtemperature triggered the earlier transition to Branch_Disabled.
                   A branch switches from Branch_Normal:
                     - to Branch_FailSilent if a branch is clamped, provided clamp-detection is enabled
                       (CLAMP_DET = 1)
                     - to Branch_FailSilent if a transmit error is detected, provided bit AEC = 1
                     - to Branch_TxOnly2 if a host ‘Branch_TxOnly’ command is received
                     - to Branch_Disabled if an overtemperature event is detected (TEMP_HIGH = 1)

                                                                                                                           FlexRay active star coupler
                6.10 SPI interface
                          The TJA1085 contains a bidirectional 16-bit Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) for
                          communicating with a host. The SPI allows the host to configure the TJA1085 and to
                          access error and status information.
               6.10.1 Register access
                          The SPI supports full duplex data transfer, so status information is read out on pin SDO
                          while control data is being shifted in on pin SDI. Bit sampling is performed on the falling
                          edge of the clock signal on pin SCLK and data is shifted on the rising edge (MSB first; see
                          Figure 8).
                          The clock signal must be LOW when SCSN goes LOW to initiate an SPI register access
                          cycle.

               6.10.2 SPI registers
                          The SPI register structure in the TJA1085 is illustrated in Figure 9. The three MSBs

                          access as read/write or read only. If bit 12 is 1, the SPI data transfer will be read only and
                          all data on the SDI pin will be ignored. If bit 12 is 0, data bits 11 to 0 will be written to the

                   The assignment of control and status register addresses is detailed in Table 6. Data can
                   only be written to the Control and Configuration registers (status registers are read-only
                   by definition). Therefore the state of bit 12 is only evaluated when these registers are
                   being accessed.

                                                                                                               FlexRay active star coupler
                   Autonomous Error Confinement (AEC):
                   Setting the AEC bit enables the autonomous error confinement feature of the TJA1085.
                   When AEC is enabled, a bus error (TxE_BRx = 1) triggers a transition from
                   Branch_Normal to Branch_FailSilent. AEC is disabled by default.
                   Bus Failure Timer (BFT):
                   Setting the BFT bit enables the bus failure timer.
                   When the BFT is enabled, pulses shorter than tto(BFT) are ignored, resulting in more robust
                   bus error detection. The BFT is enabled by default.
                   Wake-up detection on branch x (WUD_BRx):
                   Setting the WUD_BRx bit enables wake-up detection on the specified branch.
                   Each branch in a TJA1085 star network contains a low-power receiver for detecting
                   remote wake-up events. These events can be enabled and disabled individually. This
                   feature makes it possible to minimize quiescent current consumption, especially in
                   AS_Sleep mode. Wake-up detection is enabled by default on all branches.
                   Communication Controller interface Enable (CC_EN):
                   Setting bit CC_EN enables the communication controller interface.
                   A communication controller can be connected to the TJA1085 when CC_EN = 1. If
                   CC_EN = 0, the RXD output driver is switched off to minimize current consumption in
                   AS_Normal mode. The CC interface is disabled by default.
                   TRXD0/1 interface Enable (TRXD_EN):
                   Setting bit TRXD_EN enables the TRXD0 and TRXD1 interfaces.
                   When the TRXD0/1 interfaces are enabled, several TJA1085 devices can be connected
                   together to form a single active star. If only one TJA1085 is needed at any time, the
                   TRXD0/1 interfaces can be disabled to minimize current consumption in AS_Normal
                   mode. The TRXD0 and TRXD1 interfaces are enabled by default.
                   Clamp detection (CLAMP_DET):
                   Setting bit CLAMP_DET enables clamp detection on TXEN, TRXD and on the four
                   branches.
                   When clamp detection is enabled, a CLAMP_ERROR interrupt is generated if clamping is
                   detected on TXEN (CLAMP_TXEN = 1), TRXD (CLAMP_TRXD = 1) or on a branch
                   (CLAMP_BRx). Clamp detection is enabled by default.
                   Bit latching (BIT_LATCHING):
                   When bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), the status bits in the General and
                   Branch X status registers reflect the latched state until the register is read. Once the
                   register has been read, latching is released and the bits then reflect the current ‘live’
                   status. When bit latching is disabled, the status bits reflect the ‘live’ status at all times. Bit
                   latching is disabled by default.

              6.10.2.3 Interrupt Status register
                       The Interrupt Status register is read-only. When the TJA1085 sets a bit in this register, it
                       triggers a falling edge on pin INTN. Bits PWON, WU, SPI_ERROR and HC_ERROR are
                       reset after a successful read operation. The remaining bits are reset after the flag (or
                       flags) that triggered the interrupt has been reset and a successful read operation has
                       been performed (see Section 6.7).

                                                                                                                 FlexRay active star coupler
                   PWON: A PWON interrupt is generated to signal a power-on event.
                   The PWON interrupt status bit is set when the TJA1085 leaves AS_PowerOff or
                   AS_Reset. It is reset after a successful read operation on the Interrupt Status register.
                   WU: A WU interrupt indicates the occurrence of a wake-up event.
                   The WU interrupt status bit is set when a wake-up event is detected on a branch
                   (WU_BRx = 1), on TRXD0/1 (WU_TRXD = 1), or on LWU (WU_LOCAL = 1). It is reset
                   after a successful read operation on the Interrupt Status register.
                   EVENT_BRx: An EVENT_BRx interrupt signals the occurrence of a significant event on
                   the relevant branch.
                   The EVENT_BRx interrupt status bit is set when any of the following events is detected on
                   a branch:
                      - a wake-up event (WU_BRx = 1)
                      - a bus error (TxE_BRx = 1)
                      - clamping (CLAMP_BRx = 1)
                   It is reset after the flag (or flags) that triggered the interrupt has been reset and the
                   Interrupt Status register has been read successfully. Resetting EVENT_BRx will trigger a
                   falling edge on INTN to indicate to the host that the event that triggered the interrupt has
                   been resolved (except when the interrupt was triggered by a branch wake-up event).
                   UV_ERROR: A UV_ERROR interrupt indicates that an undervoltage has occurred.
                   The UV_ERROR interrupt status bit is set when a VBAT (UV_VBAT = 1), VCC
                   (UV_VCC = 1) or VIO (UV_VIO = 1) undervoltage is detected. It is reset after the flag (or
                   flags) that triggered the interrupt has been reset and the Interrupt Status register has been
                   read successfully. Resetting UV_ERROR triggers a falling edge on INTN to indicate to the
                   host that the undervoltage condition is no longer present.
                   CLAMP_ERROR: A CLAMP_ERROR interrupt indicates that an input channel has
                   become clamped or a collision has occurred on the TRXDO/1 interface.
                   The CLAMP_ERROR interrupt status bit is set when clamping is detected on TRXD
                   (CLAMP_TRXD = 1), on TXEN (CLAMP_TXEN = 1) or on a branch (CLAMP_BRx = 1) or
                   if a collision is detected on TRXD0/TRXD1 (COLL_TRXD = 1). It is reset after the flag (or
                   flags) that triggered the interrupt has been reset and the Interrupt Status register has been
                   read successfully. Resetting CLAMP_ERROR triggers a falling edge on INTN to indicate
                   to the host that the clamp or collision error has been corrected.
                   SPI_ERROR: An SPI_ERROR interrupt indicates that an error has occurred during SPI
                   communications.
                   The SPI_ERROR interrupt status bit is set if the number of SCLK cycles generated during
                   a LOW phase on SCSN does not equal 16. It is reset after a successful read operation on
                   the Interrupt Status register.
                   HC_ERROR: A HC_ERROR interrupt indicates that an invalid host command has been
                   received.

                   The HC_ERROR interrupt status bit is set when the host requests an illegal mode
                   transition (as defined in the Section 6.8.1 and Section 6.9.1). It is reset after a successful
                   read operation on the Interrupt Status register.
                   TEMP_ERROR: A TEMP_ERROR interrupt signals the presence of an overtemperature
                   condition.
                   The TEMP_ERROR interrupt status bit is set when the temperature warning level
                   (TEMP_WARN = 1) or temperature high level (TEMP_HIGH = 1) is exceeded. It is reset
                   after the flag (or flags) that triggered the interrupt has been reset and the Interrupt Status
                   register has been read successfully. Resetting TEMP_ERROR triggers a falling edge on
                   INTN to indicate to the host that the overtemperature condition is no longer present.

                   WU_LOCAL:
                   WU_LOCAL is set when a local wake-up event is detected. A WU interrupt is generated.
                   WU_LOCAL is reset after the General Status register has been read successfully or when
                   the TJA1085 switches from AS_Normal to AS_Standby or AS_Sleep. This ensures that a
                   new wake-up event will be detected.
                   WU_TRXD:
                   WU_TRXD is set when a wake-up event is detected on the TRXD0/1 interface. A WU
                   interrupt is generated.
                   WU_TRXD is reset after the General Status register has been read successfully or when
                   the TJA1085 switches from AS_Normal to AS_Standby or AS_Sleep. This ensures that a
                   new wake-up event will be detected.
                   BGE_FB:
                   Bit BGE_FB provides information about the voltage level on pin BGE.
                   BGE_FB is set when the voltage on BGE is HIGH and reset when the voltage on BGE is
                   LOW.
                   UV_VBAT:
                   UV_VBAT is set when a VBAT undervoltage is detected, generating a UV_ERROR
                   interrupt.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), UV_BAT will remain set until the General
                   Status register has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation (set if
                   VBAT < Vuvd(VBAT) for longer than tdet(uv)(VBAT) and reset if VBAT > Vuvr(VBAT) for longer than
                   trec(uv)(VBAT)). If bit latching is not enabled, UV_BAT will reflect the ‘live’ situation at all
                   times.
                   UV_VCC:
                   UV_VCC is set when a VCC undervoltage is detected, generating a UV_ERROR interrupt.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), UV_VCC will remain set until the General
                   Status register has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation (set if
                   VCC < Vuvd(VCC) for longer than tto(uvd)(VCC) and reset if VCC > Vuvr(VCC) for longer than
                   tto(uvr)(VCC)). If bit latching is not enabled, UV_VCC will reflect the ‘live’ situation at all
                   times.
                   UV_VIO:
                   UV_VIO is set when a VIO undervoltage is detected, generating a UV_ERROR interrupt.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), UV_VIO will remain set until the General
                   Status register has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation (set if
                   VIO < Vuvd(VIO) for longer than tto(uvd)(VIO) and reset if VIO > Vuvr(VIO) for longer than
                   tto(uvr)(VIO)). If bit latching is not enabled, UV_VIO will reflect the ‘live’ situation at all times.
                   When a VIO undervoltage is active, the digital inputs are disabled and the TJA1085 is
                   unable to accept Host commands. If the VIO undervoltage persists for longer than
                   tto(uvd)(VIO), the APM flag is set and the TJA1085 switches from Host control to
                   Autonomous control.

                   TEMP_WARN:
                   TEMP_WARN is set when the junction temperature rises above the temperature warning
                   level, generating a TEMP_ERROR interrupt.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), TEMP_WARN will remain set until the
                   General Status register has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation
                   (set when Tj > Tj(warn) and reset when Tj < Tj(warn) with no activity on the bus or on the CC
                   and TRXD0/1 interfaces). If bit latching is not enabled, TEMP_WARN will reflect the ‘live’
                   situation at all times.
                   TEMP_HIGH:
                   TEMP_HIGH is set when the junction temperature rises above the temperature high level.
                   The output driver on the TRXD0/1 interface is disabled along with the branch transmitters
                   (all branches switch to Branch_Disabled). A TEMP_ERROR interrupt is generated.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), TEMP_HIGH will remain set until the
                   General Status register has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation
                   (set when Tj > Tj(high) and reset when Tj < Tj(high) with no activity on the bus or on the CC
                   and TRXD0/1 interfaces). If bit latching is not enabled, TEMP_HIGH will reflect the ‘live’
                   situation at all times.
                   CLAMP_TRXD:
                   CLAMP_TRXD is set when the TRXD0/1 interface is configured as an input and TRXD0
                   or TRXD1 is clamped LOW for longer than tdetCL(TRXD). The output driver on the TRXD0/1
                   interface is disabled and data on the inputs is ignored. A CLAMP_ERROR interrupt is
                   generated.
                   If bit latching is enabled, CLAMP_TRXD will remain set until the General Status register
                   has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation (set when TRXD0 or
                   TRXD1 clamped LOW and reset when TRXD0 and TRXD1 are HIGH). If bit latching is not
                   enabled, CLAMP_TRXD will reflect the ‘live’ situation at all times.
                   CLAMP_TXEN:
                   CLAMP_TXEN is set when the TXEN is clamped LOW for longer than tdetCL(TXEN). Data
                   on TXD/TXEN is ignored and a CLAMP_ERROR interrupt is generated.
                   If bit latching is enabled, CLAMP_TXEN will remain set until the General Status register
                   has been read, after which it will reflect the current ‘live’ situation (set when TXEN
                   clamped LOW and reset when TXEN is HIGH). If bit latching is not enabled,
                   CLAMP_TXEN will reflect the ‘live’ situation at all times.
                   COLL_TRXD:
                   COLL_TRXD is set when a collision is detected on the TRXD0/1 interface (TRXD0 and
                   TRXD1 LOW for longer than tdet(col)(TRXD)). A CLAMP_ERROR interrupt is generated.
                   COLL_TRXD is reset once the General Status register has been read.

              6.10.2.5 Branch X status registers
                       There is a dedicated read-only status register for each branch, i.e. there are four Branch X
                       status registers in total. Each register contains relevant status information of a branch.

                                                                                                                 FlexRay active star coupler
                   STATE_BRx:
                   Bits STATE_BRx indicate the current branch operating mode.
                   WU_BRx:
                   WU_BRx is set when a remote wake-up event is detected on a branch. A WU interrupt is
                   generated along with an EVENT_BRx interrupt to indicate the branch where the wake-up
                   pattern or dedicated data frame was detected.
                   WU_BRx is reset after the Branch Status register has been read successfully or when the
                   TJA1085 switches from AS_Normal to AS_Standby or AS_Sleep. This ensures that a new
                   wake-up event will be detected.
                   TxE_BRx:
                   TxE_BRx is set when a transmit error is detected on a branch, generating an
                   EVENT_BRx interrupt. A transmit error is detected when there is a mismatch between the
                   transmitted and received signals.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), TxE_BRx will remain set until the register
                   has been read, after which it is reset if no mismatch is found between transmitted and
                   received signals or the branch leaves Branch_Normal. If bit latching is not enabled,
                   TxE_BRx is reset if no mismatch is found in a data frame or the branch leaves
                   Branch_Normal.
                   CLAMP_BRx:
                   CLAMP_BRx is set when a branch is clamped for longer than tdetCL(bus), generating a
                   CLAMP_ERROR interrupt along with an EVENT_BRx interrupt to indicate the branch.
                   If bit latching is enabled (BIT_LATCHING = 1), CLAMP_BRx will remain set until the
                   register has been read, after which it is reset when idle is detected on the branch. If bit
                   latching is not enabled, CLAMP_BRx is reset when idle is detected on the branch.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 15) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 16 and 17

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 15.
