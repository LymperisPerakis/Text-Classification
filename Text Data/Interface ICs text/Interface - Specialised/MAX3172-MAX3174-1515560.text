                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                  Note 2: The charge pump on the MAX3171/MAX3173 can supply V+ and V- to the MAX3172/MAX3174. The V+ and V- input levels
                          vary with the mode of chipset operation as follows:
                             V.35/V.28 modes: +5.55V ≤ V+ ≤ +6.50V, -6.50V ≤ V- ≤ -5.45V
                             Typical operation: V+ = +5.90V, V- = -5.80V
                             V.10/V.11 modes: +4.20V ≤ V+ ≤ +5.0V, -4.60V ≤ V- ≤ -3.80V
                             Typical operation: V+ = +4.60V, V- = -4.20V
                             The MAX3171/MAX3173 are guaranteed to provide these V+/V- supply levels.

which enables driver 4 on the MAX3172/MAX3174

driver 3 on the MAX3170. A logic low selects DTE,
which enables receiver 4 on the MAX3172/MAX3174
(INVERT = 0), receiver 1 on the MAX3171/MAX3173,
and receiver 1 on the MAX3170.
