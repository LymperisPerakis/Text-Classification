GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                           FEATURES
The SP510E is a highly integrated physical layer               Up to 52Mbps Differential Transmission Rates
solution that is configurable to support multiple serial       ±15kV HBM ESD Tolerance for Analog I/O Pins
standards. It incorporates eight drivers and eight
                                                               Integrated Termination Resistors for V.11/V.35
receivers (8TX/8RX), configurable for either
differential (V.11 or V.35) or single ended (V.28 and          Eight Drivers and Eight Receivers (8TX/8RX)
V.10) signaling.                                               Adjustable Logic Level Pin VL (Down to 1.65V)
SP510E enables a Serial Communications Controller              Software Selectable Protocols with 3-Bit Word:
to implement a variety of serial port types including                  - RS-232 (V.28)
V.24, V.25, V.36, EIA-530, EIA-530-A, X.21, RS-232.                    - EIA-530 (V.10 & V.11)
The device architecture is designed to support the                     - EIA-530A (V.10 & V.11)
data and clock signals used in HDLC or SDLC serial                     - X.21 (V.11)
ports as either DTE or DCE.
                                                                       - RS-449/V.36
Operating configuration is programmable in system              Internal Line or Digital Loopback Testing
using the mode-select pins. The V.11 and V.35 modes
                                                               Adheres to NET1/NET2 and TBR2 Requirements
include internal bus termination that may be switched
in or out using the TERM_OFF pin.                              Easy Flow-Through Pinout
The SP510E is ideal for space constrained
                                                               Single +5V Supply Voltage
applications. It requires only a single 5V supply for full     Individual Driver/Receiver Enable/Disable Controls
operation. The VL pin determines the receiver output           Operates in DTE or DCE Mode
voltage (VOH, down to 1.65V), for interfacing with             Pin Compatible Upgrade for SP509, SP508
lower voltage CPUs and FPGAs. For single supply
operation at 5V the VL pin will be connected to VCC.
Fully compliant V.28 and V.10 driver output voltages
are generated using the onboard charge pump.                  TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
Special power sequencing is not required during                Data Communication Networks
system startup. Charge pump outputs are internally
                                                               Telecommunication Equipment
regulated to minimize power consumption. The
SP510E requires only four 1µF capacitors for                   Secured Data Communication
complete functionality. The device may be put into a           CSU and DSU
low power shutdown mode when not in active use.                Data Routers
All receivers have fail-safe protection to put outputs         Network Switches
into an output-high state when inputs are open,
                                                               WAN Access Equipment
shorted, or terminated but idle.
                                                               VoIP-PBX Gateways

Thermal Considerations
High speed devices like the SP510E dissipate heat during normal operation. Actual power dissipation is a
function of the switching frequency and loading. For maximum system performance and reliability designers
should ensure sufficient air flow. Other commonly used methods for managing heat include heat sinks for
higher powered devices, forced air flow (fans) and lower density board stuffing.
PCB Design
The use of multi layer printed circuit boards is recommended to provide both a better ground plane and a
thermal path for heat dissipation. If possible, the ground plane should face the bottom of the package to form
the thermal conduction plane. Two-sided printed circuit boards may be used where board dimensions and
package count are small, but multi-layer boards allow for improved signal routing as well as improved signal
integrity. A multi-layer board allows microstrip line techniques for high speed signal interconnections when the
high speed signal lines on the inner layers.
