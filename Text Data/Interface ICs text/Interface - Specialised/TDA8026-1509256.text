8. Functional description
                       Remark: Throughout this document ISO 7816-3 and EMV standard terminology
                       conventions have been adhered to and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with these.
                   8.1 Power supplies
                       The TDA8026 supply pins are VDD, VDD(INTF) and GND1 to GND10.
                         • VDD must be between 2.7 V and 5.5 V
                         • VDD(INTF) must be between 1.6 V and 3.6 V
                       The VDD, VDD(INTF) supply voltages can be applied to the device at any time, in any
                       sequence. All interface signals to the system controller are referenced to the VDD(INTF)
                       supply voltage which can be lower or higher than VDD. The integrated DC-to-DC converter
                       generates the card supply voltage (VCC(n)) of either 5 V , 3 V or 1.8 V ( 5 %). In addition,
                       the internal voltage regulator delivers VDD(INTREGD) 3.3 V supply voltage.
                                                                      POWER ON

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                      TDA8026
                                                                                                                  Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                8.2.1 Standby mode
                       In Standby mode, both the supply voltages VDD and VDD(INTF) are applied within the
                       specification limits as described in Table 40 on page 40. In addition, the DC-to-DC
                       converter is not running and the card slots are not activated.
                8.2.2 Active mode
                       In active mode, both the VDD and VDD(INTF) supply voltages are applied to the device
                       within the specification limits as described in Table 40 on page 40. A minimum of one card
                       slot is activated. All card slots can be activated at once and communication performed
                       with up to two cards slots.
                       The DC-to-DC converter has been developed to handle a 116 mA (typical) DC load. This
                       allows two active card slots to communicate with a load of 55 mA while the three
                       remaining card slots are in clock-stop mode (see Section 8.2.3 for information about this
                       mode) with a 2 mA load.
                       The DC-to-DC converter overload protection is triggered when a higher current load than
                       specified in Table 40 on page 40 is supplied to the DC-to-DC converter (see Section 8.11
                       for further information).
                8.2.3 Clock-stop mode
                       Clock-stop mode is a low-power mode which is triggered when a card is activated without
                       any communication. In this mode, a supply voltage with a low frequency clock is applied to
                       cards that do not support the clock-stop feature.
                8.2.4 Shutdown mode
                       Shutdown mode is the very low power consumption mode, typically 25 A. The TDA8026
                       enters this mode when the SDWNN pin is driven LOW. Only presence monitoring on card
                       slot 1 remains enabled. When card insertion or removal is detected on card slot 1, an
                       interrupt signal (IRQN) is sent to the microcontroller.
                       In shutdown mode, it is assumed that the VDD(INTF) and VDD supply voltages are stable
                       and the SDWNN pin is active LOW.
               8.2.4.1 Entering shutdown mode
                       Shutdown mode is activated when the SDWNN pin is driven LOW. On entering this mode:
                        1. All card slots are automatically deactivated
                        2. The power consumption is reduced on completion of the deactivation sequence.
                       This causes the following:
                         • Digital module moves in to reset mode. However, card presence monitoring on slot 1
                            continues to operate normally
                         • All card slots are disabled and all card pins are forced to 0 V. Again, card presence
                            monitoring on slot 1 continues to operate normally
                         • Thermal protection is disabled
                         • The DC-to-DC converter is bypassed
                         • All interface signal pull-up resistors are disconnected from their supply rail (except the
                            pull-up resistor on the SDWNN pin)

               8.2.4.2 Exiting shutdown mode
                       The TDA8026 performs the following steps when exiting shutdown mode:
                        1. Card insertion on card slot 1 is signalled by the IRQN pin signal being driven LOW.
                        2. Using the IRQN pin signal, the microcontroller detects the card insertion and drives
                           the SDWNN pin HIGH to wake-up the TDA8026
                        3. When the SDWNN pin is HIGH, the IRQN pin is set to HIGH and the analog module is
                           powered-up. A full power-up sequence is executed by the TDA8026
                        4. When the TDA8026 is ready, the IRQN pin is set to LOW
                        5. The microcontroller detects the device interrupt using the IRQN pin and services it
                           which resets pin IRQN to HIGH

                8.3.2 Description
                       The voltage supervisor can be used to perform Power-On Resets (POR) and supply drop
                       detection during a card session. The supervisors control the internal regulated supply
                       voltage (VDD(INTREGD)) and the microcontroller interface supply voltage (VDD(INTF)) to
                       ensure problem-free operation of the TDA8026. This block controls:
                        • VDD using the internal voltage regulator’s output (VDD(INTREGD))
                        • the microcontroller interface supply voltage (VDD(INTF)) using the voltage on the
                            PORADJ pin (VPORADJ)
                       When an alarm occurs, the internal digital controller resets the TDA8026.

                8.3.3 VDD(INTREGD) voltage supervisor without external divider on PORADJ pin
                      An alarm signal is triggered and the analog controller resets the TDA8026 when:
                        • VDD(INTREGD) is less than Vth on pin VDD(INTREGD)
                        • Pin PORADJ monitoring VDD(INTF) is less than Vth
                      The alarm is reset and the TDA8026 leaves reset mode 8 ms after VDD and VPORADJ are
                      above their respective Vth + Vhys.
                      Vth on VDD(INTF) is set as shown in Equation 1:
                      V th = V bg  1 + -------
                                            R2

                      Thus Vbg = 1.21 V (see Figure 6).
                      In reset mode, the TDA8026 is inactive and does not respond to any external command
                      lines.

                                                                                                                  Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                   8.4 I2C-bus description
                       Remark: Refer to the I2C-bus specification for more information.
                       The I2C-bus interface in the TDA8026 is an I2C-bus slave operating either Standard mode
                       (100 kHz) or Fast mode (400 kHz). In addition, it integrates shift register functions, shift
                       timing generation and slave address recognition.
                8.4.1 I2C-bus protocol
                       The I2C-bus protocol is based on bidirectional, 2-line communication between ICs or
                       modules. The serial bus consists of two bidirectional lines: one for data signals (SDA) and
                       one for clock signals (SCL). Both the SDA and SCL lines must be connected to the
                       VDD(INTF) supply voltage using a pull-up resistor (refer to the I2C-bus specification for more
                       details).
                       The I2C-bus protocol is defined as follows:
                         • Data transfer can only be initialized when the I2C-bus is not busy.
                         • During data transfer, the data line must remain stable when the clock line is HIGH.
                            Changes in the data line while the clock line is HIGH are interpreted as control
                            signals.
                8.4.2 Bus conditions
                       The following bus conditions are defined.
                       Bus not busy — Both data and clock lines remain HIGH.
                       Start data transfer — The START condition is generated when the state of the data line
                       changes from HIGH to LOW while the clock line is HIGH.
                       Stop data transfer — The STOP condition is generated when the state of the data line
                       changes from LOW to HIGH while the clock line is HIGH.
                       Data valid — The data line state represents valid data, after a START condition with the
                       data line stable for the duration of the clock signal HIGH period. There is one clock pulse
                       per bit of data.
                8.4.3 Data transfer
                       Each data transfer is triggered by a START condition and finished by a STOP condition
                       (see Figure 13 for timing information).
                       Data transfers can be performed in Standard mode at 100 kHz or Fast mode at 400 kHz.
                       Data transfer is performed on a byte for byte basis in both read or write modes. The
                       information is transmitted in bytes and each receiver acknowledges with a 9th bit
                       (acknowledge).
                       Each byte is followed by an acknowledge bit and the transmitter must release the SDA
                       line during the acknowledge bit. The master generates an extra acknowledge related
                       clock pulse. The addressed slave receiver must generate an acknowledge bit after
                       receiving each byte. The master-receiver must generate an acknowledge bit after
                       receiving each byte clocked out of the slave transmitter.
                       The acknowledging device must pull-down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock
                       pulse to ensure the SDA line is stable LOW during the acknowledge related clock pulse
                       HIGH period.

                                                                                                                   Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                      In addition, the set-up and hold times must be taken into account. The master-receiver
                      must signal the end of the last data byte to the slave transmitter by not sending an
                      acknowledge bit on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. The transmitter
                      must ensure the data line is HIGH to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.
                8.4.4 Device addressing
                      Three device addresses are needed to control the TDA8026.
                        • One high address: The high address enables selection of a bank page (Bank 0 or
                           Bank 1) based on a configuration byte. A bank page relates to a card slot or general
                           registers. See Table 7 for detailed information.
                        • Two low addresses: The microcontroller uses two low addresses to read and write
                           into the selected bank page (see Table 6 on page 15 to Table 39 on page 38 for
                           detailed information).
                      The addresses for the device are shown in Table 5 and Table 6.

                       0            1                   0                      0                       1                A0            0                    R/W
                      Bit 1 is the address bit which selects Register0 or Register1. Bit 0 defines either Read or
                      Write mode.
                        • When bit 0 is set to logic 1, read mode is selected
                        • When bit 0 is set to logic 0, write mode is selected
                      Table 6.     Write mode addresses

                      Bank 1 page selection is performed when the configuration byte (CSb[7:0]) is written to
                      the high address representing bank 0 based on the A0 pin value.
                      Using pin A0, two TDA8026s can be used in parallel based on the selection made to the
                      address selection pin A0. Pin A0 is externally hardwired to the pins VDD(INTF) or GND. The
                      voltage on the A0 pin sets the bit 2 address bit

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                     TDA8026
                                                                                                                 Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                   8.5 Banks and registers
                       The device registers enable the microcontroller to control the TDA8026. These registers
                       are defined as banks:
                         • Bank 0 register is a read/write register which enables selection of the required card
                           slot number and access to the corresponding registers Bank 1 registers. In addition,
                           Bank 0 is used to write information about the interrupt status and the product version.
                           The registers in bank 0 (CSb[7:0] = 1h to 5h) are similar to the registers of the
                           TDA8023.
                         • Bank 1 provides access to the corresponding card slot registers. Bank 1 is composed
                           of several pages which in turn contain registers related to each individual card slot or
                           general registers. Typically, pages can contain two general registers or five card slot
                           related registers.
                       Remark: The registers are organized in bank pages in order to keep compatibility with the
                       TDA8023.
                       Bank 1 page selection is performed when the configuration byte (CSb[7:0]) is written to
                       the high I2C-bus address representing bank 0 based on the A0 pin.

                8.5.2 Bank 0 register description
                       The device registers enable the microcontroller to control the TDA8026. The registers are
                       organized in bank pages to ensure compatibility with the TDA8023.
                       Bank 0 write register enables selection of the card slot number and access to the
                       corresponding registers in bank 1. The card slot registers in bank 1 are accessed using
                       the configuration byte (CSb[7:0]). The range 01h to 05h is used to select the specific card
                       slot starting at card slot 1 (01h) and ending with card slot 5 (05h) in a similar way to the
                       TDA8023 registers.

                            slot is enabled.
                            Remark: If both pins I/OUC1 and I/OUC2 are connected at the same time, this mandatory condition also
                            applies to card slot 1.
                       [3]  In synchronous mode, this bit cannot be written when START bit is logic 1.

                 8.5.5 Selection of asynchronous or synchronous mode
                       When the activation sequence starts, the selected card slot on the TDA8026 uses the
                       RSTIN bit value to configure itself for use with asynchronous or synchronous cards. If the
                       RSTIN bit is set to logic 1 at the activation sequence start (the START bit changes from
                       LOW to HIGH), the TDA8026 will manage asynchronous cards.
                       In asynchronous mode, the card slot RST(n) pin is controlled by the corresponding ATR
                       counter (see Section 8.9 on page 36).
                       In synchronous mode, the card slot RST(n) pin is controlled by the corresponding RSTIN
                       bit. The card clock configuration is set by the PWDN bit value at the activation sequence
                       start of the selected card slot (the START bit changed from LOW to HIGH).

                      • If the PDWN bit is set to logic 0 at the start of the activation, the card clock value is the
                         CLKIN1 pin frequency for card slot 1 and the CLKIN2 pin frequency for card slots 2
                         to 5. If CLKDIV[1:0] = 00, the first four clock cycles are not transferred to CLK(n).
                         When CLKDIV[1:0] = 01, 10 or 11, the first five clock cycles are not transferred to
                         CLK(n).
                      • If the PDWN bit is set to logic 1 at the start of the activation, the clock uses the
                         CLKPD1 bit.
                   The card clock frequency and the stop state are configured using the CLKDIV[1:0] and
                   CLKPD[1:0] bits. Refer to Table 32 for the configuration in asynchronous mode and
                   Table 33 for synchronous mode.

                   [1]   If CLKDIV[1:0] = 00, the first four clock cycles are not transferred to CLK(n). When CLKDIV[1:0] is not 00,
                         the first five clock cycles are not transferred to CLK(n).
                   fclk(ext) is the clock input frequency on either pin CLKIN1 or pin CLKIN2 depending on the
                   card slot number.
                   During transitions, no pulse is shorter than 45 % of the smallest period and both the
                   first/last clock pulse around the change have the correct width; making the frequency
                   change synchronous.
                   When changing the card clock frequency from one fclk(ext) frequency division to another,
                   the modification is only active after the next rising clock edge.
                   Any change after switching the card clock frequency from an external fclk(ext) frequency
                   division to the internal oscillator frequency (fosc(int)) is not immediate. The change is
                   indicated by the state of the CLKSW bit (see the register descriptions in Table 11 and
                   Table 22). In addition, it is assumed that the fclk(ext) / x frequency division is less than or
                   equal to 6.25 MHz.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                       TDA8026
                                                                                                                   Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                   8.6 DC-to-DC converter
                       The DC-to-DC converter has been designed to provide an average of 5.4 V to the
                       programmable voltage regulators (5 V, 3 V and 1.8 V) for the card slots. It is capable of
                       delivering a total DC current of 116 mA to the card slots.
                       If the total current from all card slots exceeds 170 mA, the overcurrent/overload protection
                       deactivates the DC-to-DC converter. The addition of a 10 H external coil and Schottky
                       diode ensures the DC-to-DC converter operates at an input voltage range between 2.7 V
                       and 5.5 V.
                       When the DC-to-DC converter cannot act as a step-up converter, an overload alarm is
                       sent to the digital module and all card slot interfaces are deactivated. This causes the
                       IRQN line to be driven LOW and the Bank 1 Register 0 PROT bit is set to logic 1.
                       The DC-to-DC converter is deactivated when the TDA8026 is in shutdown mode.
                       The card slots can be directly supplied by the VDD supply voltage, if it is always above
                       5.25 V, thus removing the need to use the DC-to-DC converter. In this situation, the supply
                       voltage can be directly applied to the VUP and LX pins as shown in Figure 9.
                                                                      VDD(INTF)            VDD > 5.25 V
                                                                      VDD(INTF)                    VDD          LX    VUP

                         Fig 9.   The DC-to-DC converter
                       When DCDC_OFF is set to VDD(INTF), the DC-to-DC converter is shutdown:
                          • the output power transistors are switched OFF
                          • the DC-to-DC converter current consumption is 0 A.
                   8.7 VCC buffer
                       The current on the VCC buffer is internally limited to approximately 100 mA. When this limit
                       is reached, the automatic deactivation sequence is performed. Each card slot has its own
                       limitation and deactivation of one card slot does not affect the other card slots.
                       The VCC(n) voltage should be decoupled with two low ESR 100 nF (minimum) capacitors.
                       One capacitor should be placed close to the VCC pin of the device and the other close to
                       the C1 pin of the card connector. See Figure 14 for detailed information.
                   8.8 Sequencer and clock counter
                       Each card slot has a dedicated sequencer and clock counter.
                       The sequencer ensures that the activation and deactivation sequences meet the
                       ISO 7816 and EMV 4.3 standards, even during an emergency deactivation caused by
                       card removal during transaction, supply drop out or a hardware problem. The sequencer
                       is clocked with an internal oscillator (fosc(int)).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                      TDA8026
                                                                                                                  Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                      Card slot 1 or card slot 2 can only be activated if a card is detected as present in the slot
                      and if an alarm is not triggered by the voltage supervisor. When both of these parameters
                      are met, the card slots can be activated by setting the Command register START bit. The
                      activation sequence is described in Section 8.8.2.
                      Card slots 3 to 5 do not have presence monitoring. The corresponding STAP pin is used
                      for card presence detection on these slots.
                      The deactivation is initiated by the system controller or automatically in the case of a
                      hardware problem or a supply drop out. The deactivation sequence is described in
                      Section 8.8.3.
                      Outside a session, the card contacts are forced to low-impedance with respect to the
                      GNDC pin.
                8.8.1 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is the default state after a power-on reset. This mode ensures the power
                      consumption remains low until a card is inserted or the microcontroller starts a card
                      session. When there is not an ongoing card session, the internal oscillator runs at its low
                      frequency (t15).
                      A debouncing time of 17.8 ms is applied to card slot 1 and card slot 2 to allow for card
                      insertion (presence) detection.
                8.8.2 Activation sequence
                      When the card is inactive, pins VCC(n), CLK(n), RST(n) and I/O(n) are LOW which is
                      low-impedance with respect to pin GNDC(n) or pin GNDS depending of the card slot.
                      The sequencer is clocked by an internal oscillator. When everything is satisfactory
                      (voltage supply, card presence, no hardware problem), the system controller can trigger
                      the card present activation sequence by setting card slot’s START bit to logic 1:
                        •  The internal oscillator switches to its high frequency (t0, see Figure 10).
                        •  The DC-to-DC converter starts (t1).
                        •  VCC(n) starts to rise from 0 V to 1.8 V, 3 V or 5 V during the controlled rise time (t2).
                        •  The voltage on the I/O(n) pin rises to VCC(n), due to integrated 10 k pull-ups for
                           VCC(n) (t3).
                        • CLK(n) clock signal is sent to the card (t4 = tact) and the RST(n) pin is enabled. The
                           RST(n) pin is managed by the ATR counter or the Register1 RSTIN bit depending on
                           the card slot mode (asynchronous or synchronous).
                                                                      f osc  int 
                      The sequencer is clocked by ------------------ which leads to a time interval T = 25 s (typical).

                      In Figure 10 only one card slot is activated. If another card slot is active, the DC-to-DC
                      converter remains active.
                8.8.3 Deactivation sequence
                      When the session finishes, the microcontroller resets the START bit to logic 0 (Figure 11)
                      and the following deactivation sequence is performed:
                        •  Card reset: RST(n) pin falls to 0 V (t11).
                        •  Pin CLK(n) is stopped (t12).
                        •  Pin I/O(n) falls to 0 V (t13).
                        •  Pin VCC(n) falls to 0 V with a controlled slew rate (t14).
                        •  The DC-to-DC converter is stopped.
                        •  Pins CLK(n), RST(n), VCC(n) and I/O(n) are driven to 0 V with a low-impedance switch
                           attached to pin GNDS (t15).
                        • The internal oscillator switches to its low frequency (t15)
                                                                  T                                                     3T                      7T
                      Thus, t 11 = 0 , t 12 = t 11 + --- , t 13 = t 11 + T , t 14 = t 11 + ------ and t 15 = t 11 + ------ .
                                                                  2                                                      2                       2
                      The deactivation time tdeact is the time that VCC(n) needs to be driven below 0.4 V, counting
                      from the moment START bit is reset.

                       converter is still active.
                   8.9 Answer to reset counters
                       Each TDA8026 card slot has its own sequencer. The sequencer controls the activation
                       and deactivation sequences. In addition to these sequencers, there are two Answer To
                       Reset (ATR) counters:
                         • ATR dedicated to card slot 1
                         • ATR dedicated to the other slots
                       The operating mode (asynchronous or synchronous) has to be selected by the
                       microcontroller. The ATR counters are used in asynchronous mode to manage the RST(n)
                       pin and to check the card’s ATR. In synchronous mode, the RST pin is controlled by the
                       microcontroller using the RSTIN bit (see the bit description in Table 11 on page 20 and
                       Table 22 on page 25) and the card’s ATR is not checked.
                       The ATR counter module comprises two counters:
                         • EARLY answer counter: The early answer counter consists of a fixed part which
                            counts up to 200 clock cycles. The secondary part counts up to the D[7:0] bits value of
                            clock cycles (see the register descriptions in Table 16 on page 24 and Table 27 on
                            page 28). The default D[7:0] bits value is 170 which gives a total default count of
                            370 clock cycles
                         • MUTE counter: The mute counter counts up to C[15:8] and C[7:0] bits value for the
                            clock cycles (see the register descriptions in Table 22 on page 25 and Table 30 on
                            page 29). The default value of the C[15:0] bits is 42100 which gives a default count of
                            42100 clock cycles.
                            Both counters can be easily quickly reprogrammed, if for example, a card does not
                            fully meet the EMVCo/ISO7816 standards or to enable the implementation of new and
                            enhanced standards.

                                                                                                                      Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                       When operating, the microcontroller starts to configure the selected card slot (card supply
                       voltage) and then triggers the activation sequence using the START bit. The sequencer
                       then performs the activation sequence. The DC-to-DC converter is started, pin VCC(n) is
                       set to the previously configured card supply voltage, pin I/O(n) is enabled and CLK(n) starts
                       (see Section 8.8.2 on page 34 and Section 8.8.3 on page 35). Pin RST(n) is set to LOW.
                       The ATR counter dedicated to the card slot makes the following checks and takes the
                       steps required:
                         • START bits from a card detected on pin I/O(n) during the first 200 clock cycles are
                            ignored and the count continues.
                         • START bits from a card detected while pin RST(n) is set to LOW, with the number of
                            clock cycles between 200 and the C[15:0] bits value (default 42100), cause the
                            EARLY and MUTE bits to be set to logic 1. Pin RST(n) remains LOW and the
                            microcontroller decides if it will accept the card.
                         • START bits detected after the number of clock cycles is equal to the C[15:0] bits value
                            cause pin RST(n) to be set to HIGH.
                         • START bits received from the card when the first number of clock cycles is equal to
                            the D[7:0] bits value (default 370) and pin RST(n) set to HIGH cause the EARLY bit to
                            be set to logic 1.
                         • Cards not answering before 42100 clock cycles (or the C[15:0] bits value) with RST(n)
                            set to HIGH cause the MUTE bit to be set to logic 1.
                         • Cards answering within the correct time frame, stops the clock cycles count and the
                            microcontroller can send commands to the card.
                       Figure 12 shows the timings checked by the ATR counters.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                          TDA8026
                                                                                                                   Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                     The sequence described in Section 8.9 relates to a cold reset. If the card is mute (has not
                     answered), the microcontroller can start a warm reset by setting WARM bit to logic 1 (see
                     the bit descriptions in Table 11 on page 20 and Table 22 on page 25). Then, the ATR
                     counter set pin RST(n) to LOW and performs the same timing checks (see Figure 12).
                     Remark: It is assumed that two card activations will not take place simultaneously on card
                     slots 2 to 5 because only one I/O(n) line is available for these four slots. There is no
                     protection on the second ATR counter against starting an activation while a count is
                     ongoing. The first ATR counter is dedicated to the slot 1. Consequently, it is mandatory to
                     enable only one slot I/O(n) line at the same time for card slots 2 to 5. When switching from
                     one slot to another one, it is mandatory to first disable the slot I/O(n) line in use before
                     enabling the slot I/O(n) line required. During this transition, no I/O(n) lines are enabled for
                     card slots 2 to 5. This allows the ATR counter to be reset between card slot switching
                     actions. If both pins I/OUC1 and I/OUC2 are connected at the same time, this mandatory
                     condition also applies to card slot 1.
                8.10 Slew rate control
                     Slew rate control is embedded for the clock buffer and the I/O(n) line of each card slot. The
                     rising and falling edge of the card clock signal can be configured using 2 bits in Register6
                     of bank 1. The settings based on a 30 pF load capacitance and a VCC(n) = 5 V are shown
                     in Table 38.

                     the signal amplitude. The default setting for CLK_SR[1]/CLK_SR[3] (high) is LOW and
                     CLK_SR[0]/CLK_SR[2] (low) is HIGH.
                     Only the falling edge of the card I/O(n) signal can be configured with the two
                     programmable bits in Register6 of bank 1. The settings based on a 30 pF load
                     capacitance and a VCC(n) = 5 V are shown in Table 39 on page 38:

                                                                                                                 Multiple smart card slot interface IC
                      The fall time is calculated from 90 % to 10 % of the signal amplitude. The default setting
                      for IO_SR[0]/IO_SR[2] (low) and IO_SR[1]/IO_SR[3] (high) is LOW (see table Table 39 on
                      page 38).
                 8.11 Fault detection
                      The following fault conditions are monitored by the TDA8026.
                        • Overheating: All the card slots are automatically deactivated and the device is forced
                           in to Standby mode when the detected temperature range is between
                           125 C to 209 C. The card slot PROT bit is set to logic 1. Above 209 C the device is
                           shutdown.
                        • Card removal during transaction: A deactivation sequence is performed in
                           accordance with the EMV 4.2 standard.
                        • DC-to-DC converter overload: All card slots are automatically deactivated and the
                           device is placed in Standby mode when the current supplied by the DC-to-DC
                           converter exceeds 170 mA (ICC parameter for VCC(n)). The card slot PROT bit is set to
                           logic 1
                        • Card slot current limitation and deactivation: A current level drawn by a card
                           which exceeds 120 mA (Isd parameter for VCC(n)) triggers the deactivation sequence
                           on the faulty card slot. During the deactivation, the current is limited to approximately
                           110 mA. The card slot PROT bit is set to logic 1
                        • VDD or VDD(INTF) dropping: A voltage drop occurring on VDD or VDD(iNTF) generates
                           card slot deactivation followed by a device reset. The completion of this phase is
                           validated when the SUPL bits are set to logic 1.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 16) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 49 and 50

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 16.
