Product parametric performance is indicated in the Electrical Characteristics for the listed test conditions, unless otherwise noted. Product
performance may not be indicated by the Electrical Characteristics if operated under different conditions.
6. Performance guaranteed over the indicated operating temperature range by design and/or characterization tested at TJ = TA = 25°C.
     Low duty cycle pulse techniques are used during testing to maintain the junction temperature as close to ambient as possible.
7. Values based on design and characterization, not tested in production.
8. Guaranteed for ±300 mV and ±150 mV level of uBus.
9. Tested on a receiving bus driver. Sending bus driver has a ground offset voltage in the range of [−12.5 V to +12.5 V] and sends a 50/50
     pattern.
10. Bus driver is connected to GND and uVCC = 5 V and uVBAT ≥ 7 V.
11. The minimum value is only guaranteed, when the phase that is interrupted was continuously present for at least 870 ns.
12. uVDIG = uVIO. No undervoltage on VIO and either VCC or VBAT supplied.
13. Simulation results. Simulation performed within TJ_OP range, according to FlexRay Electrical Physical Layer Specification, Version 3.0.1.

Internal Flags
  The NCV7381B control logic uses a number of internal flags (i.e. one−bit memories) reflecting important conditions or
events. Table 1 summarizes the individual flags and the conditions that lead to a set or reset of the flags.
