NCN8025 / NCN8025A
Compact SMART CARD
Interface IC
  The NCN8025 / NCN8025A is a compact and cost−effective single
smart card interface IC. It is dedicated for 1.8 V / 3.0 V / 5.0 V smart
card reader/writer applications. The card VCC supply is provided by a
built−in very low drop out and low noise LDO.                                                    www.onsemi.com
