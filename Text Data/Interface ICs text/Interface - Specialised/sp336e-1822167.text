GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                        FEATURES
The SP336E is a monolithic serial multi-transceiver         3.3V or 5V Single Supply Operation
device that contains both RS-232 and RS-485/RS-             Robust ±15kV ESD Protection (IEC 61000-4-2 Air
422 line drivers and receivers. The configuration of         Gap)
the SP336E can be reconfigured into eight operating
modes including RS-232 only (4TX/4RX), RS-485/              Software Selectable Mode Selection

signal translator. The MaxLinear charge pumps               Mixed RS-232/RS-485 modes
deliver true RS-232 driver output voltages from a           Pin Programmable Slew Rate for Reduced EMI
single power supply at either 3.3V or 5V. The SP336E
requires only four 0.1F capacitors for charge pump.        RS-485 Advanced Failsafe on Open, Short or
A slew rate control pin configures driver outputs for        Terminated Lines
either high data rate or slew-controlled data rates.        Diagnostic Loop-Back Function
Slew-controlled outputs minimize problems with

CAUTION:
ESD (Electrostatic Discharge) sensitive device. Permanent damage may occur on unconnected devices subject to high energy electrostatic fields. Unused
devices must be stored in conductive foam or shunts. Personnel should be properly grounded prior to handling this device. The protective foam should be
discharged to the destination socket before devices are removed.

 1.0 FUNCTION TABLES
The SP336E drivers and receivers may be configured to operate as either standard RS-485/RS-422 or RS-232
devices. RS-485/RS422 drivers have differential outputs and receivers have differential inputs. RS-232 drivers
and receivers are single-ended with inverting outputs.

 2.0 SUGGESTED APPLICATION DIAGRAMS
The SP336E supports all signals used in RS-232 over an 8 pin modular jack (RJ-45) as defined in TIA/EIA-
561. For DTE serial port only three drivers are required. Driver_1 is not used in this configuration and its driver
input should be tied to high or low.
SP336E may also be used to implement a standard serial port over a DB-9 connector (TIA/EIA-574 or the
standard IBM serial port). In that case either DSR or RI signal can be supported. Both DSR and RI are used
mainly for dial-up connections and are typically not needed on dedicated lines. If both signals are required, add
a discrete transceiver such as SP3220E.
An alternative implementation would be to use the SP336E to emulate the functionality of two dual-channel
RS-232 transceivers (2 x SP232’s or equivalent).
Loop-Back
Changing from RS-232 mode (MODE 001) to loop-back mode (MODE 000) duplicates the function of an
external loop-back plug. Loop-back can be used to test serial port functionality or to diagnose faults.

RS-232 to RS-485 Translator
SP336E can be used to implement a single-chip RS-232 to RS-485 translator function. Both full-duplex (4-wire
RS-485) and half-duplex (2-wire RS-485) configurations are shown. RS-485 is capable of communicating on
data cables up to 4000 feet (1200 meter) which makes it an ideal interface for extending the reach of short-
range serial ports like RS-232. The configurations shown can be used to connect directly to existing PC type
RS-232 serial ports to enable extended-reach communication.
The RTS signal (circuit CA or 105) is used as a transmit direction control signal for half-duplex. The ON
condition puts the repeater into transmit mode and inhibits receive. On a half-duplex channel RxD should be
held in MARK state (binary 1) when receiver 3 is inactive. Driver 1 on the SP336E can be used to generate
DSR or CTS signal to indicate to the host terminal that the translator is powered-on and ready.
Shutdown Modes
SP336E features two shutdown modes. In mode 111 (full shutdown) all drivers and receivers are at high
impedance. In mode 110, all drivers are tri-state but all four receivers remain active. In modes 101 and 100 two
differential receivers can be kept active while the differential drivers are tri-stated using the Tx_EN inputs.

Bus Repeater
Mode 101 can be used as a bus-repeater to extend the reach of an RS-422 bus. This configuration is best
suited for point-to-point or multi-drop communications because the drivers are always active and echoing data
from their corresponding receiver.
For applications where multiple nodes are allowed to transmit, some type of bus arbitration should be used.
One technique would be to use SP336E in conjunction with external decoder logic, packet buffers and node
address fields embedded in the data stream. Receiving the correct node address triggers Tx_EN to pass data
onward.
Mode 100 could implement a repeater / gateway to partition or extend RS-485 networks. Direction Control
determines when data is forwarded to or from segments A and B.
