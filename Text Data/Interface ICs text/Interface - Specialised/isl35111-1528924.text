     VDD              1, 9, 12       Power supply. 1.2V supply voltage. The use of parallel 100pF and 47nF decoupling capacitors to ground is
                                     recommended for each of these pins for broad high-frequency noise suppression.
    IN[P,N]             2, 3         Driver differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least 6GHz frequency response
                                     is recommended.
    TDSBL                  4         Transmit Disable pin. Disables the IC and enters a low power mode when pulled HIGH. Must be externally pulled LOW
                                     for normal operation.
     GND            5, 8, 13, 16     These pins must be grounded.
   DE[A,B]              6, 7         Control pins for setting de-emphasis. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 2-digit number to set the de-emphasis
                                     level. A is the MSB, and B is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled up and down through 23k resistors.
   OUT[N,P]           10, 11         Driver differential output, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least 6GHz frequency
                                     response is recommended.
     LOS                   14        LOS indicator. High output when Input signal is below DT threshold.
      DT                   15        Detection Threshold. Reference DC voltage threshold for input signal power detection. Data output OUT[P,N] is muted
                                     when the power of the input signal IN[P,N] falls below the threshold. Tie to ground to disable electrical idle
                                     preservation and always enable the output driver.
 Exposed Pad               -         Exposed pad. For proper electrical and thermal performance, this pad should be connected to the PCB ground plane.

12. Compliance to limits is assured by characterization and design.
Typical Performance Characteristics
Performance is measured using the test setup illustrated in Figure 2. The signal from the pattern generator is launched into the chip
evaluation board. The ISL35111 output signal is then visualized on a scope to determine signal integrity parameters such as jitter.
