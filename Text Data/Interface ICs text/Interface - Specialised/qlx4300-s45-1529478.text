                           amplifier.
  IN1[P,N]       2, 3      Equalizer 1 differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least

    VDD      4, 7, 10, 29, Power supply. 1.2V supply voltage. The use of parallel 100pF and 10nF decoupling capacitors to
                32, 35     ground is recommended for each of these pins for broad high-frequency noise suppression.
  IN2[P,N]       5, 6      Equalizer 2 differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least

                           input impedance of In1P and In1N each go above 200k and powers down the channel. This pin
                           should be connected to the Fundamental Reset signal in PCI Express™. Otherwise, connect to
                           VDD to hold the input impedance at 50.
    IS2           14       Impedance Select 2. CMOS logic input. When the voltage on this pin is LOW, the single-ended
                           input impedance of In2P and In2N each go above 200k and powers down the channel. This pin
                           should be connected to the Fundamental Reset signal in PCI Express™. Otherwise, connect to

                           by 21 clock cycles.
 CP3[A,B,C]   18, 19, 20   Control pins for setting equalizer 3. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set
                           the boost level. A is the MSB, and C is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled down through a 25k
                           resistor.
 CP4[A,B,C]   21, 22, 23   Control pins for setting equalizer 4. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set
                           the boost level. A is the MSB, and C is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled down through a 25k
                           resistor.

                           through pins DI, ENB, and Clk when set HIGH. Resets all internal registers to zero and uses boost
                           levels set by CP pins when set LOW. If serial programming is not used, this pin should be
                           grounded.
    IS4           25       Impedance Select 4. CMOS logic input. When the voltage on this pin is LOW, the single-ended
                           input impedance of In4P and In4N each go above 200k and powers down the channel. This pin

NOTES:
 3. After channel loss, differential amplitudes at QLx4300-S45 inputs must meet the input voltage range specified in “Absolute
     Maximum Ratings” on page 5.
 4. Temperature = +25°C, VDD = 1.2V.
 5. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted
     signal (as measured at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJPP + 14.1 x RJRMS.
 6. Measured using a PRBS 27-1 pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent,
     media-induced loss only.
 7. Rise and fall times measured using a 1GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.
 8. For active data mode, cable input amplitude is 400mVP-P (differential) or greater. For line silence mode, cable input amplitude
     is 20mVP-P (differential) or less.
 9. Measured differentially across the data source.

     QLx4300-S45 that are greater than 20mVP-P.
 11. The data pattern preceding line silence mode is comprised of the PCIe electrical idle ordered set (EIOS). The data pattern
     following line silence mode is comprised of the PCIe electrical idle exit sequence (EIES).
 12. The data pattern preceding or following line silence mode is comprised of the SAS-2 ALIGN (0) sequence for OOB signaling
     at 3.125Gb/s, and amplitude of 800mVP-P.

Typical Performance Characteristics
VDD = 1.2V, TA = +25°C, unless otherwise noted. Performance was characterized using the system testbed shown in
Figure 1. Unless otherwise noted, the transmitter generated a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) PRBS-7 sequence at 800mVP-P
(differential) with 10ps of peak-to-peak deterministic jitter. This transmit signal was launched into twin-axial cable test
channels of varying gauges and lengths. The loss characteristics of these test channels are plotted as a function of
frequency in Figure 2. The received signal at the output of these test channels was then processed by the QLx4300-S45
before being passed to a receiver. Eye diagram measurements were made with 4000 waveform acquisitions and include
random jitter.

Programming Multiple QLx4300-S45
Devices
The serial bus interface provides a simple means of
setting the equalizer boost levels with a minimal amount
of board circuitry. Many of the serial interface signals can
be shared among the QLx4300-S45 devices on a board
and two options are presented in this section. The first
uses common clock and serial data signals along with
separate ENB signals to select which QLx4300-S45
accepts the programmed changes. The second method

Detection Thereshold (DT) Pin Functionality
The QLx4300-S45 is capable of maintaining periods of
line silence on any of its four channels by monitoring
each channel for loss of signal (LOS) conditions and
subsequently muting the outputs of a respective channel
when such a condition is detected. A reference current
applied to the detection threshold (DT) pin is used to set
the LOS threshold of the internal signal detection
circuitry. Current control on the DT pin is done via one or
two external resistors. Nominally, both a pull-up and
pull-down resistor are tied to the DT pin (Figure 27A),
                                                                               FIGURE 27A.
but if adequate control of the supply voltage is
maintained to within ±3% of 1.2V, then a simple pull
down resistor is adequate (as in Figure 27B). Resistors
used should be at least 1/16W, with ±1% precision.
The internal bias point of the DT pin, nominally 1.05V, is
used in conjunction with the voltage divider (R1 and R2)
shown in Figure 27A to set the reference current on the
DT pin.
Case 1: Channels with less than or equal to 17dB loss at
1.5625GHz:
   For signals transmitted on channels having less than
   or equal to 25dB of loss at 2.5GHz, the optimal DT                          FIGURE 27B.
   reference current is 0µA. This optimal reference
   current may be achieved by either leaving the DT pin
   floating, or tying the DT pin to ground (GND) with a
   10M resistor.
Case 2: Channels with greater 17dB loss at 1.5625GHz:
   For channels exhibiting more than 25dB of total loss
   (this includes cable or FR-4 loss) the DT pin should
   be configured for a reference sink current (coming
   out of the DT pin) of approximately 2µA. A typical
   configuration for a 2µA sink current is given in
   Figure 27C. If the configuration in Figure 27B is
   utilized, a 525k resistor is used.
                                                                               FIGURE 27C.

QLx4300-S45
Typical Application Reference Designs (Continued)
Figures 28 and 29 show reference design schematics for a QLx4300-S45 evaluation board with an SMA connector
interface. Figure 28 shows the schematic for the case when the equalizer boost level is set via the CP pins. Figure 29
shows the schematic for the case when the level is set via the serial bus interface.

QLx4300-S45
About Q:ACTIVE®
Intersil has long realized that to enable the complex
server clusters of next generation datacenters, it is
critical to manage the signal integrity issues of electrical
interconnects. To address this, Intersil has developed its
groundbreaking Q:ACTIVE® product line. By integrating
its analog ICs inside cabling interconnects, Intersil is able
to achieve unsurpassed improvements in reach, power
consumption, latency, and cable gauge size as well as
increased airflow in tomorrow’s datacenters. This new
technology transforms passive cabling into intelligent
“roadways” that yield lower operating expenses and
capital expenditures for the expanding datacenter.
Intersil Lane Extenders allow greater reach over existing
cabling while reducing the need for thicker cables. This
significantly reduces cable weight and clutter, increases
airflow, and reduces power consumption.
