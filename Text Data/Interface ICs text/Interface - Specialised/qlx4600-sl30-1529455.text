   PIN NAME    PIN NUMBER                                                       DESCRIPTION
        DI          16     Serial data input, CMOS logic. Input for serial data stream to program internal registers controlling the boost for all
                           four equalizers. Synchronized with clock (CLK) on pin 46. Overrides the boost setting established on CP control pins.
                           Internally pulled down.
       DO           17     Serial data output, CMOS logic. Output of the internal registers controlling the boost for all four equalizers.
                           Synchronized with clock on pin 46. Equivalent to serial data input on DI but delayed by 21 clock cycles.
  CP3[A, B, C]  18, 19, 20 Control pins for setting equalizer 3. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set the boost level. A
                           is the MSB, and C is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled down through a 25kΩ resistor.
  CP4[A, B, C]  21, 22, 23 Control pins for setting equalizer 4. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 3-digit number to set the boost level. A
                           is the MSB, and C is the LSB. Pins are internally pulled down through a 25kΩ resistor.
     MODE           24     Boost-level control mode input, CMOS logic. Allows serial programming of internal registers through pins DI, ENB,
                           and CLK when set HIGH. Resets all internal registers to zero and uses boost levels set by CP pins when set LOW. If
                           serial programming is not used, this pin should be grounded.
      LOS4          25     LOS indicator 4. High output when equalized IN4 signal is below DT threshold.
      LOS3          26     LOS indicator 3. High output when equalized IN3 signal is below DT threshold.

NOTES:
  7. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design
  8. After channel loss, differential amplitudes at QLx4600-SL30 inputs must meet the input voltage range specified in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on
     page 5.
  9. Temperature = +25°C, VDD = 1.2V.
10. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted signal (as measured
     at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJP-P + 14.1 x RJRMS.
11. Measured using a PRBS 27-1 pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent, media-induced loss only.
12. Rise and fall times measured using a 1GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.
13. For active data mode, cable input amplitude is 400mVP-P (differential) or greater. For line silence mode, cable input amplitude is 20mVP-P
     (differential) or less.
14. Measured differentially across the data source.
15. During line silence, transmitter noise in excess of this voltage range may result in differential output amplitudes from the QLx4600 that are greater
     than 20mVP-P.
16. The data pattern preceding line silence mode is comprised of the PCIe electrical idle ordered set (EIOS). The data pattern following line silence mode
     is comprised of the PCIe electrical idle exit sequence (EIES).
17. The data pattern preceding or following line silence mode is comprised of the SAS-2 ALIGN (0) sequence for OOB signaling at 3Gb/s, and amplitude
     of 800mVP-P.

QLx4600-SL30
Typical Performance Characteristics
VDD = 1.2V, TA = +25°C, unless otherwise noted. Performance was characterized using the system testbed shown in Figure 2. Unless otherwise noted,
the transmitter generated a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) PRBS-7 sequence at 800mVP-P (differential) with 10ps of peak-to-peak deterministic jitter. This
transmit signal was launched into twin-axial cable test channels of varying gauges and lengths. The loss characteristics of these test channels are plotted
as a function of frequency in Figure 3. The received signal at the output of these test channels was then processed by the QLx4600-SL30 before being
passed to a receiver. Eye diagram measurements were made with 4000 waveform acquisitions and include random jitter.

high-speed interconnects. A functional diagram of one of the four
channels in the QLx4600-SL30 is shown in Figure 23. In addition
to a robust equalization filter to compensate for channel loss and
restore signal fidelity, the QLx4600-SL30 contains unique
integrated features to preserve special signaling protocols
typically broken by other equalizers. The signal detect function is
used to mute the channel output when the equalized signal falls
below the level determined by the Detection Threshold (DT) pin
voltage. This function is intended to preserve periods of line
silence (“quiescent state” in InfiniBand contexts). Furthermore,
the output of the signal detect/DT comparator is used as a Loss
of Signal (LOS) indicator to indicate the absence of a received
signal.
As illustrated in Figure 23, the core of each high-speed signal
path in the QLx4600-SL30 is a sophisticated equalizer followed
by a limiting amplifier. The equalizer compensates for skin loss,
dielectric loss and impedance discontinuities in the transmission
                                                                          FIGURE 24. EQUALIZER TRANSFER FUNCTIONS FOR SETTINGS 0, 5,

can be set to one of 32 levels of compensation when the serial
bus is used to program the boost level and one of 18
compensation levels when the CP[k] pins are used to set the
level. The equalizer transfer functions for a subset of these
compensation levels are plotted in Figure 24. The flexibility of
this adjustable compensation architecture enables signal fidelity
to be optimized on a channel-by-channel basis, providing support
for a wide variety of channel characteristics and data rates
ranging from 2.5Gb/s to 6.25Gb/s. Because the boost level is
externally set rather than internally adapted, the QLx4600-SL30
provides reliable communication from the very first bit
transmitted. There is no time needed for adaptation and control
loop convergence. Furthermore, there are no pathological data
patterns that will cause the QLx4600-SL30 to move to an
incorrect boost level.

Optimal Cable Boost Settings
The settable equalizing filter within the QLx4600 enables the
device to optimally compensate for frequency-dependent
attenuation across a wide variety of channels, data rates and
encoding schemes. For the reference channels plotted in
Figure 3, Table 4 shows the optimal boost setting when
transmitting a PRBS-7 signal. The optimal boost setting is
defined as the equalizing filter setting that minimizes the output
residual jitter of the QLx4600. The settings in Table 4 represent
the optimal settings for the QLx4600C across an ambient
temperature range of 0°C to +70°C. The optimal setting at room
temperature (+20°C to +40°C) is generally one to two settings
lower than the values listed in Table 4.

Detection Threshold (DT) Pin Functionality
                                                                                        1.2V
The QLx4600-SL30 is capable of maintaining periods of line
silence on any of its four channels by monitoring each channel                              R1
for loss of signal (LOS) conditions and subsequently muting the
                                                                                                       DT
outputs of a respective channel when such a condition is
detected. A reference current applied to the detection threshold             47nF           R2
(DT) pin is used to set the LOS threshold of the internal signal
detection circuitry. Current control on the DT pin is done via one
or two external resistors. Nominally, both a pull-up and pull-down
resistor are tied to the DT pin (Figure 33A), but if adequate                     GND GND
control of the supply voltage is maintained to within ±3% of 1.2V,                    FIGURE 33A.
then a simple pull-down resistor is adequate (as in Figure 33B).
Resistors used should be at least 1/16W, with ±1% precision.
The internal bias point of the DT pin, nominally 1.05V, is used in
conjunction with the voltage divider (R1 and R2) shown in                                          DT
Figure 33A to set the reference current on the DT pin.
Case 1: Channels with less than or equal to 25dB loss at 2.5GHz
                                                                                    R2
(1Gb/s to 6Gb/s):
    For signals transmitted on channels having less than or equal
    to 25dB of loss at 2.5GHz, the optimal DT reference current is
    0µA. This optimal reference current may be achieved by                       GND
    either leaving the DT pin floating, or tying the DT pin to ground
    (GND) with a 10MΩ resistor                                                        FIGURE 33B.
Case 2: Channels with greater 25dB loss at 2.5GHz (1Gb/s to
6Gb/s):
                                                                                        1.2V
    For channels exhibiting more than 25dB of total loss (this
    includes cable or FR-4 loss) the DT pin should be configured
    for a reference sink current (coming out of the DT pin) of
                                                                                                       DT
    approximately 2µA. A typical configuration for a 2µA sink
    current is given in Figure 33C. If the configuration in                  47nF           100k
    Figure 33B is utilized, a 525kΩ resistor would be used.

About Q:ACTIVE™
Intersil has long realized that to enable the complex server
clusters of next generation datacenters, it is critical to manage
the signal integrity issues of electrical interconnects. To address
this, Intersil has developed its groundbreaking Q:ACTIVE™
product line. By integrating its analog ICs inside cabling
interconnects, Intersil is able to achieve unsurpassed
improvements in reach, power consumption, latency and cable
gauge size as well as increased airflow in tomorrow’s
datacenters. This new technology transforms passive cabling into
intelligent “roadways” that yield lower operating expenses and
capital expenditures for the expanding datacenter.
Intersil Lane Extenders allow greater reach over existing cabling,
while reducing the need for thicker cables. This significantly
reduces cable weight and clutter, increases airflow and reduces
power consumption.
