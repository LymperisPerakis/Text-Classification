         Description                                                      Features
         The LX7730 is a spacecraft telemetry manager IC that
                                                                             ▪  64 channel MUX
         functions as a companion to the FPGA. The LX7730
         contains a 64 universal inputs multiplexer that can be              ▪  Break-before-make switching
         configured as a mix of differential or single ended sensor          ▪  13kSPS 12-bit ADC
         inputs. There is a programmable current source that can             ▪  3% Precision Adjustable Current Source
         be directed to any of the 64 universal inputs. The                  ▪  1% Precision 5.00V Source
         universal inputs can be sampled with a 12-bit analog-to-            ▪  Threshold Monitoring
         digital converter at a sample rate up to 13kHz. The
                                                                             ▪  8 x Bi-level Logic
         universal inputs can also function as variable bi-level
         inputs with the threshold set by an internal 8 bit digital-to-
                                                                             ▪  10-bit DAC
         analog converter. There is an additional 10-bit digital-to-         ▪  Parallel or Dual SPI Interface
         analog current DAC with complementary outputs.                      ▪  Radiation Tolerant: 100krad TID, 50kad ELDRS
         Finally, there are 8 fixed threshold bi-level inputs.
         The LX7730 is register programmable with 17                      Applications
         addressable 8-bit registers. Two options are available for          ▪ Spacecraft Health Monitoring
         communication with the host FPGA. First there is an 8-
                                                                             ▪ Attitude Control
         bit parallel bus with 5 address bits and a read/write bit
                                                                             ▪ Payload Equipment
         that can communicate at a speed of up to 25MHz. The
         second option is a pair of 12.5Mbps SPI interfaces that
         can support redundant (alternating not simultaneous)
         communication to two different hosts.
                                                                                                                                  VREF

                                            and VCC. Connect a 0.47µF capacitor between this pin and the NCP pin.
                                            Charge Pump Transfer Capacitor Negative Terminal – Power Pin – This pin
                 123              NCP       is used for the charge pump used to generate VEE; it swings between GND
                                            and VEE. Connect a 0.47µF capacitor between this pin and the PCP pin.
                                            Negative power rail – Power I/O – This pin is the negative voltage power rail.
                                            It can be generated internally (using the charge pump) or supplied from an
                 124              VEE
                                            external source connected to this pin. Use a bypass capacitor to GND. The
                                            charge pump can be disabled by shorting the /EXT_VEE pin to GND.

                 125            MINUS2V     voltage power rail. It is generated internally using a linear regulator
                                            connected to the VEE rail. A bypass capacitor to GND is required.
                                            Enable external VEE – Programming pin – This pin disables the VEE charge
                 126           /EXT_VEE     pump if it is shorted to ground. If high, the VEE charge pump is enabled.
                                            There is a weak pull-up on this pin.
                                            Enable External Reference – Programming pin – This pin disables the
                 127           /EXT_REF     internal voltage reference when it is shorted to ground. If high, the internally
                                            generated voltage reference is used. There is a weak pull-up on this pin.

                            One time trimming circuits will set the default for all trimming bits. Using the OTP_in_select bit the
                            defaults can be read by the SPI or parallel bus. Writing to the trimming registers along with the
                            OTP_out_select bit allows the defaults to be modified; when OTP_out_select is de-asserted, the
                            trim values revert back to the default state.

         64 Analog Input RAD Tolerant Telemetry Controller
         Theory of Operation
         Analog Multiplexer
                          The analog multiplexer (AMUX) consists of 64 inputs. There are two outputs which are the non-
                          inverting and inverting inputs of the following instrumentation amplifier stage. Since the ADC
                          processes only positive voltages, the input voltage at the non-inverting channel is expected to be
                          greater than or equal to the inverting channel. The AMUX is physically divided into eight banks of
                          eight inputs. Only one CH#, from one input bank can be selected at a time which means that
                          differential measurements must consist of two CH#s from two different input banks. For a single
                          ended input measurement, the common SE_RTN reference pin can be selected by asserting the
                          appropriate bit in the inverting terminal AMUX register. The EN_BL SW POS bit of register 12 must
                          be de-asserted to use the analog multiplexing registers (3 and 4). The address bits for the Analog
                          MUX (registers 3 and 4) are shown in the table below.

         Bi-Level Inputs with Adjustable Threshold
                          The 64 sensor inputs can also be used as bi-level detection inputs. The bi-level detection
                          comparators monitor one position, simultaneously, from each of the input banks; the position is
                          register selectable. The Bi-level MUX and the AMUX are not independent, the EN_BL SW POS bit
                          of register 12 must be asserted to use the Bi-Level MUX. The selected eight bi-level inputs are
                          compared to a common adjustable threshold that is developed using an 8 bit binary DAC. The
                          outputs for the group of 8 are available in a register that is continuously updated and can be polled
                          to monitor the status. The comparators are sampled during the clock cycle that the Bi-Level Status
                          is read.
         Differential Amplifier, Gain scaling, Anti-Aliasing Filter
                          The AMUX feeds directly into the inputs of an instrumentation amplifier with three selectable fixed
                          gain settings (x0.4, x2 and x10) selectable using register 7. The Instrumentation Amplifier has a
                          buffered output to drive the two pole anti-aliasing filter (AAF); the AAF poles can be set to 10kHz,
                          2kHz or 400Hz using register 7. The output of the AAF drives the ADC input. The output of the
                          entire gain and filter stage is accessible at the ADC_IN pin. The ADC has a dynamic range of 0 to
                          2V and can be driven directly from the ADC_IN pin if the AAF is turned off using register 7 (AAF off)
                          or register 8 (ADC_IN = HiZ).
                          The instrumentation amplifier on a gain setting of 0.4 has a relatively high slew rate; this requires a
                          wait state for the IA output to settle for large signal level changes.

        12 Bit ADC
                        The ADC uses a successive approximation register (SAR) design. The CLK input sequences the
                        ADC logic. The specified linearity and offset error of the ADC is a result of fitting a straight line to
                        the ADC response curve.
                        The ADC can be set to convert continuously or to convert on request using START CONVERT.
                        Whenever a conversion is in process the BUSY status bit is asserted. When the conversion is
                        complete the DATA READY bit is set.
                        If the continuous conversion is selected using the Auto Conv bit of register 8, the ADC values are
                        updated continuously whether or not the registers are read.

                        The ADC will start conversion at the rising edge of the CLK after the Start Conv bit is set. In parallel
                        mode the Start Conv bit is set by the falling edge of /WE and in SPI mode it is set by the rising
                        edge of /SS#.

         64 Analog Input RAD Tolerant Telemetry Controller
                          The ADC samples the input for 25 clocks, and converts the sampled value for 12 clocks. The Data
                          Ready bit is set after CLK 37. ADC Upper Byte, register 9, and ADC Lower Byte, register 10, are
                          available for read after CLK 38.
                          If the Auto Conv bit is set and the Auto Sample Rate is set to 000, the next conversion will start 2
                          clocks after CLK 38.
         10-bit Current DAC
                          The output of the DAC should be terminated in a resistor that is less than 1.5kΩ to insure the DAC
                          stays within its compliance range. A parallel 1nF or greater capacitor can also be used to help
                          reduce bit change glitches. The DAC has complementary outputs that are accomplished by
                          steering the current between the two outputs based on the DAC setting. At zero LSBs, the DAC_N
                          is full scale and DAC_P is off. The 10-bit Current DAC positive output, DAC_P should be open
                          circuited and the negative output DAC_N can be connected to GND if the Use_DAC bit is asserted.
                          (See current De-Mux description.)
         Current De-Mux
                          The current de-mux routes a programmable current to whichever of the 64 CH inputs is selected.
                          There are several modes of operation depending on the current amplitude required. The maximum
                          current is available when the Use_DAC bit is de-asserted and the Double_Weight bit is asserted;
                          this provides eight levels ranging from 500uA to 4mA. When both the Use_DAC and
                          Double_Weight bits are de-asserted there are eight possible levels from 250uA to 2mA. When
                          current source level is changed, the current source should be settled in its new position within
                          10us. If the Use_DAC bit is asserted, the 10bit DAC is used to set the de-mux current; each LSB
                          has a weight of 10uA. A maximum of 300uA is suggested (code 31) when operating in this mode.
                          The current de-mux can be shut off by asserting the Current Source Disable bit of register 1; the
                          current De-MUX defaults to the off state at power up and must be enabled.

         Fixed Bi-Level Inputs
                          There are eight fixed bi-level inputs with a 2.5V internal threshold setting common to all detectors.
                          There is also a register selectable external threshold pin BL_TH where a threshold voltage can be
                          programmed using a voltage divider to VREF that can be used in place of the internal reference.
                          These logic threshold detected outputs go directly to output pins so they can be monitored directly

                                                                                                                  Theory of Operation
                            by the FPGA without the delay of the digital interface. A low pass filter and threshold hysteresis
                            provides high frequency noise rejection.
         Power On Reset
                            In Manual reset mode, the FPGA logically drives the RESET pin directly. The RESET pin should
                            be asserted and released a few milliseconds after power is applied to place the registers in the
                            default state. In auto-reset mode, a capacitor should be connected from RESET to GND to provide
                            SEFI immunity and to program the reset time delay: the time delay from a valid VDD and internal
                            5V rail within the IC until the reset is released. The equation for this timing is:
                             DELAY  35000  CRESET
         FPGA Interface
                            There are two options provided for the FPGA interface; either a single parallel interface or two SPI
                            interfaces. Grounding either the SPI_A or SPI_B pin will select either of these interfaces; these
                            pins have a 1MΩ pull-up to VDD. Only one interface can be active at any one time, but it is
                            acceptable to switch between interfaces; this should only be done when the interface is idle or at
                            rest. The LX7730 executes a command as soon as it has been received with the exception of the
                            10-bit DAC. The DAC output is updated when the upper byte MSB register is written to.
                            The LX7730 performs a simple even parity check on the combination of the address, data and PTY
                            (parity) bits for parallel data and the combination of address, data, W/R and P (parity) for serial
                            data. The W/R bit is high for a register write and low for a register read. If a parity error is
                            discovered, the command will not execute and the /ACK pin is pulled high, see “Interface Timing”
                            for /ACK output timing. Both SPI and parallel data transfers have even parity. The PTY line
                            supports a parity bit for the parallel data transfers.

             Note: For “serial data write” /ACK output is valid after /SS rises. It will remain valid until the next time /SS is pulled low. For
             “parallel data write” the /ACK output is valid after the address, data, and PTY signals are stable. The /ACK output should be
             low while /CE is low for the data to be written to the registers

                           Register address 0 is used to perform a master reset which returns all internal registers to the
                           power on (default) state. During the applied reset state, test signals are routed to BLO5 to 8. The
                           mapping for this is: BLO5 = VCC UVLO, BLO6 = VEE UVLO, BLO7 = +5V UVLO, BLO8 = Power
                           On Enable. To perform the master reset, the bit code 01101010 must be written to register 0; then,
                           to restore normal operation a write to register 0 of another code (such as 00000000) is required.

                           The Function enable register provides the option to power down functions that are not used; the
                           default would be to have everything active. The idea is to conserve power but only to the extent it
                           can be done without affecting any of the functions that are still active.

                           Register address 8: Analog to Digital Converter Control
                           The ADC Converter Control register allows the FPGA to initiate a sampling or continuous sampling.
                           It also indicates the status of the ADC.
                                               Analog to Digital Converter Control Register
           Bit #       Name             Default    Description
            7                              0       This register is used to slow down the auto sample rate of the ADC. The auto
                   Auto Sample                     sample rate is set to multiples of the Sample Period (t SAMP). The register bits 7,
            6                              0
                        Rate                       6, 5 represent a binary value “N” with bit 7 representing the MSB. This 3-bit
            5                              0       binary value sets the ADC auto sample rate = 40+(2N-1) x 55 clocks.
                                                   If asserted, the ADC performs continuous conversions. ADC conversions are

                                                   stored until the next value is ready and then overwritten.
                                                   This bit is asserted by the LX7730 when the ADC finishes a conversion and
            3       Data Ready             0       stays asserted until Start Conv is asserted or the Auto Conv timer begins
                                                   another conversion.
            2           Busy               0       This bit is asserted by the LX7730 while the ADC is performing a conversion.
            1        Start Conv            0       If asserted, this bit starts a single conversion process of the ADC.
                                                   If de-asserted (and AAF off is also de-asserted), the AAF amplifier is fully
                                                   functional and the output of the AAF drives the ADC input with a low
            0    ADC_IN = HI_Z             0
                                                   impedance driver. When asserted, the AAF filter is off and the ADC can be
                                                   driven from ADC_IN.

         Built-In Test and Adjustment Features
                           The following test features allow for checking and adjusting the LX7730.
                           Amplifier and Filter Offset calibration: The combined amplifier offset voltage as measured at
                           ADC_IN can be varied from the factory trimmed value by using bits 3 to 0 of register 19 in
                           calibration mode. The resultant offset effect can be monitored using the ADC.
                            AMUX and testing: A functional continuity check is performed asserting the CONT CHECK
                           register; this routes the adjustable current source directly to the non-inverting pin of the IA. (See
                           figure #9) Current flows out of the AMUX to the selected CH# input pin. If the current encounters
                           an open circuit in the AMUX or at the CH# pin, the voltage at the IA non-inverting pin will clamp. If
                           the external sensor is properly attached, the voltage read by the ADC will include the impedance of
                           the sensor plus the impedance of the two AMUX switches encountered in the current path. In
                           CONT CHECK mode, selecting the same CH# for the inverting and non-inverting terminals also
                           allows the P-polarity MUX impedance to be measured.

                              Figure 9 · Non-Inverting AMUX Continuity Check Test Configuration
                          A functional continuity check of the Inverting terminal MUX is performed asserting the NP_TEST
                          register bit; this routes the adjustable current source directly to the inverting pin of the IA. (See
                          figure #10) Current flows out of the AMUX to the selected Inverting MUX CH# input pin. If the
                          current encounters an open circuit in the AMUX or at the CH# pin, the voltage at the IA inverting pin
                          will clamp. The Non-inverting terminal is connected to VREF_DIV for this test. If the external
                          sensor is properly attached, the voltage read by the ADC is the difference of VREF_DIV and the
                          product of the current source and the impedance of the sensor plus the impedance of the two
                          AMUX switches encountered in the current path. The impedance of the N_MUX can be calculated
                          once the other impedances are known using the CONT CHECK.

                          Power supply Monitoring: The power supply pins for the LX7730 can be monitored by selecting
                          special calibration registers: MON VCC, MON VEE, MON +5V, MON VREF. The voltages are
                          divided down by a factor of 6 for the 15V rails and a factor of 2 for the 5V and VREF pins. Because
                          VREF is also the reference for the ADC, VREF must be monitored relative to a known external
                          voltage such as VCC or an external voltage reference if using the ADC for monitoring.
                          Power Supply Adjusting: It is possible to adjust the VREF output using register 18 bits 4 to 0.
                          Adjustment of VREF will affect all functions that are referencing VREF including IREF.
