1. General description
              The TJA1081G is a FlexRay transceiver that is fully compliant with FlexRay electrical
              physical layer specification ISO 17458-4:2013 (see Ref. 1 and Ref. 2). It is intended for
              communication systems from 2.5 Mbit/s to 10 Mbit/s and provides an advanced interface
              between the protocol controller and the physical bus in a FlexRay network.
              The TJA1081G features enhanced low-power modes, optimized for ECUs that are
              permanently connected to the battery.
              The TJA1081G provides differential transmit capability to the network and differential
              receive capability to the FlexRay controller. It offers excellent EMC performance as well as
              effective ESD protection.
              The TJA1081G actively monitors system performance using dedicated error and status
              information (that any microcontroller can read), along with internal voltage and
              temperature monitoring.
              The TJA1081G supports mode control as used in the TJA1080A (see Ref. 3) and is fully
              functionally and pin compatible with the TJA1081B (see Ref. 4).

7. Functional description
                       The block diagram of the transceiver is shown in Figure 1.
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1081G supports the following operating modes:
                        ‚Ä¢ Normal (normal-power mode)
                        ‚Ä¢ Receive-only (normal-power mode)
                        ‚Ä¢ Standby (low-power mode)
                        ‚Ä¢ Go-to-sleep (low-power mode)
                        ‚Ä¢ Sleep (low-power mode)
                        ‚Ä¢ PowerOff
                7.1.1 Bus activity and idle detection
                       The following mechanisms for activity and idle detection are valid in normal power modes:
                        ‚Ä¢ If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than ÔÅºVi(dif)det(act)ÔÅº for
                          tdet(act)(bus), activity is detected on the bus lines. Pin RXEN is switched LOW, releasing
                          pin RXD:
                          ‚Äì if, after activity has been detected on the bus, the differential voltage on the bus
                              lines is lower than VIL(dif), pin RXD will go LOW
                          ‚Äì if, after activity has been detected on the bus, the differential voltage on the bus
                              lines is higher than VIH(dif), pin RXD will go HIGH
                        ‚Ä¢ If the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than ÔÅºVi(dif)det(act)ÔÅº for
                          tdet(idle)(bus), idle is detected on the bus lines. Pin RXEN is switched HIGH, blocking pin
                          RXD (which is switched HIGH or remains HIGH)

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                       TJA1081G
                                                                                                                 FlexRay node transceiver
                7.1.2 Signaling on pin ERRN
                      Pin ERRN provides either error information or wake-up information. The behavior of
                      ERRN is determined by the host (via pins STBN and EN) and not by the operating mode.
                      If STBN is LOW, pin ERRN is configured to signal a wake-up event. When STBN and EN
                      are both HIGH, pin ERRN is configured to provide an error alert. Signaling on pin ERRN is
                      described in Table 4.
                      If pin ERRN goes LOW in Standby mode or Sleep mode to signal a wake-up event, the
                      host can switch the TJA1081G to Receive only mode (STBN ÔÇÆ H) to determine if the
                      wake-up is local or remote. A LOW level on ERRN in Receive only mode (provided the
                      transition to Receive only mode was not triggered by EN going LOW in Normal mode)
                      indicates a remote wake-up was detected. A HIGH level on ERRN signals a local
                      wake-up.
                      If EN had been forced HIGH after an earlier wake-up event (to switch the TJA1081G to
                      Normal mode), ERRN will always indicate the error detection status (in both Normal and
                      Receive only modes).

                                                                                                                  FlexRay node transceiver
                7.1.5 Normal mode
                      In Normal mode, the transceiver is able to transmit and receive data via bus lines BP and
                      BM. The output of the normal receiver is connected directly to pin RXD.
                      Transmitter behavior in Normal mode, with no TXEN timeout (see Section 7.4.7) and the
                      temperature flag not set (TEMP HIGH = 0; see Table 11), is detailed in Table 10.
                      In this mode, pin INH is set HIGH.
                      Table 10.   Transmitter function table
                       BGE      TXEN       TXD             Transmitter
                       L        X          X               transmitter is disabled
                       X        H          X               transmitter is disabled
                       H        L          H               transmitter is enabled; the bus lines are actively driven; BP is driven
                                                           HIGH and BM is driven LOW
                       H        L          L               transmitter is enabled; the bus lines are actively driven; BP is driven
                                                           LOW and BM is driven HIGH
                      The first LOW level detected on pin TXD when pin BGE is HIGH and pin TXEN is LOW
                      activates the transmitter.
                7.1.6 Receive-only mode
                      In Receive-only mode, the transceiver can only receive data. The transmitter is disabled,
                      regardless of the voltage levels on pins BGE and TXEN.
                      In this mode, pin INH is set HIGH.
                7.1.7 Standby mode
                      Standby mode is a low-power mode featuring very low current consumption. In this mode,
                      the transceiver cannot transmit or receive data. The low-power receiver is activated to
                      monitor the bus for wake-up patterns.
                      A transition to Standby mode can be triggered by applying the appropriate levels on pins
                      EN and STBN (see Figure 4 and Table 6) or if an undervoltage is detected on pin VCC
                      (see Figure 4 and Section 7.1.9).
                      In this mode, pin INH is set HIGH.
                      If the wake flag is set, pins RXEN and RXD are driven LOW; otherwise pins RXEN and
                      RXD are set HIGH (see Section 7.2).
                7.1.8 Go-to-sleep mode
                      In this mode, the transceiver behaves as in Standby mode. If Go-to-sleep mode remains
                      active longer than the go-to-sleep hold time (th(gotosleep)) and the wake flag has been
                      cleared previously, the transceiver switches to Sleep mode regardless of the voltage on
                      pin EN.
                7.1.9 Sleep mode
                      Sleep mode is a low-power mode. The only difference between Sleep mode and Standby
                      mode is that pin INH is set floating in Sleep mode. A transition to Sleep mode is triggered
                      from all other modes when the UVVIO flag or the UVVBAT flag is set (see Table 8).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                          TJA1081G
                                                                                                                                    FlexRay node transceiver
                       When the wake flag is set and VIO is valid, the undervoltage flags are reset. The
                       transceiver switches from Sleep mode to the mode indicated by the levels on pins EN and
                       STBN (see Table 8).
                   7.2 Wake-up mechanism
                       From Sleep mode (pin INH floating), the transceiver enters Standby mode if the wake flag
                       is set. Consequently, pin INH is switched on (HIGH).
                       If an undervoltage is not detected on pins VIO, VCC or VBAT, the transceiver switches
                       immediately to the mode indicated by the levels on pins EN and STBN.
                       In Standby, Go-to-sleep and Sleep modes, pins RXD, RXEN and ERRN are driven LOW if
                       the wake flag is set.
                7.2.1 Remote wake-up
               7.2.1.1 Bus wake-up via wake-up pattern
                       A valid wake-up pattern on the bus triggers a remote wake-up. A valid remote wake-up
                       pattern consists of a DATA_0, DATA_1 or idle, DATA_0, DATA_1 or idle sequence. The
                       DATA_0 phases must last at least tdet(wake)DATA_0 and the DATA_1 or idle phases at least
                       tdet(wake)idle. The entire sequence must be completed within tdet(wake)tot.
                                                                                                              < tdet(wake)tot

               7.2.1.2 Bus wake-up via dedicated FlexRay data frame
                       If the TJA1081G receives a dedicated data frame that emulates a valid wake-up pattern
                       as detailed Figure 6, the remote wake-up source flag is set.
                       Due to the Byte Start Sequence (BSS) preceding each byte, the DATA_0 and DATA_1
                       phases for the wake-up symbol are interrupted every 1 ÔÅ≠s. For 10 Mbit/s, the maximum
                       interruption time is 130 ns. Such interruptions do not prevent the transceiver from
                       recognizing the wake-up pattern in the payload of a data frame.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                          TJA1081G
                                                                                                                    FlexRay node transceiver
                   7.3 Fail-silent behavior
                       To ensure fail-silent behavior, a reset mechanism for the digital state machine has been
                       implemented along with undervoltage detection.
                       If an undervoltage is detected on pins VCC, VIO and/or VBAT, the transceiver switches to a
                       low-power mode. This action ensures that the transmitter and receiver are passive when
                       an undervoltage is detected and that their behavior is defined.
                       The digital state machine is supplied by VCC, VIO or VBAT. Therefore, the digital state
                       machine is properly supplied as long as the voltage on pin VCC, VIO or VBAT remains
                       above 4.5 V.
                       If the voltage on all pins (i.e. VCC, VIO and VBAT) breaks down, a reset signal is transmitted
                       to the digital state machine. The reset signal is transmitted as soon as the internal supply
                       voltage to the digital state machine is no longer high enough to guarantee proper
                       operation. This precaution ensures that the digital state machine is passive, and its
                       behavior defined, when an undervoltage is detected.
                7.3.1 VBAT undervoltage
                       If the UVVBAT flag is set, the transceiver enters Sleep mode (pin INH is switched off)
                       regardless of the voltage levels on pins EN and STBN. If the undervoltage recovers, the
                       transceiver switches to the mode determined by the voltages on pins EN and STBN.
                7.3.2 VCC undervoltage
                       If the UVVCC flag is set, the transceiver switches to Standby mode regardless of the
                       voltage levels on pins EN and STBN. If the undervoltage recovers or the wake flag is set,
                       mode switching via pins EN and STBN is again enabled.
                7.3.3 VIO undervoltage
                       If the voltage on pin VIO is lower than Vuvd(VIO) for longer than tdet(uv)(VIO) (even if the UVVIO
                       flag is reset) pins EN, STBN, TXD and BGE are set LOW (internally) and pin TXEN is set
                       HIGH (internally). If the UVVIO flag is set, the transceiver enters Sleep mode (pin INH is
                       switched off). If the undervoltage recovers or the wake flag is set, mode switching via pins
                       EN and STBN is again enabled.
                   7.4 Flags
                7.4.1 Local wake-up source flag
                       The local wake-up source flag can only be set in a low-power mode. When a wake-up
                       event is detected on pin WAKE (see Section 7.2.2), the local wake-up source flag is set.
                       The local wake-up source flag is reset by entering a low-power mode.
                7.4.2 Remote wake-up source flag
                       The remote wake-up source flag can only be set in a low-power mode if pin VBAT is within
                       its operating range. When a remote wake-up event is detected on the bus lines (see
                       Section 7.2.1), the remote wake-up source flag is set. The remote wake-up source flag is
                       reset by entering a low-power mode.

                                                                                                                    FlexRay node transceiver
                7.4.3 Wake flag
                      The wake flag is set if the local or remote wake-up source flag is set. The wake flag is
                      reset by entering a low-power mode or by setting one of the undervoltage flags.
                7.4.4 Power-on flag
                      If the internal supply voltage to the digital section rises above the minimum operating
                      level, the PWON power-on flag is set. The PWON flag is reset when the TJA1081G enters
                      Normal mode.
                7.4.5 Temperature medium flag
                      If the junction temperature exceeds Tj(warn)(medium) in a normal-power mode, the
                      temperature medium flag is set. The temperature medium flag is reset when the junction
                      temperature drops below Tj(warn)(medium) (in a normal-power mode or after the status
                      register has been read in a low-power mode). No action is taken when this flag is set.
                7.4.6 Temperature high flag
                      If the junction temperature exceeds Tj(dis)(high) in a normal-power mode, the temperature
                      high flag is set. If a negative edge is applied to pin TXEN while the junction temperature is
                      below Tj(dis)(high) in a normal-power mode, the temperature high flag is reset.
                      The transmitter is disabled when the temperature high flag is set.
                7.4.7 TXEN clamped flag
                      If pin TXEN is LOW for longer than tdetCL(TXEN), the TXEN clamped flag is set. If pin TXEN
                      is HIGH, the TXEN clamped flag is reset. The transmitter is disabled when the TXEN
                      clamped flag is set.
                7.4.8 Bus error flag
                      The bus error flag is set if pin TXEN is LOW, pin BGE is HIGH and the data received on
                      the bus lines (pins BP and BM) is different to that received on pin TXD. The transmission
                      of any valid communication element, including a wake-up pattern, is not detected as a bus
                      error.
                      The bus error flag is reset if the data on the bus lines (pins BP and BM) is the same as on
                      pin TXD or if the transmitter is disabled. No action is taken when the bus error flag is set.
                7.4.9 UVVBAT flag
                      If the voltage on pin VBAT is lower than Vuvd(VBAT) for longer than tdet(uv)(VBAT), the UVVBAT
                      flag is set. The UVVBAT flag is reset if the voltage is higher than Vuvr(VBAT) for longer than
                      tto(uvr)(VBAT) or by setting the wake flag; see Section 7.3.1.
               7.4.10 UVVCC flag
                      In a non-low-power mode, the UVVCC flag is set if the voltage on pin VCC is lower than
                      Vuvd(VCC) for longer than tdet(uv)(VCC). In a low-power mode, the UVVCC flag is set if the
                      voltage on pin VCC is lower than Vuvd(VCC) for longer than tto(uvd)(VCC). The UVVCC flag is
                      reset if the voltage on pin VCC is higher than Vuvr(VCC) for longer than tto(uvr)(VCC) or the
                      wake flag is set; see Section 7.3.2.

                7.4.11 UVVIO flag
                        If the voltage on pin VIO is lower than Vuvd(VIO) for longer than tto(uvd)(VIO), the UVVIO flag is
                        set. The UVVIO flag is reset if the voltage on pin VIO is higher than Vuvr(VIO) for longer than
                        tto(uvr)(VIO) or the wake flag is set; see Section 7.3.3.
                   7.5 Status register
                        Pin ERRN goes LOW when one or more of status bits S4 to S10 is set. The contents of
                        the status register (Table 11) can be read out on pin ERRN using the input signal on pin
                        EN as a clock. The timing diagram is shown in Figure 8.
                        The status register is accessible if:
                           ‚Ä¢ UVVIO flag is not set and the voltage on pin VIO is between 4.75 V and 5.25 V
                           ‚Ä¢ UVVCC flag is not set and the voltage on pin VIO is between 2.8 V and 4.75 V
                         If an edge is not detected on pin EN for tdet(EN) after reading the status register, status bits
                        S4 to S10 are cleared provided the corresponding flags have been reset.

15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 ‚ÄúSurface mount reflow
                     soldering description‚Äù.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       ‚Ä¢ Through-hole components
                       ‚Ä¢ Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢ Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       ‚Ä¢ Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       ‚Ä¢ The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       ‚Ä¢ Package placement
                       ‚Ä¢ Inspection and repair
                       ‚Ä¢ Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                15.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢ Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       ‚Ä¢ Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢ Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       ‚Ä¢ Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       ‚Ä¢ Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 16 and 17

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 13.
