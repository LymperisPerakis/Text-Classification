                  Rev. 7 — 26 September 2014                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9701/PCA9702 are low power 18 V tolerant SPI General Purpose Input (GPI)
              shift register designed to monitor the status of switch inputs. It generates an interrupt
              when one or more of the switch inputs change state. The input level is recognized as a
              HIGH when it is greater than 0.7  VDD and as a LOW when it is less than 0.4  VDD
              (minimum threshold of 2 V at 5 V node). The PCA9701 can monitor up to 16 switch inputs
              and the PCA9702 can monitor up to 8 switch inputs.
              The falling edge of the CS pin samples the input port status and clears the interrupt. When
              CS is LOW, the rising edge of the SCLK loads the shift register and shifts the value out of
              the shift register. The serial input is sampled on the falling edge of SCLK.
              Each of the input ports has a 18 V breakdown ESD protection circuit. When used with a
              series resistor (minimum 100 k), the input can connect to a 12 V battery and support
              double battery, reverse battery, 27 V jump start and 40 V load dump conditions in
              automotive applications. Higher voltages can be tolerated on the inputs depending on the
              series resistor used to limit the input current.
              With both the high breakdown voltage and high ESD, these devices are useful for both
              automotive and mobile applications.
              The PCA9703/PCA9704 are new pin compatible devices for the PCA9701/PCA9702
              which have an interrupt masking feature allowing selected inputs to not generate
              interrupts and provides higher ground offset of 0.55  VDD (minimum of 2.5 V at 5 V node)
              with minimum hysteresis of 0.05  VDD (minimum of 225 mV at 5 V node).

[1]   HWQFN24 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must be connected to supply
      ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be
      soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias
      need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

                       PCA9701 is a 16-bit General Purpose Input (GPI) with an open-drain interrupt output
                       designed to monitor switch status. By putting an external 100 k series resistor at the
                       input port, the device allows the input to tolerate momentary double 12 V battery, reverse
                       battery, 27 V jump start or 40 V load dump conditions. The interrupt output is asserted
                       when an input port status changes. The open-drain interrupt output is enabled when
                       INT_EN is HIGH and disabled when INT_EN is LOW. The input port status is accessed
                       via the 4-wire SPI interface. The PCA9702 is the 8-bit version of the PCA9701.
                       Multiple PCA9701 or PCA9702 devices can be serially connected for monitoring a large
                       number of switches by connecting the SDOUT of one device to the SDIN of the next
                       device. SCLK and CS must be common among all devices and interrupt outputs may be
                       tied together. No external logic is necessary because all the devices’ interrupt outputs are
                       open-drain that function as ‘wired-AND’ and can simply be connected together to a single
                       pull-up resistor.
                   7.1 SPI bus operation
                       The PCA9701 or PCA9702 interfaces with the controller via the 4-wire SPI bus that is
                       comprised of the following signals: chip select (CS), serial clock (SCLK), serial data in
                       (SDIN), and serial data out (SDOUT). To access the device, the controller asserts CS
                       LOW, then sends SCLK and SDIN. When reading/writing is complete, the controller
                       de-asserts CS. See Figure 6 for register access timing.
                7.1.1 CS - chip select
                       The CS pin is the device chip select and is an active LOW input. The falling edge of CS
                       captures the input port status in the input status register. If the interrupt output is asserted,
                       the falling edge of CS will clear the interrupt. When CS is LOW, the SPI interface is active.
                       When CS is HIGH, the SPI interface is disabled.
                7.1.2 SCLK - serial clock input
                       SCLK is the serial clock input to the device. It should be LOW and remain LOW during the
                       falling and rising edge of CS. When CS is LOW, the first rising edge of SCLK parallel
                       loads the shift register from the input. The subsequent rising edges on SCLK serially shifts
                       data out from the shift register. The falling edge of SCLK samples the data on SDIN.
                7.1.3 SDIN - serial data input
                       SDIN is the serial data input port. The data is sampled into the shift register on the falling
                       edge of SCLK. SDIN is only active when CS is LOW. This input has a 20 A pull-down
                       current source.
                7.1.4 SDOUT - serial data output
                       SDOUT is the serial data output signal. SDOUT is high-impedance when CS is HIGH and
                       switches to low-impedance after CS goes LOW. When CS is LOW, after the first rising
                       edge of SCLK the most significant bit in the shift register is presented on SDOUT.
                       Subsequent rising edges of SCLK shift the remaining data from the shift register onto
                       SDOUT.

                                 Figure 6 shows the waveforms of the device operation. Initially CS is HIGH and SCLK is
                                 LOW. On the falling edge of CS, input port status, DATA[n:0] is captured into the input
                                 status register, and subsequently the first rising edge of SCLK parallel loads the shift
                                 register. The falling edge of SCLK samples the data on the SDIN. The MSB from the shift
                                 register is valid and available on the SDOUT after the first rising edge of SCLK.

                         7.2 Interrupt output
                                 INT is the open-drain interrupt output and is active LOW. A pull-up resistor of
                                 approximately 10 k is recommended. The interrupt output is asserted when the input
                                 status is changed, and is cleared on the falling edge of CS or when the input port status
                                 matches the input status register. When there are multiple devices, the INT outputs may
                                 be tied together to a single pull-up.
                                 Table 4 illustrates the state of the interrupt output versus the state of the input port and
                                 input status register. The interrupt output is asserted when the input port and input status
                                 register differ.

                   7.3 General Purpose Inputs
                       The General Purpose Inputs (GPI) are designed to behave like a typical input in the 0 V to
                       5.5 V range, but are also designed to have low leakage currents at elevated voltages. The
                       input structure allows for elevated voltages to be applied through a series resistor. The
                       series resistor is required when the input voltage is above 5.5 V. The series resistor is
                       required for two reasons: first, to prevent damage to the input avalanche diode, and
                       second, to prevent the ESD protection circuitry from creating an excessive current flow.
                       The ESD protection circuitry includes a latch-back style device, which provides excellent
                       ESD protection during assembly or typical 5.5 V applications. The series resistor limits the
                       current flowing into the part and provides additional ESD protection. The limited current
                       prevents the ESD latch-back device from latching back to a low voltage, which would
                       cause excessive current flow and damage the part.
                       The minimum required series resistance for applications with input voltages above 5.5 V
                       is 100 k. For applications requiring an applied voltage above 27 V, Equation 1 is
                       recommended to determine the series resistor. Failure to include the appropriate input
                       series resistor may result in product failure and will void the warranty.

                       The series resistor should be placed physically as close as possible to the connected
                       input to reduce the effective node capacitance. The input response time is effected by the
                       RC time constant of the series resistor and the input node capacitance.

                      The VIL is specified as a maximum of 0.40  VDD and is 2.0 V at 4.5 V VDD. This means
                      that if the user applies 2.0 V or less to the input (with VDD = 4.5 V), or as the voltage
                      passes this threshold, they will always see a LOW.
                      The VIH is specified as a minimum of 0.7  VDD. This means that if the user applies 3.15 V
                      or more to the input (with VDD = 4.5 V), or as the voltage passes this threshold, they will

                 8.2.1 SBC wake port extension with cyclic biasing
                        System Basis Chips (SBC) offer many functions needed for in-vehicle networking
                        solutions. Some of the features built into SBC are:
                         •  Transceivers (HS-CAN, LIN 2.0)
                         •  Scalable voltage regulators
                         •  Watchdog timers; wake-up function
                         •  Fail-safe function
                        For more information on SBC, refer to

                         •  PCA970x fits to SBC UJA106x and UJA107xA family
                         •  PCA970x can be powered by V1 of SBC
                         •  Extends the SBC with 8/16 additional wake inputs
                         •  C can be set to stop-mode during standby to save ECU standby current. SBC with
                            GPI periodically monitors the wake inputs
                            – Cyclic bias via V3
                            – Very low system current consumption even with clamped switches

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 24) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 24.
