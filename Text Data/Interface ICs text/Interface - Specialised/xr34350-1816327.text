XR34350 guarantees a logic-high receiver output when the
receiver inputs are open, shorted, or terminated but idle/
undriven. The enhanced failsafe interprets 0V differential
as a logic high with a minimum 50mV noise margin, while
maintaining compliance with the EIA/TIA-485 standard
of ±200mV. No external biasing resistors are required,
further easing the usage of multiple protocols over a single
connector.
