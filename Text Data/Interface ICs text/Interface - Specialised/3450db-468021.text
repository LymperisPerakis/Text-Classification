Hi-Speed USB Host or Device PHY With UTMI+ Interface
General Description
              The USB3450 is a stand-alone Hi-Speed USB Physical Layer Transceiver (PHY). The USB3450 uses
              a UTMI+ interface to connect to an SOC or ASIC or FPGA. SMSC’s advanced proprietary technology
              minimizes power dissipation, resulting in maximum battery life for portable applications. The USB3450
              is a flexible solution for adding USB to new designs without integrating the analog PHY block.
