TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Overview
Description
The TLE9222 FlexRay transceiver is designed for data transmission rates from 1 Mbit/s up to 10 Mbit/s
according to the FlexRay Electrical Physical Layer Specification 3.0.1. The Bus Driver (BD) realizes the physical
interface between a FlexRay node and the communication channel. It provides differential transmit and
receive capability to the bus, allowing the node bidirectional time-multiplexed binary data stream transfer. In
addition to transmit and receive functions, the TLE9222 provides low power standby operation, supply
voltage monitoring (undervoltage detection) as well as bus failure detection and represents an ESD-
protection barrier between the bus and the ECU.
The TLE9222 supports the following FlexRay functional classes:
•   Functional class “Bus driver - bus guardian interface”
•   Functional class “Bus driver logic level adaptation”
•   Functional class “Bus driver remote wakeup”
•   Functional class “Bus driver increased voltage amplitude transmitter”
In BD_Standby mode the quiescent current is decreased to a minimal level while still being able to detect
wake-up requests on the bus.
Fail Safe features, like failure detection and the power supply monitoring, combined with an easy accessible
status register support requirements for safety related applications with extended diagnostic features.
The TLE9222 is internally protected against transients on the bus pins, BP and BM. This makes it possible to
use the TLE9222 for implementing ECUs without additional external bus protection circuitry while fulfilling
ESD and ISO pulse requirements of car manufacturers. With its excellent EMC performance the TLE9222
provides a very high immunity against RF disturbances over a broad frequency range and transmits only a
minimal level of electromagnetic emission onto the bus.
The TLE9222 is integrated in a RoHS compliant PG-TSSOP-14 and PG-TSON-14 package. Using the latest
Infineon Smart Power Technology it is especially tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the automotive
environment and qualification according to the AEC-Q100 standard.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
4             Functional description
The TLE9222 realizes the physical interface between the FlexRay node and the communication channel.
Differential transmit and receive capability to the FlexRay bus is provided, allowing the node bidirectional
time multiplexed binary data stream transfer.
The differential bus voltage is measured between two signal lines, denoted BP (Bus Plus) and BM (Bus Minus),
defined as uBUS = uBP - uBM. Three different bus states are defined for the FlexRay bus; Idle, Data_0 and
Data_1. For the Idle state no differential voltage is driven to BP or to BM. The common mode bus biasing level
will depend on the operation mode of all nodes on the bus. For the Data_1 state a positive differential voltage
is driven between BP and BM, whereas for the Data_0 state a negative differential voltage is driven between
BP and BM.
4.1           Operation modes
The TLE9222 supports two functional operation modes, BD_Normal mode and BD_Standby mode. In
addition, the BD_Off condition describes the behavior of the TLE9222 when unsupplied.
Mode transitions of the TLE9222 are triggered by host commands, undervoltage events and during power-up
/ -down, see Figure 3 and Table 1.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
4.1.1         BD_Normal mode
In BD_Normal mode all interfaces and functions of the TLE9222 are in operating condition. The
communication controller interface is fully active; the RxD output reflects the data on the bus pins, the TxD
drives the data to the transmitter and the TxEN input enables or disables the transmitter. When the
transmitter is activated, fail safe functionality like the transmitter time-out, overtemperature detection and
bus error detection are also enabled. The bus biasing is connected to VCC / 2 via the internal common mode
resistors. With the RxEN flag in the status register the bus states idle or active can be read out through the SPI
interface.
The host interface is active and fully functional, as well as status register read-out on the SPI interface.
Through the bus guardian interface, the transmitter can be activated or disabled.
The wake-up detector is active, but received wake-up information is not flagged while in BD_Normal mode.
The power supply interface including voltage monitor on both VCC and VIO is active. Undervoltage events are
signalled on the ERRN output and in the status register, and trigger a mode transition to BD_Standby mode.
BD_Normal mode can only be entered with a valid host command while both power supplies are within their
operational range.
4.1.2         BD_Standby mode
After power-up the TLE9222 automatically enters BD_Standby, an idle mode with optimized low power
consumption. In BD_Standby mode neither sending nor receiving data is possible, both the transmitter and
the receiver are disabled. The bus biasing is connected to GND through the internal common mode resistors.
The communication controller interface is inactive. The TxD and the TxEN inputs are not functional. The RxD
output is used for signalling wake-up or error information, depending on the host command. The host
interface is active and fully functional, as well as status register read-out on the SPI interface.
The bus guardian interface is inactive and detection of bus transmission through the RxEN flag in the status
register is not possible. The bus failure detector is not active, no bus failure can be detected.
The wake-up detector is active and signals wake-up requests on the ERRN and RxD outputs while the host
command is BD_Standby mode.
The power supply interface with voltage monitoring on both VCC and VIO is active. If the TLE9222 is forced to
BD_Standby mode because of undervoltage events while the host command is BD_Normal mode, this is
signalled on the ERRN output. Additionally, the information is stored in the status register.
4.1.3         BD_Off condition
The TLE9222 enters the BD_Off condition when the VCC power supply drops below the uBDPDVCC power-on-
reset threshold. In this state the transmitter and the receiver are turned off, the wake-up function is not
operational, the RxD and ERRN outputs are “low” and the SDO output is in high impedance state. If the VIO
reference supply is available, the logical inputs are set to their default states as given in Table 2.

Figure 4                     FlexRay physical layer bus signals
The communication controller interface drives the serial digital data stream available on the TxD input to the
FlexRay bus via the transmitter. Simultaneously the receiver of the TLE9222 monitors the data on the FlexRay
bus and transfers the data to a serial digital data stream back to the RxD output. A logical “low” signal on the
TxD input drives a Data_0 signal on the FlexRay bus; a Data_0 signal on the FlexRay bus results in a logical
“low” signal on the RxD output. Vice versa a logical “high” on TxD drives a Data_1 signal on the FlexRay bus
and results in a logical “high” signal on the RxD output. The RxD output is also used to signal wake-up events
while the transceiver is in BD_Standby mode.
The TxEN input is only functional in BD_Normal mode and requires a transition from “high” to “low” for
initiating bus transmissions. After TxEN has been set “low” while the BGE input is “high”, a “low” level on the

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
For avoiding unintentional blocking of the FlexRay bus in case of failures, the transmitter is protected with a
time-out function. In case a time-out occurs, the transmitter will automatically be disabled and the error will
be signalled by the ERRN output and in the status register. A more detailed description of this fail safe function
is given in Chapter 4.7.3.
4.3          Bus guardian interface
The bus guardian interface allows an external supervision device to immediate interrupt any bus transmission
of the TLE9222. A logical “low” signal on the BGE input disables the transmitter of the TLE9222 while operating
in BD_Normal mode, regardless of the signals on the TxD and TxEN inputs.
For increasing the ECU system safety level, an enhanced redundant feedback path has been implemented for
the bus guardian interface. A monitoring circuit directly at the transmitter output stages provides reliable
feedback by setting the ERRN output “low” and indication with the BGE flag in the status register after the
transmitter has been disabled through the Bus Guardian interface.
The logical I/O level of the BGE input is adapted to the digital reference voltage level uVIO. Together with the
TxEN input, the BGE input is monitored for the transmitter time-out function (see Chapter 4.7.3).
Additionally, the status register includes the RxEN (Receive Enable NOT) flag that indicates activity (Data_0 or
Data_1) on the FlexRay bus. This detection is only active in BD_Normal Mode. The RxEN bit can be read out
with the SPI Interface as described in Chapter 4.8.
4.4          Host interface
The host interface enables the host to control the operation mode of the TLE9222 and to flag status
information. The host interface is implemented using hard wired signals, Option A according to the FlexRay
EPL Spec. 3.0.1.
Table 3       Host command
STBN                Resulting operation mode
High                BD_Normal
Low                 BD_Standby
The STBN (Standby Not) input controls the operation mode of the TLE9222. Unless the TLE9222 is being forced
to BD_Standby mode because of undervoltage events, the host command will set operation mode as given in
Table 3. Mode change by host command is completed within the time dBDModeChange after the host command
is applied. Voltage spikes on the STBN input that are shorter than dBDLogicFilter are filtered out and ignored.

The ERRN output is used to signal events detected by the TLE9222 to the host controller. Depending on the
provided host command, the ERRN output indicates errors or wake-up events, see Table 4. The TLE9222
reacts on and signals these events on the ERRN output within the time dReactionTimeERRN. Detailed
information about the detected events as given in Table 4 can be read out from the status register with the SPI
interface as described in Chapter 4.8.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
A “low” output level on the ERRN pin is latched. To reset the ERRN event and the status register either a correct
read-out of the status register or a mode change by the host command is required, given that the error
condition has been resolved.
4.5                  Power supply interface
The TLE9222 is powered by the VCC pin which shall be connected to a voltage supply with nominal 5 V.
Additionally, the TLE9222 provides the VIO reference voltage pin for all digital inputs and outputs. The voltages
at the VCC and VIO pins are monitored for detection of undervoltage events.
4.5.1                VCC undervoltage detection
The TLE9222 detects undervoltage events on the VCC pin if the voltage uVCC falls below the undervoltage
detection threshold uBDUVVCC for a time t > dBDUVVCC_blk. Upon detection the VCC-undervoltage flag and the
error flag are set. In case the TLE9222 is in BD_Normal mode, the transmitter will be disabled and the ERRN
output will go “low” after the time dReactionTimeERRN. After the time dBDUVVCC the TLE9222 will force a
transition to BD_Standby, regardless of the host command (see Figure 6).

Figure 6             VCC undervoltage detection
The TLE9222 recovers from a VCC undervoltage event after the time t > dBDRVCC following the voltage uVCC rise
above the undervoltage detection threshold uBDUVVCC. This will release the host command and change
operation mode accordingly.
4.5.2                VIO undervoltage detection
The VIO undervoltage detection is similar to that on the VCC supply. Undervoltage events on the VIO pin are
detected if the voltage uVIO falls below the undervoltage detection threshold uUVIO for a time t > dBDUVVIO_blk.
Upon detection the VIO-undervoltage flag and the error flag are set. While an undervoltage event is present on
the VIO pin, the reference threshold levels of all digital input and output pins are invalid. Therefore, the
TLE9222 blocks the host interface, communication controller interface, SPI interface and the bus guardian
interface. The digital outputs RxD and ERRN are set “low” and all digital input pins follow their default levels

Figure 7             VIO undervoltage detection
The TLE9222 will recover from a VIO undervoltage event after the time t > dBDRVIO following the voltage uVIO
rise above the undervoltage detection threshold uUVIO. This will release the SPI interface and host command,
and change mode accordingly (see Figure 7).
4.5.3                Power-up and power-down
The TLE9222 will remain in BD_Off condition as long as the voltage on the VCC supply pin, uVCC, is below the
power-down threshold uBDPDVCC. When uVCC is ramped up higher than uBDPDVCC the TLE9222 powers up and
begins initialization of the BD_Standby mode within the time dBDPower. After both voltages uVCC and uVIO have
risen above their respective undervoltage detection thresholds (uBDUVVCC and uUVIO, respectively), the digital
interfaces will be released and the full functionality of the device will be available. The power-on event can be
identified with the corresponding flag in the status register and mode change according to the host command
will then be initiated (see Figure 8).

Figure 9         Power-down behavior
While the TLE9222 is being powered down, the behavior on the digital interface level shift reference pin VIO is
very similar to the VCC supply pin. As uVIO falls below the undervoltage threshold the undervoltage timer is
started and the VIO-undervoltage flag is set. If VCC is not already in undervoltage condition, the error flag is also
set. After the detection time for VIO undervoltage, dBDUVVIO, the TLE9222 blocks the host command (if not
already blocked because of VCC undervoltage) and all digital interfaces and enters BD_Standby mode.
When the voltage at the VCC supply pin, uVCC, falls below the power-on threshold uBDPDVCC the TLE9222 enters
BD_Off condition within the time dBDPower.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
4.6                     Remote wake-up
The TLE9222 detects and signals a remote wake-up request after correct reception of a bus wake-up pattern
or wake-up payload in a FlexRay data frame while operating in BD_Standby mode. When the valid wake-up
pattern or wake-up payload is detected, the TLE9222 signals the request with the remote wake-up flag in the
status register and on the RxD and ERRN outputs within the time dBDWakeupReactionRemote.
The wake-up detector is also active in BD_Normal mode, but wake-up requests are only flagged when the
TLE9222 is in BD_Standby mode.
4.6.1                   Bus wake-up patterns
A wake-up pattern consists of at least two wake-up symbols. A wake-up symbol on the FlexRay bus is defined
as either a phase of Data_0 followed by a phase of Idle, or alternatively as a phase of Data_0 followed by a
phase of Data_1. A valid remote wake-up event is detected with the reception of at least two consecutive
wake-up symbols on the bus within the time dWUTimeout (see Figure 10 and Figure 11).

4.6.2                       Wake-up by payload
In addition to wake-up detection by wake-up patterns, the TLE9222 also supports wake-up requests by a
specific payload within the data field of a FlexRay communication frame with data transmission rate of
10 Mbit/s.
A dedicated Byte Start Sequence (BSS) is transmitted before each byte of the payload within the FlexRay data
frame. The BSS consists of one “high” bit followed by one “low” bit. For transmitting a “Data_0” byte on the
FlexRay bus, the FlexRay controller sends 10 bits, the “high” bit and the “low” bit as part of the BSS followed
by the eight “low” data bits (HL= BSS; LLLLLLLL= “Data_0”). For sending a “Data_1” byte the FlexRay controller
sends the “high” bit and the “low” bit, followed by the eight consecutive “high” data bits (HL = BSS;
HHHHHHHH = “Data_1”) (see Figure 12).

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
4.7                                 Fail safe functions and flags
In addition to power supply undervoltage detection, the TLE9222 provides several functions for detection of
local or remote failures with corresponding status flags. These errors are signalled with the ERRN output and
can be read out from the status register. When local errors are detected, the TLE9222 initiates fail safe
procedures for device self protection and prevention of communication channel interruption.
4.7.1                               Overtemperature detection
The transmitter of the TLE9222 is protected against overtemperature events when active in BD_Normal mode.
If the junction temperature rises above the TJ(warning) threshold the temperature-warning flag in the status
register is set. If the junction temperature continues to rise and exceeds the TJ(Shut_Down) threshold, the
transmitter will be disabled and the overtemperature event will be flagged by the temperature-high flag in the
status register and signalled with the ERRN output.

The bus error detector monitors the FlexRay bus for identifying external failures which may lead to corrupt
data transmission and reception. With the RxD-TxD compare function and the bus overcurrent monitoring,
bus errors are detected and signalled with the bus error flag. The bus error detector is only enabled in
BD_Normal mode while the transmitter is active.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
4.7.2.1       RxD-TxD compare
When the TLE9222 transmits data on the bus (TxEN “low” and BGE “high”), the digital input data on TxD is
compared with the received data on the RxD output. If the data is not identical, a failure condition is identified.
Both the positive and the negative edges on the TxD input signal triggers an internal comparator to compare
the TxD signal with the RxD signal. The results are stored in an internal error counter. When the internal error
counter exceeds 10 reported comparison failures, the bus error flag will be set. The error counter is reset when
the transmitter is deactivated.
4.7.2.2       Bus overcurrent
The BP and BM bus pins have implemented current sensors for detection of overcurrent conditions in the
direction in or out of the pins. Detection of overcurrent is the typical signature of a short circuit of one of the
bus lines to the ground or a supply line.
4.7.3         Transmitter time-out
For avoiding unintentional blocking of the FlexRay bus in case of e.g. a malfunctioning microcontroller or
short circuits on the PCB, the transmitter is protected with a time-out function. When the transmitter is
activated for bus transmission while in BD_Normal mode, with a “low” signal on TxEN and “high” on BGE, a
timer is started. In case a time-out occurs, the transmitter will automatically be disabled and the failure will
be signaled on the ERRN output and in the status register.
The transmitter timer is reset when the transmitter is deactivated with either TxEN or BGE.
4.7.4         VIO undervoltage flag
During VIO undervoltage events, the SPI register is blocked and can not be read out. After undervoltage
recovery, depending on host command and the status of other register flags, the VIO-undervoltage flag may or
may not be set. Please refer to Chapter 4.7.6.
4.7.5         SPI-error flag
The SPI-error flag is used for indication of incorrect SPI read-out procedure, please find detailed description
in Chapter 4.8.1.
4.7.6         Error flag
If any local errors or bus errors are detected, the respective bit in the status register is flagged together with
the error flag (bit 12). If the error flag is set, but no other error contributing flags in the status register set, then
this indicates that a VIO undervoltage event has occurred in the past but recovery has already taken place.
While the error flag is set and the host command on the STBN input is “high”, the ERRN output is “low”.
4.7.7         Mode flags
The mode flag in the status register indicates the current operating mode of the TLE9222, regardless of the
applied host command. If the TLE9222 is in BD_Standby mode, bit 1 will be “low”. If the current operation
mode is BD_Normal, bit 1 will be “high”. The mode flag will only toggle during an operation mode change, i.e.
not be reset by SPI register read-out. The mode indication can be beneficial for the host when the TLE9222 is
forced to a different mode than requested with the host command during VCC undervoltage events.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Functional description
The RxEN flag indicates ongoing bus transmission. As soon as the bus state returns to idle, this flag is set
“high”.
The wake-up, power-on and error flags and their corresponding status register bits are latched “low”. A mode
change by host command or a correct SPI status bit register read-out will reset these flags, given that the error
condition has been resolved.
4.8.1              Read-out procedure
The SPI interface of the TLE9222 is enabled by the SCSN (SPI Chip Select Not) input. While SCSN is “high”, the
SDO (SPI Data Output) output is in a high impedance state and clock signals on the SCLK input are ignored.
The read-out procedure is initiated with a “low” signal on SCSN, which will cause the SDO output to be set
“low” (see Figure 13). After the time dSPILead the status register data can be shifted out on the SDO output
synchronized with the rising edge of a clock signal on the SCLK input. With a clock signal period of dSPIClk, the
TLE9222 supports SPI data rates in the range 10 kbit/s to 4 Mbit/sIf a transition on SCSN from “high” to “low”
is detected while SCLK is “high”, this would be identified as a SPI error.
Within the SCSN period, the time dSPISCSN_Low while the signal on SCSN is “low”, exactly 16 clock cycles are
expected for a correct read-out procedure. Incorrect SPI access, with more or less than 16 SCLK cycles or
wrong timing, is protected by the SPI timer. If the read-out time dSPISCSN_Low expires, the SDO output is set to
“high impedance” within the time dSPISDOZ. Additionally the error flag and SPI-error flag in the status register
will be set, while the state of all other latched bits are left unchanged.
                                                                      dSPISCSN_Low

Figure 14            SPI read-out
After a correct SPI read-out process, the information on the ERRN output and the flags in the status register
are refreshed. Next SPI read-out can be initiated after SCSN is set “high” for the time dSPIInterframe.
The SPI interface is available in both BD_Normal mode and BD_Standby mode, but SPI readout should not
occur at the same time as a mode change with the host interface, the time dBDModeChange must be respected.
The SPI register is also blocked during undervoltage conditions on VIO.
While the TLE9222 is set in BD_Standby with host command (pin STBN = “low”) and no wake-up or errors have
been detected, the SPI interface requires an enable time of dSPILeadStbOK from SCSN goes “low” until the first
rising edge on the clock signal on the SCLK input can be applied.

TLE9222
FlexRay Transceiver
Application information
7.4           Implementation of ECU functional safety concepts
The TLE9222 has been implemented with features for alleviating the development of functional safety
requirements on a system level. The top level objective is to ensure a malfunctioning ECU is put in a safe state,
which for the FlexRay transceiver means no bus disturbance.
This is realized by the Bus Guardian interface, which controls the bus transmitter directly at the driver stages.
The TLE9222 is also implemented with a redundant diagnostic path for detecting the true state of the bus
transmitter. This status is multiplexed back to the ERRN output, which is set “low” when the transmitter is
reliably disabled. By taking advantage of this safety feature, the ECU diagnostic coverage can be increased.

Figure 22         Application diagram
In Figure 22 an application example of an Automotive ECU for safety critical applications is shown. Together
with a Safety MCU Supply IC, e.g. the Infineon TLF35584, that incorporates safe state control functionality, the
BGE input of the TLE9222 is connected to the safe state output. If the Safety Supply IC detects unexpected
behavior at the supply voltages or incorrect MCU behavior through the functional watchdog, the TLE9222
makes sure there is no influence to the FlexRay bus after the BGE input is set “low”. Additionally, the

trigger a SPI readout of the status register. By observing the BGE flag being set “low”, the MCU has verified that
the TLE9222 has been safely disconnected from the bus by the Safety Supply IC.
It is recommended to follow these steps for the ECU software implementation. After ECU power-up, the MCU
should test and verify the correct behavior of the fail safe state as a part of its initialization routine, before
releasing the transceiver for bus access and transmission.
7.5           Minimizing ECU current consumption through BD_Standby mode
The very low current consumption of iVCC_Stb_85 and iVCC_Stb_150 of the TLE9222 can only be reached with the
correct system implementation and software control. While operating in ECU low power mode with the
TLE9222 in BD_Standby mode, the logic inputs should be in their default states (See Table 2). This prevents
current to flow through the implemented pull-up / pull-down circuits. Secondly, the logic outputs, RxD and
ERRN, should be in their default condition “high” for BD_Standby mode (See Table 4). After the TLE9222 is set
to BD_Standby mode, it is recommended to perform a SPI readout for verifying correct state transition and to
clear pending diagnosis flags.
A MCU in low-power mode should continuously (by interrupt) or periodically (by polling) monitor the ERRN
output for wake-up information. Even if the wake-up function is not being used, the MCU should clear the flags
of the status register by SPI readout. For simpler ECU implementations, not using the SPI interface, a mode
change cycle to BD_Normal mode and back to BD_Standby mode again has the same effect.
