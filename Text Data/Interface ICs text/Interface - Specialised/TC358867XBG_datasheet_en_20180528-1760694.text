Overview
   TC358867XBG is a bridge device that enables video streaming from a
   Host (application or baseband processor) over MIPI® DSI or DPI link
   to drive DisplayPortTM display panels. TC358867XBG also supports
   audio streaming from the host via I2S interface to the Display panels.                     P-VFBGA80-0707-0.65-001
   TC358867XBG provides a low power bridge solution to efficiently                            Weight: 76mg (Typ.)
   translate MIPI® DSI or DPI transfers to DisplayPortTM transfers. As the
   DisplayPortTM uses fewer wires compared to other existing display panel standards, it simplifies the LCD
   connectivity. The effect of using TC358867XBG is to enable existing baseband devices supporting DSI or
   DPI streaming to connect to new panels supporting DisplayPortTM interface and also to connect to existing
   panels over longer distance using DisplayPortTM adaptors at far-end.

1. Overview
   The DSI/DPI to DisplayPortTM converter (TC358867XBG) is a bridge device that enables video
   streaming from a Host (application or baseband processor) over MIPI® DSI or DPI link to drive
   DisplayPortTM display panels. TC358867XBG also supports audio streaming from the host via I2S
   interface to the Display panels. TC358867XBG provides a low power bridge solution to efficiently
   translate MIPI® DSI or DPI transfers to DisplayPortTM transfers. As the DisplayPortTM uses fewer wires
   compared to other existing display panel standards, it simplifies the LCD connectivity. The effect of
   using TC358867XBG is to enable existing baseband devices supporting DSI or DPI streaming to
   connect to new panels supporting DisplayPortTM interface and also to connect to existing panels over
   longer distance using DisplayPortTM adaptors at far-end.
   The chip can be configured through the DSI link by sending write/read register commands through DSI
   Generic Long Write packets. It can also be configured through the I2C Slave interface.
   The DSI-RX receiver supports from 1 to 4-Lane configurations at bit rate up to 1 Gbps per lane. Host
   can transmit video in continuous video streaming mode. Host controls video timing by sending video
   frame and line sync events together with video pixel data; video data transmission can be burst or non-
   burst. Since the chip integrates only a small video buffer, Host still has to take care of transmitting pixel
   data at appropriate video line time in order to avoid buffer overflow (or underflow).
   The DPI-Rx receiver supports 16, 18 or 24 bits parallel interface along with the required control signals
   for the Pixel clock and HSync/VSync/DE.
   The TC358867XBG also supports content protection using HDCP copy protection(Optional).
   The DisplayPortTM transmitter supports data throughput at 1.62 Gbps or 2.7 Gbps per lane of main link.
   TC358867XBG supports three configuration modes. These modes mainly differ based on the source of
   input stream and output interface..
     ●    Mode_S21: A system configuration where TC358867XBG may typically be used is shown in Figure
          1.1. In this configuration, the TC358867XBG can support displays with resolution up to WUXGA
          (1920×1200) at 24bit, 60 fps or WUXGA (1920×1200) at 18bit, 60 fps. Video stream source is from
          DSI Host.
     ●    Mode_P21: A system configuration where TC358867XBG may typically be used is shown in Figure
          1.2. This is similar to the Mode_S21 except that the video stream source is from DPI Host. In this
          configuration, the TC358867XBG can support displays with resolution up to WUXGA (1920×1200)
          at 24bit, 60 fps.
     ●   Mode_S2P: A system configuration where TC358867XBG may typically be used is shown in Figure
         1.3. In this mode, DisplayPortTM output is not used and the chip rather behaves as a DSI to RGB
          convertor. In this system, TC358867XBG could be connected to a single display. In this
          configuration, the TC358867XBG can support displays with resolution up to WXGA (1280x800 or
          1366x768). Maximum output PCLK is 100MHz. Video stream source is from DSI Host.
                                                   7 / 20                                              2018-05-28


                                                                                             TC358867XBG
The chip supports power management to conserve power when its functions are not in use. Host
manages the chip's power consumption modes by using ULPS messages over DSI link during DPI input
mode.
The following figures show all these modes, where TC358867XBG, display panels and a Host are
connected in target Reference system for mobile large display panel applications.
