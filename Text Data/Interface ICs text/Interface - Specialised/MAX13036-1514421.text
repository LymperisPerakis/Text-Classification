Note 1: All units are 100% production tested at TA = +125°C. Limits over the operating temperature range are guaranteed by cor-
         relation to the +125°C tests.
Note 2: The total supply current is the sum of the current flowing into VL, BAT, and BATREF.
Note 3: VTH_C = (VTH_HIGH + VTH_LOW)/2.
Note 4: VTH_HYS = (VTH_HIGH - VTH_LOW).
Note 5: Wetting current rise/fall time is measured as the time from 10% to 90% of the maximum wetting current.
Note 6: Guaranteed by design.

                       threshold is exceeded.
                       Interrupt Output. INT is an open-drain output that asserts low when one or more of the IN0–IN7 inputs
    14         INT
                       change state and is enabled for interrupts.
                       SPI Chip-Select Input. Drive CS low to enable clocking of data into and out of the MAX13036. SPI data is

example, assume all inputs are configured for a continuous
