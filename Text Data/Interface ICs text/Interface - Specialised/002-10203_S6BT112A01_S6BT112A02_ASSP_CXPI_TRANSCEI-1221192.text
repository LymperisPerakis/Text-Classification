5.2   Master Node
 There is only one node in a system, which functions as a schedule manager and a primary clock master.
 The transceiver works in Master mode when low-level is applied on SELMS.
 The baud rate clock is applied on the CLK pin in the Master state.
 The transceiver is usually used as the "Master" or "Slave", except for the “Secondary Clock master function”.
 The SELMS input should not be changed in normal mode.
 The SELMS input should not be changed during wakeup pulse transmission in Sleep mode.
 The CLK pin inputs for the baud rate clock in Master state.

5.2.1    Normal Mode
The Normal mode denotes the state to which communication is possible. The master node transmits the clock to the CXPI BUS,
which means that the clock is master. During the Normal mode, the transmitted signal is encoded and the received signal is
decoded. When the transmitting node transmits data to the CXPI BUS, it transmits to the TXD pin after converting the data to UART
format by 1 byte. The data is transmitted to the CXPI BUS as LSB first.
When the receiving node receives data from the CXPI BUS, it receives from the RXD pin in the UART format by 1 byte. The UART
format is listed in Table 5-2. Refer to the JASO CXPI (JASO D 015-3:2015) standard for details of the operation.

5.2.2       Sleep Mode
The Sleep mode denotes a power-saving state during which each node stops transmitting and receiving data. All nodes transition to
Sleep mode immediately after power-on. The nodes also transition to Sleep mode after the Sleep processing is executed from the
Normal mode and transition from Standby mode or Normal mode due to CXPI BUS error.
When each node receives the Wakeup factor during the Sleep mode, it transitions to the Standby mode.The Wakeup factor (for
example, detecting that the ignition has been turned on) of each node is different from each application (for example, detecting that
the ignition has been turned on) and the external factor that receives the Wakeup pulse from the CXPI BUS. During the Sleep mode,
the reception signal is received without decoding. The MCU can detect a wakeup pulse width monitor using the RXD signal.
The sleep mode is initiated by a falling edge on the NSLP pin while TXD is already set High. The CXPI BUS transmit path is
immediately disabled when the NSLP pin goes Low. All wake-up events must be maintained for a specific period (refer to the
TMODE_CHG parameter in Table 8-7).

5.2.3    Standby Mode
The Standby mode denotes the prepared state to the Normal mode after releasing the Sleep mode. During the CLK state (in slave
node), the RXD pin and the BUS pin are in a high-impedance state. After TMODE_CHG, the state changes to the Normal mode.
5.2.4    Power-on Sequence
The power-on sequence occurs at power-up while setting up Sleep mode. When VBAT is above 5.3 V, the NSLP pin should be in a
High state. After transition to the normal mode, activate the BUS pin after a clock input of 33 periods.

5.3    Slave Node
All the nodes, except the master node, are connected with the system. The transceiver works as Slave when High level is applied on
SELMS. The CLK pin outputs the baud rate clock during the Slave state.
The transceiver is usually used as the "Master" or "Slave", except for the “Secondary Clock master function”.

The SELMS input should not be changed during the Normal mode or during wakeup pulse transmission in the Sleep mode. The
CLK pin outputs the baud rate clock in Slave node.
Figure 5-5 CLK Pin Clock Output (Slave)
5.3.1     Normal Mode
The Normal mode can perform data transmit and receive. During the Normal mode, the signal that is transmitted is encoded and the
signal that is received is decoded. When the transmitting node transmits data to the CXPI BUS, it transmits to the TXD pin after
converting the data to UART format by 1 byte. The data is transmitted to the CXPI BUS by LSB first. When the receiving node
receives data from the CXPI BUS , it revises from the RXD pin in the UART format by 1 byte. The UART format is shown in Table 5-7.
Refer to the JASO CXPI (JASO D 015-3:2015) standard for details of the operation.

5.3.2     Sleep Mode
The Sleep mode denotes a state of power saving during which each node stops transmit and receive of data. All nodes transition to
the Sleep mode immediately after power-on. They also transition to the Sleep mode after the sleep processing is executed from the
Normal mode and transition from the Standby mode or the Normal mode due to CXPI BUS error.
During the Sleep mode, when each node receives the Wakeup factor, it transitions to the Standby mode. The Wakeup factor is
different from each application and is composed of the internal factor (for example, detecting that the ignition has been turned on)
and the external factor that receives the Wakeup pulse from the CXPI BUS.
During the Sleep mode, the reception signal is received without decoding. The sleep mode is initiated by a falling edge on the NSLP
pin while the TXD pin is already set High. The CXPI BUS transmit path is immediately disabled when the NSLP pin goes Low.
All wake-up events must be maintained for a specific period (refer to TMODE_CHG in Table 8-7).

During the Sleep mode, the received signal will be output from the CLK pin without decoding a received signal. The RXD pin outputs
at High level. When the Master node transmits the encoded PWM clock signal to the CXPI BUS during a wake-up sequence, Slave
MCUs receive shorter low-level width signals than the UART communication period and possibly get errors. This is because the
Slave node is received without decoding. To avoid these errors, S6BT112A01 or S6BT112A02 CXPI transceiver IC outputs receive
signals on the CLK pin in the Sleep mode.
MCU can detect a wake-up pulse width to monitor the CLK signal. (Figure 5-7)
Figure 5-7 CLK Output of Receive Signal、RXD stays High (for Slave node)
■Wakeup function
The WakeupPulseOutput state transmits out the wakeup pulse in the Slave node. When the slave device returns from the Sleep
mode, it must transmit a wake-up pulse. As the NSLP pin is in a Low state, the TXD pin transmits a Low state. The TXD signal is
transmitted to the BUS pin without encode. The TXD pin outputs the signal width, which is a value obtained by subtracting the
TTXD_BT:
Signal width = TXD signal (“L”) – TTXD_BT(“L”)

5.3.3    Standby Mode
This is the standby state during the Normal mode after releasing the Sleep mode. During this state, CLK (in slave node), the RXD
pin, and the BUS pin enter the high-impedance state. After "TMODE_CHG," this state changes to the Normal mode.
5.3.4    Power-on Sequence
This sequence occurs at power-up, while setting up the Sleep mode. When VBAT is above 5.3 V, the NSLP pin should be in a High
state.

5.4    Common Functions
5.4.1    Overtemperature Protection
The overtemperature protection (OTP) monitors the die temperature. If the junction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction
temperature, TSD_H, the thermal protection circuit disables the output driver.
The driver is enabled again when the junction temperature falls below TSD_L and theTXD pin is toggled. (see Table 5-10)
5.4.2    WP_ThermalShutdown
The WP_ThermalShutdown state detects the "shutdown temperature" during the WakeupPulseOutput mode. The overtemperature
protection is inactive during the Sleep mode.

5.4.3    Low-voltage Reset
The low-voltage reset state detects the low voltage of the BAT pin. This device has an integrated power-on reset and low-voltage
detection at the supply BAT.
If the supply voltage, VBAT, is dropping below the power-on reset level (that is, VBAT<VPOR_L), then change the LowPowerReset mode.
In the LowPowerReset mode, the output stage is disabled and communication to the CXPI BUS is not possible.
If the power supply reaches a higher level than the low-voltage reset level, VBAT> VPOR_H, then change the Standby mode (the NSLP
pin is High) or Sleep mode (the NSLP pin is Low).
After releasing LowPowerRest mode, enable the Power-up sequence.

5.4.5    Secondary Clock Master
The node that detects the wakeup event transmits the wakeup pulse on to the CXPI BUS. If the primary clock master cannot
transmit the clock to the CXPI BUS due to failure, the wakeup pulse is retransmitted. If the clock is not transmitted to the CXPI BUS,
each node detects the CXPI BUS error.
The secondary clock master may transmit the clock to the CXPI BUS instead of the primary clock master if it detects that the clock
does not exist, and confirms that the clock does not exist on the CXPI BUS for the period during which it transitions from the Sleep
mode
■Operation sequence from master to slave
The TXD input pin is set High and the CLK pin is high-impedance. A Low setting on the NSLP pin initiates a transition to the Sleep
mode. After the RXD pin is confirmed to High state, the SELMS pin goes to High state. Table 5-15 shows the pin states just before

5.4.6    Arbitration
Transceivers arbitrate bit-by-bit. Arbitration in bytes is done in the MCU.
In the Normal mode, each node always compares the received bit from the CXPI BUS with the transmitted bit to the CXPI BUS.
When the value of the bit is corresponding, the node may continuously transmit to the CXPI BUS. When the value of the bit is not
corresponding, the loss of arbitration is detected, and the transmission of the bit after that shall discontinue. If the transmitting node
detects the arbitration loss, it behaves as the receiving node. The data of each bit transmitted on the CXPI BUS performs arbitration
from the start by the bit. Moreover, arbitration is targeted at the entire field of the frame. When two or more nodes begin transmitting
at the same time, by arbitration only the node that transmits the highest priority frame can complete the transmission.
The MCU compares between the transmitted data (TXD) and received data (RXD). If the data difference is detected, MCU has to
stop data transmission until finding IFS.

5.4.7      TXD Toggle
If the TXD pin is short to ground or open, the BUS pin output is not fixed Low (logic value). Therefore, it does not interfere with the
communication of the other device.
An initial TXD dominant check prevents the bus line being driven to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
communications) if the TXD pin is forced permanently Low by a hardware and/or software application failure. The TXD input level is
checked after a transition to the Normal mode.
If the TXD pin is Low, the transmit path remains disabled and is only enabled when the TXD pin goes High.
A TXD toggle is required in the following cases.
    Data   transmission after recovery from low-voltage reset.
    Data   transmission after recovery from thermal shutdown.
    First TXD data transmission in the Normal mode.
    First wake-up pulse transmission in sleep mode.
■Short-circuit from the TXD pin to ground.(failure detect)
In the event of a short-circuit to ground or an open-wire on the TXD pin, the BUS pin output remains High (logical value ‘1’) by this
toggle function. In this case, by comparing the sent data to the TXD pin and received data from the RXD pin of the transceiver IC,
the MCU can detect the permanent Low on the TXD pin by the data difference. In this case too, the receiver is active.
