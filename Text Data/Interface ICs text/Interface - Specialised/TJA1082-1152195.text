              The TJA1082 FlexRay node transceiver is compliant with the FlexRay electrical physical
              layer specification V2.1 Rev. B (see Ref. 1). In addition, it incorporates features and
              parameters included in V3.0.1 (see Ref. 2 and Section 14). It is primarily intended for
              communication systems operating at between 2.5 Mbit/s and 10 Mbit/s, and provides an
              advanced interface between the protocol controller and the physical bus in a FlexRay
              network. The TJA1082 offers an optimized solution for Electronic Control Unit (ECU)
              applications that do not need enhanced power management and are typically switched by
              the ignition or activated by a dedicated wake-up line.
              The TJA1082 provides a differential transmit capability to the network and a differential
              receive capability to the FlexRay controller. It offers excellent ElectroMagnetic
              Compatibility (EMC) performance as well as high ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD)
              protection.
              The TJA1082 actively monitors system performance using dedicated error and status
              information (readable by any microcontroller), as well as internal voltage and temperature
              monitoring.

                   6.1 Power modes
                       The TJA1082 features three power modes: Normal, Standby and Power-off. Normal and
                       Standby modes can be selected via the STBN input (HIGH for Normal mode) once the
                       transceiver has been powered up. See Table 3 for a detailed description of pin signaling in

               6.1.1.1 Bus activity and idle detection
                       In Normal mode, bus activity and bus idle are detected as follows:
                         • Bus activity is detected when the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is
                            higher than Vi(dif)det(act) for tdet(act)(bus):
                            – If the differential voltage on the bus lines is lower than VIL(dif) after bus activity has
                               been detected, pin RXD switches LOW.
                            – If the differential voltage on the bus lines is higher than VIH(dif) after bus activity has
                               been detected, pin RXD remains HIGH.
                         • Bus idle is detected when the absolute differential voltage on the bus lines is lower
                            than Vi(dif)det(act) for tdet(idle)(bus). This results in pin RXD being switched HIGH or
                            staying HIGH.
                6.1.2 Standby mode
                       Standby mode is a low-power mode featuring very low current consumption. In Standby
                       mode, the transceiver is unable to transmit or receive data since both the transmitter and
                       the normal receiver are switched off. The low-power receiver is activated to monitor the
                       bus for wake-up activity, provided an undervoltage has not been detected on pin VCC.
                       The low-power receiver is deactivated if an undervoltage is detected on pin VCC - with the
                       result that the wake flag is not set if a wake-up pattern or dedicated data frame is
                       received.
                       Pins ERRN and RXD indicate the status of the wake flag when VIO and VCC are within
                       their operating ranges. See Table 3 for a description of pins ERRN and RXD when an
                       undervoltage is detected on pin VIO or pin VCC.
                       The status register cannot be read via the SPI interface if an undervoltage is detected on
                       pin VIO.
                       The BGE input has no effect in Standby mode.
                6.1.3 Power-off mode
                       The transmitter and the two receivers (normal and low-power) are deactivated in
                       Power-off mode. As a result, the wake flag is not set if a wake-up pattern or dedicated
                       data frame is received. If the voltage at VCC rises above Vth(rec)POR, the transceiver
                       switches to Standby mode and the digital section is reset. If VCC subsequently drops
                       below Vth(det)POR, the transceiver reverts to Power-off mode (see Section 6.2).
                       The status register cannot be read via the SPI interface in Power-off mode.
                6.1.4 State transitions
                       Figure 4 shows the TJA1082 state transition diagram. The timing diagram for the ERRN
                       indication signal during transitions between Normal and Standby modes, when the error
                       flag is set and the wake flag is not set, is illustrated in Figure 5 and described in Table 6.

                      6.2 Power-up and power-down behavior
                   6.2.1 Power-up
                             The TJA1082 has two supply pins: VCC (+5 V) and VIO (for the voltage level adaptation).
                             The ramp up of the different power supplies can vary, depending on the state or value of a
                             number of signals and parameters. The power-up behavior of the TJA1082 is not affected
                             by the sequence in which power is supplied to these pins or by the voltage ramp up.
                             As an example, Figure 6 shows one possible power supply ramp-up scenario. The digital
                             section of the TJA1082 is supplied by VCC. The voltage on pin VCC ramps up before the
                             voltage on pin VIO. As long as the voltage on VCC remains below the power-on reset
                             recovery threshold, Vth(rec)POR, the internal state machine is not active and the transceiver
                             is totally passive, remaining in Power-off mode. As soon as the voltage crosses the
                             Vth(rec)POR threshold, the internal state machine starts running, setting the PWON flag and
                             switching the TJA1082 to Standby mode. This initializes the VCC and VIO under-voltage
                             flags to the set state (since both VCC and VIO are actually in undervoltage state just after
                             power-on).
                             Once both VIO and VCC have reached their operating ranges, the under-voltage flags are
                             reset. The operating mode is then determined by the level on STBN (the TJA1082
                             switches to Normal mode if STBN is HIGH and remains in Standby mode if STBN is
                             LOW), provided VIO and VCC are above their respective undervoltage recovery levels
                             (Vuvr(VIO) and Vuvr(VCC)).

                   6.3 Remote wake-up
                6.3.1 Bus wake-up via wake-up pattern
                       A valid remote wake-up event occurs when a wake-up pattern is received. A wake-up
                       pattern consists of at least two consecutive wake-up symbols. A wake-up symbol consists
                       of a DATA_0 phase lasting longer than tdet(wake)DATA_0, followed by an idle phase lasting
                       longer than tdet(wake)idle, provided both wake-up symbols occur within a time span of
                       tdet(wake)tot (see Figure 8). The transceiver also wakes up if the idle phases are replaced
                       by DATA_1 phases.
                                                                                                                                     wake-up

                  6.3.2 Bus wake-up via dedicated FlexRay data frame
                               The TJA1082 wake flag is set when a dedicated data frame emulating a valid wake-up
                               pattern, as shown in Figure 10, is received.
                               The DATA_0 and DATA_1 phases of the emulated wake-up symbol are interrupted by the
                               Byte Start Sequence (BSS) preceding each byte in the data frame. With a data rate of
                               10 Mbit/s, the interruption has a maximum duration of 130 ns and does not prevent the
                               transceiver from recognizing the wake-up pattern in the payload.
                               For longer interruptions at lower data rates (5 Mbit/s and 2.5 Mbit/s), the wake-up pattern
                               should be used (see Section 6.3.1).
                               The wake flag is not set if an invalid wake-up pattern is received. See Ref. 1 for more
                               details on invalid wake-up patterns.

          The duration of each interruption is 130 ns.
          The transition time from DATA_0 to DATA_1 and vice versa is about 20 ns.
          The TJA1082 wake-up flag is set on receipt of the following frame payload:
          0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,

                   6.4 Bus error detection
                            The TJA1082 detects the following bus errors during transmission:
                             •   Short-circuit BP to BM at the ECU connector or on the bus
                             •   Short-circuit BP to GND at the ECU connector or on the bus
                             •   Short-circuit BM to GND at the ECU connector or on the bus
                             •   Short-circuit BP to VCC at the ECU connector or on the bus
                             •   Short-circuit BM to VCC at the ECU connector or on the bus
                            The bus error flag is not set when a wake-up pattern or a FlexRay Collision Avoidance
                            Symbol (CAS) is being transmitted or received.
                   6.5 Fail silent behavior
                            Three mechanisms guarantee the ‘fail silent’ behavior of the TJA1082:
                             • The TXEN Clamped flag is set if pin TXEN goes LOW for longer than tdetCL(TXEN) in
                                 Normal mode; the transmitter is disabled.
                             • The BGE Clamped flag is set if pin BGE goes HIGH for longer than tdetCL(BGE) in
                                 Normal mode; no action is taken.
                             • If a loss-of-ground occurs at the transceiver, resulting in the TJA1082 switching to
                                 Power-off mode, no current flows out of the digital input pins (TXD, TXEN, BGE,
                                 STBN, SCLK, SCSN); see Table 3 for details of the behavior of the bus pins.
                   6.6 TJA1082 flags
                            The TJA1082 has 11 status/error flags. These are described in Table 7.

                               The TJA1082 contains a 16-bit status register, of which bits S0 to S4 reflect the state of
                               the status flags, bits S5 to S10 reflect the state of the error flags and bit S15 is a parity bit.
                               All flags can be individually read out on pin SDO via a 16-bit SPI interface when the
                               transceiver is configured in SPI mode. The status register bits are described in Table 8.

                   6.8 Error signalling
                       The TJA1082 provides two modes for error indication:
                         • SPI mode (default mode)
                         • Simple error indication mode
                       SPI mode is active on power-up.
                       To switch to simple error indication mode, SCSN has to be held LOW (connected to GND)
                       and SCLK held HIGH (connected to VIO) for longer than tdet(L)(SCLK) (provided a VIO
                       undervoltage has not occurred).
                       When the TJA1082 is in simple error indication mode, a rising edge on SCSN initiates a
                       transition to SPI mode (provided a VIO undervoltage has not occurred).

                       If a VIO undervoltage condition is detected, it is not possible to switch between SPI mode
                       and simple error indication mode.
                6.8.1 SPI mode
                       The error flag information in the status register is latched in SPI mode. This means that
                       the status bit is reset once the status register has been completely read (provided the
                       corresponding error flag has been reset). If an error condition is detected in Normal mode,
                       pin ERRN goes LOW (provided one of the error bits, S5-S10, is set). Pin ERRN goes
                       HIGH again once all the error bits (S5-S10) have been reset.
                6.8.2 Simple error indication mode
                       If an error condition is detected in Normal mode, pin ERRN goes LOW once the relevant
                       error flag has been set. Pin ERRN goes HIGH again when all error conditions have been
                       cleared and all flags have been reset. Error flags are not latched. It is not possible to
                       read-out the status bits in this mode.
                   6.9 SPI interface
                       The TJA1082 includes a 16-bit SPI interface to enable a host to read the status register
                       when the transceiver is in SPI mode (see Section 6.8).
                       While pin SCSN is HIGH, the SDO output is in a high-impedance state. To begin a status
                       register readout, the host must force pin SCSN LOW. This causes the SDO pin to output a
                       LOW level by default. The data at pin SDO is then shifted out on the rising edge of the
                       clock signal on pin SCLK.
                       The status bits shifted out at SDO are active HIGH. The status bits are refreshed and pin
                       SDO returned to a high-impedance state once the status register has been read
                       successfully (after exactly 16 clock cycles) and SCSN has been forced HIGH again. Clock
                       signals on SCLK are ignored while SCSN is HIGH. The timing diagram for the SPI readout
                       is illustrated in Figure 12.
                       The SLCK period ranges from 500 ns to 100 s (10 kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s).

                         If SCSN remains LOW for longer than 16 clock cycles, it recognized as an SPI error.
                         When this happens, the SPI error flag is set and pin SDO goes to a high-impedance state
                         until the next falling edge on pin SCSN.
                         An SPI error is also assumed if fewer than 16 clock cycles are received while SCSN is
                         LOW. If this happens, the SPI error flag is set.
                         All status bits are refreshed once the status register has been successfully read.
                         When the transceiver is in simple error indication mode the SDO output is in a
                         high-impedance state and pin SCSN is in pull-down mode. In SPI mode pin SCSN is in
                         pull-up mode.
                         SPI readout is not possible when the transceiver has detected an undervoltage on VIO.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 13 and 14

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 19.
