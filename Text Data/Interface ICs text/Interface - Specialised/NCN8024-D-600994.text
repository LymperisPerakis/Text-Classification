PIN FUNCTION AND DESCRIPTION
 Pin #    Name     Type                                                Description
   11    CRD_I/O  Input/ This pin handles the connection to the serial I/O (C7) of the card connector. A bi−directional level
                  Output translator adapts the serial I/O signal between the card and the micro controller. An 11 kW (typical)
                         pullup resistor to CRD_VCC provides a High impedance state for the smart card I/O link.
   12   CRD_AUX2  Input/ This pin handles the connection to the chip card’s serial auxiliary AUX2 I/O pin (C8). A bi−directional
                  Output level translator adapts the serial I/O signal between the card and the micro controller. An 11 kW
                         (typical) pullup resistor to CRD_VCC provides a High impedance state for the smart card C8 pin.
   13   CRD_AUX1  Input/ This pin handles the connection to the chip card’s serial auxiliary AUX1 I/O pin (C4). A bi−directional
                  Output level translator adapts the serial I/O signal between the card and the micro controller. An 11 kW
                         (typical) pullup resistor to CRD_VCC provides a High impedance state for the smart card C4 pin.
   14   CRD_GND    GND   Card Ground
   15   CRD_CLK   Output This pin is connected to the CLOCK card connector’s pin (Chip card’s pin C3). The Clock signal
                         comes from the CLKIN input through clock dividers and level shifter.
   16   CRD_RST   Output This pin is connected to the chip card’s RESET pin (C2) through the card connector. A level
                         translator adapts the external Reset (RSTIN) signal to the smart card.
   17   CRD_VCC   Power  This pin is connected to the smart card power supply pin. An internal DC/DC converter is
                         programmable using the pin 5V/3V to supply either 5 V or 3 V output voltage. An external distributed
                         ceramic capacitor (200 nF + 330 nF typical recommended) must be connected across CRD_VCC
                         and CRD_GND. This set of capacitor (if distributed) must be low ESR (< 100 mW).
   18    PORADJ    Input Power−on reset threshold adjustment input pin for changing the reset threshold with an external
                         resistor power divider. Recommended to be connected to ground when unused.
   19    CMDVCC    Input Command VCC pin. Activation sequence Enable/Disable pin (active Low). The activation sequence is
                         enabled by toggling CMDVCC High to Low and when a card is present.
   20     RSTIN    Input This Reset input connected to the host and referred to VDD (microcontroller side), is connected to
                         the smart card Reset pin through the internal level shifter which translates the level according to the
                         CRD_VCC programmed value.
   21       VDD   Power  This pin is connected to the system controller power supply. It configures the level shifter input
                         stage to accept the signals coming from the controller. A 0.1 mF capacitor shall be used to bypass
                         the power supply voltage. When VDD is below 2.35 V typical the card pins are disabled.
   22      GND     GND   Ground
   23       INT   Output The interrupt request is activated LOW on this pin. This is enabled when a card is present and the
                         card presence is detected by CRD_PRES or CRD_PRES pins. Similarly an interrupt is generated
                         when CRD_VCC is overloaded. 20 kW typical integrated pullup resistor to VDD.

                         (typical) resistor provides a high impedance state.
   27    AUX1uc   Input/ This pin is connected to an external micro−controller. A bi−directional level translator adapts the
                  Output serial C4 signal between the smart card and the external controller. A built−in constant 11 kW
                         (typical) resistor provides a high impedance state.
   28    AUX2uc   Input/ This pin is connected to an external micro−controller. A bi−directional level translator adapts the
                  Output serial C8 signal between the smart card and the external controller. A built−in constant 11 kW
