     VDD        1, 4, 12, 9   Power supply. 1.2V supply voltage. The use of parallel 100pF and 10nF decoupling capacitors to
                              ground is recommended for each of these pins for broad high-frequency noise suppression.
   IN[P,N]          2, 3      Equalizer 1 differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least
                              6GHz frequency response is recommended.
   CP[A,B]          6, 7      Control pins for setting the equalizer. CMOS logic inputs. Pins are read as a 2-digit number to set
                              the boost level. Pins are internally pulled up and down through a 23k resistor.
  OUT[P,N]        11, 10      Equalizer differential output, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least
                              6GHz frequency response is recommended.
     LOS            14        LOS indicator. High output when equalized In signal is below DT threshold. Open drain output
                              internally pulled up to VDD with a 10k resistor.
      DT            15        Detection Threshold. Reference DC voltage threshold for input signal power detection. Data output
                              OUT is muted when the power of the equalized version of IN falls below the threshold. Tie to ground
                              to disable electrical idle preservation and always enable the limiting amplifier.

NOTES:
 1. After channel loss, differential amplitudes at QLx111GRx input must meet the input voltage range specified in “Absolute
    Maximum Ratings” on page 3.
 2. Temperature = +25°C, VDD = 1.2V.
 3. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted
    signal (as measured at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJpp + 14.1 x RJRMS.
 4. Measured using a PRBS 27-1 pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent,
    media-induced loss only.
 5. Rise and fall times measured using a 1GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.
 6. For active data mode, cable input amplitude is 300mVP-P (differential) or greater. For line silence mode, cable input amplitude
    is 20mVP-P (differential) or less.

QLx111GRx
Typical Performance Characteristics
Performance is measured using the test setup illustrated in Figure 1. The signal from the pattern generator is launched
into the twin-ax cable using an SMA adapter card. The chip evaluation board is connected to the output of the cable
through another adapter card. The QLx111GRx output signal is then visualized on a scope to determine signal integrity
parameters such as jitter (Note 7).

                  FIGURE 4. FUNCTIONAL DIAGRAM OF A SINGLE CHANNEL WITHIN THE QLx111GRx
Operation
The QLx111GRx is an advanced lane-extender for
high-speed interconnects. A functional diagram of
QLx111GRx is shown in Figure 4. In addition to a robust
equalization filter to compensate for channel loss and
restore signal fidelity, the QLx111GRx contains unique
integrated features to preserve special signaling
protocols typically broken by other equalizers. The signal
detect function is used to mute the channel output when
the equalized signal falls below the level determined by
the Detection Threshold (DT) pin voltage. This function is
intended to preserve periods of line silence (“quiescent
state” in InfiniBand contexts). Furthermore, the output of
the Signal Detect/DT comparator is used as a loss of
signal (LOS) indicator to indicate the absence of a
received signal.
As illustrated in Figure 4, the core of the high-speed          FIGURE 5. GAIN PROFILE FOR VARIOUS BOOST

                                              Line Silence/Quiescent Mode
                                              Line silence is commonly broken by the limiting
                                              amplification in other equalizers. This disruption can be
                                              detrimental in many systems that rely on line silence as
                                              part of the protocol. The QLx111GRx contains special
                                              lane management capabilities to detect and preserve
                                              periods of line silence while still providing the
                                              fidelity-enhancing benefits of limiting amplification during
                                              active data transmission. Line silence is detected by
                                              measuring the amplitude of the equalized signal and
                                              comparing that to a threshold set by the voltage at the
                                              DT pin. When the amplitude falls below the threshold, the
                                              output driver stage is muted.
                                              LOS Indicator
                                              Pin LOS is used to output the state of the muting circuitry
                                              to serve as a loss of signal indicator for the device. This
                                              signal is directly derived from the muting signal off the
                                              DT-threshold signal detector output. The LOS signal goes

                                              and LOW when the power goes above the DT threshold.
                                              This feature is meant to be used in optical systems (e.g.
                                              SFP+) where there are no quiescent or electrical-idle
                                              states. In these cases, the DT threshold is used to
                                              determine the sensitivity of the LOS indicator.
                                              Detection Threshold (DT) Pin Functionality
                                              The QLx111GRx is capable of maintaining periods of line
                                              silence by monitoring each channel for loss of signal
                                              (LOS) conditions and subsequently muting the outputs of
                                              a respective channel when such a condition is detected. A
                                              reference voltage applied to the detection threshold (DT)
                                              pin is used to set the LOS threshold of the internal signal
                                              detection circuitry. Voltage control on the DT pin is done
                                              via two external resistors. Both a pull-up and pull-down
                                              resistor are tied to the DT pin, with suggested values
                                              indicated in Figure 8. Other values of the resistors may
                                              also be applicable; therefore customers are advised to
                                              verify DT settings for their specific application.

ABOUT Q:ACTIVE®
Intersil has long realized that to enable the complex
server clusters of next generation datacenters, it is
critical to manage the signal integrity issues of electrical
interconnects. To address this, Intersil has developed its
groundbreaking Q:ACTIVE® product line. By integrating
its analog ICs inside cabling interconnects, Intersil is able
to achieve unsurpassed improvements in reach, power
consumption, latency, and cable gauge size as well as
increased airflow in tomorrow’s datacenters. This new
technology transforms passive cabling into intelligent
“roadways” that yield lower operating expenses and
capital expenditures for the expanding datacenter.
Intersil Lane Extenders allow greater reach over existing
cabling while reducing the need for thicker cables. This
significantly reduces cable weight and clutter, increases
airflow, and improves power consumption.
