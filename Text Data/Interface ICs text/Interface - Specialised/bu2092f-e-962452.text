      Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
      between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is operated
      over the absolute maximum ratings.

Power Dissipation
    Power dissipation(total loss) indicates the power that can be consumed by IC at TA=25°C(normal temperature). IC is heated
    when it consumed power, and the temperature of IC chip becomes higher than ambient temperature. The temperature that
    can be accepted by IC chip depends on circuit configuration, manufacturing process, and consumable power is limited.
    Power dissipation is determined by the temperature allowed in IC chip(maximum junction temperature) and thermal
    resistance of package(heat dissipation capability). The maximum junction temperature is typically equal to the maximum
    value in the storage temperature range. Heat generated by consumed power of IC radiates from the mold resin or lead
    frame of the package. The parameter which indicates this heat dissipation capability(hardness of heat release)is called
    thermal resistance, represented by the symbol θ JA (°C/W).The temperature of IC inside the package can be estimated by
    this thermal resistance. Figure 7 shows the model of thermal resistance of the package. Thermal resistance θJA, ambient
    temperature TA, maximum junction temperature TJmax, and power dissipation PD can be calculated by the equation below:
                              θJA = (TJmax - TA) / PD   (°C/W)
    Derating curve in Figure 8 indicates power that can be consumed by IC with reference to ambient temperature. Power that
    can be consumed by IC with reference to ambient temperature. Power that can be consumed by IC begins to attenuate at
    certain ambient temperature. This gradient is determined by thermal resistance θJA. Thermal resistance θJA depends on
    chip size, power consumption, package, ambient temperature, package condition, wind velocity, etc even when the same of
    package is used. Thermal reduction curve indicates a reference value measured at a specified condition.
                                                                                 0.8

Operational Notes
     1.   Reverse Connection of Power Supply
          Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
          connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
          supply pins.
     2.   Power Supply Lines
          Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the
          digital and analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog
          block. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and
          aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic capacitors.
     3.   Ground Voltage
          Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
     4.   Ground Wiring Pattern
          When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
          connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
          ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
          on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
     5.   Thermal Consideration
          Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
          deterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size
          and copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
     6.   Recommended Operating Conditions
          These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately
          obtained. The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
     7.   Inrush Current
          When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may
          flow instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
          supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring,
          and routing of connections.
     8.   Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
          Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
     9.   Testing on Application Boards
          When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
          subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
          should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
          process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
          transport and storage.
     10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
          Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
          damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
          Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment)
          and unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
     11. Unused Input Pins
          Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
          extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
          charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
          cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
          power supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
     12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
          In the construction of this IC, P-N junctions are inevitably formed creating parasitic diodes or transistors. The
          operation of these parasitic elements can result in mutual interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical
          damage. Therefore, conditions which cause these parasitic elements to operate, such as applying a voltage to an
          input pin lower than the ground voltage should be avoided. Furthermore, do not apply a voltage to the input pins
          when no power supply voltage is applied to the IC. Even if the power supply voltage is applied, make sure that the
          input pins have voltages within the values specified in the electrical characteristics of this IC.
     13. Ceramic Capacitor
          When using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with
          temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
     14. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
          Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe
          Operation (ASO).
