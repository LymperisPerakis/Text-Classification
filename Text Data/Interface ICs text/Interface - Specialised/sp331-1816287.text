Description
                                                                                       FEATURES
The SP331 is a programmable RS-232 and/or RS-485 transceiver IC.                       ■■ +5V Only Operation
The SP331 contains four drivers and four receivers when selected in                    ■■ Software Programmable RS-232 or
RS-232 mode; and two drivers and two receivers when selected in                           RS-485 Selection
                                                                                       ■■ Four RS-232 Transceivers in RS-232 Mode
RS-485 mode. The SP331 also contains a dual mode which has two
                                                                                       ■■ Two RS-485 Full-Duplex Transceivers in
RS-232 drivers/receivers plus one differential RS-485 driver/receiver.
                                                                                          RS-485 Mode
The RS-232 transceivers can typically operate at 230kbps while                         ■■ Two RS-232 Transceivers and One
adhering to the RS-232 specifications. The RS-485 transceiv-                              RS-485 Transceiver in Dual Mode
ers can operate up to 10Mbps while adhering to the RS-485                              ■■ Self-Testing Loopback Mode
specifications. The SP331 includes a self-test loopback mode where                     ■■ Full Driver Tri-State (Hi-Z) Control
the driver outputs are internally configured to the receiver inputs.                   ■■ Ideal for RS-232 to RS-485 conversion
This allows for easy diagnostic serial port testing without using an
external loopback plug. The RS-232 and RS-485 drivers can be disabled
(High-Z output) by controlling a set of four select pins.

specified. These drivers can also operate at least 120kbps.         receiver inputs are disconnected from the outside world.
                                                                    The driver outputs are in tri-state and the receiver inputs
When programmed to RS-485 mode, the differential RS-                are disabled. The input impedance of the receivers during
485 drivers produce complaint RS-485 signals. Each RS-              loopback is approximately 15kΩ to ground.
485 driver outputs a unipolar signal on each output pin with
a magnitude of at least 1.5V while loaded with a worst case
of 54Ω between the driver’s two output pins. The signal
levels and drive capability of the RS-485 drivers allow the
drivers to also comply with RS-422 levels. The transmission
rate for the differential drivers is 10Mbps.
Receivers
The SP331 has four single-ended receivers when
programmed for RS-232 mode and two differential receivers
when programmed for RS-485 mode.
Control for the mode selection is done via a 4–bit control
word, as in the drivers. As the operating mode of the
receivers is changed, the electrical characteristics will
change to support the requirements of the appropriate
serial standard. Unused receiver inputs can be left floating
without causing oscillation. To ensure a desired state of
the receiver output, a pull–up resistor of 100kΩ to +5V
should be connected to the inverting input for a logic low,
or the non–inverting input for a logic high. For single-ended
receivers, a pull–down resistor to ground of 5kΩ is internally
connected, which will ensure a logic high output.
