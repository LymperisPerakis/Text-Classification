8. Functional description
                            Remark: Throughout this document the ISO 7816 terminology conventions have been
                            adhered to and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with these.
                     8.1 Power supplies
                            The power supply voltage ranges are as follows:
                              • VDDP: 4.85 V to 5.5 V
                              • VDD: 2.7 V to 3.6 V
                            VDD should rise prior to VDDP or at the same time. VDDP should not rise before VDD.
                            All interface signals to the system controller are referenced to VDD(INTF). All card contacts
                            remain inactive during power up or power down. After powering up the device, pin OFFN
                            remains LOW until pin CMDVCCN is set HIGH and pin PRESN is LOW. During power
                            down, pin OFFN goes LOW when VDDP falls below the falling threshold voltage (Vth).
                            The internal oscillator frequency (fosc(int)) is only used during the activation sequences.
                            When the card is not activated (pin CMDVCCN is HIGH), the internal oscillator is in low
                            frequency mode to reduce power consumption.
                            This device has a Low Drop-Off (LDO) voltage regulator connected to pin VCC, and is
                            used instead of a DC-to-DC converter. It ensures a minimum VCC of 4.75 V and that the
                            power supply voltage on pin VDDP does not fall below 4.85 V for a maximum load current
                            of 65 mA.

                          Fig 3.      Voltage supervisor circuit
                       The voltage supervisor monitors the voltage of the VDDP and VDD supplies providing both
                       Power-On Reset (POR) and supply drop-out detection during a card session. The
                       supervisor threshold voltages for VDDP and VDD are set internally. As long as VDD is less
                       than Vth + Vhys, the IC remains inactive irrespective of the command line levels. After VDD
                       has reached a level higher than Vth + Vhys, the IC remains inactive for the duration of tw.
                       The output of the supervisor is sent to a digital controller in order to reset the
                       TDA8034T/TDA8034AT. This defined reset pulse of approximately 8 ms, i.e. (tw = 1024 
                       1⁄
                          fosc(int)low), is used internally to maintain the IC in the Shutdown mode during the supply
                       voltage power on; see Figure 4. A deactivation sequence is performed when either VDD or
                       VDDP falls below Vth.
                       Remark: fosc(int)low is the low frequency (or inactive) mode of the defined fosc(int)
                       parameter.

                       XTAL2. The TDA8034T/TDA8034AT automatically detects if an external clock is
                       connected to XTAL1, eliminating the need for a separate pin to select the clock source.
                       Automatic clock source detection is performed on each activation command (falling edge
                       of the signal on pin CMDVCCN). The presence of an external clock on pin XTAL1 is
                       checked during a time window defined by the internal oscillator. If a clock is detected, the
                       internal crystal oscillator is stopped. If a clock is not detected, the internal crystal oscillator
                       is started. When an external clock is used, it is mandatory that the clock is applied to pin
                       XTAL1 before the falling edge of the signal on pin CMDVCCN.
                                                                                          DIGITAL

                         Fig 5.    Basic layout for using an external clock
                       The clock frequency is selected using pin CLKDIV1 to be either 1⁄2 fxtal or 1⁄4 fxtal on
                       TDA8034T or fxtal or 1⁄2 fxtal on TDA8034AT as shown in Table 4.
                       The frequency change is synchronous and as such during transition, no pulse is shorter
                       than 45 % of the smallest period. In addition, only the first and last clock pulse around the
                       change has the correct width. When dynamically changing the frequency, the modification
                       is only effective after 10 clock periods on pin XTAL1.
                       The duty cycle of fxtal on pin CLK should be between 45 % and 55 %. If an external clock
                       is connected to pin XTAL1, its duty cycle must be between 48 % and 52 %.
                       When the frequency of the clock signal on pin CLK is either 1⁄2 fxtal or 1⁄4 fxtal on TDA8034T
                       or fxtal or 1⁄2 fxtal on TDA8034AT, the frequency dividers guarantee a duty cycle between
                       45 % and 55 %.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                        TDA8034T; TDA8034AT
                                                                                                                   Smart card interface
                   8.4 Input and output circuits
                       When pins I/O and I/OUC are pulled HIGH using an 11 k resistor between pins I/O and
                       VCC and/or between pins I/OUC and VDD(INTF), both lines enter the idle state. Pin I/O is
                       referenced to VCC and pin I/OUC to VDD(INTF), thus allowing operation at VCC  VDD(INTF).
                       The first side on which a falling edge occurs becomes the master. An anti-latch circuit
                       disables falling edge detection on the other line, making it the slave. After a time delay td,
                       the logic 0 present on the master-side is sent to the slave-side. When the master-side
                       returns logic 1, the slave-side sends logic 1 during time delay (tw(pu)). After this sequence,
                       both master and slave sides return to their idle states.
                       The active pull-up feature ensures fast LOW-to-HIGH transitions making the
                       TDA8034T/TDA8034AT capable of delivering more than 1 mA, up to an output voltage of
                       0.9VCC, at a load of 80 pF. At the end of the active pull-up pulse, the output voltage is
                       dependent on the internal pull-up resistor value and load current. The current sent to and
                       received from the card’s I/O lines is limited to 15 mA at a maximum frequency of 1 MHz.

                   8.5 Shutdown mode
                       After a power-on reset, if pin CMDVCCN is HIGH, the circuit enters the Shutdown mode,
                       ensuring only the minimum number of circuits are active while the TDA8034T/TDA8034AT
                       waits for the microcontroller to start a session.
                         • all card contacts are inactive. The impedance between the contacts and GND is
                           approximately 200 .
                         • pin I/OUC is high-impedance using the 11 k pull-up resistor connected to VDD(INTF)
                         • the voltage generators are stopped
                         • the voltage supervisor is active
                         • the internal oscillator runs at its lowest frequency (fosc(int)low)
                   8.6 Activation sequence
                       The following device activation sequence is applied when using an external clock; see
                       Figure 6:
                        1. Pin CMDVCCN is pulled LOW (t0).
                        2. The internal oscillator is triggered (t0).
                        3. The internal oscillator changes to high frequency (t1).
                        4. VCC rises from either 0 V to 3 V or 0 V to 5 V on a controlled slope (t2).
                        5. Pin I/O is driven HIGH (t3).
                        6. The clock on pin CLK is applied to the C3 contact (t4).
                        7. Pin RST is enabled (t5).
                       Calculation of the time delays is as follows:
                         • t1 = t0 + 384  1⁄fosc(int)low
                         • t2 = t1
                         • t3 = t1 + 17T / 2
                         • t4 = driven by host controller; > t3 and < t5
                         • t5 = t1 + 23T / 2
                       Remark: The value of period T is 64 times the period interval of the internal oscillator at
                       high frequency (1⁄fosc(int)high); t3 is called td(start) and t5 is called td(end).

                   8.7 Deactivation sequence
                       When a session ends, the microcontroller sets pin CMDVCCN HIGH. The
                       TDA8034T/TDA8034AT then executes an automatic deactivation sequence by counting
                       the sequencer back to the inactive state (see Figure 7) as follows:
                        1. Pin RST is pulled LOW (t11).
                        2. The clock is stopped, pin CLK is LOW (t12).
                        3. Pin I/O is pulled LOW (t13).
                        4. VCC falls to 0 V (t14). The deactivation sequence is completed when VCC reaches its
                             inactive state.
                        5. VCC < 0.4 V (tdeac)
                        6. All card contacts become low-impedance to GND. However, pin I/OUC remains pulled
                             up to VDD using the 11 k resistor.
                        7. The internal oscillator returns to its low frequency mode.
                       Calculation of the time delays is as follows:
                         •   t11 = t10 + 3T / 64
                         •   t12 = t11 + T / 2
                         •   t13 = t11 + T
                         •   t14 = t11 + 3T / 2
                         •   tdeac = t11 + 3T / 2 + VCC fall time

                       The VCC buffer is able to continuously deliver up to 65 mA at VCC = 5 V or 3 V.
                       The VCC buffer has an internal overload protection with a threshold value of approximately
                       120 mA. This detection is internally filtered, enabling spurious current pulses up to
                       200 mA with a duration of a few milliseconds to be drawn by the card without causing
                       deactivation. However, the average current value must stay below maximum; see Table 8.
                   8.9 Fault detection
                       The following conditions are monitored by the fault detection circuit:
                         • Short-circuit or high current on pin VCC
                         • Card removal during transaction
                         • VDDP falling
                         • VDD falling
                         • VDD(INTF) falling
                         • Overheating
                       Fault detection monitors two different situations:
                         • Outside card sessions, pin CMDVCCN is HIGH: pin OFFN is LOW if the card is not in
                           the reader and HIGH if the card is in the reader. Any voltage drop on VDD is detected
                           by the voltage supervisor. This generates an internal power-on reset pulse but does
                           not act upon the pin OFFN signal. The card is not powered-up and short-circuits or
                           overheating are not detected.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                     TDA8034T; TDA8034AT
                                                                                                                      Smart card interface
                     • In card sessions, pin CMDVCCN is LOW: when pin OFFN goes LOW, the fault
                         detection circuit triggers the automatic emergency deactivation sequence (see
                         Figure 8). When the microcontroller resets pin CMDVCCN to HIGH, after the
                         deactivation sequence, pin OFFN is rechecked. If the card is still present, pin OFFN
                         returns to HIGH. This check identifies the fault as either a hardware problem or a card
                         removal incident.
                   On card insertion or removal, bouncing can occur in the PRESN signal. This depends on
                   the type of card presence switch in the connector (normally open or normally closed) and
                   the mechanical characteristics of the switch. To correct for this, a debouncing feature is
                   integrated in to the TDA8034T/TDA8034AT. This feature operates at a typical duration of
                   4.5 ms (tdeb = 640  (1⁄fosc(int)low). Figure 9 on page 13 shows the operation of the
                   debouncing feature.
                   On card insertion, pin OFFN goes HIGH after the debounce time has elapsed. When the
                   card is extracted, the automatic card deactivation sequence is performed on the first
                   HIGH/LOW transition on pin PRESN. After this, pin OFFN goes LOW.

                   8.10 Automatic determining of card supply voltage
                            The supply voltage (VCC) that the card requires is determined automatically by monitoring
                            the duration of the HIGH state (logic 1) on pin CMDVCCN before the activation command
                            (CMDVCCN falling edge) occurs. If pin CMDVCCN stays HIGH for more than 30 ms,
                            activation occurs with VCC set to 5 V. If pin CMDVCCN stays HIGH for less than 15 ms,
                            activation occurs with VCC set to 3 V.
                            To activate the card at VCC = 5 V, pin CMDVCCN must stay HIGH for t0 > 30 ms before
                            going LOW (logic 0).

                              activated at 3 V, the sequence shown in Figure 12 applies: pin CMDVCCN must be set
                              LOW for t1 (200 s < t1 < 700 s), and then HIGH for t2 (200 s < t2 < 15 ms) before
                              going LOW.
9. Limiting values
                              Remark: All card contacts are protected against any short-circuit to any other card
                              contact. Stress beyond the levels indicated in Table 5 can cause permanent damage to
                              the device. This is a short-term stress rating only and under no circumstances implies
                              functional operation under long-term stress conditions.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                        This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                        of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                        soldering description”.
                   14.1 Introduction to soldering
                        Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                        Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                        the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                        ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                        Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                        suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                        densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                   14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                        Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                        a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                          • Through-hole components
                          • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                        Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                        packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                        leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                        due to an increased probability of bridging.
                        The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                        component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                        packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                        Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                          • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                          • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                          • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                          • Package placement
                          • Inspection and repair
                          • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                   14.3 Wave soldering
                        Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                          • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                            transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                            exposed to the wave
                          • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                   14.4 Reflow soldering
                        Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                          • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                             higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 16) than a SnPb process, thus
                             reducing the process window
                          • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                             window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                          • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                             heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                             temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                             characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                             packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                             depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                             Table 10 and 11
