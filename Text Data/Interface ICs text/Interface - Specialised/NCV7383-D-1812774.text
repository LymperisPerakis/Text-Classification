A remote wakeup will be also detected if NCV7383 receives a full FlexRay frame at 10 Mbit/s with the following payload data:
  0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
  0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF
The wakeup pattern, the alternative wakeup pattern and the wakeup frame lead to identical wakeup treatment and signaling.
