8. Functional description
                               Remark: Throughout this document the ISO 7816 terminology conventions have been
                               adhered to and it is assumed that the reader is familiar with these.
                       8.1 Power supplies
                               The power supply voltage ranges are as follows:
                                 • VDDP: 4.85 V to 5.5 V when VCC_SEL2 is HIGH (VCC = 5 V)
                                 • VDDP: 3 V to 5.5 V when VCC_SEL2 is LOW (VCC = 3 V) or when VCC_SEL1 is LOW
                                     (VCC = 1.8 V)
                                 • VDD: 2.7 V to 3.6 V
                               All interface signals to the system controller are referenced to VDD(INTF). All card contacts
                               remain inactive during power up or power down. After powering up the device, pin OFFN
                               remains LOW until pin CMDVCCN is set HIGH and pin PRESN is LOW. During power
                               down, pin OFFN goes LOW when VDDP falls below the falling threshold voltage (Vth).
                               The internal oscillator frequency (fosc(int)) is only used during the activation sequences.
                               When the card is not activated (pin CMDVCCN is HIGH), the internal oscillator is in low
                               frequency mode to reduce power consumption.
                               This device has a Low Drop-Off (LDO) voltage regulator connected to pin VCC, and is
                               used instead of a DC-to-DC converter. It ensures a minimum VCC of 4.75 V and that the
                               power supply voltage on pin VDDP does not fall below 4.85 V when pin VCC_SEL2 is
                               HIGH, for a maximum load current of 65 mA.

                       In case the 3 power supply VDD, VDDP, VDD(INTF) are connected together (VDD
                       =VDDP= VDD(INTF)) and if the power up slope is faster than 1ms (10%-90% slope<1ms),
                       a deep shutdown sequence must be performed once the supplies have reached steady
                       state; this means CMDVCCN is set high while VCC_SEL1 and VCC_SEL2 forced to low
                       level (see Section 8.6 “Deep shutdown mode”).

                         Fig 3.   Voltage supervisor circuit
                       The voltage supervisor monitors the voltage of the VDDP, VDD and VDD(INTF) supplies
                       providing both Power-On Reset (POR) and supply drop-out detection during a card
                       session. The supervisor threshold voltages for VDDP and VDD are set internally, and for
                       VDD(INTF) externally by pin PORADJ. As long as VDD is less than Vth + Vhys, the IC remains
                       inactive irrespective of the command line levels. After VDD has reached a level higher than
                       Vth + Vhys, the IC remains inactive for the duration of tw. The output of the supervisor is
                       sent to a digital controller in order to reset the TDA8034HN. This defined reset pulse of
                       approximately 8 ms, i.e. (tw = 1024  1⁄fosc(int)low), is used internally to maintain the IC in
                       the Shutdown mode during the supply voltage power on; see Figure 4. A deactivation
                       sequence is performed when either VDD, VDDP or VDD(INTF) falls below Vth.
                       Remark: fosc(int)low is the low frequency (or inactive) mode of the defined fosc(int)
                       parameter.

                   8.3 Clock circuits
                       The clock signal from pin CLK to the card is either supplied by an external clock signal
                       connected to pin XTAL1 or generated using a crystal connected between pins XTAL1 and
                       XTAL2. The TDA8034HN automatically detects if an external clock is connected to
                       XTAL1, eliminating the need for a separate pin to select the clock source.
                       Automatic clock source detection is performed on each activation command (falling edge
                       of the signal on pin CMDVCCN). The presence of an external clock on pin XTAL1 is
                       checked during a time window defined by the internal oscillator. If a clock is detected, the
                       internal crystal oscillator is stopped. If a clock is not detected, the internal crystal oscillator
                       is started. When an external clock is used, it is mandatory that the clock is applied to pin
                       XTAL1 before the falling edge of the signal on pin CMDVCCN.
                                                                                           DIGITAL
                                                                                enclkin                    clkxtal
                                                                                                    MULTIPLEXER
                                                                                                           CRYSTAL
                                                                                                XTAL1               XTAL2
                                                                                                                        001aak992
                                    enclkin and clkxtal are internal signal names.
                         Fig 5.     Basic layout for using an external clock
                       The clock frequency is selected using pins CLKDIV1 and CLKDIV1 to be either fxtal, 1⁄2 fxtal
                       or 1⁄4 fxtal or 1⁄8 fxtal as shown in Table 4.
                       Remark: The levels on both pins must not be allowed to change simultaneously but
                       should be separated by a minimum of 10 ns.
                       The frequency change is synchronous and as such during transition, no pulse is shorter
                       than 45 % of the smallest period. In addition, only the first and last clock pulse around the
                       change has the correct width. When dynamically changing the frequency, the modification
                       is only effective after 10 clock periods on pin XTAL1.
                       The duty cycle of fxtal on pin CLK should be between 45 % and 55 %. If an external clock
                       is connected to pin XTAL1, its duty cycle must be between 48 % and 52 %.

                       referenced to VCC and pin I/OUC to VDD(INTF), thus allowing operation at VCC  VDD(INTF).
                       The first side on which a falling edge occurs becomes the master. An anti-latch circuit
                       disables falling edge detection on the other line, making it the slave. After a time delay td,
                       the logic 0 present on the master-side is sent to the slave-side. When the master-side
                       returns logic 1, the slave-side sends logic 1 during time delay (tw(pu)). After this sequence,
                       both master and slave sides return to their idle states.
                       The active pull-up feature ensures fast LOW-to-HIGH transitions making the TDA8034HN
                       capable of delivering more than 1 mA, up to an output voltage of 0.9VCC, at a load of
                       80 pF. At the end of the active pull-up pulse, the output voltage is dependent on the
                       internal pull-up resistor value and load current. The current sent to and received from the
                       card’s I/O lines is limited to 15 mA at a maximum frequency of 1 MHz.
                   8.5 Shutdown mode
                       After a power-on reset, if pin CMDVCCN is HIGH, the circuit enters the Shutdown mode,
                       ensuring only the minimum number of circuits are active while the TDA8034HN waits for
                       the microcontroller to start a session.
                          • all card contacts are inactive. The impedance between the contacts and GND is
                            approximately 200 .
                          • pins I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are high-impedance using the 11 k pull-up
                            resistor connected to VDD(INTF)
                          • the voltage generators are stopped
                          • the voltage supervisor is active
                          • the internal oscillator runs at its lowest frequency (fosc(int)low)
                   8.6 Deep shutdown mode
                       When the smart card reader is inactive, the TDA8034HN will enter Deep shutdown mode
                       if pin CMDVCCN is forced HIGH and pins VCC_SEL1 and VCC_SEL2 are LOW. In Deep
                       shutdown mode, all circuits are disabled and pin OFFN follows the status of pin PRESN.
                       Changing the status of either pin CMDVCCN, VCC_SEL1 or VCC_SEL2 exits Deep
                       shutdown mode; see Figure 6.

                   8.7 Activation sequence
                       The following device activation sequence is applied when using an external clock; see
                       Figure 7:
                        1. Pin CMDVCCN is pulled LOW (t0).
                        2. The internal oscillator is triggered (t0).
                        3. The internal oscillator changes to high frequency (t1).
                        4. VCC rises from either 0 V to 3 V or 0 V to 5 V on a controlled slope (t2).
                        5. Pins I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are driven HIGH (t3).
                        6. The clock on pin CLK is applied to the C3 contact (t4).
                        7. Pin RST is enabled (t5).
                       Calculation of the time delays is as follows:
                         •    t1 = t0 + 384  1⁄fosc(int)low
                         •    t2 = t1
                         •    t3 = t1 + 17T / 2
                         •    t4 = driven by host controller; > t3 and < t5
                         •    t5 = t1 + 23T / 2
                       Remark: The value of period T is 64 times the period interval of the internal oscillator at
                       high frequency (1⁄fosc(int)high); t3 is called td(start) and t5 is called td(end).

                   8.8 Deactivation sequence
                       When a session ends, the microcontroller sets pin CMDVCCN HIGH. The TDA8034HN
                       then executes an automatic deactivation sequence by counting the sequencer back to the
                       inactive state (see Figure 8) as follows:
                        1. Pin RST is pulled LOW (t11).
                        2. The clock is stopped, pin CLK is LOW (t12).
                        3. Pins I/OUC, AUX1UC and AUX2UC are pulled LOW (t13).
                        4. VCC falls to 0 V (t14). The deactivation sequence is completed when VCC reaches its
                             inactive state.
                        5. VCC < 0.4 V (tdeac)
                        6. All card contacts become low-impedance to GND. However, pins I/OUC, AUX1UC
                             and AUX2UC remain pulled up to VDD using the 11 k resistor.
                        7. The internal oscillator returns to its low frequency mode.
                       Calculation of the time delays is as follows:
                         •   t11 = t10 + 3T / 64
                         •   t12 = t11 + T / 2
                         •   t13 = t11 + T
                         •   t14 = t11 + 3T / 2
                         •   tdeac = t11 + 3T / 2 + VCC fall time

                   8.9 VCC regulator
                       The VCC buffer is able to continuously deliver up to 65 mA at VCC = 5 V, 3 V, or 1.8 V.
                       The VCC buffer has an internal overload protection with a threshold value of approximately
                       120 mA. This detection is internally filtered, enabling spurious current pulses up to
                       200 mA with a duration of a few milliseconds to be drawn by the card without causing
                       deactivation. However, the average current value must stay below maximum; see Table 8.
                8.10 Fault detection
                       The following conditions are monitored by the fault detection circuit:
                         • Short-circuit or high current on pin VCC
                         • Card removal during transaction
                         • VDDP falling
                         • VDD falling
                         • VDD(INTF) falling
                         • Overheating
                       Fault detection monitors two different situations:
                         • Outside card sessions, pin CMDVCCN is HIGH: pin OFFN is LOW if the card is not in
                           the reader and HIGH if the card is in the reader. Any voltage drop on VDD is detected
                           by the voltage supervisor. This generates an internal power-on reset pulse but does
                           not act upon the pin OFFN signal. The card is not powered-up and short-circuits or
                           overheating are not detected.

                     • In card sessions, pin CMDVCCN is LOW: when pin OFFN goes LOW, the fault
                         detection circuit triggers the automatic emergency deactivation sequence (see
                         Figure 9). When the microcontroller resets pin CMDVCCN to HIGH, after the
                         deactivation sequence, pin OFFN is rechecked. If the card is still present, pin OFFN
                         returns to HIGH. This check identifies the fault as either a hardware problem or a card
                         removal incident.
                   On card insertion or removal, bouncing can occur in the PRESN signal. This depends on
                   the type of card presence switch in the connector (normally open or normally closed) and
                   the mechanical characteristics of the switch. To correct for this, a debouncing feature is
                   integrated in to the TDA8034HN. This feature operates at a typical duration of 8 ms
                   (tdeb = 640  (1⁄fosc(int)low). Figure 10 on page 14 shows the operation of the debouncing
                   feature.
                   On card insertion, pin OFFN goes HIGH after the debounce time has elapsed. When the
                   card is extracted, the automatic card deactivation sequence is performed on the first
                   HIGH/LOW transition on pin PRESN. After this, pin OFFN goes LOW.

                            Remark: All card contacts are protected against any short-circuit to any other card
                            contact. Stress beyond the levels indicated in Table 5 can cause permanent damage to
                            the device. This is a short-term stress rating only and under no circumstances implies
                            functional operation under long-term stress conditions.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                                                                                                                  Low power smart card interface
                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 14) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 10 and 11

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 14.
