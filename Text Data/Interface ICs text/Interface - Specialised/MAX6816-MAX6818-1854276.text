The major difference between tests done using the Human
Body Model and IEC 1000-4-2 is higher peak current in
IEC 1000-4-2, because series resistance is lower in the
IEC 1000-4-2 model. Hence, the ESD withstand volt-
age measured to IEC 1000-4-2 is generally lower than
that measured using the Human Body Model. Figure 7a
