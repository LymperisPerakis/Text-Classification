System Interface (DSI) Physical                                                              33790
Interface Device
The 33790 is a dual channel physical layer interface IC for the
Distributed System Interface (DSI) bus. It is designed to meet               DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM INTERFACE (DSI)
automotive requirements. It can also be used in non automotive
applications. It supports bidirectional communication between slave
and master ICs. Some slave devices derive a regulated 5.0 V from
the bus, which can be used to power sensors, thereby eliminating the
need for additional circuitry and wiring. This device is powered by
SMARTMOS technology.

    1. R = 0 
    2. Pin soldering temperature limit is for 10 seconds maximum duration. Not designed for immersion soldering. Exceeding these limits may
        cause malfunction or permanent damage to the device.
    3. Freescale’s Package Reflow capability meets Pb-free requirements for JEDEC standard J-STD-020C. For Peak Package Reflow
        Temperature and Moisture Sensitivity Levels (MSL),
        Go to www.freescale.com, search by part number [e.g. remove prefixes/suffixes and enter the core ID to view all orderable parts. (i.e.
        MC33xxxD enter 33xxx), and review parametrics.
    4. ESD1 performed in accordance with the Human Body Model (CZAP = 100 pF, RZAP = 1500 ), ESD2 performed in accordance with the

The 33790 is designed to provide the interface between logic       to the bus current being above (Logic [1] out) the bus return
and the DSI bus. It accepts signals with a typical 0 V to 5.0 V    logic [1] current or below (Logic [0] out). The 33790 contains
logic level to control the state of the bus output (Idle Level,    current limiting of the bus outputs as required by the DSI Bus
Logic High Level, Logic Low Level, and High Impedance). It         specification and thermal shutdown to protect itself from

signaling and outputs a 0 V to 5.0 V logic level corresponding     the IC.
