 POWER SUPPLY
      30           VDD24     24V Field Supply. Bypass to GND with 0.1μF capacitor in parallel with 1μF capacitor.
                             3.3V output from integrated LDO when powered from VDD24, or 3.0 - 5.5V supply input when
      31           VDD3      VDD24 not driven. Bypass to GND with 0.1μF capacitor in parallel with 1μF capacitor. If powering
                             VDD3 from an external supply, leave VDD24 floating. VDD3 output is turned off during thermal shutdown.

                             Exposed Pad. Connect to GND. Solder entire exposed pad area to ground plane with multiple vias
      EP              -
                             for best thermal performance. EP = exposed pad on the back of the package
 ANALOG PINS
                             Connect EXTVM to GND to use internal thresholds (14V, typical) for VDD24 voltage monitoring.
                             Connect EXTVM to external resistive divider to set external thresholds for VDD24 voltage monitoring.
      27          EXTVM
                             Connect EXTVM to VDD3 to disable VDD24 voltage monitoring at READY pin if the device is powered
                             by VDD3.
                             Digital Input Current-Limit Reference Resistor. For 24V Type 1 and Type 3 inputs, place a 8.6kΩ
      26           REFDI
                             resistor from REFDI to GND. For Type 2 inputs, place a 5.2kΩ resistor from REFDI to GND.
 FIELD INPUTS PINS
  1,3,5,7,18,     IN1-IN8    Field Inputs. For 24V Type 1 and Type 3 inputs, place a 1.5kΩ MELF resistor between the field input
