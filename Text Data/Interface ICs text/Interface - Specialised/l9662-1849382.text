1. For PSI5 the maximum operating voltage is 16.5V as called out in the PSI5 technical specification (V 1.2 /14.06.07).
   Depending on the sync supply voltage the sync pulse can be as high as 8 V above idle. To ensure the maximum operating
   voltage of 16.5 V is not exceeded then the VSATS voltage should be limited to 8.5 V.

   time, and minimum capacitance on MISO is the worst case for output hold time.

3           Functional description
3.1         Overview
            The device is an integrated circuit to be used in air bag systems. Its main functions include
            deployment of air bags and switched-power sources to satellite sensors. The device
            supports 8 deployment loops and 4 satellite-sensor interfaces.
3.2         General functions
3.2.1       Power on reset (POR)
            The ASIC has a power on reset (POR) circuit, which monitors VDD voltage. When VDD
            voltage falls below VRST1 for longer than or equal to tPOR, all outputs are disabled and all
            internal registers are reset to their default condition. A second reset level, VRST2, also
            monitors VDD but uses no filter time and will disable all outputs and all internal registers are
            reset to their default condition when VDD falls below the reset threshold.

3.2.2       RESETB
            The RESETB pin is active low. The effects of RESETB are similar to those of a POR event,
            except during a deployment. When a deployment is in-progress, the ASIC will ignore the
            RESETB signal.
            However, it shall shut itself down as soon as it detects a POR condition. When the
            deployment is completed and RESETB signal is asserted, the device disables its outputs
            and reset its internal registers to their default states.
           A de-glitch timer is provided for the RESETB pin. The timer protects this pin against
            spurious glitches. The ASIC neglects RESETB signal if it is asserted for shorter than
            tGLITCH. RESETB has an internal pull-up in case of an open circuit.

L9662                                                                         Functional description
3.2.3 Reference resistor
      IREF pin shall be connected to VDD supply through a resistor, RIREF. When the device
      detects the resistor on IREF pin is larger than RIREF_H or smaller than RIREF_L, it goes
      into a reset condition. All outputs are disabled and all internal registers are reset to their
      default conditions.
3.2.4 Loss of ground
      GND
      When the GND pin is disconnected from PC-board ground, the ASIC goes in reset
      condition. All outputs are disabled and all internal registers are reset to their default
      conditions.
      GND0-GND7
      A loss of power-ground (GND0 – GND7) pin/s disables the respective low side driver/s on
      SQLx. However, the high side driver of the respective channel will still be able to be turned
      on. Thus under the scenario where the low side is shorted to ground the device will be able
      to provide the programmed firing current for the specified time.
      An open GNDx connection on any channel has no affect on the other channels. An open
      GNDx condition will be detected using the low side MOS diagnostics.
      AGND
      The AGND pin is a reference for AOUT pin. When AGND loses its connection, the voltage
      on AOUT pin is pulled up to VDD voltage. The rest of functionality and parametric is not
      affected by a loss of AGND condition.
3.2.5 VRESx capacitance
      To ensure all diagnostics function properly a typical capacitor of equal to or greater than
      68nF is required for every 4 VRESx pins and located close to the supply pins. Thus a
      capacitor will be placed close to the VRES0, 1,2, and 3 pins and a second capacitor will be
      close to the VRES4, 5,6, and 7 pins.
3.2.6 Supply voltages
      The primary current sources for the different functions of the ASIC are as follows:
           VRESx - Firing currents along with HSS and HS FET diagnostic currents
           VSDIAG - Squib resistance and HSS diagnostics
           VSATS - Voltage and current necessary for satellite operation excluding period during
            sync pulse
           VSYNC - Sync pulse voltage
           VDD will be used for all internal functions as well as short to battery/ground and high
            squib resistance diagnostics.
3.2.7 Ground connections
      The GND pins (6, 38, and 45) are all common internal to the ASIC. A ground plane is
      needed to directly connect the GND pins together so that low impedance is maintained
      between the two pins. This ground plane needs to be isolated from the high current ground
      for the squib drivers to prevent voltage shifts.

3.3         Serial peripheral interface (SPI)
            The device contains 2 serial peripheral interfaces for control of the satellite and squib
            functions. The 2 SPI interfaces are completely independent from each other and can be
            accessed simultaneously. The following table shows the distribution of features that are
            accessed/controlled for each of the SPIs
              .

            The software reset accessed over SPI1 will not only reset squib functions but all the satellite
            functions. The device has a counter to verify the number of clocks in SCLK and SCLK_S.
            L9662 computes SPI error length flag by counting the number of SCLK/SCLK_S rising
            edges occurring when CS_D/CS_S is active. If the number of clocks in SCLK is not equal to
            16 clocks while CS_D is asserted, it ignores the SPI message and sends a SPI fault
            response. If the number of clocks in SCLK_S is not equal to 80 clocks while CS_S is
            asserted it ignores the entire SPI message and a fault will be reported in the SR frame. The
            MISO output on SPI1 shall hold the 16th bit’s state for SCLK rising edges greater than 16
            when CS_D is active, similarly the MISO output on SPI2 shall hold the 80th bit’s state for
            SCLK_S rising edges greater than 80 when CS_S is active.
3.3.1       SPI pin descriptions
            Chip select (CS_D, CS_S)
            Chip-select inputs select the device for serial transfers. CS_D or CS_S can be asserted at
            any given time and are active low. Both CS_D and CS_S inputs can be selected
            simultaneously. When chip-select is asserted, the respective MISO/MISO_S pin is released
            from tri-state mode, and all status information is latched into the SPI shift register. While
            chip-select is asserted, register data is shifted into MOSI/MOSI_S pin and shifted out of
            MISO/MISO_S pin on each subsequent SCLK/ SCLK_S. When chip-select is negated,
            MISO/MISO_S pin is tri-stated. To allow sufficient time to reload the registers chip-select pin
            shall remain negated for at least tCSN. The chip-select inputs have current sinks which pull
            these pins to the negated state when there is an open circuit condition. These pins have
            TTL level compatible input voltages allowing proper operation with microprocessors using a
            3.3 to 5.0 volt supply.
            Serial clock (SCLK, SCLK_S)
            SCLK/SCLK_S input is the clock signal input for synchronization of serial data transfer. This
            pin has TTL level compatible input voltages allowing proper operation with microprocessors

L9662                                                                          Functional description
      using a 3.3 to 5.0 volt supply. When chip select is asserted, both the SPI master and this
      device shall latch input data on the rising edge of SCLK/SCLK_S. The ASIC shifts data out
      on the falling edge of SCLK/SCLK_S.
      Serial data output (MISO, MISO_S)
      MISO/MISO_S output pins shall be in a tri-state condition when chip select is negated.
      When chip select is asserted, the MSB is the first bit of the word/byte transmitted on
      MISO/MISO_S and the LSB is the last bit of the word/byte transmitted. This pin supplies a
      rail to rail output, so if interfaced to a microprocessor that is using a lower VDD supply, the
      appropriate microprocessor input pin shall not sink more than IOH(min) and shall not clamp
      the MISO/MISO_S output voltage to less than VOH(min) while MISO/MISO_S pin is in a
      logic “1” state.
      Serial data input (MOSI, MOSI_S)
      MOSI/MOSI_S inputs take data from the master processor while chip select is asserted.
      The MSB shall be the first bit of each word/byte received on MOSI/MOSI_S and the LSB
      shall be the last bit of each word/byte received.
      This pin has TTL level compatible input voltages allowing proper operation with
      microprocessors using a 3.3 to 5.0 volt supply.
3.4   Squib drivers
3.4.1 Firing
      The on-chip deployment drivers are designed to deliver 1.2 A (min) for 2 ms (min) and
      1.75 A (min) for 1 ms (min) with VRESx voltages between 7 V and 37 V. In addition the
      device can provide 1.5 A minimum for 2 ms for VRESx voltages between 7 V and 25 V. The
      firing condition is selectable via the SPI. At the end of a deployment, a deploy success flag
      is asserted and can be read using the appropriate SPI command. Each VRESx and GNDx
      connection is used to accommodate 8 loops that can be deployed simultaneously.
      Upon receiving a valid deployment condition, the respective SQHx and SQLx drivers are
      turned on. The only other activation of the SQHx and SQLx drivers is momentarily during a
      MOS diagnostic. Otherwise, SQHx and SQLx are inactive under any normal, fault, or
      transient conditions. Upon a successful deployment of the respective SQHx and SQLx
      drivers, a deploy command success flag is asserted via SPI. Refer to Figure 8 for the valid
      conditions and the deploy success flag timing.

      The ASIC shall be protected against inadvertent turn on of the firing drivers unless the
      appropriate conditions are present. Non-typical conditions shall not cause driver activation.
      This includes the case where VRESx and/or VSDIAG pins are connected to a supply up to
      40V and VDD is between 0V and VDD min. Under these conditions the device shall ensure
      that driver activation will not occur. No flow of current shall be allowed through the SQHx
      and SQLx pins.
      Driver activation
      The firing of a squib driver requires the appropriate FEN function to be active and two
      separate sixteen bit writes to be made over the SPI1. The FEN function is defined as the
      result of the FENx pin OR’d with the internal FENx latch. The FENx pin going high initiates
      the FEN function. With the FEN 1 function being active and the appropriate Arm and Fire
      commands sent then Squib_1 & 2 drivers would be activated. With the FEN 2 function being
      active and the appropriate Arm and Fire commands sent then Squib_3 & 4 drivers would be
      activated.
      With the FEN 3 function being active and the appropriate Arm and Fire commands sent then
      Squib_5 & 6 drivers would be activated. With the FEN 4 function being active and the
      appropriate Arm and Fire commands sent then Squib_7 & 8 drivers would be activated.
      The first write is to ARM the drivers in preparation of receiving the fire command. The Arm
      command will stop on all channels any diagnostics that are active. Any combination of
      squibs can be armed. The second write is to actually activate the desired driver pairs. If
      there is a parity mismatch the data bits will be ignored and the squib drivers will not have
      their status changed, and the two write sequence must then be started again. If there is a
      mismatch in channels selected then only those channels selected in both the Arm and Fire
      commands will be activated.
      During the first write, when the drivers are armed, all diagnostic functions are cleared. The
      FIRE command must follow the ARM command along with the FEN function active in order
      for driver activation. If a command is between the ARM and FIRE command then the
      sequence must be restarted. An error response shall be received for the Fire command if
      the ARM/FIRE sequence is not followed.
      The ARM/FIRE commands and FEN function are independent from each other. The device
      shall begin the tDEPLOY timer once a valid ARM/FIRE sequence has been received. If a valid
      ARM/FIRE command has been sent and the FEN function is inactive then the drivers will
      not be activated but the tDEPLOY timer shall start. If the FEN function becomes active before
      tDEPLOY has expired then the drivers will become active for the full tDEPLOY time. If the FEN
      does not become active before tDEPLOY has expired then the sequence would need to be
      restarted. A diagram illustrating this is shown in Figure 8

            Only the channels selected in the ARM and, directly following, the FIRE command will be
            able to be activated.
            By reading the appropriate registers a status of the deployment is provided. If a valid
           Arm/Fire sequence has been provided the status flag will become active. This flag shall
            remain active for as long as the TDEPLOY timer is counting. Depending on the state of the
            FEN function the DEPLOY_STATUS flag will be active a minimum of TDEPLOY and a
            maximum of 2 x TDEPLOY. If driver activation did occur (both a valid Arm/Fire sequence
            and the appropriate FEN function active within the appropriate time) then the
            DEPLOY_SUCCESS flag will be active. This flag will be active until cleared by software. If a
            valid Arm/Fire sequence did occur but the FEN function was never activated within the
            TDEPLOY time then the DEPLOY_SUCCESS flag will remain ‘0’.
            During driver activation the respective high side (SQHx) and low side (SQLx) drivers will
            turn on for tDEPLOY.
            Device driver activation will not occur or, if firing is in process, will terminate under the
            following conditions:
                 Power On Reset (POR)
                 IREF resistance is larger than RIREF_H or smaller than RIREF_L
                 Loss of ground condition on GND pin
            The following conditions are ignored when driver activation is in-progress:
                 RESETB
                 Valid soft reset sequences
                 SPI1 commands except as noted below Response for ignored commands will be
                  0xD009
                 FEN function

Note: SPI MISO sent in the next SPI transmission.
      The device can only deploy a channel when the FEN function is active. Once the drivers are
      active the device shall keep the drivers on for the required duration regardless of the FEN
      state. Once completed, a status bit will be set to indicate firing is complete.
3.4.2 Firing current measurement
      All channels have a 7 bit current measurement register that is used to measure the amount
      of time the current is above IMEAS during firing. The maximum measurement for each
      channel is 3.175 ms nominal based on a bit weight of 25 ms. The current measurement
      register shall not increment outside the deployment time. The current measurement will
      begin incrementing once the current has exceeded 95% of the nominal target value. The
      count will continue to increment from the stored value until either a clear command has
      been issued for that channel or all ‘1’s are present in the corresponding channel
      measurement register. If all ‘1’s are present for a channel’s measurement register and
      another firing sequence has been issued the register shall remain all ‘1’s. Only if a clear
      command has been issued will that particular register be reset to all ‘0’s. All other channels
      shall keep the stored measurement count. During firing the current measurement register
      cannot be cleared. After a clear command has been issued for a channel then the channel is
      ready to count if the current exceeds the specified level. After a POR or software reset the
      device shall reset all 8 measurement registers to all ‘0’s.
      A “real-time” current measurement status of all the channels is available. If a current limit
      status request is sent then the device shall report in the next SPI transfer whether the
      current is above or below IMEAS for each of the channels. The current status results can be
      read at any time and shall correctly report whether current is flowing. The content of the
      internal current status register is captured on the falling edge of chip select during the SPI
      response. The internal status register is updated at a nominal sample time of 25 μs and is
      independent of SPI transfers.
      For this circuit there is continuously being performed compensation of the comparator to
      remove offset errors, which is independent from SPI commands. Compensation is
      performed every 12.8 μs based on the internal clock.
3.4.3 Fire enable (FEN) function description
      The Fire Enable (FEN) function is the result of the FENx input OR’d with the internal FEN
      latch. If the FEN latch is not enabled and the FENx pin is low then activation of the FET
      drivers are disabled except as indicated during the MOS test. All internal diagnostic

Functional description                                                                                L9662
            functions, and results, will be available through the serial interface. This pin must be pulled
            high to initiate the FEN latch function (if programmed) and enable firing of the FET drivers.
            The FEN function will be considered active when the pin is active (‘1’ or high) for more than
            12 microseconds. Tolerance range for the filter to be used will be 12 to 16 μs.
            When the FENx input is active, ‘1’, the FEN function will be active. When the FENx input
            state transitions from ‘1’ to ‘0’, the programmable latching function will hold the FEN
            function active until the timeout of the FEN timer. The programmable latch and hold
            function will be capable of delays of 0ms, 128ms, 256ms, and 512ms. There are 4
            independent timers with the timer for FEN1 associated with channels 1 & 2, timer for FEN2
            associated with channels 3 & 4, timer for FEN3 associated with channels 5 & 6, and the
            timer for FEN4 associated with channels 7 & 8. The timer is reset to the programmed
            time when the FENx pin transitions from ‘0’ to ‘1’. The programmable counter delay will
            be set through a SPI command.
3.4.4       Squib diagnostics
            Overview

                   Short to battery/ground and loop to loop diagnostics
                   The leakage diagnostic includes a short to battery, a short to ground and a short between
                   loop tests. The test will be run for each SQHx and SQLx pin so that shorts can be detected
                   regardless of the resistance between the squib pins.
                   Normal short to battery/ground diagnostics.
                   For the test the internal VRCM is switched on and connected to the selected pin (SQHx or
                   SQLx). The IPD bit will be selected to be OFF which will deactivate the pulldown current on
                   all the channels. During the test if no leakage is present the voltage on the selected SQHx
                   or SQLx pin will be equal to VBIAS and no current is sunk or sourced by VRCM. If a leakage
                   to ground or battery, the VRCM will sink or source a current less than ISVRCM trying to
                   keep VBIAS. Two current comparators, ISTB and ISTG, will detect the abnormal current
                   flow.
                   Loop to loop diagnostics
                   For this test the same procedure is followed except the pulldown current (IPD) is selected to
                   be ON which will deactivate the pulldown current only on the channel under test with all
                   other channel pulldown currents active. If a short to ground fault is active, assuming it was
                   not active during normal short to battery/ground diagnostics, then that particular channel
                   has a short to another squib loop. To detect loop to loop shorts between ASICs in the
                   system the Stop diagnostics command with IPD enabled needs to be sent to the other
                   ASICs before running the loop to loop diagnostics on the channel to be monitored. If the
                   channel being monitored has a short to ground fault active, assuming it was not active
                                                                                   DocID028325 Rev 1                                                                                            35/80

            1. Condition where 2 open channels have the SQHx pins shorted will not be detected. If one squib is open
                 and the other has a normal squib connection then the fault will be indicated on the channel that is open.

            Once the command is issued the state of the comparators shall be captured on the next
            falling edge of CS_D. The results are valid after TSHORTDIAG time, which is mainly
            dependent on the external capacitors on the squib lines.
            Squib resistance measurement
            During a resistance measurement, both ISRC and ISINK are switched on and connected to
            the selected SQHx and SQLx channel. A differential voltage is created between the SQHx
            and SQLx pin based in the ISRC current and resistance between the pins. The analog
            output pin, AOUT, will provide the resistance-measurement voltage based on the scaling
            factor indicated in the electrical parameters section. The tri-state output, AOUT, will be
            connected to an ADC input of a microprocessor. When not running squib resistance
            diagnostics the AOUT pin will be high impedance.
            To increase accuracy of the squib resistance measurements the offset of the internal
            amplifier can be provided on the AOUT pin. This is done by setting the appropriate
            calibration bit, waiting the required time, and reading the converted AOUT voltage
            connected to the microprocessor ADC. In test mode, Aout pin can be used as digital/analog
            output for testing deployment and diagnostics comparators and thresholds. Test mode is
            reserved for supplier use only.
            The normal measurement method for squib resistance is to take a single ended analog
            output measurement for a channel (VAOUT with AMC bit=0) and use the tolerances and
            equation shown in the parametric table. The device is also capable of improving the
            tolerance at resistances below 3.5 Ohms by removing the offset of the differential
            comparator. This method involves taking the single ended analog output results for a

      High squib resistance diagnostics
      During a high squib resistance diagnostic, VRCM and ISINK are switched ON and
      connected to SQHx and SQLx on the selected channel. Current flowing on SQHx will be
      measured and compared to IHR threshold to identify if resistance is above or below
      RSQHZ. The results shall be reported in the next SPI message. Once the command is
      issued the state of the squib resistance shall be valid after THSR captured on the next
      falling edge of CS_D. The voltage source for this test will be VBIAS which is based on the
      VDD supply.
      High and low side FET diagnostics
      Prior to either the HS or LS FET diagnostics being run it is required to have the VRCM
      switched ON. Running the leakage diagnostics with the appropriate delay time prior to either
      the HS or LS FET diagnostics will precondition the squib pin to the appropriate voltage level.
      When the FET diagnostic command is issued the flags will initially be cleared. Once this is
      complete there is a check to determine if the VRCM is not active or some leakage is
      present. If either of these conditions are present then the MOS will not be turned ON, the
      test will be aborted and the Fault Present (FP) bit will be set. The FEN function must be
      inactive for the channel under test in order to be able to run the test. The test will not start if
      FEN function is active on the channel under test and will result in the FP bit to be set.
      If no leakage is present and FEN function is inactive, the MOS (High side or Low Side) is
      turned ON.
      The device shall monitor the current sink or sourced by VRCM. If the MOS is working
      properly, this current will exceed ISTB (HS test) or ISTG (LS test) and the device shall turn
      off the driver under test within the specified time TSHUTOFF. If the current does not exceed
      ISTB or ISTG then the test will be terminated and the MOS will be switched off by the ASIC
      within TFETTIMEOUT. During the TFETTIMEOUT period the FET Timeout bit will be set
      (FT=1) and will be cleared at the expiration of the timer.
      The results must be compared with the leakage diagnostic results to distinguish between a
      real leakage/short versus a FET fault. For high side FET diagnostics if no faults were
      indicated in the preceding leakage diagnostics then a normal result would be STB = 1;
      STG = 0 (with FT = 0; FP = 0). If the returned results for the high side FET test is not
      STB = 1; STG = 0 (with FT = 0; FP = 0) then either the FET is not functional, a short
      occurred during the test, or there is a missing VRESx connection for that channel. For low
      side FET diagnostics if no faults were indicated in the preceding leakage diagnostics then a
      normal result would be STB = 0; STG = 1 (with FT = 0; FP = 0). If the returned results for the
      low side FET test is not STB = 0; STG = 1 (with FT = 0; FP = 0) then either the FET is not
      functional, a short occurred during the test, or there is a missing GNDx connection for that
      channel.
      On the next falling edge of CS_D, comparator results are latched and reported in the MISO
      response. The results will remain latched until the next test is initiated (diagnostic write
      command). If the test is in progress then a bit is used in the response to indicate the test
      completion. If the FET under test is working properly then the results shall indicate a “Short
      to Ground” for LS test and “Short to Battery” for HS test.
      For all conditions the current on SQHx/SQLx will never exceed ISVRCM. On the squib lines
      there will be higher transient currents due to the presence of the filter capacitor.

            High side safing diagnostics
            When the command is received the ASIC will activate IHSS on the selected VRESx. The
            diagnostics will measure the difference between VSDIAG and VRESx. The internal
            comparator will detect open, short or normal condition based on the differential voltage
            between VSDIAG and VRESx.
            The results shall be reported in the next SPI message using bits HSS1 and HSS0 as
            indicated in the following table. Once the command is issued the voltages shall be captured
            on the next falling edge of CS_D.

            Loss of ground
            When any of the power grounds (GND0 – 7) are lost, no deployment can occur on the
            respective deployment channels because the low side driver will be inactive. The high side
            driver for the respective channel can still be activated.
           A loss of ground condition on one or several channels will not affect the operation of the
            remaining channels. When a loss of ground condition occurs, the source of the low side
            MOS will be floating. In this case, no current will flow through the low side driver.
            This condition will be detected as a fault by a low side MOS diagnostic. No additional faults
            will be reported from any other diagnostic due to this condition.

3.4.5 SPI register definition for squib functions
      The SPI provides access to read/write to the registers internal to the device. All commands
      and responses sent to/from the ASIC on SPI1 shall use set D13 as required for odd parity
      on the 16 bit word. The responses to the commands are sent in the next valid CS_D.
      The table below summarizes the MISO register mode response of various events and MOSI
      messages. After POR event, RESETB negated, and loss of GND, the device sends 0x0000
      in MISO for the first SPI transmission.
      The MISO response shown here is the one received in the next valid SPI transmission after
      each event or MOSI write.

Note: X in software reset response should be interpreted as follows: D11=1;D10=0;D9:D8=CL bits
      The SPI fault responses (0xD000 or 0xD003) indicate a fault in the last MOSI transmission.
      The device uses the parity bit to determine the integrity of the MOSI command transmission.
      Squib SPI commands
      The following modes are supported by the squib ASIC using SPI1.
           Configuration mode
           Deployment mode
           Diagnostic mode
           Monitor mode
      The table below is a summary of the modes and the functions that are achieved by sending
      the particular MOSI command. The following sections will provide a full description of bit
      settings for each mode. All commands and responses use D13 to achieve odd parity.

                               sequence is broken, the processor will be required to re-transmit the

                               within two subsequent 16- bit SPI transmissions. When soft reset
                               command is received, the device reset its deployment driver’s internal
                               logic and timer, satellite internal logic including all internal registers. The

            Bits [D9:D8]               Bits are used to set the period of the FEN latch timer. The device has
                                       4 independent timers. A valid FENx input will start the pulse stretch
                                       timer. These bits will set the timer duration. These values default to
                                       ‘00’ after a POR event.
            Deployment commands
            The deployment mode is used to activate the drivers. Two consecutive commands are
            required to activate the drivers. Any combination of channels can be fired as long as the
            prerequisite conditions are met as indicated in the previous section.

                            1     Arm Channel 0
            The Deploy Status becomes ‘1’ when there is a valid fire sequence. Once active it will
            become ‘0’ when the time out has expired waiting FEN activation or when squib driver has
            turned off for fire completion. The same information is available when receiving a response
            from Monitor Mode 1.
            For the drivers to be fire capable the command mode 1 (Arming) must be sent followed by
            command mode 2 (Firing). With this sequence valid and FEN active then firing will begin. A
            break in the sequence will require the process to be restarted. All other bit patterns for D12-
            D8 shall be ignored.
            To begin a deployment 2 consecutive commands need to be sent along with the FEN active
            (external or internal latch). An example of a firing sequence for channel 0 would be as
            follows
            FENx active or inactive
            TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
            RX – Based on previous command

      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x6001 – Firing on Channel 0 is started on if FEN is active
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored – sequence is not allowed
      RX – 0x6001
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored
      RX – 0xD005
      Alternatively, if the sequence is broken the response shall be as in the following example
      FENx active
      TX – 0x5901 – ARM Channel 0
      RX – Based on previous command
      TX – 0x2000 – Read of Register Mode 1
      RX – 0x5901
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored – sequence is not allowed
      RX – contents of register
      TX – 0x6001 – Command ignored – sequence is not allowed
      RX – 0xD005
      If, for example, channel 0 and 1 bits are set in the Arm command and channel 0 and 7 bits
      are set in the fire command then the result will be the drivers on channel 0 will be activated
      (assuming FEN function is active) and there will be no effect on channel 7.
      During a deployment, any commands directed to the channel that are in deployment are
      ignored and the response shall be 0xD009.

            The DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag indicates if the corresponding channel’s drivers were
            activated and that the activation period has completed. This bit is set when the activation
            period has expired. The DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag will be ‘1’ until it is cleared by writing a
            ‘1’ to the appropriate channel(s) (bits D7-D0).
            The DEPLOY_STATUSx bit will become ‘1’ when there is a valid Arm and Fire sequence for
            the corresponding channel. The DEPLOY_STATUSx bit transitioning from a ‘0’ to a ‘1’ does
            not depend on the state of the FEN function. It will become ‘0’ when time out has expired.

          Depending on the state of FEN the DEPLOY_STATUSx flag could be ‘1’ for a minimum of 1x
          tDEPLOY and a maximum of up to 2 x tDEPLOY (see Figure 8). The Deployment status is
          captured on the falling edge of CS_D.
          Bit D8 is used to select the meaning of bit D7 through bit D0 in the status response
          message. When this bit is set to ‘1,’ bits D7 through D0 in the status response message will
          report the state of the DEPLOY_STATUSx flag.
          When this bit is ‘0,’ bit D7 through bit D0 in the status response message will report the
          DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag. The following table 16 shows the conditions for the
          DEPLOY_STATUSx flag and the DEPLOY_SUCCESSx flag.

          Once the Deploy Success Flag is set, it will inhibit the subsequent deployment command
          until a SPI command to clear this deployment success flag is received. Bits D7 through bit
          D0 are used to clear/keep the deploy success flag. When these bits are set to ‘1,’ the flag
          can be cleared. Otherwise, the state of these flags is not affected. The Success flag must
          be cleared to allow re-activation of the drivers

Note:       The FEN status is the result of the state of the FEN input pin OR’d with the FEN latch timer.
            The FEN latch timer will remain inactive until a transition of ‘1’ to ‘0’ on the FEN input
            (assuming the pin was high for a minimum of 16μs). At that time the FEN latch timer will be
            active and keep the internal FEN signal active based on the programmed time (0ms, 128ms,
            256ms or 512ms) for that particular FEN function.

3.4.6 Satellite sensor interface
      The device provides four currents limited to I_Lim each through outputs ICH1, ICH2, ICH3
      and ICH4. The voltage at these four channels is supplied by the VSATS input. Channels 1,
      2, 3 and 4 serve as switched power sources to remote mounted satellite sensors. The
      device will monitor the current flow from its output pin and “demodulate” the current to be
      decoded using Manchester protocol. Decoded satellite message is communicated to an
      external microprocessor via SPI2. Both the satellite and squib circuits can be reset over
      when sending the appropriate configuration commands via SPI1 (16 bit SPI).
      For operation using a sync pulse a capacitor between 10 nF to 47 nF is required to be within
      70 nH of the respective ASIC pin for signal stability.
      In case of loss of VCC all outputs will remain off.
      Satellite operation modes
      Each receiver channel provides different modes of operation that can be programmed by
      SPI command.
      Receive mode (asynchronous data transfer)
      In Receive Mode the sensor interface operates in asynchronous mode. The specified data
      messages from each channel will be continuously received every tasync. (Design Information
      only).
      The Sensor Interface supplies satellites and receives current modulated data. In this mode,
      the channels are supplied via pin VSATS. A voltage  VICHxmin+Vhdp_max(I=75mA@105°C) at

            High voltage mode and satellite SYNC mode
            In High Voltage Mode and SYNC Mode the ICHx outputs are regulated to a higher output
            voltage (VICHx_HV) than in Receive mode. In this case, the channel power supply is taken
            from a separate input pin (VSYNC). Both modes are activated and deactivated by the same
            SPI command. The start of the SYNC impulse is arbitrary and is created by a signal from the
            μC using the INITSYNC input pin. The Sync pulse shall be initiated for all satellites based on
            the rising edge of the INITSYNC input after a tSYNCDLY delay. The duration of the sync pulse
            shall be based on the programmed sync pulse high time based on [D9:D8] in the MCR. If
            the sync timing register has not been written the default pulse high time shall be tSYNC_high1.
            The absence of an INITSYNC input rising edge does not prevent processing of incoming
            messages when in HV or SYNC mode.
            For Sync mode the valid sync time selections would be tSYNC_high1 and tSYNC_high2. For
            High Voltage Mode the valid sync time selections would be tSYNC_high3 and tSYNC_high4. The
            time selections of tSYNC_high3 and tSYNC_high4 cannot be used in normal operation because
            the time duration will be longer than the receive disable time, resulting in improper
            communication with the satellites. For HV mode (used only in the manufacturing or supplier
            facility) if there is a short to battery flag is set then the message must be ignored.
           At the start of a sync pulse there is a short period before the actual start of the sync pulse for
            a channel where the current is limited to 20mA typical. This low current limit will start after
            the tINITSYNCFLT time and last for 200 ns. The satellite current requirements in conjunction
            with the capacitance on the pins should be verified so that the minimum satellite voltage can
            be maintained.
            SYNC mode
            During the receiver disable time a sync pulse cannot be initiated and any change on the
            INITSYNC pin will be ignored by the ASIC.The satellite SYNC mode is used to generate
            automatic sync pulses for synchronous data transmission. In this mode, the output operates
            in Receive Mode, but is periodically switched to a higher output voltage VICHx_HV. Thus, the
            receiver decoder blocks are deactivated for the duration of the Sync pulse. To avoid
            disturbance in the data flow during re-settling of the output voltage to the receive-mode
            level, the receiver decoder block is deactivated for time tRECV_disable.

      The receiver disable time, tRECV_disable, is started from the rising edge of the INITSYNC
      input. When operating in sync mode the valid sync time selections would be tSYNC_high1 and
      tSYNC_high2.
      In synchronous communication mode it is possible to communicate with a maximum of two
      (2) satellites on one channel. This is done using a simple form of time division multiplexing
      where each device transmit its data during a known time slot.
      The figure below shows examples for 1 or 2 satellites on a channel.

            High voltage mode
            The High Voltage Mode is based on the SYNC Mode and will be used to communicate with
            the external satellites via voltage modulation. When in this mode the valid sync time
            selections would be tSYNC_high3 and tSYNC_high4.
            During the High Voltage Mode it is necessary to disable the receiver of the sensor interface
            until a complete data frame is sent. After sending a data frame the receiver must be enabled
            again to receive the expected answer from the satellites. The microcontroller will control the
            enabling and disabling of the receiver along with Sync pulse high time (tSYNC_highx) the
            over SPI2 for each bit of the data frame.

            Satellite message decoding
            The device is configurable for decoding of satellite messages based on either Manchester-1
            or Manchester-2 decoding. Each of the four satellite channels has a Manchester decoder
            that can be enabled or disabled through the CCR register.
            For Manchester-1 decoding a logic 0 is defined as a signal transition from 1 to 0 at 50%
            Duty cycle, logic 1 is defined as a signal transition from 0 to 1 at 50% Duty cycle. For
            Manchester-2 decoding a logic 0 is defined as a signal transition from 0 to 1 at 50% Duty
            cycle, logic 1 is defined as a signal transition from 1 to 0 at 50% Duty cycle. An example of
            Manchester-1 and Manchester-2 decoding is given below.

      The device is capable of different bit rates, which can be programmed via SPI2 based on
      the operating frequency of the satellite bus. For the first message and all subsequent
      messages the ASIC uses the Start Bits’ time to decode the rest of the bits in the message. In
      case the measured bit rate obtained using the 2 Start bits doesn’t fall within the range
      selected by the SPI as defined the device declares a bit time error and waits for idle. The
      idle time between messages is 1.5 times the measured start bits time of the previous
      message unless a message error is detected. If an error is detected then the device shall
      default to 1.5 times the maximum frequency (minimum bit time). The initial idle time (after a
      POR or reset) is 0 bit times.
      The decoder uses a counter to track the high to low and low to high transitions at the bit
      center. Figure 15 is an example that illustrates how the ASIC performs the decoding.
      A transition is considered a bit center only when an edge is detected 75% to 125% of the
      reference bit time after de-glitch filter. The de-glitch filter can modify bit time if the noise on is
      not symmetric on each transition. When a single edge occurs below 75% of the reference bit
      time it is considered to be a bit edge but it is ignored. When the decoder detects a second
      edge below 75% of the reference bit time the device declares a bit time error via SPI, revert
      to the minimum bit time of the selected range, and wait for idle. When a valid bit center is
      detected the counter will reset and start counting again until another edge is detected. If the
      message is not complete and no edge is detected in the range of 75% to 125% of measured
      bit time, the device declares a bit time error via SPI, revert to the minimum bit time of the
      selected range, and wait for idle. The idle time is defined as 150% of the minimum bit time of
      the selected protocol speed range. If there is no bit transition detected for that period of time
      and the correct number of bits was received, the message is considered complete. Bit time
      error and too many bits faults are stored directly into the data register once they are
      selected without the need to wait till an idle time. Since a bit time error is reported directly
      once it is detected before Idle time, too few bits error may never be reported since bit time
      error is detected first.
      Bit time errors and too many bits errors will cause the decoder to revert to the minimum bit
      time of the selected range, and discard the message. In case of a message containing
      multiple errors only one error code is reported per message, errors detected in the decoding
      phase have the following reporting priority; bit time errors, too many bits errors then
      communication errors (CRC/Parity).

            Communication protocols
            In order to support the various satellite sensors, the device supports two different
            communication standards (MS and PSI5 Mode). The Manchester standard consists of two
            protocols (CRC / Even Parity), while the PSI5 standard consists of one protocol (Even
            Parity) for a total of three communication protocols. The three protocols which are described
            in this section are: 1) Protocol A - CRC. 2) Protocol B Generic – Parity: to support Bosch
            PAS3 and PAS4 sensors. 3) Protocol C: PSI5 – Parity: support for various sensors. Bit D3 of
            the MCR configures the device for either MS or PSI5 communication standard. Bits D10 to
            D13 in the MCR register are used to configure the specific device channel (Ch. 0,1,2,3) to
            use any of these specified protocols.
            This version of the device supports the following PSI5 Operational Modes.

      The default for the device is to perform CRC decoding on all messages. The device has the
      option not to perform the CRC decoding and pass the satellite message, excluding the 2
      start bits, over the MISO. CRC decoding can be disabled/enabled by writing to the
      appropriate bit in the CCR register.
      For the CRC mode the error detection code used for processing the message is based on
      the polynomial x3 + x1 + x0. If the device is in CRC mode it will process all incoming
      messages and report an error via SPI2 in case of a CRC mismatch. The CRC is performed
      after a complete message is received and, in case of CRC error, the device sets a fault code
      in the SR word.
      The message data sent over SPI2 is MSB first.
      Protocol B: generic variable length protocol
      The data received from satellite receiver block has to be decoded in the digital block. The
      data is received LSB first. The protocol format is defined below for the 4 different message

      Once the data is transferred to the SPI transfer buffer the satellite data register is cleared.
      If there is no incoming satellite message before the next SPI data read a register empty flag
      will be indicated assuming no other fault conditions exist.
      Current sensor description
      Each output channel senses the current drawn by the remote satellite sensor. The circuit
      modulates the load current into logic voltage levels for post processing by a Manchester
      decoder. Each channel has an internal comparator with a programmable currents trip points
      selectable through the appropriate setting in the CCR Register for each of the 4 satellite
      channels. For determining the appropriate current threshold setting the total current, idle
      plus signal, must be taken into account. The current sense comparator also provides
      hysteresis, which can be enabled through appropriate setting in the CCR Register. Each
      comparator output have a de-glitch filter as a function of the protocol speed.
      Satellite short conditions
      Each channel has a short circuit protection by independent current limit. When a short to
      ground occurs the output becomes current limited to 150 mA maximum when the voltage is
      at idle and 280 mA maximum during the sync pulse for a total period of tFlt _GND. After time
      tFlt _GND the output will shut off and a leakage to ground fault shall be reported in the SR
      word. The output will remain off until re-enabled via SPI and if the short is not present then
      the outputs shall return to normal operation. All channels that do not have a short condition
      shall not be affected.
      When the output is shorted to battery, an internal comparator senses the output voltage
      level then turns off an internal series transistor to provide blocking diode for the current
      going through the output channel. The output will be OFF only when fault condition is
      present. As soon as the fault disappears, the interface will become ON again. A leakage to
      battery fault will be set and reported in the SR word after it has been present for tFlt _BATT.
      Once read it shall be cleared and if the condition is still present the flag will be set. The
      comparators have 20 to 50 mV input offset to prevent turning off the output under an open
      circuit condition.

             1/100th ratio of the sense current in this mode internal data register and decoder are
             bypassed. This will allow the IF2/V2 and IF3/V3 pins to be connected to a resistor to ground
             and provide an analog voltage equivalent to the sense current to be read by an A/D port.
             These two pins have an internal clamp as protection. This feature is available for Channels
             2 and 3.
             Digital output
             Channels 2 and 3 can be configured as a logic level output with the level reflecting if the
             current is above or below the selected internal current threshold. See Table 33 for MCR and
             CCR bit settings for this mode. The output voltage has a reversed polarity to the satellite
             current such that when the current drawn by the satellite is below the current detection
             threshold, the IFx/Vx signal level transitions into a high state, on the other hand if the current
             drawn by the satellite exceeds the current detection threshold, IFx/Vx signal transitions into
             a low state.
             Channel 2 and 3 mode selection
             These channels can be configured to decode satellite messages or Hall Effect sensors and
             provide results through the SPI and/or the IFx/Vx pins. The following Table 33 shows the
             settings for the MCR and CCR based on the interfacing to a sensor or satellite.

3.4.7           SPI register definition for satellite functions
               The SPI provides access to read/write to the registers internal to the device. All commands
                sent to the ASIC shall use set D15 as required for odd parity on the 16 bit word. The total
                message length when CS_S is active is 80 bits. The response to the command is sent in the
                next valid CS_S.

            When the device is set to report the MCR in the MISO response it must be done only when
            reporting all CCRs. If Data is reported with the MCR in the MISO response then the data
            status information is lost. When the MCR is in MISO word 1 then there is no indicator
            whether a response in words 2 to 5 are CCR or Data.
            If the SR is returned in the MISO response with a CCR then the status information for that
            word will not change until the next SR with Data. The SR bits will indicate which words are
            CCR and Data.

           The MOSI input takes data from the master microprocessor while CS_S is asserted. The
           MSB is the first bit of each word received on MOSI and the LSB is the last bit of each word
           received on MOSI. This pin has TTL level compatible input voltages allowing proper
           operation with microprocessors using a 3.3 to 5.0 volt supply.
           When data is transmitted for any of the first 4 words on MISO then the SR will be the 5th
           word. This is required to identify good vs. bad data since, depending on the data mode, all
           16 bits from a satellite can be data.
           Satellite module configuration register (MCR)
           This register defines the global configuration to the satellite module.
           The MCR will be the 1st word in the message of the MOSI transfer. The micro MUST never
           write the MCR in the wrong position because it will be recognized by the ASIC as a CCR.
           The SPI message definition for MOSI commands and MISO responses for the MCR are
           defined below.

                                          valid.
            Bits [D13:D10]                These bits are used to configure the output channels for either
                                          CRC or Parity sensor protocols.
                                          When in MS Mode the default configuration is the protocol A.
                                          For PSI5 mode these bits must be set to 1's.

             When transferring data if the CRC check is disabled on the ASIC then there is no parity bit
             and the CRC bits will be present along with the data bits on the MISO line.

             Bits [D11].         Used to enable/disable checksum calculations in MS satellite
                                 mode (D11 is ignored in PSI5).

                                   the ASIC does not perform a parity check on the incoming message and
                                   will be included in the data field.

            Status registers (SR)
            The definition for the Status Register is valid for all four protocols.
            The SR will always be the 1st word in the message of the MOSI frame
            The message faults and data/channel information are indicated using 3 bits per channel
            (SF2, SF1 and SF0). These bits represent the actual highest priority state of the ICHx-
            receiver, i.e. any change in a state will overwrite the previous value with the highest priority
            fault being reported if more than one fault exists.

      Error code 011 is an “or-ed”combination of the following errors:
           Start bit error outside of selected operating range

           Bit time error outside 75% 125% of start bit
      If in Hall Effect mode the status register under normal conditions will report a Register
      Empty (CHxSF2:CHxSF0='010'). If a fault is on the channel then either a Leakage to supply
      and no good data (CHxSF2:CHxSF0='101') or Leakage to ground (CHxSF2:CHxSF0='110')
      would be present.
      If in Raw data mode the status resister under normal conditions will report Register Empty
      (CHxSF2:CHxSF0='010').
           If decoder is on then satellite data will be present (See Table 40 under protocol A or
            Protocol B)
           If decoder is off then D0 will contain data
      If a fault is on the channel then either a Leakage to supply and no good data (CHxSF2:
      CHxSF0='101') or Leakage to ground (CHxSF2:CHxSF0='110') would be present.
