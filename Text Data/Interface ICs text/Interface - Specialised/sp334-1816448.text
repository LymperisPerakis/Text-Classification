Description
                                                                                    FEATURES
The SP334 is a programmable RS-232 and/or RS-485 transceiver IC.                    ■■ +5V Single Supply Operation
The SP334 contains three drivers and five receivers when selected                   ■■ Software Programmable RS-232 or
in RS-232 mode; and two drivers and two receivers when selected in                     RS-485 Selection
                                                                                    ■■ Three RS-232 Drivers and Five Receivers
RS-485 mode.
                                                                                       in RS-232 Mode
The RS-232 transceivers can typically operate at 230kbps                            ■■ Two RS-485 Full-Duplex Transceivers in
while adhering to the RS-232 specifications. The RS-485                                RS-485 Mode
transceivers can operate up to 10Mbps while adhering to the                         ■■ Full Differential Driver Tri-State (Hi-Z)
RS-485 specifications. The RS-485 drivers can be disabled                              Control
                                                                                    ■■ Receiver Output Tri-State Control
(High-Z output) by the TXEN enable pin. The RS-232 and RS-485
receiver outputs can be disabled by the RXEN pin.
