1             Description
              CLT01-38S4 adds to the existing current limiter family. Still focusing on power consumption
              savings, the whole series allows each customer to find the right solution.
              The CLT01-38S4 is an octal input termination device with a high speed SPI output. Its
              maximum input data rate is 400 kbps while the output SPI speed is 6.25 MHz.
              As in previous versions, robustness is a key feature of CLT01-38S4. The product is
              compliant with surge standards defined in IEC 61000-4-x.
              It can run all types of sensor according to IEC 61131-2. Type 1 and 3 with a 2.35 mA limited
              current and type 2 using two inputs per sensor with the correct RREF.
