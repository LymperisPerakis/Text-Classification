BLOCK DIAGRAM EXPLANATION
DDC Switch Block
Passive NMOS based 3:1 mux for DDC channels from each HDMI/DVI input connector. This section can remain active even when
3.3V supply is gone, as long as 5.0V from TMDS connector is connected to the PI3HDMI1310-A IC.
3:1 High speed Differential Channel Block
4-differential channels per port. 3 channels are targeted for high speed data channels (250Mbps to 3.4Gbps) and 1 channel is
targeted for high speed clock signal (25MHz to 340MHz).
HPD Control Channels Block
Drives each HPD channels through the input pin, HPD_Sink.
This signal will need to drive external pull-down transistor circuit before connecting to the HDMI/DVI connector. The external
pull down circuit will look like the following:
