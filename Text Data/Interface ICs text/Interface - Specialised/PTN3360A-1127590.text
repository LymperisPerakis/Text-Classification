                 Rev. 02 — 8 October 2009                                            Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PTN3360A is a high-speed level shifter device which converts four lanes of low-swing
             AC-coupled differential input signals to DVI v1.0 and HDMI v1.3a compliant open-drain
             current-steering differential output signals, up to 2.5 Gbit/s per lane. Each of these lanes
             provides a level-shifting differential buffer to translate from low-swing AC-coupled
             differential signaling on the source side, to TMDS-type DC-coupled differential
             current-mode signaling terminated into 50 Ω to 3.3 V on the sink side. Additionally, the
             PTN3360A provides a single-ended active buffer for voltage translation of the HPD signal
             from 5 V on the sink side to 1.1 V on the source side and provides a channel for level
             shifting of the DDC channel (consisting of a clock and a data line) between 3.3 V
             source-side and 5 V sink-side. The DDC channel is implemented using pass-gate
             technology providing level shifting as well as disablement (isolation between source and
             sink) of the clock and data lines.
             The low-swing AC-coupled differential input signals to the PTN3360A typically come from
             a display source with multi-mode I/O, which supports multiple display standards, e.g.,
             DisplayPort, HDMI and DVI. While the input differential signals are configured to carry DVI
             or HDMI coded data, they do not comply with the electrical requirements of the DVI v1.0 or
             HDMI v1.3a specification. By using PTN3360A, chip set vendors are able to implement
             such reconfigurable I/Os on multi-mode display source devices, allowing the support of
             multiple display standards while keeping the number of chip set I/O pins low. See
             Figure 1.
             The PTN3360A main high-speed differential lanes feature low-swing self-biasing
             differential inputs which are compliant to the electrical specifications of DisplayPort
             Standard v1.1 and/or PCI Express Standard v1.1, and open-drain current-steering
             differential outputs compliant to DVI v1.0 and HDMI v1.3a electrical specifications. The
             I2C-bus channel level-translates the DDC signals between 3.3 V (source) and 5.0 V (sink).
             The PTN3360A is a fully featured HDMI as well as DVI level shifter. It is functionally
             equivalent to PTN3300A but provides higher speed performance and higher ESD
             robustness. The PTN3360A is also equivalent to PTN3360B with the exception that
             PTN3360A provides inverting level shifting on the HPD channel.
             PTN3360A is powered from a single 3.3 V power supply consuming a small amount of
             power (120 mW typ.) and is offered in a 48-terminal HVQFN48 package.

                                   HVQFN48 package supply ground is connected to both GND pins and exposed center pad. GND
                                   pins must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal,
                                   electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using
                                   a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board,
                                   thermal vias need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

                                                       Enhanced HDMI/DVI level shifter with inverting 1.1 V HPD
6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 2 “Functional diagram of PTN3360A”.
                       The PTN3360A level shifts four lanes of low-swing AC-coupled differential input signals to
                       DVI and HDMI compliant open-drain current-steering differential output signals, up to
                       2.5 Gbit/s per lane. It has integrated 50 Ω termination resistors for AC-coupled differential
                       input signals. An enable signal OE_N can be used to turn off the TMDS inputs and
                       outputs, thereby minimizing power consumption. The TMDS outputs, HPD_SINK input
                       and DDC_SINK I/Os are back-power safe to disallow current flow from a powered sink
                       while the PTN3360A is unpowered.
                       The PTN3360A's DDC channel provides active level shifting and buffering, allowing 3.3 V
                       source-side termination and 5 V sink-side termination. The sink-side DDC ports are
                       equipped with a rise time accelerator enabling drive of long cables or high bus
                       capacitance. This enables the system designer to isolate bus capacitance to meet HDMI
                       DDC version 1.3a distance specification. The PTN3360A offers back-power safe sink-side
                       I/Os to disallow backdrive current from the DDC clock and data lines when power is off or
                       when DDC is not enabled. An enable signal DCC_EN enables the DDC level shifter block.
                       The PTN3360A also provides voltage translation for the Hot Plug Detect (HPD) signal
                       from 0 V to 5 V on the sink side, inverting and level-shifting to 1.1V/0 V on the source side.
                       The PTN3360A does not re-time any data. It contains no state machines except for the
                       DDC/I2C-bus block. No inputs or outputs of the device are latched or clocked. Because
                       the PTN3360A acts as a transparent level shifter, no reset is required.
                   6.1 Enable and disable features
                       PTN3360A offers different ways to enable or disable functionality, using the Output Enable
                       (OE_N) and DDC Enable (DDC_EN) inputs. Whenever the PTN3360A is disabled, the
                       device will be in Standby mode and power consumption will be minimal; otherwise the
                       PTN3360A will be in Active mode and power consumption will be nominal. These two
                       inputs each affect the operation of PTN3360A differently: OE_N affects only the TMDS
                       channels, and DDC_EN affects only the DDC channel. HPD_SINK does not affect either
                       of the channels. The following sections and truth table describe their detailed operation.
                6.1.1 Hot plug detect
                       The HPD channel of PTN3360A functions as a level-shifting buffer to pass the HPD logic
                       signal from the display sink device (via input HPD_SINK) on to the display source device
                       (via output HPD_SOURCE_N).
                       The output logic state of HPD_SOURCE_N output always follows the inverse logic state of

                                                     Enhanced HDMI/DVI level shifter with inverting 1.1 V HPD
                6.1.2 Output Enable function (OE_N)
                      When input OE_N is asserted (active LOW), the IN_Dx and OUT_Dx signals are fully
                      functional. Input termination resistors are enabled and the internal bias circuits are turned
                      on.
                      When OE_N is de-asserted (inactive HIGH), the OUT_Dx outputs are in a
                      high-impedance state and drive zero output current. The IN_Dx input buffers are disabled
                      and IN_Dx termination is disabled. Power consumption is minimized.
                      Remark: Note that OE_N has no influence on the HPD_SINK input, HPD_SOURCE_N
                      output, or the SCL and SDA level shifters. OE_N only affects the high-speed TMDS
                      channel.
                6.1.3 DDC channel enable function (DDC_EN)
                      The DDC_EN pin is active HIGH and can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave. When
                      DDC_EN is LOW, the DDC channel is turned off. The DDC_EN input should never change
                      state during an I2C-bus operation. Note that disabling DDC_EN during a bus operation will
                      hang the bus, while enabling DDC_EN during bus traffic would corrupt the I2C-bus
                      operation. Hence, DDC_EN should only be toggled while the bus is idle. (See I2C-bus
                      specification).

                   6.2 Analog current reference
                       The REXT pin (pin 6) is an analog current sense port used to provide an accurate current
                       reference for the differential outputs OUT_Dx. For best output voltage swing accuracy, use
                       of a 10 kΩ resistor (1 % tolerance) connected between this terminal and GND is
                       recommended.
                       If an external 10 kΩ ± 1 % resistor is not used, this pin can be left open-circuit, or
                       connected to GND or VDD, either directly (0 Ω) or using pull-up or pull-down resistors of
                       value less than 10 kΩ. In any of these cases, the output will function normally but at
                       reduced accuracy over voltage and temperature of the following parameters: output levels
                       (VOL), differential output voltage swing, and rise and fall time accuracy.
                   6.3 Backdrive current protection
                       The PTN3360A is designed for backdrive prevention on all sink-side TMDS outputs,
                       sink-side DDC I/Os and the HPD_SINK input. This supports user scenarios where the
                       display is connected and powered, but the PTN3360A is unpowered. In these cases, the
                       PTN3360A will sink no more than a negligible amount of leakage current, and will block
                       the display (sink) termination network from driving the power supply of the PTN3360A or
                       that of the inactive DVI or HDMI source.

11. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                11.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                11.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                11.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                11.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 5) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 12 and 13
