1   General description
              Designed as an MCU replacement in various gaming and lighting applications, this NFC
              tag adds connectivity and increases flexibility while saving energy and lowering the bill of
              materials.
              NXP's NTAG 5 switch lets designers eliminate the MCU in selected gaming and lighting
              applications and other cost sensitive designs, for added functionality, connectivity,
              and efficiency at a lower cost. Operating at 13.56 MHz, it is an NFC Forum-compliant
              (customer development board is NFC Forum certified - Certification ID: 58626)
              contactless tag that can be read by any NFC-enabled device at close range and by
              an ISO/IEC 15693-enabled industrial reader over a longer range. Easy configuration
              supports a range of control functions, and the integrated originality check lets the user
              verify an end product’s authenticity.

               Figure 1. NTAG 5 switch overview
              In some lighting and gaming applications, NTAG 5 switch enables simple and cost-
              effective designs without a microcontroller. It implements multiplexed pins, offering
              general-purpose I/O (GPIO) and pulse width modulation (PWM) as well as NFC field
              detection. The characteristics of the PWM or GPIO signal can be configured through the
              NFC interface. These features can be used to switch on/off and control motor speed or
              LED brightness.
              Support for ISO/IEC 15693 lets the NTAG 5 switch communicate securely in two ways —
              with powerful industrial readers, at a range of up to 60 cm and with NFC-enabled devices
              within proximity range. This duality makes it possible for the device to be calibrated and
              parameterized automatically while in the factory and then, when put to use in the field,
              safely communicate with contactless devices such as NFCenabled smartphones.
              The tag’s 512 bytes of memory can be divided into three areas, and each area can use
              a different protection level, varying from no protection to 32-/64-bit, password-protected
              read/write access. Different parties in the value chain can have their own dedicated
              memory areas for storing access data.

                                                   NTAG 5 switch - NFC Forum-compliant PWM and GPIO bridge
                   The NTAG 5 switch comes with pre-programmed proof-of-origin functionality to verify
                   authenticity. The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) based originality signature can be
                   locked or reprogrammed by the customer.
                   The NTAG 5 is a powerhouse, harvesting the energy from an NFC Reader, it can operate
                   without a battery. Better yet, with its configurable output voltage, it can power a circuit, a
                   sensor network and even charge a super capacitor wireless.

8       Functional description
                   8.1 Memory Organization
                8.1.1 General
                       The entire memory is divided into three different parts:
                       • User memory
                         – This part of the memory is intended to be used to store user data. It is organized in
                           blocks of 4 bytes each (see Section 8.1.2).
                         – According to NFC Forum Type 5 Tag Specification, EEPROM block 0 contains the
                           Capability Container directly followed by the NDEF Message TLV. If NTAG 5 switch
                           is used in a proprietary way, any user data may be stored in the user memory. Direct
                           read/write access with the standard READ BLOCK and WRITE BLOCK commands
                           (see Section 8.2.3.4) to this part of the memory is possible depending on the related
                           security and write protection conditions.
                         – 16-bit counter
                           The last block of the EEPROM memory contains the 16-bit counter and the counter
                           protection flag (see Section 8.1.2.1).
                       • Configuration area
                         – Within this part of the memory all configuration options are stored (see Section 8.1.3).
                           This memory area can only be accessed with the READ CONFIG (see
                           Section 8.2.3.2.1) or WRITE CONFIG (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) commands.
                         – The configuration area contains required security-related information, such as access
                           passwords with related privileges, headers, customer ID (CID), originality signature
                           and many more which will be loaded at power-on reset.
                         – Access to configuration blocks may be blocked at all or password protected with
                           related configuration bits.
                         – All session registers are accessible in the configuration area as long as not locked
                           by LOCK_SESSION_REG. These configuration items can be changed on the fly and
                           have immediate effect, but get lost after power-on reset.
                       WARNING: The content of bytes and bits defined as RFU SHALL NOT be changed.
                8.1.2 User memory
                       According to NFC Forum Type 5 Tag Specification, the user accessible EEPROM
                       memory is divided into blocks. A block is the smallest access unit. For NTAG 5 switch,
                       each block consists of 4 bytes (1 block = 32 bits). Bit 0 in each byte represents the least
                       significant bit (lsb) and bit 7 the most significant bit (msb), respectively.
                       The last block contains the 16-bit counter (see Section 8.1.2.1).
                       NTAG 5 switch offers 512 bytes (4096 bits) of user memory.

               8.1.2.1 16-bit counter
                        Last Block of the user memory contains the 16-bit counter. The block can be accessed
                        with the standard read and write commands but special data format is required.
                        The standard protection conditions for the user memory are not valid for the counter
                        block.
                        Counter block can only be accessed from NFC perspective.
                        The 16-bit counter can be
                        • preset to initial start value protected with the write password
                        • read
                        • increased by one, optionally protected with the read password
                        The counter can be read with an (EXTENDED) READ SINGLE BLOCK to the last block
                        or (EXTENDED) READ MULTIPLE BLOCK command including the last block. The 4 byte
                        data of the counter block provide the following information in Table 8.

                            01h              Incrementing of the counter value is protected with the read password
                       The counter can be preset to a start value with an (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK
                       command to counter block. The counter can only be preset to a start value after a SET
                       PASSWORD command with the write password.
                       The PROT byte (data byte 3) value defines if the protection to increment the counter
                       is enabled or disabled. If the protection is enabled, the read password is required to
                       increment the counter value.
                       The data for the (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK command to preset the counter
                       is defined in Table 9.
                       Remark: A Preset counter value of 0x0001 is not possible, a (EXTENDED) WRITE
                       SINGLE BLOCK command with that value will only increment the counter.
Table 9. Preset counter data structure

                       To increment the counter by one with a (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK
                       command to counter block. If the protection to increment the counter is enabled, a SET
                       PASSWORD command with the read password is required before.
                       The data for the (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK command to increment the
                       counter is defined in Table 10.
                       Remark: The counter can only be incremented with the C0 and C1 values defined in
                       Table 10. Other values than that preset the counter if a SET PASSWORD command with
                       the write password or leads to an error message.

                8.1.3 Configuration Memory
                       The configuration memory contains the security and configuration information. Access
                       to this memory area is only possible with WRITE CONFIG (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) and
                       READ CONFIG (see Section 8.2.3.2.1) commands depending on the initialization status.
                       Writing to blocks with only RFU bytes is not possible and results in error code 0Fh.
                       Reading complete RFU blocks results in receiving all bytes 00h.
                       Changing RFU bytes and bits is not allowed and may result in unintended behavior.
                       Different features can be configured with CONFIG bits. Similar to all other configuration
                       options, the effect does not take place in the current session. The effect takes place after
                       POR. If immediate change is expected, related session register bytes or bits need to be
                       used (see Section 8.1.4).
                       To which section each block belongs is defined in first column (Sec.). Sections might be
                       locked by setting related bit to 1b (see Section 8.1.3.21).

                8.1.3.1 Originality Signature
                        The Originality signature (see Section 8.6) is stored in first 8 blocks (block 00h to
                        block 07h) of configuration memory and may be verified by the NFC device using the
                        corresponding ECC public key. As the NXP originality signature is on default not locked,
                        it may be re-programmed by the customer. If the originality check is not needed, it may
                        even be used as additional 32 byte user EEPROM.

                       and Originality Signature.

               8.1.3.3 Customer ID (CID)
                       The Customer ID at delivery is C000h and can be reprogrammed and locked. It might be
                       used to identify the product.
                       The two most significant bits (b7 and b6 of CID (MSB)) are always equal to 11b. Only
                       CID[13-0] may be written by customer. Note, that other values of the two most significant
                       bits are RFU.
                       When the CID is written with WRITE CONFIG command, the 2 most significant bits are
                       always set to 11b. The input CID in WRITE CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) is
                       bit wise ORed with C000h.
                       Example: When setting CID to 10AAh, resulting customer-specific CID is D0AAh.

                           The CID can be permanently locked by setting the Configuration Header to Locked state
                           (see Table 14) using WRITE CONFIG command. Note, that Originality Signature gets
                           locked, too.

                           The NFC Global Crypto Header (NFC_GCH) defines the status and access of the
                           • NFC passwords
                           As long as not locked by the RF section lock, the NFC Global Crypto Header can be
                           written with WRITE CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2). The programming of
                           NFC Global Crypto Header can be done in only one direction from lower state to higher
                           and it is irreversible.
                           Once locked (as per table below), GCH cannot be updated anymore.

                       Privacy password. The counter will be reset automatically to zero after a successful
                       authentication.

                       Byte 0 of Block 0Eh is LSB and Byte 1 is MSB of the NFC Authentication Limit counter
                       value.
                       The Authentication limit is enabled with the most significant bit of Byte 1 is set to 1b. The
                       remaining 15 bits of NFC_AUTH_LIMIT are defining the preset value.
                       T Counter can be written with a WRITE CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) if
                       • the Crypto Config Header is not set to "Locked" and NFC Global Crypto Header is not
                          set to "Locked", or
                       • a valid SET_PASSWORD command with the write password has been executed
                          before. In 64-bit password mode, both read and write passwords are required.
                       Examples:
                       • 8000h enables and presets the authentication limit to 0, which means the maximum
                          number of authentications (32767) before a preset is required again
                       • F000h enables and presets the authentication limit to 28672
                       If the NFC authentication limit counter reaches FFFFh, then SET_PASSWORD
                       command is permanently locked. No further authentication is possible.
                       Remark: The absolute maximum authentication limit value is FFFEh before a is required,
                       otherwise the authentication is irreversibly locked (no longer available).
               8.1.3.7 Passwords
                       The passwords are stored in the configuration memory.
                       Default password bytes of Privacy and Destroy password are all 0Fh, Read, Write and
                       EAS/AFI password bytes have a default value of all 00h.
                       The usage of passwords, read and write access to passwords depends upon NFC Global
                       Crypto Header settings.

                         PWM on and off times are coded by using maximum 12 bits. To code for example,
                         PWM0_ON as 0123h, PWM0_ON (LSB) is set to 23h, and PWM0_ON (MSB) is set to
                         01h.
               8.1.3.11 Energy harvesting settings
                         Energy harvesting configuration controls the behavior of the energy harvesting
                         output pin. If DISABLE_POWER_CHECK is 0b and energy harvesting is enabled
                         with EH_ENABLE is 1b, only when the applied field strength is sufficient to generate
                         configured minimum output load current (EH_IOUT_SEL) and voltage (EH_VOUT_SEL),
                         the energy harvesting output is enabled.
                         If energy harvesting will be enabled during the session with register bits,
                         EH_IOUT_SEL and EH_VOUT_SEL define the needed output power. However,
                         DISABLE_POWER_CHECK and EH_ENABLE bits need to be set to 0b in this case.
                         Details can be found in energy harvesting section (see Section 8.4).

                       pin depending on various events. As this pin is an open-drain active low implementation,
                       ED pin state ON means that signal is LOW and OFF means that signal is HIGH. More
                       details can be found in ED section (see Section 8.3.1).

                        User blocks can be blocked from writing by the NFC interface. These bits are one time
                        programmable. Once written to 1b, they cannot be changed back to 0b. Each bit locks
                        one block of user memory area (e.g., bit 0 of byte 0 locks block 0).These bytes can be
                        written by NFC. The access to these bytes for the particular interface can be restricted by
                        configuring the device SECTION_LOCK.

                       These lock configurations are provided to allow customer to initialize NTAG 5 switch
                       during customer configuration from NFC interface. After the configuration is done, it is
                       recommended to write the appropriate lock conditions and lock the device configuration
                       bytes.
                       These lock bytes take the highest priority above all locks. Different section access
                       conditions have to be chosen appropriately, so that the other interface does not change
                       and corrupt the other interface security configuration.
                       If NFC_LOCK_0 bits are set to 1b, then the lock bytes cannot be updated and gets
                       locked permanently.

                      Note: Section 8 (Device configuration lock bytes) is always readable.
                      In case of not readable and/or not writeable, IC responds with an error from NFC
                      perspective, when trying to access locked sections.
                8.1.4 Session Registers
                      After POR, the content of the configuration settings (see Section 8.1.3) is loaded
                      into the session register. The values of session registers can be changed during a
                      session. Change to session registers take effect immediately, but only for the current
                      communication session. After POR, the session registers values will again contain the
                      configuration register values as before.
                      To change the default behavior, changes to the related configuration bytes are needed,
                      but the related effect will only be visible after the next POR.
                      Session registers starting from block A3h until the end may be write protected with
                      LOCK_REGISTER bit.
                      Most of the parameters are defined in the configuration memory section.

               8.1.4.4 Pulse Width Modulation Duty Cycle Register
                       The PWM duty cycle maybe changed during one session from NFC perspective (see
                       Section 8.1.3.10).
               8.1.4.5 Energy Harvesting Register
                       Energy harvesting registers may be used to enable energy harvesting during one
                       NFC session. In this case, EH_ENABLE bit of EH_CONFIG byte in block 3Dh is set
                       to 0b. Required EH_VOUT_I_SEL and EH_VOUT_V_SEL need to be set in that
                       EH_CONFIG byte. Desired energy harvesting mode (EH_MODE) needs to be configured
                       in CONFIG_0 byte of block 37h. In case of energy harvesting is enabled already during
                       boot (EH_ENABLE bit of EH_CONFIG is 1b), or energy harvesting is not used at all, this
                       register byte gives no information.
                       Setting EH_TRIGGER to 1b is needed to trigger power detection.
                       Polling for bit EH_LOAD_OK should be used to check, if sufficient energy is available.
                       Only if EH_LOAD_OK = 1b, energy harvesting may be enabled via session registers by
                       writing 09h to this byte.
                       Details can be found in energy harvesting section (see Section 8.4).

                       Event detection and field detection functionality define the behavior of the ED pin
                       depending on various events. Indicated event may be changed during one session. More
                       details can be found in ED section (see Section 8.3.1).
               8.1.4.7 System Reset Generation
                       System reset can be generated by writing to RESET_GEN_REG register using WRITE
                       CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2). Writing E7h will trigger the system reset. This
                       byte gets automatically reset after the system reset.

                   8.2 NFC interface
                       The definition of the NFC interface is according to the ISO/IEC 15693 and NFC Forum
                       Type 5 Tag. The details of passive communication mode are described in Section 8.2.1.
                8.2.1 Passive communication mode
                       Main uses cases for passive communication mode are Smart Metering, Home
                       automation and in the box configuration. With antenna sizes of Class 4 or bigger, energy
                       harvesting on the one side and long-distance read/write access to the EEPROM is
                       possible in a very efficient way.

             8.2.2.1.1 State transitions from and to POWER-OFF state
                       If NFC field is switched off or below, HMIN NTAG 5 switch goes to POWER-OFF state.
                       POWER-OFF state will be left to READY state no later than 1 ms after NTAG 5 switch is
                       powered by an NFC field greater than HMIN.
                       NOTE: When loading default data to mirrored SRAM, start-up time, dependent on the
                       pre-loaded bytes, might be greater than 1 ms.

                          The READ CONFIG command returns configuration memory content starting with the
                          first block defined by the Block Address and reads Number of Blocks + 1 configuration
                          blocks.
                          Access to the configuration blocks depends on the status and definition of the related
                          block within the configuration memory (see Section 8.1.3).
                          If one of the requested configuration blocks is not accessible due to the actual status,
                          NTAG 5 switch will respond with Error_flag set.
                          A READ CONFIG command can read one or multiple blocks of the following areas of the
                          configuration memory within one command execution:
                          • Block 00h to block 17h
                          • rest of configuration memory
                          Only Option_flag = 0b is supported.

                          the configuration memory.
                          Access to the configuration blocks depends on the status and definition of the related
                          block within the configuration memory (see Section 8.1.3).
                          If the requested configuration block is not write accessible due to the actual status, NTAG
                          5 switch will respond with Error_flag set.
                          The timing of the command is write alike.
                          Option_flag = 0b and Option_flag = 1b is supported and is in accordance with ISO/IEC
                          15693 write-alike commands.

                       transmitted first with a SET PASSWORD command.
                       If the 64-bit password protection is enabled, both passwords are required for read & write
                       access to protected blocks.
                       Once the 64-bit password protection is enabled, a change back to 32-bit password
                       protection (read and write password) is not possible.
                       Remark: A retransmission of the passwords is not required after the execution of the 64-
                       bit PASSWORD PROTECTION command.
                       Remark: The 64-bit PASSWORD PROTECTION does not include the 16-bit counter
                       block.
                       The timing of the command is write alike.

                   The PROTECT PAGE command defines the protection pointer address of the user
                   memory to divide the user memory into two arbitrarily sized pages and defines the
                   access conditions for the two pages.
                   The protection pointer address defines the base address of the higher user memory
                   segment Page 0-H. All block addresses smaller than the protection pointer address are in
                   the user memory segment Page 0-L.
                   Table below shows an example of the user memory segmentation with the protection
                   pointer address PP_AREA_0H 14h.
                   Remark: In the example below PP_AREA_1 is pointing outside the user memory.

                   defined as Page 0-H.
                   The access conditions and the protection pointer address can be changed under the
                   following circumstances for plain password mode:
                   • The related passwords (Read and Write password) have been transmitted first with the
                      SET PASSWORD command.
                   • The page protection condition is not locked (see Section 8.2.3.3.7)
                   The timing of the command is write alike.
                   Option_flag = 0b and Option_flag = 1b is supported and is in accordance with ISO/IEC

                        • Standard mode (most significant bit of mask length byte equal 0b)
                           (see Section 8.2.3.4.1.1)
                        • Extended mode (most significant bit of mask length byte equal 1b)
                           The extended mode offers additional features to optimize the inventory procedure for
                           different requirements (see Section 8.2.3.4.1.2)
                        The INVENTORY READ command may also be transmitted in addressed or SELECTED
                        mode. Then the command behaves similar to a READ or READ MULTIPLE BLOCK (see
                        Section 8.2.3.4.1.3).
            8.2.3.4.1.1 Standard mode
                        If most significant bit of mask length byte is equal 0b the INVENTORY READ command
                        is used in the standard mode.
                        If the Inventory_flag is set to 1b and an error is detected, NTAG 5 switch remains silent.
                        If the Option flag is set to 0b, n blocks of data are transmitted. If the Option flag is set to
                        1b, n blocks of data and the part of the UID which is not part of the mask are transmitted.
                        The request contains:
                        •  Flags
                        •  INVENTORY READ command code

                        •  AFI (if AFI_flag is set to 1b)
                        •  Mask length (most significant bit equal 0b)
                        •  Mask value (if mask length > 00h)
                        •  First block number to be read
                        •  Number of blocks to be read

                          NTAG 5 switch reads the requested block(s) and sends back their value in the response.
                          Additionally the bytes of the UID, which are not parts of the mask and the slot number
                          in case of 16 slots, are returned. Instead of padding with zeros up to the next byte
                          boundary, the corresponding bits of the UID are returned. The mechanism and timing
                          of the INVENTORY READ command perform the same as the INVENTORY command
                          which is defined in ISO/IEC 15693.
                          Remark: The number of bits of the retransmitted UID can be calculated as follows:
                          • 16 slots: 60 bits (bit 64 to bit 4) - mask length rounded up to the next byte boundary
                          • 1 slot: 64 bits - mask length rounded up to the next byte boundary
                          Remark: If the sum of first block number and number of blocks exceeds the total
                          available number of user blocks, the number of transmitted blocks is less than the
                          requested number of blocks. This means that the last returned block is the highest
                          available user block, followed by the 16-bit CRC and the EOF.
                          Example: mask length = 30 bits
                          Returned: bit 64 to bit 4 (30 bits) = 30 gives 4 bytes

                                Multiple of 8 bits                               Repeated as needed
                         The mechanism and timing of the INVENTORY READ command performs the same as
                         at the INVENTORY command which is defined in ISO/IEC 15693.
                         If the UID is requested in the truncated format the retransmitted UID can be calculated as
                         follows:
                         16 slots: 64 - 4 - mask length rounded up to the next byte boundary
                         1 slot: 64 - mask length rounded up to the next byte boundary
                         Example: mask length = 30 Returned: 64 - 4 - 30 = 30 gives 4 bytes

                                                                                                                                    Interrogator
                                                           returned value                                                           transmitted by NTAG 5
                                                                                                                                    switch
            8.2.3.4.1.3  Addressed and SELECTED mode
                         The INVENTORY READ command can also be transmitted in the addressed or
                         SELECTED mode. In this case, the Inventory_flag is set to 0 and the meaning of flags 7
                         to 4 is in accordance with ISO/IEC 15693.
                         In the addressed or selected mode, the INVENTORY READ command behaves similar to
                         a READ or READ MULTIPLE BLOCK command.
                         In the addressed mode, it is recommended to address the IC with a mask length of 64
                         and to transmit the complete UID in the mask value field.
                         In the selected mode (IC has been selected with a valid SELECT command before), it is
                         recommended to address the IC with a mask length of 0 (and do not transmit the mask
                         value field).
                         Remark: If the INVENTORY READ command is used in the addressed or selected
                         mode, the AFI shall not be transmitted and the IC will only respond in the first-time slot.
             8.2.3.4.2 FAST INVENTORY READ
                         Command code = A1h
                         When receiving the FAST INVENTORY READ command, NTAG 5 switch behaves the
                         same as the INVENTORY READ command with the following exceptions:
                         The data rate in the direction NTAG 5 switch to the reader is twice as defined in ISO/IEC
                         15693 depending on the Datarate_flag 53 kbit (high data rate) or 13 kbit (low data rate).
                         The data rate from the reader to NTAG 5 switch and the time between the rising edge
                         of the EOF from the reader to NTAG 5 switch remains unchanged (stays the same as
                         defined in ISO/IEC 15693).

                          The EAS ALARM command can be used in the following configurations:
                          • Option_flag is set to 0b:
                             EAS ID mask length and EAS ID value shall not be transmitted.
                             If the EAS mode is enabled, the EAS response is returned from the IC.
                          • Option_flag is set to 1b:
                             Within the command, the EAS ID mask length has to be transmitted to identify how
                             many bits of the following EAS ID value are valid (multiple of 8-bits). Only those ICs will
                             respond with the EAS sequence which have stored the corresponding data in the EAS
                             ID configuration (selective EAS) and if the EAS Mode is set.
                             If the EAS ID mask length is set to 00h, the IC will answer with its EAS ID.

                       Command code = A6h
                       The PROTECT EAS/AFI command enables the password protection for EAS and/or AFI
                       if the EAS/AFI password is first transmitted with the SET PASSWORD command.
                       Option_flag set to 0b: EAS will be protected.
                       Option_flag set to 1b: AFI will be protected.
                       Both protections (AFI and EAS) can be enabled separately.
                       Once the EAS/AFI protection is enabled, it is not possible to change back to unprotected
                       EAS and/or AFI.
                       The timing of the command is write-alike as of write commands with Option_flag set to
                       0b.
                       Note: Option_flag is only related to the parameter to be locked, and NOT to the response
                       behavior.

                        reader and NTAG 5 switch to ensure very reliable data transmission:
                        •  16-bit CRC per block
                        •  Bit count checking
                        •  Bit coding to distinguish between logic 1, logic 0, and no information
                        •  Channel monitoring (protocol sequence and bit stream analysis)
                8.2.5 Error Handling
               8.2.5.1 Transmission Errors
                        According to ISO/IEC 15693 NTAG 5 switch will not respond if a transmission error
                        (CRC, bit coding, bit count, wrong framing) is detected and will silently wait for the next
                        correct received command.

               8.2.5.2 Not supported commands or options
                       If the received command or option is not supported, the behavior depends on the
                       addressing mechanism.
                       • Non-Addressed Mode
                          NTAG 5 switch remains silent
                       • Addressed or selected Mode
                          NTAG 5 switch responds with error code 0Fh (no information given, or error code not
                          supported).
                          If the Inventory flag or the Protocol Extension flag is set, the IC will not respond if the
                          command or option is not supported.
                       • Parameter out of range
                          – Read alike commands
                             If the sum of the first block number and the number of blocks exceeds the total
                             available number of user blocks, the number of transmitted blocks is less than the
                             requested number of blocks. This means that the last returned block is the highest
                             available user block, followed by the 16-bit CRC and the EOF.
                          – Write alike commands
                             If the address of a block to be written does not exist or a block to be written is locked,
                             the behavior of the IC depends on the addressing mechanism.
                             – Non-Addressed Mode
                                  NTAG 5 switch remains silent.
                             – Addressed or SELECTED Mode
                                  NTAG 5 switch responds with error code 0Fh (no information given, or error code
                                  not supported).
                   8.3 Wired Interface
                       NTAG 5 switch has not only an NFC interface, but also a wired interface. Details are
                       described in following clauses.
                8.3.1 Event detection
                       The event detection feature provides the capability to trigger an external device (e.g.,
                       µController) or switch on the connected circuitry by an external power management unit
                       depending on activities on the NFC interface. On top this active low pin can be used as
                       one of the two possible PWM channels.
                       As the event detection pin functionality is operated via NFC field power, VCC supply for
                       the IC itself is only required when ED pin is used as PWM channel.
                       NOTE: In some cases VOUT pin might be used as field detection trigger.
                       The configurable events indicated at event detection pin are:
                       •  The presence/absence of the NFC field
                       •  NDEF Message TLV length field is ZERO/non-ZERO
                       •  IC is/is not in standby mode
                       •  Dedicated config bit is ZERO
                       •  Write/Read command ongoing
                       Event detection pin is an active LOW signal. Due to open-drain implementation an
                       external pull-up resistor shall be used on this pin.
                       How to use the event detection pin in applications is described in AN11203.

                8.3.2 GPIO
                      At POR, the GPIO are set to high-impedance state. When configuration is read, the pins
                      are controlled to behave as per the configuration.
                      GPIOs can be configured to be either input or output (see Section 8.1.3.9). In input
                      mode, the status of the pad will be available in one of the session register bits. In output
                      mode status depends on the session register/config bits content.
                      How to use the GPIO pins in applications is described in AN11203.
                8.3.3 PWM
                      GPIO pins and ED pin are multiplexed and can be used as a pulse width modulation
                      output. GPIO pins have push-pull architecture, ED pin is an open-drain implementation,
                      which means the PWM signal gets inverted.
                      PWM resolution, pre-scalar factor (see Section 8.1.3.9) as well as duty cycle can be
                      configured using configuration bytes (see Section 8.1.3.10).
                      The pulse width modulation resolution (PWMx_RESOLUTION_CONF) defines the
                      maximum number of pulses that are available in the given PWM period. PWM resolution
                      can be set independently for both outputs to either 6, 8, 10 or 12 bits.
                      The 2-bit PWMx_PRESCALE value divides the PWM input frequency (1695 kHz) by a
                      factor of 1, 2, 4 or 8.

                      PWMx_ON and PWMx_OFF defines the starting point and end point of the PWMx output
                      is asserted to HIGH.
                      To calculate proper PWMx_ON (start of HIGH level) and PWMx_OFF (end of HIGH level)
                      values, PWMx_RESOLUTION_CONF value and PWM_PRESCALE values need to be
                      set to achieve desired PWM frequency. As an example 12-bit resolution is chosen. Duty
                      cycle shall be set to 20 % and start time shall be 10 % offset.

                8.3.4 Standby mode
                       To minimize overall current consumption, when the IC is supplied via VCC NTAG 5 switch
                       can be set to standby mode by writing related session bit form NFC perspective. The
                       IC will leave standby mode when NFC field is detected, automatically, or HPD pin gets
                       pulled to HIGH for at least 20 µs and released again. In standby mode the current is
                       typically less than 6 µA.
                       Worst case standby current consumption values can be found in Section 10.1 table.
                       In case GPIO/PWM pins are not used the pins can be left floating. However, to ensure
                       lowest standby current, following settings are needed:
                       CONFIG bytes USE_CASE_CONF shall be set in any case to GPIO/PWM, both pins
                       SDA_GPIO1 and SCL_GPIO0 shall be set as input using weak pull-up (GPIOx_IN in).
                       Block 37h: CONFIG_1, USE_CASE_CONF shall be set to GPIO/PWM (10b) and
                       CONFIG, GPIOx_IN, both shall be set to plain input with weak pullup (01b).
                       Block 39h: PWM_GPIO_CONFIG_0, SDA_GPIO1 and SCL_GPIO0 shall both be set to
                       1b to define them as general-purpose input.
                8.3.5 Hard power-down mode
                       In hard power-down mode NTAG 5 switch is switched off using hard power down pin.
                       When pulled to HIGH, the hard power down current is typically less than 0.25 µA. This
                       mode can only be left by connecting HPD pin to ground.
                       There is no hard power-down mode, when using SO8 packaged version of NTAG 5
                       switch.
                       Worst case hard power down current consumption values can be found in Section 10.1
                       table.
                   8.4 Energy harvesting
                       NTAG 5 switch provides the capability to supply external low-power devices with energy
                       harvested from the NFC field of an NFC device.
                       When DISABLE_POWER_CHECK bit is set to 0b, minimum provided output power can
                       be configured by setting desired voltage and minimum required output current in the
                       related configuration bytes (see Section 8.1.3.11).
                       WARNING: Sufficient RF field is required when DISABLE_ POWER_CHECK is
                       set to 0b to have access to EEPROM. As long as NTAG 5 switch detects too less

                                                    NTAG 5 switch - NFC Forum-compliant PWM and GPIO bridge
                   energy to be harvested from the field only INVENTORY command and READ/WRITE
                   CONFIGURATION to access session registers will be handled. This feature ensures
                   a stable system, as the host will only be supplied if there is sufficient energy available.
                   However, during design phase we recommend disabling this power check.
                   The provided output power in general of course depends on many parameters like the
                   strength of the NFC field, the antenna size, or the distance from the NFC device. The
                   design ensures with the right settings, that VOUT is only enabled, when sufficient energy
                   can be harvested from the NFC field.
                   1.8 V, 2.4 V or 3 V output voltage can be selected by coding EH_VOUT_V_SEL
                   accordingly.
                   Minimum required load current can be coded in EH_VOUT_I_SEL configuration field.
                   VOUT and VCC need to be connected as soon as energy harvesting is used. Otherwise
                   there is no EEPROM access possible from NFC perspective and status registers may
                   contain invalid information.
                   Appropriate capacitor dependent on load needs to be placed between VOUT and ground
                   to close energy gaps during miller pauses. An example circuit is illustrated in the figure
                   below.
                   VOUT pin shall be kept floating (not connected) in case energy harvesting feature is not
                   used. If energy harvesting is disabled, pin will be connected to GND internally.
                   With EH_ENABLE configuration bit st to 1b, energy harvesting will be enabled after boot,
                   automatically and all energy harvesting-related session register bits are meaningless.
                   When enabling energy harvesting via session registers, EH_MODE, EH_VOUT_SEL
                   and EH_IOUT_SEL needs to be configured properly in the related configuration bytes.
                   EH_ENABLE configuration bit need to be 0b in this case.
                   After boot, session registers can be used to first trigger current detection by setting
                   EH_TRIGGER to 1b, then poll for EH_LOAD_OK that gets 1b and finally set
                   EH_TRIGGER and EH_ENABLE to 1b, or directly enable energy harvesting by setting
                   EH_TRIGGER and EH_ENABLE bit to 1b (see Table 66).
                                                                                                           VOUT configurable to 1.8 V, 2.4 V or 3 V

                   8.5 Security
                       NTAG 5 switch implements different levels to protect data. The easiest, but efficient
                       method is to lock EEPROM to read only.
                       With the plain password authentication scheme, the memory can be split in three
                       different parts with different access conditions.
                       Configuration area can be protected as well.
                       Further implementation details can be found in AN12366.
                8.5.1 Locking EEPROM to read only
                       Independent on the split of the memory, the user memory may be locked to read-only.
                       If the user EEPROM shall stay in read/write state, the LOCK BLOCK command can be
                       disabled and lock block sections can be locked. With these features, it can be ensured,
                       NTAG 5 switch stays in read/write state.
                       Locking the complete EEPROM to read-only as defined in NFC Forum Type 5 Tag
                       specification is quite time consuming. Every single block needs to be addressed by
                       a LOCK BLOCK command (see Section 8.2.3.4). To accelerate this locking, NTAG 5
                       switch stores the information in the configuration area. With this feature, locking the
                       EEPROM can be accelerated by a factor of 16.

                8.5.2 Memory Areas
                       The memory may be split into three different configurable areas with different access
                       conditions.
                       Highest priority has the 16-bit Protection Pointer PP_AREA_1. It splits the memory into
                       an AREA_0 and an AREA_1 at the address configured with the PP_AREA_1.
                       The area below this address can be split into two more areas with the 8-bit PP_AREA_0-
                       H (see Section 8.1.3.18) .
                       AREA_0-L, usually used to store NDEF messages, starts from block 0. AREA_0-H,
                       usually used as password protected area to store private data, starts from block address
                       configured by the 8-bit PP_AREA_0H and ends just before the block addressed with the
                       PP_AREA_1 configuration byte. If PP_AREA_1 points outside the addressable memory
                       space, only AREA_0-L and AREA_0-H are available.
                       The concept is illustrated in the Figure below and further details can be found in
                       AN12366.

                8.5.3 Plain password authentication
                       NTAG 5 switch implements plain password authentication scheme from NFC
                       perspective.
                       In summary, seven 32-bit passwords are available from NFC perspective.
                       •  Read
                       •  Write
                       •  Restricted AREA_1 Read
                       •  Restricted AREA_1 Write
                       •  Destroy
                       •  NFC Privacy password (is used to come out of NFC PRIVACY mode)
                       •  EAS/AFI protection
                       64-bit password protection can be enabled for read and write operations.
                       A 32-bit password is used to authenticate, before doing memory operations. The
                       mechanism is easy to use. After setting and locking the password, and setting right
                       access conditions in initialization phase, the NFC Device needs to fetch a random
                       number from the ICs. XORing the plain password and this random number results in
                       used password to authenticate.
                       To resist brute force attacks, a negative authentication counter can be enabled.
                       How to use plain password authentication in applications is described in AN12366.

                       (curve name secp128r1), according to the ECDSA algorithm. The use of a standard
                       algorithm and curve ensures easy software integration of the originality check procedure
                       in NFC devices without specific hardware requirements.
                       The UID is signed with an NXP private key and the resulting 32 byte signature is stored
                       in the configuration memory during IC production.
                       The originality signature is stored in the configuration memory block 00h to block 07h.

                   This signature can be retrieved using the READ_SIGNATURE command or with
                   the READ CONFIG command and can be verified in the NFC device by using the
                   corresponding ECC public key provided by NXP. In case the NXP public key is stored
                   in the reader device, the complete signature verification procedure can be performed
                   offline.
                   To verify the signature (for example with the use of the public domain crypto library
                   OpenSSL) the tool domain parameters shall be set to secp128r1, defined within the
                   standards for elliptic curve cryptography SEC.
                   NTAG 5 switch provides the possibility to customize the originality signature to
                   personalize the IC individually for specific application. At delivery, the NTAG 5 switch
                   is pre-programmed with the NXP originality signature described above. This signature
                   is unlocked in the dedicated memory. If needed, the signature can be reprogrammed
                   with a custom-specific signature using the WRITE CONFIG command during the
                   personalization process by the customer. The signature can be permanently locked
                   afterwards by setting the Config Header to “locked” with the WRITE CONFIG command
                   to avoid further modifications.
                   In any case, it is recommended to permanently lock the originality signature during the
                   initialization process by setting the Config Header to lock with the WRITE CONFIG
                   command.
                   How to use and verify Originality Signature in applications is described in AN11350.
                   How to generate Originality Signature is described in AN11859.
