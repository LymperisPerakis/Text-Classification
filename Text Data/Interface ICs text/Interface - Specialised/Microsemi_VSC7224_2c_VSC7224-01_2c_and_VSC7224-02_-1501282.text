4-Channel Multirate Adaptive Retimer
Microsemi’s EQNOX™ family of advanced unidirectional adaptive             Highlights
retimers equalize deteriorated input signals while dissipating the lowest • World-class adaptive equalization
possible power.
                                                                          • Up to 12.5 Gbps operation
The VSC7224 devices are 4-channel unidirectional adaptive channel         • 18 dB programmable output de-emphasis
extenders with CDR. They incorporate analog and digital equalization,
                                                                          • Retimer and redriver modes
clock and data recovery, and output de-emphasis. VSC7224 supports
data rates up to 12.5 Gbps. VSC7224-01 supports data rates up to          • Built-in VScope™
11.5 Gbps. VSC7224-02 supports data rates up to 10.3 Gbps.                • On-chip frequency synthesizers
The VSC7224 devices are simple-to-use copper media receivers
and drivers that provide electrical compensation to cable, copper,
                                                                          Applications
and backplane environments to increase system margin and media            • Line, backplane, and copper cable driver,
                                                                            receiver, and retimer
driving distances. Target applications include Ethernet, Fibre Channel,
Infiniband, CPRI, OTN, and many others, accomodating a wide               • PCB signal enhancement
collection of both standard and proprietary protocols. They equalize      • Optical module retimer and receiver
greater than 40 inches of FR-4 at 10 Gbps and greater than 10 m of
24AWG of copper direct-attached cable at 10 Gbps.
The VSC7224 devices can be used either on their own or with an
external microcontroller to control, monitor, and enhance system
performance.
The VSC7224 devices feature Microsemi’s proprietary FlexEQ™
technology to equalize deteriorated input signals while dissipating the
lowest possible power. A low-cost 25 MHz crystal, along with on-chip
frequency synthesizers, allows for CDR operation at any data rate. Its
three-tap FIR output driver architecture enables up to 18 dB of de-
emphasis.
The VSC7224 devices include Microsemi’s patented VScope input
signal monitoring integrated circuit signal monitoring and waveform
viewing technology.
