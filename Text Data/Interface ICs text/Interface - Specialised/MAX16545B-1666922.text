Pin Description
  PIN           NAME                                                     FUNCTION
    1        SMBUS_CLK  SMBus Clock Node.
                        Analog Current Representation of the Load Current. Connect this pin to ground through a properly
                        sized resistor for proper voltage representation. Always keep this pin connected to ground through
    2           ILOAD
                        a resistor. A capacitor parallel to the RILOAD resistor is required (see Figure 6 for the recommended
                        value).
                        Soft-Start Node. A capacitor is connected from SS to GND to program soft-start. The soft-start
                        program capacitor should not exceed 75nF. If a fast-load transient (di/dt > 2.5A/ms) resulting in fast
    3             SS
                        and large transient output voltage deviation is possible in the application, an additional capacitor
                        between SS and VOUT is recommended to keep the pass FET VGS above its UVLO threshold.
                        Charge-Pump Supply for Pass FET Gate Drive. Connect this node to VOUT through a 220nF bypass
    4            VBST   capacitor. This supply is designed to be used by the MAX16545B/C and the MAX16543 only. No
                        additional load or external components other than a bypass capacitor are allowed on the BST pin.
   5-8           VOUT   12V Output Power—Load Side.
  9-12            VIN   12V Input Power—Power Supply Side.
   13            GND    Ground. Connect this node to GND plane through vias for proper operation.
                        12V Input Voltage UVLO pin. Normally connected to the center node of a resistor-divider connected
                        from VIN to ground. A properly sized capacitor can be placed in parallel to the bottom resistor of the
   14          EN/UVLO
                        resistor-divider for additional filtering. In addition to 12V UVLO programming, this node can be used
                        to enable/disable the MAX16545B/C.
   15      SMBUS_ALERT  SMBus Alert. Open-drain, active-low pin.
                        Fault Communication (Bidirectional) Pin. This pin is used to indicate/receive detection of latching
   16           FAULT   fault. See the FAULT Reporting section for more details. Connect this pin to the system bias supply
                        rail through a 10kΩ resistor. 5V compliant, active-low pin.
                        Report VIN and VOUT status. See the Power Good (PWRGD) Output section for more details.
   17          PWRGD
                        Connect this pin to system bias supply rail through a 10kΩ resistor. 5V compliant.
                        Moderate OCP Threshold Programming Input. Connect this pin to GND using an appropriate
   18           ROCP    programming resistor. See the Moderate OCP Threshold section for additional details. No other
                        components are allowed on this pin.
   19       SMBUS_DATA  SMBus Data Node.
                        SMBus Address Programming and Current Hysteresis Flag. Connect this pin to GND through a
   20         SMBUS_ID
                        properly sized resistor to select desired address setting.
                        System Current Reporting Input Pin. If current reporting from a single MAX16545B/C device is
                        desired, connect this pin to GND through a 10kΩ resistor. Use this pin to sum currents from up to
   21         ILOAD_IN  two MAX16543 devices if used in higher-current applications. In this case, the connection from the
                        ILOAD pin of MAX16543 to ILOAD_IN of MAX16545B/C should be made through a 500Ω resistor.
                        Refer to the MAX16543 Follower Device section for details.
                        Internal 1.8V Linear Regulator (LDO) Output. Connect this pin to GND through a 1μF (or higher)
   22            VDD    capacitor. See Figure 6 for the correct value. No additional loads or components other than up to two
                        MAX16543 devices and external properly sized capacitor are allowed on the VDD pin.

MAX16545C                            MOSFET, Lossless Current Sensing, and PMBus Interface
CONFIG Register (D0h)
This is a 2-byte register used to configure the MAX16545B/C. The default value is 0000h. The meaning of the bits of this
register is shown in Table 12.
CONFIG_2 Register (DDh)
This single-byte register allows the selection of the number of samples to average for voltage, current and power report-
ing. It also sets the threshold for startup OCP. Only bits 5:0 are used; bits 7:6 have no effect and should be left as 00b.
The meaning of the bits of this register is shown in Table 13

●● Place input capacitors (where applicable) as close to
   the IC as possible.
●● Place output capacitors as close to the IC as pos-
   sible.
Example
The EV kit layout in Figure 7 shows use of large, wide
power planes for VIN and VOUT on the top layer. CIN and
COUT are close to the IC. The other VIN and VOUT power
layers are connected with multiple vias between the pins.
Ground
●● Use a trace approximately 0.1mm wide by 0.7mm
   long from the ground pin (pin 13) on the top layer to
   the second-layer AGND island.
