1   General description
              Optimized for sensor-driven applications, this highly integrated NFC IC creates a secure,
              standard-based link from the device to the cloud, in a future proof way to address and
              even power sensors.
              NTAG 5 link is available in two different variants (see Section 4). NTP5332 supports all
                                                                        2
              features of NTP5312, and on top of these, it offers also I C master features, as well as
              AES mutual authentication.
              NXP's NTAG 5 link lets designers of sensor-equipped systems add an NFC interface
                                                                     2
              with a wired host interface that’s configurable as an I C master/slave, a pulse width
              modulator (PWM), or a general-purpose I/O (GPIO). Operating at 13.56 MHz, it is an
              NFC Forum-compliant Type 5 Tag (customer development board is NFC Forum certified
              - Certification ID: 58626) that can be read and written by an NFC-enabled device at close
              range and by an ISO/IEC 15693-enabled industrial reader over a longer range.
                                                                                      l 2C

                                                                                                                      2
              The NTAG 5 link can act as a direct bridge between an NFC-enabled device and any I C
              slave, such as a sensor or external memory. This is especially useful in environments
              that require zero-power, single-shot measurements.
              With NTAG 5 link, the device can connect to the cloud with a single tap. The connection
              uses an NFC Forum-compliant data exchange mechanism involving SRAM to ensure
              highly interoperable data transfers.
              Support for ISO/IEC 15693 lets the NTAG 5 link communicate securely in two ways: with
              powerful industrial readers, at a range of up to 60 cm and with NFC-enabled devices
              in proximity range. This duality makes it possible for the device to be calibrated and
              parameterized automatically while in the factory and then, when put to be used in the
              field, safely communicate with contactless devices such as mobile phones.
              NTAG 5 link offers 2048 bytes (16384 bits) bytes of memory which can be divided
              into three areas, and each area can use a different protection level, varying from no

                   mutual authentication protected read/write access.
                   The NTAG 5 link comes with pre-programmed proof-of-origin functionality to verify
                   authenticity. The ECC-based originality signature can be reprogrammed or locked by the
                   customer.
                   The NTAG 5 link can operate without a battery by drawing power from the NFC reader
                   instead. It supports energy harvesting, which means it can be used to supply power to
                   other components in the system. When sufficient energy is available, NTAG 5 link can
                   supply a fixed, configurable voltage level to ensure a stable overall system.

8       Functional description
                   8.1 Memory Organization
                8.1.1 General
                       The entire memory is divided into three different parts:
                       • User memory
                         – This part of the memory is intended to be used to store user data. It is organized in
                           blocks of 4 bytes each (see Section 8.1.2).
                         – According to NFC Forum Type 5 Tag Specification, EEPROM block 0 contains the
                           Capability Container directly followed by the NDEF Message TLV. If NTAG 5 link is
                           used in a proprietary way, any user data may be stored in the user memory. Direct
                           read/write access with the standard READ BLOCK and WRITE BLOCK commands
                           (see Section 8.2.3.5) to this part of the memory is possible depending on the related
                           security and write protection conditions.
                         – 16-bit counter
                           The last block of the EEPROM memory from NFC perspective contains the 16-bit
                           counter and the counter protection flag (see Section 8.1.2.1). This counter is not
                                                   2
                           accessible from I C perspective.
                       • Configuration area
                         – Within this part of the memory all configuration options are stored (see Section 8.1.3).
                           This memory area can only be accessed with the READ CONFIG (see
                           Section 8.2.3.2.1) or WRITE CONFIG (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) commands from NFC
                                                        2
                           perspective. From I C perspective, normal READ and WRITE commands are used.
                         – The configuration area contains required security-related information, such as access
                           keys with related privileges, headers, customer ID (CID), originality signature and
                           many more which will be loaded at power-on reset.
                         – Access to configuration blocks may be blocked at all or password protected with
                           related configuration bits.
                         – All session registers are accessible in the configuration area as long as not locked
                           by LOCK_SESSION_REG. These configuration items can be changed on the fly and
                           have immediate effect, but get lost after power-on reset.
                       • SRAM
                         – SRAM is accessible when NTAG 5 link is VCC supplied and SRAM_ENABLE is set to
                           1b.
                         – Volatile SRAM can be used for fast and frequent data transfer (see Section 8.1.5).
                           With WRITE SRAM (see Section 8.2.3.6.2) and READ SRAM (see Section 8.2.3.6.1),
                           the content is written or read.
                         – When the SRAM gets mapped to user memory (the start address is always block 0
                           from both interfaces), then standard READ BLOCK and WRITE BLOCK commands
                           can be used. This mechanism is used, e.g., for PHDC or dynamic pairing.
                                  2
                         – From I C perspective, SRAM is always located from address 2000h to 203Fh.
                       WARNING: The content of bytes and bits defined as RFU SHALL NOT be changed.
                8.1.2 User memory
                       According to NFC Forum Type 5 Tag Specification, the user accessible EEPROM
                       memory is divided into blocks. A block is the smallest access unit. For NTAG 5 link,

                       each block consists of 4 bytes (1 block = 32 bits). Bit 0 in each byte represents the least
                       significant bit (lsb) and bit 7 the most significant bit (msb), respectively.
                                                                                                                      2
                       User EEPROM map looks totally the same from NFC and I C perspective.
                       The last block contains the 16-bit counter (see Section 8.1.2.1). It is only accessible from
                       NFC perspective.
                       NTAG 5 link offers 2048 bytes (16384 bits) of user memory.

                             00h              Incrementing of the counter value is not protected
      3         PROT         01h              Incrementing of the counter value is protected with the read password or by
                                              mutual authentication depending on the used security level
                        The counter can be preset to a start value with an (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK
                        command to counter block. The counter can only be preset to a start value after a SET
                        PASSWORD command with the write password or a valid mutual authentication with a
                        key with the Write privilege, depending on the used security level.
                        The PROT byte (data byte 3) value defines if the protection to increment the counter is
                        enabled or disabled. If the protection is enabled, the read password or a valid mutual
                        authentication with a key with the Read privilege is required to increment the counter
                        value, again depending on the used security level.
                        The data for the (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK command to preset the counter
                        is defined in Table 9.
                        Remark: A Preset counter value of 0x0001 is not possible, a (EXTENDED) WRITE
                        SINGLE BLOCK command with that value will only increment the counter.

                                               authentication
                        To increment the counter by one with a (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK
                        command to counter block. If the protection to increment the counter is enabled, a SET
                        PASSWORD command with the read password or a valid mutual authentication with a
                        key with the Read privilege is required before.
                        The data for the (EXTENDED) WRITE SINGLE BLOCK command to increment the
                        counter is defined in Table 10.

                          been executed before or leads to an error message.

                8.1.3 Configuration Memory
                          The configuration memory contains the security and configuration information. Access
                          to this memory area is only possible with WRITE CONFIG (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) and
                          READ CONFIG (see Section 8.2.3.2.1) commands depending on the initialization status.
                          Writing to blocks with only RFU bytes is not possible and results in error code 0Fh from
                                                                               2
                          NFC perspective and NAK from I C perspective. Reading complete RFU blocks results in
                          receiving all bytes 00h.
                          Changing RFU bytes and bits is not allowed and may result in unintended behavior.
                                  2
                          From I C perspective, the configuration can be accessed using READ MEMORY and
                                                                                                                                      2
                          WRITE MEMORY command. Block address of configuration area from I C perspective
                          starts from 1000h.
                          In Table 11 all NFC_KHs, NFC_KPs and AES_KEYs (all marked with an asterisk) are
                          only available in AES mode. NFC_KHs and NFC_KPs are not available at all and set to
                          RFU in plain password mode. In the area of KEY_0 and KEY_1, the plain passwords are
                          stored (see Section 8.1.3.9). The rest of the KEY area is RFU in plain password mode.
                          NOTE: AES mode is only available for NTP5332.
                          Different features can be configured with CONFIG bits. Similar to all other configuration
                          options, the effect does not take place in the current session. The effect takes place after
                          POR. If immediate change is expected, related session register bytes or bits need to be
                          used (see Section 8.1.4).
                          To which section each block belongs is defined in first column (Sec.). Sections might be
                          locked by setting related bit to 1b (see Section 8.1.3.32).

               8.1.3.1 Originality Signature
                         The Originality signature (see Section 8.8) is stored in first 8 blocks (block 00h to
                         block 07h) of configuration memory and may be verified by the NFC device using the
                         corresponding ECC public key. As the NXP originality signature is on default not locked,
                         it may be re-programmed by the customer. If the originality check is not needed, it may
                         even be used as additional 32 byte user EEPROM.

               8.1.3.3 Customer ID (CID)
                       The Customer ID at delivery is C000h and can be reprogrammed and locked. It might be
                       used to identify the product.
                       The two most significant bits (b7 and b6 of CID (MSB)) are always equal to 11b. Only
                       CID[13-0] may be written by customer. Note, that other values of the two most significant
                       bits are RFU.
                       When the CID is written with WRITE CONFIG command, the 2 most significant bits are
                       always set to 11b. The input CID in WRITE CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) is
                       bit wise ORed with C000h.
                                                                     2                                                         2
                       As long as not locked by the I C section lock, CID maybe updated from I C perspective
                       with the same logic as from NFC perspective.
                       Example: When setting CID to 10AAh, resulting customer-specific CID is D0AAh.

                       The CID can be permanently locked by setting the Configuration Header to Locked state
                       (see Table 14) using WRITE CONFIG command. Note, that Originality Signature gets
                       locked, too.
               8.1.3.4 NFC Global Crypto Header
                       The NFC Global Crypto Header (NFC_GCH) defines the status and access of the
                       • NFC passwords in plain password mode and all other NFC features listed below
                       • NFC Keys
                       • NFC Protection Pointer
                       • NFC Protection Pointer Conditions
                       • NFC Key Headers
                       • NFC Key Privileges
                       • NFC Crypto Configuration Header
                       • EAS and AFI protection
                       As long as not locked by the RF section lock, the NFC Global Crypto Header can be
                       written with WRITE CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2). The programming of
                       NFC Global Crypto Header can be done in only one direction from lower state to higher
                       independently from the interface and it is irreversible.
                                                         2                                                                2
                       Same rules apply from I C perspective, as long as not locked by the I C section lock.
                       Once locked (as per table below), GCH cannot be updated anymore.

                       command, except for the Privacy password. The counter will be reset automatically to

                       The Authentication limit is enabled with the most significant bit of Byte 1 is set to 1b. The
                       remaining 15 bits of NFC_AUTH_LIMIT are defining the preset value.
                       The start value for the Authentication Limit can be preset with a WRITE CONFIG
                       command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) if
                       • the Crypto Config Header is not set to "Locked" and the NFC Global Crypto Header is
                          not set to "Activated" or
                       • a valid mutual authentication with a key with the Crypto Config privilege set has been
                          executed before.
                       In plain password mode, the Counter can be written with a WRITE CONFIG command
                       (see Section 8.2.3.2.2) if
                       • the Crypto Config Header is not set to "Locked" and NFC Global Crypto Header is not
                          set to "Locked", or
                       • a valid SET_PASSWORD command with the write password has been executed
                          before. In 64-bit password mode, both read and write passwords are required.
                       Examples:
                       • 8000h enables and presets the authentication limit to 0, which means the maximum
                          number of authentications (32767) before a preset is required again
                       • F000h enables and presets the authentication limit to 28672
                       If the NFC Authentication Limit is enabled, the authentication limit value is increased by
                       one at each CHALLENGE or AUTHENTICATE command (first step only). As soon as the
                       value of the Authentication limit reaches
                       • FF00h: only mutual authentication will be accepted to reset the authentication limit
                       • FFFFh: no further authentication is possible any longer. This status is irreversible.
                       Remark: The absolute maximum authentication limit value is FFFEh before a preset is
                       required, otherwise the authentication is irreversibly locked (no longer available).
                               2                                                                                                       2
                       From I C perspective, this block can be read and written if not locked by the I C section
                       lock.
               8.1.3.7 NFC Key Header
                       The NFC Key Header bytes (NFC_KH0, NFC_KH1, NFC_KH2, NFC_KH3) define the
                       status for the related NFC key.

                       WRITE CONFIG commands) depends on the status of the related Key Header and the
                       status of the Global Crypto Header.

                           The I C Protection pointer (I2C_PP) defines the address of the user memory where
                           the user memory below PP_AREA_1 is divided into AREA_0-L and AREA_0-H, two
                           arbitrarily sized sections with independent access conditions, which are defined by
                           condition byte (I2C_PPC).
                           The NFC interface can access this configuration block with READ CONFIG and WRITE
                           CONFIG commands if not locked by NFC section lock.

                           The protection pointer address (I2C_PP) defines the base address where the user
                           memory below PP_ARA_1 is divided into higher and lower sections.
                                                                                                                                 2

                           • I C AREA_0-H ends, where AREA_1 starts. Note it is the same position (PP_AREA_1)
                              as from NFC perspective (see Section 8.1.3.24).
                           Below is an example where the memory is divided into to areas with I2C_PP address
                           set to 0050h. In this example PP_AREA_1 is pointing outside the user EEPROM, which
                                     2
                           means I C AREA_0-H ends at the end of the user memory.
                           Default value of I2C_PP is FFh.

              8.1.3.12 I C Authentication Limit Counter
                              2
                       The I C Authentication Limit Counter is a feature to limit the maximum number of failed
                                                      2
                       authentications from I C perspective. The counter is incremented for failed password
                       write to block 1096h to 1099h. The counter resets on positive authentication.
                       The NFC interface can access this block with READ CONFIG and WRITE CONFIG
                       commands if not locked by NFC section lock.

                       Byte 0 of Block 32h is LSB and Byte 1 is MSB of the I C Authentication Limit counter
                       value. Default value of I2C_AUTH_LIMIT is 00h.
                                                                                                                                  2
                       The start value for the Authentication Limit can be preset with an I C WRITE command if
                       • I2C Key header is not locked or Not active
                       • I2C Key header is Active then after valid authentication with a write key.
                       The Authentication limit is enabled with the most significant bit of Byte 1 is set to 1b. The
                       remaining 15 bit of I2C_AUTH_LIMIT are defining the preset value.
                       Example:
                       • 8000h enables and presets the authentication limit to 0, which means the maximum
                          number of failed authentications before a successful is required again is 32767.
                       Remark: The absolute maximum authentication limit value is FFFEh before a positive
                       authentication is required, otherwise the authentication is irreversibly locked (no longer
                       available).
                       As soon as the value of the Authentication limit reaches
                       • FFFFh: no further authentication possible any longer. This status is irreversible.
              8.1.3.13 Configuration
                       Different features can be configured with CONFIG bits. The effect does not take place
                       in the current session. The effect takes place after POR. All config bits can be read and
                       written from both interfaces.

              8.1.3.18 Energy harvesting settings
                       Energy harvesting configuration controls the behavior of the energy harvesting
                       output pin. If DISABLE_POWER_CHECK is 0b and energy harvesting is enabled
                       with EH_ENABLE is 1b, only when the applied field strength is sufficient to generate
                       configured minimum output load current (EH_IOUT_SEL) and voltage (EH_VOUT_SEL),
                       the energy harvesting output is enabled.
                       If energy harvesting will be enabled during the session with register bits,
                       EH_IOUT_SEL and EH_VOUT_SEL define the needed output power. However,
                       DISABLE_POWER_CHECK and EH_ENABLE bits need to be set to 0b in this case.
                       Details can be found in energy harvesting section (see Section 8.5).

                         pin depending on various events. As this pin is an open-drain active low implementation,
                         ED pin state ON means that signal is LOW and OFF means that signal is HIGH. More
                         details can be found in ED section (see Section 8.3.2).

                       configuration bytes.

                   These lock bytes take the highest priority above all locks. Different section access
                   conditions have to be chosen appropriately, so that the other interface does not change
                   and corrupt the other interface security configuration.
                   If I2C_LOCK_0 and NFC_LOCK_0 bits are set to 1b, then the lock bytes cannot be
                   updated and gets locked permanently. If any interface is not locked i.e. any one of the
                   I2C_LOCK_0 and NFC_LOCK_0 bits are 0b, then the particular interface can unlock the
                   other.

                       Note: Section 7 (default SRAM content) and Section 8 (Device configuration lock bytes)
                       are always readable.
                                                                                                                                                2
                       In case of not readable and/or not writeable, IC responds with an NACK from I C
                       perspective and with an error from NFC perspective, when trying to access locked
                       sections.
                 8.1.4 Session Registers
                       After POR, the content of the configuration settings (see Section 8.1.3) is loaded
                       into the session register. The values of session registers can be changed during a
                       session. Change to session registers take effect immediately, but only for the current
                       communication session. After POR, the session registers values will again contain the
                       configuration register values as before.
                       To change the default behavior, changes to the related configuration bytes are needed,
                       but the related effect will only be visible after the next POR.
                       Session registers starting from block A3h until the end may be write protected with
                       LOCK_REGISTER bit.
                                                                                                        2
                       Reading and writing the session registers via I C can only be done with READ
                       REGISTER and WRITE REGISTER commands.
                       Most of the parameters are defined in the configuration memory section.

                       These session register bytes define the various configurations for GPIO/PWM use case
                       (see Section 8.1.3.13). From NFC perspective IN_STATUS bits are read only, all others
                                                                                           2
                       maybe changed during a session. From I C perspective, all bits are read only. For details
                       refer to Section 8.3.3 and Section 8.3.4.

               8.1.4.5 Pulse Width Modulation Duty Cycle Register
                       The PWM duty cycle maybe changed during one session from NFC perspective (see
                       Section 8.1.3.16).
                                        2                                                                                                                        2
                       As long as the I C slave use case is enabled, these settings can also be done from I C
                       perspective.
               8.1.4.6 Watch Dog Timer Register
                       Watch Dog Timer register settings are read only (see Section 8.1.3.17).
               8.1.4.7 Energy Harvesting Register
                       Energy harvesting registers may be used to enable energy harvesting during one
                       NFC session. In this case, EH_ENABLE bit of EH_CONFIG byte in block 3Dh is set
                       to 0b. Required EH_VOUT_I_SEL and EH_VOUT_V_SEL need to be set in that
                       EH_CONFIG byte. Desired energy harvesting mode (EH_MODE) needs to be configured
                       in CONFIG_0 byte of block 37h. In case of energy harvesting is enabled already during
                       boot (EH_ENABLE bit of EH_CONFIG is 1b), or energy harvesting is not used at all, this
                       register byte gives no information.
                       Setting EH_TRIGGER to 1b is needed to trigger power detection.
                       Polling for bit EH_LOAD_OK should be used to check, if sufficient energy is available.
                       Only if EH_LOAD_OK = 1b, energy harvesting may be enabled via session registers by
                       writing 09h to this byte.
                                                                                    2
                       There is only read only access from I C perspective.
                       Details can be found in energy harvesting section (see Section 8.5).

                           System reset can be generated by both the interfaces by writing to RESET_GEN_REG
                           register using WRITE CONFIG command (see Section 8.2.3.2.2). Writing E7h will trigger
                           the system reset. This byte gets automatically reset after the system reset.

                   8.1.5 SRAM
                           For frequently changing data, a volatile memory of 256 bytes with unlimited write
                           endurance is built in. The 256 bytes are mapped in a similar way as done in the
                           EEPROM, i.e., 256 bytes are seen as 64 pages of 4 bytes.
                           SRAM is only available when supplied by VCC and SRAM_ENABLE bit is set to 1b.
                           The SRAM can be mirrored in the User Memory from block 00h to 3Fh for access from
                           both interfaces as illustrated in the table below. This allows using NFC Forum read and
                           write commands to access the SRAM.
                           The lock block condition (e.g. user EEPROM blocks are set to read-only) is not valid for
                           the mirrored SRAM.
                           The access conditions (e.g. first blocks of user EEPROM are password protected) are
                           valid for the mirrored SRAM, too, for both interfaces.
                           The access conditions for READ SRAM and WRITE SRAM commands can be restricted
                           with SRAM_CONF_PROT security bits.
                                  2
                           From I C perspective, SRAM is located in blocks 2000h to 203Fh and can be accessed
                           at any time without any protection.
                           NOTE: SRAM values are not initialized during boot and may have arbitrary data.

                           After POR the SRAM can be pre-loaded with default data (e.g. NDEF message)
                           depending on SRAM_COPY_ENABLE bit in CONFIG register. If SRAM_COPY_ENABLE
                           bit and SRAM_ENABLE both are set to 1b, then the copy feature will be triggered after
                           POR. The startup time depends upon the number of bytes (maximum 64) to be copied.
                           In the table below, an example is illustrated where 48 bytes are copied to the SRAM on
                           POR.

                       Main uses cases for passive communication mode are Smart Metering, Home
                       automation and in the box configuration. With antenna sizes of Class 4 or bigger, energy
                       harvesting on the one side and long-distance read/write access to the EEPROM is
                       possible in a very efficient way.

             8.2.2.1.1 State transitions from and to POWER-OFF state
                       If NFC field is switched off or below, HMIN NTAG 5 link goes to POWER-OFF state.
                       POWER-OFF state will be left to READY state no later than 1 ms after NTAG 5 link is
                       powered by an NFC field greater than HMIN.
                       NOTE: When loading default data to mirrored SRAM, start-up time, dependent on the
                       pre-loaded bytes, might be greater than 1 ms.

               8.2.3.1 Commands for state transitions
                       Following commands are implemented for all possible state transitions according to ISO/
                       IEC 15693.
                       •  INVENTORY
                       •  STAY QUIET
                       •  SELECT
                       •  RESET TO READY
                       On top of these commands, NTAG 5 link offers
                       • INVENTORY READ in extended mode (see Section 8.2.3.5.1)
                       • FAST INVENTORY READ in extended mode (see Section 8.2.3.5.2)
                       • AUTHENTICATE to move to SELECTED SECURE state (see Section 8.2.3.4.5)
               8.2.3.2 Configuration operations
             8.2.3.2.1 READ CONFIGURATION
                       Command code = C0h
                       The READ CONFIG command returns configuration memory content starting with the
                       first block defined by the Block Address and reads Number of Blocks + 1 configuration
                       blocks.
                       Access to the configuration blocks depends on the status and definition of the related
                       block within the configuration memory (see Section 8.1.3).
                       If one of the requested configuration blocks is not accessible due to the actual status,
                       NTAG 5 link will respond with Error_flag set.
                       A READ CONFIG command can read one or multiple blocks of the following areas of the
                       configuration memory within one command execution:

                       The SET PASSWORD command enables the different passwords to be transmitted to
                       the IC to access the different protected functionalities of the following commands. The
                       SET PASSWORD command has to be executed just once for the related password if the
                       IC is powered.
                       Remark: The SET PASSWORD command can only be executed in addressed or
                       selected mode and the timing of the SET PASSWORD command is write alike.
                       The XOR password has to be calculated with the password and two times the received

                       transmitted first with a SET PASSWORD command.
                       If the 64-bit password protection is enabled, both passwords are required for read & write
                       access to protected blocks.
                       Once the 64-bit password protection is enabled, a change back to 32-bit password
                       protection (read and write password) is not possible.
                       Remark: A retransmission of the passwords is not required after the execution of the 64-
                       bit PASSWORD PROTECTION command.
                       Remark: The 64-bit PASSWORD PROTECTION does not include the 16-bit counter
                       block.
                       The timing of the command is write alike.

                       Command code = B6h
                       The PROTECT PAGE command defines the protection pointer address of the user
                       memory to divide the user memory into two arbitrarily sized pages and defines the
                       access conditions for the two pages.
                       The protection pointer address defines the base address of the higher user memory
                       segment Page 0-H. All block addresses smaller than the protection pointer address are in
                       the user memory segment Page 0-L.
                       Table below shows an example of the user memory segmentation with the protection
                       pointer address NFC_PP_AREA_0H 14h.

                                                                                           NTAG 5 link - NFC Forum-compliant I C bridge
                         Remark: If the IC receives an invalid password, it will not execute any following
                         command until a Power-On Reset (POR) (NFC reset) is executed.
               8.2.3.4 AES Authentication
             8.2.3.4.1 Introduction
                         NXP implements a scalable security approach. This means, during lifetime the security
                         level may be changed. In production, NXP configures the IC, that plain password mode
                         is enabled. With the DEV_SEC_CONFIG byte (see Table 66) AES mutual authentication
                         may be activated. Only in case NFC Security is set to AES mode following commands
                         and AES mutual authentication is enabled. To lock the security level, the Security Lock
                         bits need to be set to 010b (see Table 66).
                         NOTE: AES authentication mode and this flexibility are only available for NTP5332.

                         As defined in ISO/IEC 15693 and ISO/IEC 29167-10.
                         Command code = 35h
                         CSI code= 00h (AES Crypto Suite)
                         The AUTHENTICATE command allows the interrogator to perform the following
                         authentication procedures as defined in ISO/IEC 15693:
                         • Tag Authentication (TAM1)
                         • Mutual Authentication (MAM1, MAM2)
                         After receiving a valid AUTHENTICATE command, NTAG 5 link calculates the response
                         and as soon as the calculation is finalized, the response with the result of the crypto
                         calculation (b3 flag is set) is sent. Only for tag authentication the calculation result is
                         additionally stored in the response buffer (b2 flag is set).
                         NTAG 5 link supports the Crypto Suite AES128 as defined in ISO/IEC 29167-10.
                         Option_flag = 0b and Option_flag = 1b is supported and is in accordance with ISO/IEC
                         15693 write-alike commands.

                         The CHALLENGE command transmits the message (challenge) to NTAG 5 link to
                         authenticate as defined in ISO/IEC 15693.
                         The CHALLENGE command can only be executed in the READY state and in not
                         addressed mode.
                         After receiving a valid CHALLENGE command, NTAG 5 link starts with the crypto
                         calculation.
                         If the calculation is finalized, NTAG 5 link will respond to a valid READBUFFER
                         command with the result of the crypto calculation based on the previous CHALLENGE
                         command message.
                         NTAG 5 link supports the Crypto Suite AES128 as defined in ISO/IEC 29167-10.
                         Only Option_flag = 0b is supported.

                       Following commands are implemented for accessing user memory according to ISO/IEC
                       15693.
                       •  READ SINGLE BLOCK
                       •  WRITE SINGLE BLOCK
                       •  LOCK BLOCK
                       •  READ MULTIPLE BLOCKS up to 3Fh blocks
                       •  EXTENDED READ SINGLE BLOCK
                       •  EXTENDED WRITE SINGLE BLOCK
                       •  EXTENDED LOCK BLOCK
                       •  EXTENDED READ MULTIPEL BLOCKS up to 3Fh blocks
                       On top of these commands, NTAG 5 link offers INVENTORY READ and FAST
                       INVENTORY READ
             8.2.3.5.1 INVENTORY READ
                       Command code = A0h
                       When receiving the INVENTORY READ request, NTAG 5 link performs the same as the
                       anti-collision sequence, with the difference that instead of the UID and the DSFID, the
                       requested response is defined by additional options.
                       The INVENTORY READ command provides two modes which are defined by the most
                       significant bit of the mask length byte as follows:
                       • Standard mode (most significant bit of mask length byte equal 0b)
                          (see Section 8.2.3.5.1.1)
                       • Extended mode (most significant bit of mask length byte equal 1b)
                          The extended mode offers additional features to optimize the inventory procedure for
                          different requirements (see Section 8.2.3.5.1.2)
                       The INVENTORY READ command may also be transmitted in addressed or SELECTED
                       mode. Then the command behaves similar to a READ or READ MULTIPLE BLOCK (see
                       Section 8.2.3.5.1.3).

                        is used in the standard mode.
                        If the Inventory_flag is set to 1b and an error is detected, NTAG 5 link remains silent.
                        If the Option flag is set to 0b, n blocks of data are transmitted. If the Option flag is set to
                        1b, n blocks of data and the part of the UID which is not part of the mask are transmitted.
                        The request contains:
                        •  Flags
                        •  INVENTORY READ command code

                        •  Mask value (if mask length > 00h)

                        meaning of Flags bits 7 to 4 is as defined in ISO/IEC 15693.
                        The INVENTORY READ command can also be transmitted in the addressed or

                          NTAG 5 link reads the requested block(s) and sends back their value in the response.
                          Additionally the bytes of the UID, which are not parts of the mask and the slot number
                          in case of 16 slots, are returned. Instead of padding with zeros up to the next byte
                          boundary, the corresponding bits of the UID are returned. The mechanism and timing
                          of the INVENTORY READ command perform the same as the INVENTORY command
                          which is defined in ISO/IEC 15693.
                          Remark: The number of bits of the retransmitted UID can be calculated as follows:
                          • 16 slots: 60 bits (bit 64 to bit 4) - mask length rounded up to the next byte boundary
                          • 1 slot: 64 bits - mask length rounded up to the next byte boundary
                          Remark: If the sum of first block number and number of blocks exceeds the total
                          available number of user blocks, the number of transmitted blocks is less than the
                          requested number of blocks. This means that the last returned block is the highest
                          available user block, followed by the 16-bit CRC and the EOF.
                          Example: mask length = 30 bits
                          Returned: bit 64 to bit 4 (30 bits) = 30 gives 4 bytes

                                                                                                                            link
            8.2.3.5.1.3  Addressed and SELECTED mode
                         The INVENTORY READ command can also be transmitted in the addressed or
                         SELECTED mode. In this case, the Inventory_flag is set to 0 and the meaning of flags 7
                         to 4 is in accordance with ISO/IEC 15693.
                         In the addressed or selected mode, the INVENTORY READ command behaves similar to
                         a READ or READ MULTIPLE BLOCK command.
                         In the addressed mode, it is recommended to address the IC with a mask length of 64
                         and to transmit the complete UID in the mask value field.
                         In the selected mode (IC has been selected with a valid SELECT command before), it is
                         recommended to address the IC with a mask length of 0 (and do not transmit the mask
                         value field).
                         Remark: If the INVENTORY READ command is used in the addressed or selected
                         mode, the AFI shall not be transmitted and the IC will only respond in the first-time slot.
             8.2.3.5.2 FAST INVENTORY READ
                         Command code = A1h
                         When receiving the FAST INVENTORY READ command, NTAG 5 link behaves the
                         same as the INVENTORY READ command with the following exceptions:
                         The data rate in the direction NTAG 5 link to the reader is twice as defined in ISO/IEC
                         15693 depending on the Datarate_flag 53 kbit (high data rate) or 13 kbit (low data rate).
                         The data rate from the reader to NTAG 5 link and the time between the rising edge of the
                         EOF from the reader to NTAG 5 link remains unchanged (stays the same as defined in
                         ISO/IEC 15693).
                         Only the single subcarrier mode is supported for the response to the FAST INVENTORY
                         READ command.
               8.2.3.6 SRAM operations
                         When SRAM is mirrored to user EEPROM address space, standard READ BLOCK and
                         WRITE BLOCK commands can be used. To have a more efficient way to access the 256
                         bytes SRAM, READ SRAM and WRITE SRAM are implemented
             8.2.3.6.1 READ SRAM
                         Command code = D2h
                         This command can only be used, when NTAG 5 link is powered via VCC end
                         SRAM_ENABLE bit (see Table 38) is set to 1b.

                       When receiving READ SRAM desired SRAM blocks will be returned.
                       NTAG 5 link returns only the requested blocks. The blocks are numbered from 00h to
                       3Fh. The number of blocks in the request is one less than the number of blocks that
                       NTAG 5 link returns in its response. EXAMPLE: A value of 06h in the "Number of Blocks"
                       field requests to read 7 blocks. A value of 00h requests to read a single block from
                       SRAM.
                       If SRAM is read or write protected a valid authentication needs to be proceeded.
                       It is recommended to use this command in pass-through mode.
                       Only Option_flag = 0b is supported.

                       SRAM_ENABLE bit (see Table 38) is set to 1b.
                       When receiving WRITE SRAM desired SRAM blocks will be written to the SRAM. It is
                       recommended to use this command in pass-through mode because of performance
                       reasons.
                       If SRAM is write protected a valid authentication needs to be preceded.
                       The blocks are numbered from 00h to 3Fh. The number of blocks in the request is one
                       less than the number of blocks that the VICC shall write. E.g., to write one block to SRAM
                       Number of Blocks is coded as 00h.
                       Option_flag = 0b and Option_flag = 1b is supported and is in accordance with ISO/IEC
                       15693 write-alike commands.

                            READ I C command is used to trigger an I C master read command (R/W bit is 1b) on

                            the I C bus.
                            Command parameters:

                            • I C param contains I C address and STOP condition option
                            • Data length N byte codes the length of bytes to be read from the slave. N+1 bytes will
                               be read from the slave. E.g., to read one byte 00h needs to be coded. Maximum is
                               FFh, which means 256 bytes will be read.
                            Response to this command will follow immediately.

                      In plain password mode the PROTECT EAS/AFI command enables the password
                      protection for EAS and/or AFI if the EAS/AFI password is first transmitted with the SET
                      PASSWORD command.
                      In AES mode, the PROTECT EAS/AFI command enables the protection for EAS and/or
                      AFI if a valid mutual authentication with the EAS/AFI privilege has been executed before.
                      Option_flag set to 0b: EAS will be protected.
                      Option_flag set to 1b: AFI will be protected.
                      Both protections (AFI and EAS) can be enabled separately.
                      Once the EAS/AFI protection is enabled, it is not possible to change back to unprotected
                      EAS and/or AFI.
                      The timing of the command is write-alike as of write commands with Option_flag set to
                      0b.
                      Note: Option_flag is only related to the parameter to be locked, and NOT to the response
                      behavior.

                8.2.4 Data integrity
                       Following mechanisms are implemented in the contactless communication link between
                       reader and NTAG 5 link to ensure very reliable data transmission:
                       •  16-bit CRC per block
                       •  Bit count checking
                       •  Bit coding to distinguish between logic 1, logic 0, and no information
                       •  Channel monitoring (protocol sequence and bit stream analysis)
                8.2.5 Error Handling
               8.2.5.1 Transmission Errors
                       According to ISO/IEC 15693 NTAG 5 link will not respond if a transmission error (CRC,
                       bit coding, bit count, wrong framing) is detected and will silently wait for the next correct
                       received command.
               8.2.5.2 Not supported commands or options
                       If the received command or option is not supported, the behavior depends on the
                       addressing mechanism.
                       • Non-Addressed Mode
                          NTAG 5 link remains silent
                       • Addressed or selected Mode
                          NTAG 5 link responds with error code 0Fh (no information given, or error code not
                          supported).
                          If the Inventory flag or the Protocol Extension flag is set, the IC will not respond if the
                          command or option is not supported.
                       • Parameter out of range
                          – Read alike commands
                             If the sum of the first block number and the number of blocks exceeds the total
                             available number of user blocks, the number of transmitted blocks is less than the
                             requested number of blocks. This means that the last returned block is the highest
                             available user block, followed by the 16-bit CRC and the EOF.
                          – Write alike commands
                             If the address of a block to be written does not exist or a block to be written is locked,
                             the behavior of the IC depends on the addressing mechanism.
                             – Non-Addressed Mode
                                  NTAG 5 link remains silent.
                             – Addressed or SELECTED Mode
                                  NTAG 5 link responds with error code 0Fh (no information given, or error code not
                                  supported).
                   8.3 Wired Interface
                       NTAG 5 link has not only an NFC interface, but also a wired interface. Details are
                       described in following clauses.

                       The definition of the I C interface is according to the UM10204. The details of slave and
                       master mode are described in Section 8.3.1.1 and Section 8.3.1.2.
                                 2
                       NOTE: I C master mode is only available for NTP5332.

                             2
                       The I C slave interface supports both standard (up to 100 kHz) and fast mode (up to
                       400 kHz) communication speeds for both read and write. Implementation will be a so-

                       NTAG 5 link supports the I C protocol defined in UM10204. Any device that sends data
                       onto the bus is defined as a transmitter, and any device that reads the data from the bus
                       is defined as a receiver. The device that controls the data transfer is known as the "bus
                       master", and the other as the "slave" device. A data transfer can only be initiated by the
                       bus master, which will also provide the serial clock for synchronization.
             8.3.1.1.1 Start condition
                       Start is identified by a falling edge of Serial Data (SDA), while Serial Clock (SCL) is
                       stable in the high state. A Start condition must precede any data transfer command.
                       NTAG 5 link continuously monitors SDA (except during a Write cycle) and SCL for a Start
                       condition, and will not respond unless one is given.

                                                                                                 NTAG 5 link - NFC Forum-compliant I C bridge
             8.3.1.1.2 Stop condition
                       Stop is identified by a rising edge of SDA while SCL is stable and driven high. A Stop
                       condition terminates communication between NTAG 5 link and the bus master. A Stop
                       condition at the end of a Write command triggers the internal write cycle.
             8.3.1.1.3 Acknowledge bit (ACK)
                       The acknowledge bit is used to indicate a successful byte transfer. The bus transmitter,
                       whether it is the bus master or slave device, releases Serial Data (SDA) after sending 8
                       bits of data. During the ninth clock pulse period, the receiver pulls Serial Data (SDA) low
                       to acknowledge the receipt of the 9th data bits.
             8.3.1.1.4 Data input
                       During data input, the IC samples SDA on the rising edge of SCL. For correct device
                       operation, SDA must be stable during the rising edge of SCL, and the SDA signal must
                       change only when SCL is driven low.
             8.3.1.1.5 Addressing
                       To start communication between a bus master and NTAG 5 link, the bus master must
                       initiate a Start condition. Following this initiation, the bus master sends the device
                                                                                 2
                       address. The IC address from I C consists of a 7-bit device identifier (see Table 229 for
                       default value).
                                          2
                       As long as I C address is 7 bit long, the 8th bit (least significant bit) is used as the Read/
                       Write bit (R/W). This bit is set to 1b for Read and 0b for Write operations.
                       If a match occurs on the device address, the IC gives an acknowledgment on SDA during
                       the 9th bit time. If the IC does not match the device select code, it deselects itself from
                       the bus and clears the register I2C_IF_LOCKED (see Table 88).
                                                                       2                                   2

                       NTAG 5 link offers the option to disable the I C interface temporarily using the session

                       register bit DISABLE_I C (see Table 100). With this feature, the NFC Device can easily
                       get exclusive access to EEPROM.
                       This feature can be enabled via the NFC interface during the session by setting related
                       session bit.

                       microcontroller. Using energy harvesting capability, I C device can be powered by NTAG

                       The response from the READ I C command will be stored in the SRAM and can be read
                       (see Section 8.2.3.6.1) afterwards from NFC perspective. Due to the 256 byte SRAM,
                                                                                                                        2

                       Of course, all other NFC commands are working in master mode and the user memory
                       as well as configuration memory is accessible from NFC perspective.
                                                                      2
                       WARNING: When enabling I C master mode and disabling NFC interface in parallel,
                       NTAG 5 link gets disabled for current session.
                       Implementation details can be found in AN12368.
               8.3.1.3 Watch Dog Timer
                                                                                                                              2
                       A programmable watchdog timer is implemented to unlock the I C host from NTAG 5
                       link latest after a defined maximum time period. The host itself will not be notified of this
                       event directly but the NFC status register is updated accordingly.
                       On default Watch Dog Timer is enabled with a value of 0848h (~20 ms) but the watchdog
                       timer can be freely set with WDT_CONFIG from 0000h (9.434 μs) up to (FFFFh+1) *
                       9.434 µs (~618 ms). It is recommended to keep this time as short as possible, by setting
                                                                                                                      2
                       the value above, but close to the maximum needed I C transaction time.
                       The timer is only active, when WDT_ENABLE is set to 1b and the IC is VCC powered.
                                                                                2
                       The timer starts ticking when the I C communication starts. The Watch Dog Timer
                                         2
                       ensures, that I C interface gets released after the configured time period in any case.
                                                          2
                       In the case where the I C communication has completed before the end of the timer and
                       the status register I2C_IF_LOCKED was not cleared by the host, it will be cleared when
                       defined watchdog time elapses.
                                                                                                                                2
                       NOTE: If WDT_CONFIG configured time elapses before ongoing I C communication is
                                                                                                                          2
                       finished, WDT will release SDA line in between of ongoing I C communication.
                       The timer is reset automatically, when I2C_IF_LOCKED gets cleared, or the IC is not VCC
                       powered.
                           2
                       In I C master use case, watchdog timer is always enabled independently of
                       WDT_ENABLE. It is important to set WDT_CONFIG in accordance with maximum
                       execution time.

                       NTAG 5 link offers an easy to use I C command set.

               8.3.1.5 Error Handling
                       In case of any detected error, NTAG 5 link in slave mode responds with a NACK:
                       • Memory Write
                         – EEPROM
                           generated on the fourth data byte if the block is not writable
                         – SRAM
                           generated on the first byte if the block is not writable
                         – Arbiter locked to NFC interface, or
                         – EEP cycle ongoing, or
                            2
                         – I C interface disabled
                           generate on block address BL_AD0
                       • Memory Read
                         – EEPROM/SRAM
                           returned data will be FFh if the access is to restricted region
                         – Arbiter locked to NFC interface, or
                         – EEP cycle ongoing, or
                            2
                         – I C interface disabled
                           generate on block address BL_AD0
                       • Register Access
                         Registers are always accessible. NACK will only be generated:
                         – DATA NACK due to register write command to trigger system reset
                                                                                                                         2
                         – NACK for register read/write command on BL_AD0 if I C interface is disabled
                 8.3.2 Event detection
                       The event detection feature provides the capability to trigger an external device (e.g.,
                       µController) or switch on the connected circuitry by an external power management unit
                       depending on activities on the NFC interface. On top this active low pin can be used as
                                                                                                             2
                       one of the two possible PWM channels to offer I C and PWM functionality.
                       As the event detection pin functionality is operated via NFC field power, VCC supply for
                       the IC itself is only required when ED pin is used as PWM channel.
                       NOTE: In some cases VOUT pin might be used as field detection trigger.
                       The configurable events indicated at event detection pin are:
                       • The presence/absence of the NFC field

                                                                                          NTAG 5 link - NFC Forum-compliant I C bridge

                      external pull-up resistor shall be used on this pin.
                      How to use the event detection pin in applications is described in AN11203.
                8.3.3 GPIO
                       2
                      I C pins (SCL/SDA) are multiplexed and can be used as general-purpose input/
                                                                                                                                                  2
                      output pins linked to configuration/session bits. When configured as GPIO pins, I C
                      communication is not possible anymore.
                      At POR, the GPIO are set to high-impedance state. When configuration is read, the pins
                      are controlled to behave as per the configuration.
                      GPIOs can be configured to be either input or output (see Section 8.1.3.15). In input
                      mode, the status of the pad will be available in one of the session register bits. In output
                      mode status depends on the session register/config bits content.
                      How to use the GPIO pins in applications is described in AN11203.
                8.3.4 PWM
                       2
                      I C pins (SDA/SCL) and ED pin are multiplexed and can be used as a pulse width
                                                   2
                      modulation output. I C pins have push-pull architecture, ED pin is an open-drain
                      implementation, which means the PWM signal gets inverted.
                      PWM resolution, pre-scalar factor (see Section 8.1.3.15) as well as duty cycle can be
                      configured using configuration bytes (see Section 8.1.3.16).
                      The pulse width modulation resolution (PWMx_RESOLUTION_CONF) defines the
                      maximum number of pulses that are available in the given PWM period. PWM resolution
                      can be set independently for both outputs to either 6, 8, 10 or 12 bits.
                      The 2-bit PWMx_PRESCALE value divides the PWM input frequency (1695 kHz) by a
                      factor of 1, 2, 4 or 8.

                      PWMx_ON and PWMx_OFF defines the starting point and end point of the PWMx output
                      is asserted to HIGH.

                                                                                        NTAG 5 link - NFC Forum-compliant I C bridge
                      To calculate proper PWMx_ON (start of HIGH level) and PWMx_OFF (end of HIGH level)
                      values, PWMx_RESOLUTION_CONF value and PWM_PRESCALE values need to be
                      set to achieve desired PWM frequency. As an example 12-bit resolution is chosen. Duty
                      cycle shall be set to 20 % and start time shall be 10 % offset.

                8.3.5 Standby mode
                      To minimize overall current consumption, when the IC is supplied via VCC NTAG 5 link
                                                                                                                              2
                      can be set to standby mode by writing related session bit form NFC or I C perspective.
                      The IC will leave standby mode according to configuration when NFC field is detected,
                      automatically, or HPD pin gets pulled to HIGH for at least 20 µs and released again. In
                      standby mode the current is typically less than 6 µA.
                      Worst case standby current consumption values can be found in Section 10.1 table.
                      In case SDA/SCLGPIO/PWM pins are not used the pins can be left floating. However, to
                      ensure lowest standby current, following settings are needed:
                      CONFIG bytes USE_CASE_CONF shall be set in any case to GPIO/PWM, both pins
                      SDA_GPIO1 and SCL_GPIO0 shall be set as input using weak pull-up (GPIOx_IN in).
                      Block 37h: CONFIG_1, USE_CASE_CONF shall be set to GPIO/PWM (10b) and
                      CONFIG, GPIOx_IN, both shall be set to plain input with weak pullup (01b).
                      Block 39h: PWM_GPIO_CONFIG_0, SDA_GPIO1 and SCL_GPIO0 shall both be set to
                      1b to define them as general-purpose input.
                8.3.6 Hard power-down mode
                      In hard power-down mode NTAG 5 link is switched off using hard power down pin. When
                      pulled to HIGH, the hard power down current is typically less than 0.25 µA. This mode
                      can only be left by connecting HPD pin to ground.
                      There is no hard power-down mode, when using SO8 packaged version of NTAG 5 link.
                      Worst case hard power down current consumption values can be found in Section 10.1
                      table.

                   8.4 Arbitration between NFC and I C interface
                       There are different modes implement to ensure access to the EEPROM and described in
                       detail hereafter. Two status bits (I2C_IF_LOCKED and NFC_IF_LOCKED) are provided
                       to show the status of arbiter.
                       Details about the different arbitrations modes can be found in AN12364.
                8.4.1 NFC Mode
                       If NTAG 5 link is only powered by NFC, arbiter needs only to lock to the NFC interface
                       if the IC receives a valid NFC command. After completion of the NFC command,
                       NFC_IF_LOCKED will be cleared automatically.
                        2
                8.4.2 I C Mode
                                                                                                                          2
                       If NTAG 5 link is only powered by VCC, arbiter needs only to lock to the I C interface
                       if the IC is correctly addressed for the memory access. The host needs to clear
                       I2C_IF_LOCKED. Otherwise, the bit will be cleared automatically if the watchdog timer
                       expires.
                            2
                       In I C mode, availability of the SRAM as part of the memory depends on
                       SRAM_ENABLE bit.
                8.4.3 Normal Mode
                       If NTAG 5 link is powered by NFC and VCC, arbiter locks interface on a first come first
                       serve principle.
                                                                                                                      2
                       When receiving a valid NFC command and access is not locked to I C, then the arbiter
                       locks to the NFC interface. After completion of the NFC command, the lock will be
                       released automatically. The host can access the registers at any time. Only access to
                       EEPROM is locked.
                                                                                                              2
                       When NTAG 5 link is correctly addressed by its I C address for the memory access and
                                                                                                                    2
                       access is not locked to NFC, then the arbiter locks to the I C interface. The host needs
                       to clear the lock actively. If not, the lock will be released automatically as soon as the
                       watchdog timer expires. NFC reader can access the registers at any time. Only access to
                       EEPROM is locked.
                       In this mode, availability of the SRAM depends on SRAM_ENABLE bit.
                       How to exchange data based on NDEF messages is defined in NFC Forum Tag NDEF
                       Exchange Protocol (TNEP) Specification.
                8.4.4 SRAM Mirror Mode
                       In this mode arbiter works like in normal mode with the exception, that SRAM is used
                       instead of EEPROM.
                8.4.5 SRAM Pass-Through Mode
                                                                                                                    2
                       In this mode, the NTAG 5 link transfers data from NFC to I C and vice versa using the
                       SRAM. The arbiter switches automatically between the two interfaces when accessing
                       the terminator block (last block of SRAM).

                                                                                         NTAG 5 link - NFC Forum-compliant I C bridge
                8.4.6 SRAM PHDC Mode
                       This mode is similar to SRAM mirror mode. This mode needs to be enabled, when PHDC
                       communication scheme as defined in NFC Forum PHDC specification shall be used.
                       NFC will always get a response when accessing SRAM.
                   8.5 Energy harvesting
                       NTAG 5 link provides the capability to supply external low-power devices with energy
                       harvested from the NFC field of an NFC device.
                       When DISABLE_POWER_CHECK bit is set to 0b, minimum provided output power can
                       be configured by setting desired voltage and minimum required output current in the
                       related configuration bytes (see Section 8.1.3.18).
                       WARNING: Sufficient RF field is required when DISABLE_ POWER_CHECK is
                       set to 0b to have access to EEPROM. As long as NTAG 5 link detects too less
                       energy to be harvested from the field only INVENTORY command and READ/WRITE
                       CONFIGURATION to access session registers will be handled. This feature ensures
                       a stable system, as the host will only be supplied if there is sufficient energy available.
                       However, during design phase we recommend disabling this power check.
                       The provided output power in general of course depends on many parameters like the
                       strength of the NFC field, the antenna size, or the distance from the NFC device. The
                       design ensures with the right settings, that VOUT is only enabled, when sufficient energy
                       can be harvested from the NFC field.
                       1.8 V, 2.4 V or 3 V output voltage can be selected by coding EH_VOUT_V_SEL
                       accordingly.
                       Minimum required load current can be coded in EH_VOUT_I_SEL configuration field.
                       VOUT and VCC need to be connected as soon as energy harvesting is used. Otherwise
                       there is no EEPROM access possible from NFC perspective and status registers may
                       contain invalid information.
                       Appropriate capacitor dependent on load needs to be placed between VOUT and ground
                       to close energy gaps during miller pauses. An example circuit is illustrated in the figure
                       below.
                       VOUT pin shall be kept floating (not connected) in case energy harvesting feature is not
                       used. If energy harvesting is disabled, pin will be connected to GND internally.
                       With EH_ENABLE configuration bit st to 1b, energy harvesting will be enabled after boot,
                       automatically and all energy harvesting-related session register bits are meaningless.
                       When enabling energy harvesting via session registers, EH_MODE, EH_VOUT_SEL
                       and EH_IOUT_SEL needs to be configured properly in the related configuration bytes.
                       EH_ENABLE configuration bit need to be 0b in this case.
                       After boot, session registers can be used to first trigger current detection by setting
                       EH_TRIGGER to 1b, then poll for EH_LOAD_OK that gets 1b and finally set
                       EH_TRIGGER and EH_ENABLE to 1b, or directly enable energy harvesting by setting
                       EH_TRIGGER and EH_ENABLE bit to 1b (see Table 97).

                       How to use energy harvesting in applications is described in AN12365.
                   8.6 Security
                       NTAG 5 link implements different levels to protect data. The easiest, but efficient method
                       is to lock EEPROM to read only.
                       With the plain password authentication scheme, the memory can be split in three
                       different parts with different access conditions.
                       With NTP5332's mutual AES authentication the memory is split in three different parts
                       again, but with the advantage, that the password will never be transmitted in plain text.
                       Configuration area and SRAM can be protected from both interfaces as well.
                       Further implementation details can be found in AN12366.
                8.6.1 Locking EEPROM to read only
                       Independent on the split of the memory, the user memory may be locked to read-only.
                       If the user EEPROM shall stay in read/write state, the LOCK BLOCK command can be
                       disabled and lock block sections can be locked. With these features, it can be ensured,
                       NTAG 5 link stays in read/write state.
                       Locking the complete EEPROM to read-only as defined in NFC Forum Type 5 Tag
                       specification is quite time consuming. Every single block needs to be addressed by a
                       LOCK BLOCK command (see Section 8.2.3.5). To accelerate this locking, NTAG 5 link
                       stores the information in the configuration area. With this feature, locking the EEPROM
                       can be accelerated by a factor of 16.
                       As long as these bytes are not locked, the EEPROM can be set to read/write state again
                                2

                8.6.2 Memory Areas
                      The memory may be split into three different configurable areas with different access
                      conditions.
                      Highest priority has the 16-bit Protection Pointer PP_AREA_1. It splits the memory into
                      an AREA_0 and an AREA_1 at the address configured with the PP_AREA_1.
                                                                                                                                                         2
                      The split configured with the 16-bit Protection Pointer is the same for both, NFC and I C

                      The area below this address can be split into two more areas with the 8-bit
                      NFC_PP_AREA_0-H (see Section 8.1.3.28) and the 8-bit I2C_PP_AREA_0-H (see
                                                                                                             2

                      NFC AREA_0-L, usually used to store NDEF messages, starts from block 0. NFC
                      AREA_0-H, usually used as password protected area to store private data, starts from
                      block address configured by the 8-bit NFC_PP_AREA_0H and ends just before the block
                      addressed with the PP_AREA_1 configuration byte. If PP_AREA_1 points outside the
                      addressable memory space, only AREA_0-L and AREA_0-H are available.

                      I C AREA_0-L starts from block 0. I C AREA_0-H, starts from the block address
                      configured by the 8-bit I2C_PP_AREA_0H.

                                                                                         NTAG 5 link - NFC Forum-compliant I C bridge
                8.6.3 Plain password authentication
                       NTAG 5 link implements plain password authentication scheme from NFC perspective.
                       In summary, seven 32-bit passwords are available from NFC perspective.
                       • Read
                       • Write
                       • Restricted AREA_1 Read
                       • Restricted AREA_1 Write
                       • Destroy
                       • NFC Privacy password (is used to come out of NFC PRIVACY mode)
                       • EAS/AFI protection
                       64-bit password protection can be enabled for read and write operations.
                       A 32-bit password is used to authenticate, before doing memory operations. The
                       mechanism is easy to use. After setting and locking the password, and setting right
                       access conditions in initialization phase, the NFC Device needs to fetch a random
                       number from the ICs. XORing the plain password and this random number results in
                       used password to authenticate.
                              2
                       From I C perspective, plain password authentication can be enabled with two 32-bit
                       passwords for the restricted AREA_1 and two for the rest of user EEPROM.
                       To resist brute force attacks, a negative authentication counter can be enabled.
                       How to use plain password authentication in applications is described in AN12366.
                8.6.4 AES authentication
                       NTP5332 version of NTAG 5 link implements AES authentication from NFC perspective.
                       Highest security level of NTAG 5 link is AES mutual authentication based on the Crypto
                       Suite AES128 as defined in ISO/IEC 29167-10. A 128-bit password is used to (mutual)
                       authenticate, before doing memory operations.
                       In summary three keys can be used.
                              2
                       From I C perspective, only plain password authentication can be enabled.
                       How to use AES authentication in applications is described in AN12366.
                   8.7 NFC PRIVACY Mode
                       In the Privacy Mode the NTAG 5 link is not traceable by its UID neither by data stored
                       in the User Memory. All NTAG 5 link in the NFC PRIVACY Mode will respond to an
                       Inventory command with the UID E0 04 00 00 00 00 00 00, consequently also the User
                       memory is NOT accessible.
                       In plain password mode ENABLE NFC PRIVACY Mode command with a valid privacy
                       password is used to set NTAG 5 link to this mode and DISABLE NFC PRIVACY MODE
                       is used to disable it again.
                       In AES mode, a valid mutual authentication with the vendor-specific Purpose_MAM2[3:0]
                       1001b and a key with the privacy privilege set to 1b is needed to enable and disable the
                       NFC PRIVACY Mode.
                       NTAG 5 link in NFC PRIVACY Mode only support following commands:

                   8.8 Programmable Originality signature
                       NTAG 5 link original signature is based on standard Elliptic Curve Cryptography (curve
                       name secp128r1), according to the ECDSA algorithm. The use of a standard algorithm
                       and curve ensures easy software integration of the originality check procedure in NFC
                       devices without specific hardware requirements.
                       The UID is signed with an NXP private key and the resulting 32 byte signature is stored
                       in the configuration memory during IC production.
                       The originality signature is stored in the configuration memory block 00h to block 07h.

                       This signature can be retrieved using the READ_SIGNATURE command or with
                       the READ CONFIG command and can be verified in the NFC device by using the
                       corresponding ECC public key provided by NXP. In case the NXP public key is stored
                       in the reader device, the complete signature verification procedure can be performed
                       offline.
                       To verify the signature (for example with the use of the public domain crypto library
                       OpenSSL) the tool domain parameters shall be set to secp128r1, defined within the
                       standards for elliptic curve cryptography SEC.
                       NTAG 5 link provides the possibility to customize the originality signature to personalize
                       the IC individually for specific application. At delivery, the NTAG 5 link is pre-programmed
                       with the NXP originality signature described above. This signature is unlocked in the
                       dedicated memory. If needed, the signature can be reprogrammed with a custom-specific
                       signature using the WRITE CONFIG command during the personalization process by
                       the customer. The signature can be permanently locked afterwards by setting the Config
                       Header to “locked” with the WRITE CONFIG command to avoid further modifications.
