       1              1          VDD       Input. +5V ±10% power supply input with respect to DGND.
       2              2         DGND       Input. Digital Ground.
       3              3        CMPTR       Input, active high or low (depending on polarity of the voltage input to A/D converter).
                                           This pin connects directly to the zero crossing comparator output (CMPTR) of the
                                           TC5XX A/D converter. A high-to-low state change on this pin causes the TC520A to
                                           terminate the de-integrate phase of conversion.
       4              4            B       Output, active high. The A and B outputs of the TC520A connect directly to the A and B
                                           inputs of the TC5XX A/D converter connected to the TC520A. The binary code on A, B
                                           determines the conversion phase of the TC5XX A/D converter: (A, B) = 01 places the
                                           TC5XX A/D converter into the Auto Zero phase; (A, B) =10 for Integrate phase (INT);
                                           (A, B) =11 for De-integrate phase (DINI) and (A, B) = 00 for Integrator Zero phase (IZ).
                                           Please see the TC500/TC500A/TC510/TC514 family data sheets for a complete
                                           description of these phases of operation.
       5              5            A       Output, active high. See pin 4 description above.
       6              6        OSCOUT      Input. This pin connects to one side of an AT-cut crystal having a effective series resis-
                                           tance of 100 (typ.) and a parallel capacitance of 20pF (typ.). If an external frequency
                                           source is used to clock the TC520A, this pin must be left floating.
       7              7         OSCIN      Input. This pin connects to the other side of the crystal described in pin 6 above. The
                                           TC520A may also be clocked from an external frequency source connected to this pin.

(see Figure 4-1). The Auto Zero phase compensates
for offset errors in the TC5XX A/D converter. The
Integrate phase connects the voltage to be converted
to the TC5XX A/D converter input, resulting in an inte-
grator output dv/dt directly proportional to the magni-
tude of the applied input voltage. Actual A/D conversion
(counting) is initiated at the start of the DINT phase and
terminates when the integrator output crosses 0V. The
integrator output is then forced to 0V during the IZ
phase and the converter is ready for another cycle.
Please see the TC500/TC500A/TC510/TC514 data
sheet for a complete description of these phases.
The number of SYSCLK periods (counts) for the AZ
and INT phases is determined by the LOAD VALUE.
The LOAD VALUE is a single byte that must be loaded
into the most significant byte of 16-bit counter on board
the TC520A during initialization. The lower byte of this
counter is pre-loaded to a value of 0FFH (25610) and
cannot be changed.
The LOAD VALUE (upper 8 bits of the counter) can be
programmed over a range of 0FFH to 00H (corre-
sponding to a range of AZ = INT = 256 counts to 65536
counts). (See Figure 3-2). The LOAD VALUE sets the
number of counts for both the AZ and INT phases and
directly affects resolution and speed of conversion. The
greater the number of counts allowed for AZ and INT,
the greater the A/D resolution (but the slower the con-
version speed).

4.4.6         OPTO-ISOLATED APPLICATIONS
The 3 wire serial port of the TC520A can be opto-
isolated for applications requiring isolated data acquisi-
tion. The additional control lines (LOAD, DV, READ)
are normally not needed in such applications, but can
also be brought across the isolation barrier with the
addition of a second isolator.

NOTES:
DS21431C-page 14  2001-2012 Microchip Technology Inc.


 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
