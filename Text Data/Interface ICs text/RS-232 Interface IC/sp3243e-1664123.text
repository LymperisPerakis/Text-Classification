General Description                                                Features
The SP3243E products (SP3243E, SP3243EB, SP3243EH,
and SP3243EU) are 3 driver / 5 receiver RS-232 transceiver
                                                                   ■ Meets true EIA / TIA-232-F standards from a +3.0V to
                                                                     +5.5V power supply
solutions intended for portable or hand-held applications
such as notebook and palmtop computers. The SP3243E                ■ Interoperable with EIA / TIA-232 and adheres to EIA /
includes one complementary receiver that remains alert to            TIA-562 down to a +2.7V power source
monitor an external device’s Ring Indicate signal while the
device is shutdown. The SP3243E and EB devices feature
                                                                   ■ AUTO ON-LINE® circuitry automatically wakes up from a
slew-rate limited outputs for reduced crosstalk and EMI. The         1µA shutdown
“EU” and “EH” series are optimized for high speed with data        ■ Regulated Charge Pump yields stable RS-232 outputs
rates up to 1Mbps, easily meeting the demands of high speed          regardless of VCC variations
RS-232 applications. The SP3243E series uses an internal
high-efficiency charge-pump power supply that requires only        ■ Enhanced ESD specifications:
0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. This charge pump and              ±15kV Human Body Model
MaxLinear’s driver architecture allow the SP3243E series to           ±15kV IEC61000-4-2 Air Discharge
deliver compliant RS-232 performance from a single power
                                                                      ±8kV IEC61000-4-2 Contact Discharge

feature allows the device to automatically “wake-up” during a      ■ 250kbps minimum transmission rate (EB)
shutdown state when an RS-232 cable is connected and a
connected peripheral is turned on. Otherwise, the device
