GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADM3101E is a high speed, single-channel, RS-232/                                                       Because of the ±15 kV ESD protection of the ADM3101E
ITU-T V.28 transceiver interface device that operates from                                                  input/output pins, this device is ideally suited for operation
a single 3.3 V power supply. Low power consumption makes                                                    in electrically harsh environments or where RS-232 cables are
it ideal for battery-powered portable instruments.                                                          frequently plugged and unplugged.
The ADM3101E conforms to the EIA/TIA-232E and ITU-T V.28                                                    Four external 0.1 μF charge pump capacitors are used for the
specifications and operates at data rates of up to 460 kbps.                                                voltage doubler/inverter permitting operation from a single
