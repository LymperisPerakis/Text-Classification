Note 1:                          All devices are 100% tested at TA = +25°C. All temperature limits are guaranteed by design.
Note 2:                          Guaranteed by design.
Note 3:                          tRD timeout period begins after POK1 timeout period (tPOKP) and VCC2 ≥ VTH2 (max) (MAX6741/MAX6744).
Note 4:                          Refers to the manual reset function obtained by forcing the RESET output low.

Note: The first “_ _” or “_” are placeholders for the threshold
voltage levels of the devices. Desired threshold levels are set
by the part number suffix found in Tables 1 and 2. The “_” after
the D is a placeholder for the reset timeout period suffix found
in Table 3. For example, the MAX6736XKLTD3-T is a dual-volt-
age supervisor VTH1 = 4.625V, VTH2 = 3.075V, and a 150ms
minimum reset timeout period. All devices are available in
tape-and-reel only. There is a 2500-piece minimum order
increment for standard versions (see Table 1). Sample stock is
typically held on standard versions only. Nonstandard versions
require a minimum order increment of 10,000 pieces. Contact
factory for availability.
Devices are available in both leaded and lead-free packaging.
Specify lead-free by replacing “-T” with “+T” when ordering.
