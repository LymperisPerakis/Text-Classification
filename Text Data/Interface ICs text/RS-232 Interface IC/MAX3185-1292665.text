The MAX3185 is a complete DTE RS-232 serial port                 ♦ Enhanced ESD Protection:
designed to meet the stringent ESD requirements of the               ±15kV—Human Body Model
European community. All transmitter outputs and receiv-
                                                                     ±8kV—IEC1000-4-2, Contact Discharge
er inputs are protected to ±15kV using IEC 1000-4-2
                                                                     ±15kV—IEC1000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge
Air-Gap Discharge, ±8kV using IEC 1000-4-2 Contact
Discharge, and ±15kV using the Human Body Model.                 ♦ Latchup Free During an ESD Event
The MAX3185 has three RS-232 transmitters, five RS-              ♦ 20-Pin SSOP and SO Packages
232 receivers, and no charge pump, optimizing it for
operation in desktop PC and motherboard applications.            ♦ Guaranteed 230kbps Data Rate
It is guaranteed to run at data rates up to 230kbps, pro-        ♦ Flow-Through Pinout
viding compatibility with popular software for communi-
cating with personal computers. Power-supply current             ♦ Pin Compatible with SN75C185
is less than 300µA for IDD and ISS, and less than 1mA            ♦ Complete DTE Serial Port
for ICC.
The MAX3185 is pin and functionally compatible with
the industry-standard 75185, so existing designs can
instantly become EMC compliant. The MAX3185 is
available in an SO package and in the tiny SSOP that              ______________Ordering Information
