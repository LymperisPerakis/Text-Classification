          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

          charge pump) over the 3.0V to 3.6V VDD range. The            +1.2V. The DAC output impedance is typically 50kΩ,

          To complete the design, the DC output is biased to the
          final desired value at DAC midscale. Because the              Figure 2. Design Example for Optrex DMC Display
          previous steps concentrated on the transfer function
          only, we now have a large offset of +1.94V. This is cal-
          culated from the entire equation, where the reference
          resistors are assumed to be infinite, the DAC voltage is                                                                 Chip Information

          tor from REF+ to FB forces VLCD to -1.1V, resulting in a
          nominal contrast voltage (VREG - VLCD) of +6.1V. This
          is close to the target value of +6V.
                                             Actual Performance
          The graph in Figure 2 shows the actual LCD display’s
          data curve, along with the MAX3325’s performance
          with various DAC codes. Note that changing the DAC
          code does not affect the slope of the temperature com-
          pensation. If a wider scale of contrast adjustments is
          desired, change the DAC output resistor, and readjust
          the offset voltage.
