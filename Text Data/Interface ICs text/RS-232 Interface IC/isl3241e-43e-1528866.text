NOTES:
 1. Add “-T*” suffix for tape and reel. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
 2. These Intersil Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte
    tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Intersil Pb-
    free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

NOTES:
  4. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See Tech
     Brief TB379 for details.
  5. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.
Electrical Specifications                                               Test Conditions: VCC = 3V to 3.6V, VL = 1.8V ±10%, C1 to C4 = 0.1µF, Unless Otherwise Specified.
Typicals are at TA = +25°C, VCC = 3.3V, VL = 1.8V, Unless Otherwise Specified. Boldface limits apply over the operating temperature range, -40°C
to +85°C.

The already low current requirement drops significantly when
the device enters powerdown mode. In powerdown, supply
current drops to less than 1µA, because the on-chip charge
pump turns off (V+ collapses to VCC, V- collapses to GND), and
the transmitter outputs three-state. Inverting receiver outputs
disable only in manual powerdown (ISL3243E) or when EN =
VL (ISL3241E); refer to Table 2 for details. This micro-power
mode makes the ISL324xE ideal for battery powered and
portable applications.
