NOTES
1
  All typicals are given for V DD = +12 V, VSTBY = 5 V, TA = +25°C.
2
  Current into device pins is defined as positive. Current out-of-device pins is defined as negative. All voltages are referred to ground unless otherwise specified. For
  current, minimum and maximum values are specified as an absolute value and the sign is used to indicate direction. For voltage logic levels, the more positive value is
  designated as maximum. For example, if –6 V is a maximum, the typical value (–6.8 V) is more negative.
3
  Only one driver output shorted at a time.
4
  If receiver inputs are unconnected, receiver output is a logic high.
5
 Refer to typical curves. Driver output slew rate is measured from the +3.0 V to the –3.0 V level on the output waveform. Slew rate is determined by load capacitance.
Specifications subject to change without notice.
