Description
The ST75185C contains three drivers and five               120 k-bits/s, use of EIA/ITA-423-B (ITU v.10) and
receivers. The pinout matches the DB9S                     EIA/ITA-422-B (ITU v.11) standards are

bipolar circuits and processing of the ST75185C
provides a rugged low-cost solution for this
function at the expense of quiescent power and
external passive components relative to the
ST75C185.
The ST75185C complies with the requirements of
the EIA/TIA 232-E and ITU (formally CCITT) v.28
standards. These standards are for data
interchange between a host computer and
peripheral at signalling rates up to 20 k-bits/s. The
switching speeds of the ST75185C are fast
enough to support rates up to 120 K-bits/s with
lower capacitive loads (shorter cables). Inter-
operability at the higher signalling rates cannot be
assured unless the designer has design control of
the cable and the interface circuits at the both
ends. For inter-operability at signalling rates to

             maximum, is used in this datasheet for logic levels only (e.g. if - 10 V is a maximum, the
             typical value is a more negative voltage).

           Diodes placed in series with the VDD and VSS leads protect the ST75185C in the fault
           condition in which the devices output are shorted to ±15 V and the power supplies are at low
           state and provide low-impedance path to ground (see Figure 18).
