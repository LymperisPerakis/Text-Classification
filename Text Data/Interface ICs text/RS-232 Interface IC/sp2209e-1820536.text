Charge Pump
The charge pump is an MaxLinear-patented design (U.S.
5,306,954) and uses a unique approach compared to older
less-efficient designs. The charge pump requires two
external capacitors using a two-phase voltage shifting
technique with a 200kHz internal oscillator to attain a -9V
power supply. Refer to Figure 8 for the internal charge
pump circuit. The internal power supply consists of a
charge pump that provides output voltages of at least ±5V
regardless of the input voltage (VDD). This is important to
maintain compliant RS-232 levels, regardless of power
supply fluctuations. A description of each phase follows.

of C2 is connected to GND. This transfers a negative
generated voltage to C2. A negative voltage is built up on
the negative side of C2 with each cycle of the oscillator. If
the current drawn is small, the output voltage at C2– will be
close to –VDD. As the current drawn from C2– increases,
the output voltage will decrease with magnitude. The
charge pump cycle will continue as long as the operational
conditions for the internal oscillator are present. Refer to
Figure 9 for the internal charge pump waveforms.

SP2209E High ESD Dual Port RS-232 Transceiver Data Sheet              Applications
Applications
With six drivers and ten receivers, the SP2209E device is
ideal for applications requiring two RS-232 ports such as in
desktop or portable computers. Refer to Figure 14. For
typical DB9 serial ports for Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)
to Data Circuit Terminating Equipment (DCE) interface
implementation, 2 data lines (TxD and RxD) and 6 control
lines (DCD, RTS, DTR, DSR, CTS, and RI) are required.
The straight-through pinout for data lines in the SP2209E
enables a simplified PCB layout by allowing ground lines to
separate the signal lines and ground planes to be placed
beneath the IC without the complication of a multi-layer
PCB layout.
A receiver from each port, R5INA and R5INB, are active
while the rest of the channels are powered down. This
allows the SP2209E to monitor peripheral devices while the
rest of the system is in a power-saving standby mode.
Failsafe receiver outputs are pulled high, if the receiver
inputs are left unconnected or at zero input. The SP2209E
can be implemented as a power management device to
wake up the entire system when any communication is
initiated in peripheral devices. The SP2209E device has a
low standby current of 100µA.
A standard serial mouse can be powered from the
SP2209E drivers. Two driver outputs connected in parallel
and set to VOH can be used to supply power to the V+ pin
of the mouse. The third driver is set to VOL to link current
from the V– terminal. Typical mouse specifications are
10mA at +6V and 5mA at –6V.
LapLink Compatibility
The SP2209E can operate up to 460kbps data under
maximum drive load conditions of CL = 1000pF and
RL = 3kΩ at minimum power supply voltages.
