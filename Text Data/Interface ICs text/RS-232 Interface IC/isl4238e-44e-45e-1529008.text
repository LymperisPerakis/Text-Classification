     VCC         System power supply input (2.7V to 5.5V).
     V+          Internally generated positive transmitter supply (+5.5V).
      V-         Internally generated negative transmitter supply (-5.5V).
    GND          Ground connection. This is also the potential of the thermal pad (PD).
     C1+         External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead.
     C1-         External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead.
     C2+         External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead.
     C2-         External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead.
     TIN         TTL/CMOS compatible transmitter Inputs. (Note)
    TOUT         ±15kV ESD Protected, RS-232 level (nominally ±5.5V) transmitter outputs.
     RIN         ±15kV ESD Protected, RS-232 compatible receiver inputs.
    ROUT         TTL/CMOS level receiver outputs.
   ROUTB         TTL/CMOS level, noninverting, always enabled receiver outputs.
  INVALID        Active low output that indicates if no valid RS-232 levels are present on any receiver input.
 FORCEOFF Active low to shut down transmitters and on-chip power supply. This overrides any automatic circuitry and FORCEON (see Table 2).
 FORCEON         Active high input to override automatic power-down circuitry thereby keeping transmitters active. (FORCEOFF must be high).
     NC          No Connection
     PD          Exposed Thermal Pad. Connect to GND.
NOTE: ISL4238E input pins incorporate positive feedback resistors. Once the input is driven to a valid logic level, the feedback resistor maintains
that logic level until VCC is removed. Unused transmitter inputs may be left unconnected by the user.

result in failures not covered by warranty.
NOTE:
  1. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See
     Tech Brief TB379, and Tech Brief TB389.
  2. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.

NOTES:
  3. ISL4238E inputs utilize a positive feedback resistor. The input current is negligible when the input is at either supply rail.
  4. An “edge” is defined as a transition through the transmitter or receiver input thresholds.
  5. Skew is measured at the receiver input switching points (1.4V).
  6. Skew is measured at the transmitter zero crossing points.
  7. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
     and are not production tested.
