“#”, or “-” in the package code indicates RoHS status only. Package drawings may show a different suffix character, but the drawing
pertains to the package regardless of RoHS status.
Package thermal resistances were obtained using the method described in JEDEC specification JESD51-7, using a four-layer board.
