The SP3239E device is an RS-232 transceiver solution intended for portable or hand-held applications
such as notebook and palmtop computers. The SP3239E uses an internal high-efficiency, charge-pump
power supply that requires only 0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. This charge pump and Exar's driver
architecture allow the SP3239E device to deliver compliant RS-232 performance from a single power
supply ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V. The SP3239E is a 5-driver / 3-receiver device that is ideal for laptop
/ notebook computer and PDA applications. The SP3239E includes one complementary receiver that
remains alert to monitor an external device's Ring Indicate signal while the device is shutdown.

Figure 17. ESD Test Circuit for IEC61000-4-2
The circuit models in Figures 16 and 17 represent
the typical ESD testing circuit used for all three                    I→
methods. The CS is initially charged with the DC
                                                                      30A
power supply when the first switch (SW1) is on.
Now that the capacitor is charged, the second
switch (SW2) is on while SW1 switches off. The
voltage stored in the capacitor is then applied
                                                                      15A
through RS, the current limiting resistor, onto the
device under test (DUT). In ESD tests, the SW2
switch is pulsed so that the device under test
receives a duration of voltage.                                        0A
For the Human Body Model, the current limiting                                 t = 0ns                      t = 30ns
                                                                                                t→
resistor (RS) and the source capacitor (CS) are
1.5kΩ an 100pF, respectively. For IEC-61000-4-2,
the current limiting resistor (RS) and the source ca-           Figure 18. ESD Test Waveform for IEC61000-4-2
pacitor (CS) are 330Ω an 150pF, respectively.
The higher CS value and lower RS value in the
IEC61000-4-2 model are more stringent than the
Human Body Model. The larger storage capaci-
tor injects a higher voltage to the test point when
SW2 is switched on. The lower current limiting
resistor increases the current charge onto the
test point.
