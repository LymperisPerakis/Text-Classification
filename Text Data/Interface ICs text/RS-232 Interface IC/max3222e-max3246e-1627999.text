 Note 1: V+ and V- can have maximum magnitudes of 7V, but their absolute difference cannot exceed 13V.
 Note 2: This device is constructed using a unique set of packaging techniques that impose a limit on the thermal profile the device
           can be exposed to during board-level solder attach and rework. This limit permits only the use of the solder profiles recom-

           Preheating is required. Hand or wave soldering is not allowed.
 Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
 operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to

 Note 4: MAX3246E devices are production tested at +25°C. All limits are guaranteed by design over the operating temperature range.
 Note 5: The MAX3237E logic inputs have an active positive feedback resistor. The input current goes to zero when the inputs are at
          the supply rails.
 Note 6: MAX3241EEUI is specified at TA = +25°C.
           Transmitter skew is measured at the transmitter zero crosspoints.
