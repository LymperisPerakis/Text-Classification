This converter generates ±10 V RS-232 output levels.                                                        contain ESD protection to levels greater than 2 kV.
The ADM202 meets or exceeds the TIA/EIA-232-E and V.28                                                      The ADM202 is available in a 16-lead PDIP and both narrow
