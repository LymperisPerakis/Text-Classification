The MAX3209E is placed in standby mode when VDD is
not present, provided that VSTBY remains at +3V to
+5.5V. In standby mode, receivers R5 and R10 remain
active, consuming 100µA max while unloaded. Standby
mode allows activity to be sensed on the serial ports so
that main power can be restored by the power-man-
agement unit, as shown in Figure 6.
