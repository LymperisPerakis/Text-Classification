General Description                                         Benefits and Features
The MAX3250 is a 3.0V to 5.5V powered, ±50V isolated        • Isolation Breaks Ground Loops Due to High Common-
EIA/TIA-232 and V.28/V.24 communications interface            Mode Voltages While Maintaining Data Rate
with high data-rate capabilities. The MAX3250 is a dual       • ±50V Isolation
die part that operates with up to ±50V difference
                                                              • 250kbps Guaranteed Data Rate
between the RS-232 side and the logic side (ISOCOM
to GND). This makes the device ideal for operation in         • FAULT Output Signals Excessive Isolated-Side
noisy conditions with high common-mode voltages.                 Voltage
This feature prevents damage to the device if RS-232        • Integration of Isolation and RS-232 Saves Space
lines are inadvertently short-circuited to a +24V or ±48V
                                                              • SSOP Package
power bus.
The MAX3250 is powered by a single 3V to 5.5V supply
                                                            • Shutdown Allows Multiple Interfaces (IrDA, RS-232,
on the logic side. Power is transferred from the logic        RS-485) to be Connected to the Same UART
side to the isolated side by ±100V external capacitors.       • High-Impedance Transmitter and Receiver
The MAX3250 has two receivers (Rx) and two drivers               Outputs in Shutdown
(Tx) and is guaranteed to run at data rates of 250kbps        • 20µA Supply Current in Shutdown
while maintaining RS-232 output levels. The trans-          • Inductorless/Transformerless Design Simplifies EMI
ceivers have a proprietary low-dropout transmitter out-       Compliance

features a FAULT open-drain output to signal an exces-
sive isolated-side voltage condition on any of the RS-      • Meets EIA/TIA-232 Specifications Down to 3.0V
232 inputs. This output can drive an alarm LED or can
be monitored by the processor to prevent operation
under these conditions. The receiver outputs are high
impedance in shutdown, allowing multiple interfaces         Pin Configuration
(IrDA, RS-232, RS-485) to be connected to the same
UART.

Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
