             RS-232-Compatible Transceivers in µMAX
                                  General Description                                                                       Features
                                                                                                                                              MAX3311/MAX3313
The MAX3311/MAX3313 are low-power, +5V EIA/TIA-                  ♦ 1µA Low-Power Shutdown (MAX3311)
232-compatible transceivers. Both devices have one
transmitter and one receiver. The transceivers have a            ♦ INVALID Output (MAX3313)
proprietary low-dropout transmitter output stage                 ♦ Receiver Active in Shutdown (MAX3311)
enabling RS-232-compatible operation from a +5V sup-
ply with a single inverting charge pump. These devices           ♦ Single Transceiver (1Tx/1Rx) in 10-Pin µMAX
require only three 0.1µF capacitors and will run at data         ♦ RS-232-Compatible Operation
rates up to 460kbps while maintaining RS-232-compati-
ble output levels.
The MAX3311 features a 1µA shutdown mode. In shut-
down the device turns off the charge pump, pulls V- to
ground, and the transmitter output is disabled. The
MAX3313 features an INVALID output that asserts high
when an active RS-232 cable signal is connected, sig-
naling to the host that a peripheral is connected to the
communication port.

The time required to exit shutdown is typically less than
100µs.

                  The MAX3311/MAX3313 maintain RS-232-compatible
                  transmitter output voltage (±3.7V minimum) even at
                  high data rates. Figure 2 shows a transmitter loopback
                  test circuit. Figure 3 shows the loopback test result at
                  120kbps, and Figure 4 shows the same test at
                  250kbps.
