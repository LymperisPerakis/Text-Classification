The MAX3186 is a complete DCE RS-232 serial port                       ♦ Enhanced ESD Protection:
designed to meet the stringent ESD requirements of the
European community. All transmitter outputs and receiv-                    ±15kV—Human Body Model
er inputs are protected to ±15kV using IEC 1000-4-2                        ±8kV—IEC1000-4-2, Contact Discharge
Air-Gap Discharge, ±8kV using IEC 1000-4-2 Contact                         ±15kV—IEC1000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge
Discharge, and ±15kV using the Human Body Model.
The MAX3186 has five RS-232 transmitters, three RS-                    ♦ Latchup Free During an ESD Event
232 receivers, and no charge pump, optimizing it for                   ♦ 20-Pin SSOP or SO Packages
operation in modem applications. It is guaranteed to
run at data rates up to 230kbps, providing compatibility               ♦ Guaranteed 230kbps Data Rate
with popular software for communicating with personal
computers. Power-supply current is less than 300µA for                 ♦ Flow-Through Pinout
IDD and ISS, and less than 1mA for ICC.                                ♦ Complete DCE Serial Port
The MAX3186 is available in an SO package and in the
tiny SSOP that further reduces board space.

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
