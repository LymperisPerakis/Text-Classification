Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +85°C. Specifications are over -40°C to +85°C and are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: Both receivers will operate over the ±70V input range. The input resistance increases with input voltage. The input resis-
          tance will increase within 24V ≤ |VR_IN| ≤ 32V.
Note 4: Guaranteed by design, not production tested.
Note 5: Transmitter skew is measured at the transmitter zero crosspoints.
Note 6: Output recovery time is the delayed time for the transmitter to enter normal operating mode after an overvoltage condition.
