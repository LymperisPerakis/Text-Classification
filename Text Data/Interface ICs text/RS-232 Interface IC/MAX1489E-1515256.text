charge (ESD) shocks. These inputs have a ±25V range
and feature hysteresis and time-domain filtering. The              ♦ Latchup Free During an ESD Event
outputs are TTL and CMOS compatible. The MAX1489E
                                                                   ♦ Low 350µA Supply Current
has a 120kbps guaranteed data rate. Supply current is
typically 350µA.                                                   ♦ Input Hysteresis and Time-Domain Filtering
The MAX1489E is pin compatible with the MC1489,                      Eliminate the Need for External Filtering
MC14C89, SN75189, SN75C189, DS1489, and                            ♦ Stable Input Thresholds
DS14C89. It is available in 14-pin plastic DIP and SO
packages.                                                          ♦ Pin Compatible with MC1489, MC14C89, SN75189,
