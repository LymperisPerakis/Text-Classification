The SP3220E devices are RS-232 driver/receiver solutions intended for portable or hand-held
applications such as palmtop computers, instrumentation and consumer products. These
devices incorporate a high-efficiency, charge-pump power supply that allows the SP3220E
devices to deliver true RS-232 performance from a single power supply ranging from +3.0V
to +5.0V. This charge pump requires only 0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. The ESD toler-
ance of the these devices are over +/-15kV for both Human Body Model and IEC61000-4-2
Air discharge test methods. All devices have a low-power shutdown mode where the driver
outputs and charge pumps are disabled. During shutdown, the supply current falls to less
than 1µA.

These are stress ratings only and functional operation
of the device at these ratings or any other above those
indicated in the operation sections of the specifications
below is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum
rating conditions for extended periods of time may
affect reliability and cause permanent damage to the

The charge pump oscillator typically operates
at greater than 250kHz allowing the pump to
run efficiently with small 0.1μF capacitors.
Efficient operation depends on rapidly charg-
ing and discharging C1 and C2, therefore
capacitors should be mounted close to the
IC and have low ESR (equivalent series
resistance).
Low cost surface mount ceramic capacitors
(such as are widely used for power-supply
decoupling) are ideal for use on the charge
pump. However the charge pumps are de-
signed to be able to function properly with a
wide range of capacitor styles and values.
If polarized capacitors are used the positive
and negative terminals should be connected
as shown in the Typical Operating Circuit.
