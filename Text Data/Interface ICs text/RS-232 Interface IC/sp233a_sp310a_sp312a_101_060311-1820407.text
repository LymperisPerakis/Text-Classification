The SP233A / SP310A / SP312A devices are a family of line driver and receiver pairs that meets
the specifications of RS-232 and V.28 serial protocols. The devices are pin-to-pin compatible with
popular industry standard pinouts. The SP233A / SP310A / SP312A offer 120kbps data rate under
load, small ceramic type 0.1μF charge pump capacitors and overall ruggedness for comercial appli-
cations. Features include Exar's BiCMOS design allowing for low power operation without sacrificing
performance. These devices are available in plastic DIP and SOIC Wide packages operating over
the commercial and industrial temperature ranges.

All packages are available as lead free (RoHS compliant). To order add “-L” suffix to part number.
For Tape and Reel add “/TR”. Reel quantity is 1,500 for SOICW.
Example: SP233ACT-L/TR = lead free and Tape and Reel. SP233ACT/TR = standard with Tape
and Reel.
