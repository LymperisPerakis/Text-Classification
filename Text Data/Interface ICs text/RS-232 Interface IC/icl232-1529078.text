The voltage quadrupler contains two charge pumps which use two        which is within the 3V limits, known as the transition region, of

the clock, capacitor C1 is charged to VCC . During phase two, the     high whenever the input is floating or driven between +0.8V and
voltage on C1 is added to VCC , producing a signal across C2 equal    -30V. The receivers feature 0.5V hysteresis to improve noise
