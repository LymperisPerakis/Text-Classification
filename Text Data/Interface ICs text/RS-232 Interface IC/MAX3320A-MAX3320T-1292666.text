                                                                   — 100ms (min) Power-On RESET Pulse Width
whenever the VCC supply voltage declines below a pre-
set threshold, staying asserted for at least 100ms after           — Power-Supply Transient Immunity
VCC rises above the reset threshold. The MAX3320 has               — Guaranteed RESET Valid to VCC = 1V

dropout transmitter output stage, enabling true RS-232
performance with a dual charge pump powered from a               ♦ 250kbps Guaranteed Data Rate
+3V to +5.5V supply. The device requires only four
small 0.1µF external charge-pump capacitors, and is
guaranteed to run at data rates of up to 250kbps. It
comes in the space-saving 20-pin SSOP package.
