                       S1-A-7001 – Quick Start Guide
Congratulations on your purchase of the Connective Peripherals S1-A-7001
RS232 to CANbus adapter. Getting started is quick and easy:
General Installation
         Detailed installation instructions, port information and mechanical
          details are in the S1-A-7001 datasheet. This can be downloaded from:
          http://www.connectiveperipherals.com.
         To begin, connect the RS232 cable to your Host RS232 connector and
          the S1-A-7001. If the host RS232 is configured for DTE, like most PC-
          based COM ports, a straight-through 9-pin D-Sub cable can be used.
          External power is required and supplied through the CANbus
          connector as noted in the pin-out table at the end of this document.
CAN Firmware
         The S1-A-7001 comes with Connective Peripherals CANbus firmware
          pre-loaded from the factory. From time-to-time, Connective
          Peripherals will update the firmware and make it available on the
          web.       Updated          firmware can     be    obtained     from:
          http://www.connectiveperipherals.com. Included with the firmware
          download will be a copy of EASYBoot, a utility that programs the
          firmware into the S1-A-7001.
         When updating with newly downloaded firmware, it is first necessary
          to place the S1-A-7001 adapter in Boot-loader mode:
              o Start a terminal program, such as HyperTerminal. Connect to
                   the COM port and issue the “B” command:
