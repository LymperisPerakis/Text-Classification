 CAUTION
 ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily
 accumulate on the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection.                                                          WARNING!
 Although the AD7306 features proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may
 occur on devices subjected to high energy electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD
                                                                                                                                                                ESD SENSITIVE DEVICE
 precautions are recommended to avoid performance degradation or loss of functionality.
