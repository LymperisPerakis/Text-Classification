Note 4: MAX3246E devices are production tested at +25°C. All limits are guaranteed by design over the operating temperature
         range.
Note 5: The MAX3237E logic inputs have an active positive feedback resistor. The input current goes to zero when the inputs are at
         the supply rails.
Note 6: MAX3241EEUI is specified at TA = +25°C.
         Transmitter skew is measured at the transmitter zero crosspoints.
