The SP3238E device is an RS-232 transceiver solution intended for portable or hand-held applications
such as notebook and palmtop computers. The SP3238E uses an internal high-efficiency, charge-pump
power supply that requires only 0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. This charge pump and Exar's driver
architecture allow the SP3238E device to deliver compliant RS-232 performance from a single power
supply ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V. The SP3238E is a 5-driver / 3-receiver device that is ideal for laptop
/ notebook computer and PDA applications. The SP3238E includes one complementary receiver that
remains alert to monitor an external device's Ring Indicate signal while the device is shutdown.
The AUTO ON-LINE® feature allows the device to automatically "wake-up" during a shutdown state
when an RS-232 cable is connected and a connected peripheral is turned on. Otherwise, the device
automatically shuts itself down drawing less than 1µA.

The AUTO ON-LINE® circuit has two stages:

           1) Inactive Detection
           2) Accumulated Delay
The first stage, shown in Figure 17, detects an
inactive input. A logic HIGH is asserted on
RXINACT if the cable is disconnected or the
external transmitters are disabled. Otherwise,
RXINACT will be at a logic LOW. This circuit is
duplicated for each of the other receivers.
The second stage of the AUTO ON-LINE®
circuitry, shown in Figure 18, processes all the
receiver's RXINACT signals with an accumulated
delay that disables the device to a 1µA supply
current. The STATUS pin goes to a logic LOW
when the cable is disconnected, the external
transmitters are disabled, or the SHUTDOWN
pin is invoked. The typical accumulated delay is
around 20µs. When the SP3238E drivers or inter-
nal charge pump are disabled, the supply current
is reduced to 1µA. This can commonly occur in
handheld or portable applications where

resistor (RS) and the source capacitor (CS) are
1.5kΩ an 100pF, respectively. For IEC-61000-4-2,
the current limiting resistor (RS) and the source ca-           Figure 21. ESD Test Waveform for IEC61000-4-2
pacitor (CS) are 330Ω an 150pF, respectively.
The higher CS value and lower RS value in the
IEC61000-4-2 model are more stringent than the
Human Body Model. The larger storage capaci-
tor injects a higher voltage to the test point when
SW2 is switched on. The lower current limiting
resistor increases the current charge onto the
test point.
