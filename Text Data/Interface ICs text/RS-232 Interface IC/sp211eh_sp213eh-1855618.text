									DESCRIPTION
The SP211EH/213EH devices are high speed enhanced multi-channel RS-232 line transceiv-
ers with improved electrical performance. The SP211EH/213EH series is a superior drop-in
replacement to our previous versions as well as popular industry standards. All devices fea-
ture very low power CMOS construction and the Exar-patented (5,306,954) on-board charge
pump circuitry that generates the +/-10V RS-232 voltage levels using 0.1µF charge pump
capacitors. The SP211EH and SP213EH devices feature a low-power shutdown mode, which
reduces power supply drain to 1µA. Enhancements to this series include a higher transmis-
sion rate of 500kbps, a lower power supply current at 3mA typical (no load), and superior
ESD performance. The ESD tolerance has been improved for this series to over +/-15kV for
both Human Body Model and IEC61000-4-2 Air Discharge test methods.

Phase 1
— VSS charge storage —During this phase of
the clock cycle, the positive side of capacitors
C1 and C2 are initially charged to +5V. C1+ is
then switched to ground and charge on C1– is
transferred to C2–. Since C2+ is connected to
+5V, the voltage potential across capacitor
C2 is now 10V.
Phase 2
— VSS transfer — Phase two of the clock con-
nects the negative terminal of C2 to the VSS
storage capacitor and the positive terminal
of C2 to ground, and transfers the generated
–l0V to C3. Simultaneously, the positive side
of capacitor C 1 is switched to +5V and the
negative side is connected to ground.

the clock is identical to the first phase — the

EIA STANDARDS
The Electronic Industry Association (EIA)
developed several standards of data
transmission which are revised and up-
dated in order to meet the requirements
of the industry. In data processing, there
are two basic means of communicating
between systems and components. The
RS--232 standard was first introduced in
1962 and, since that time, has become an
industry standard. The RS-232 is a
relatively slow data exchange proto-
col, with a maximum baud rate of only
20kbps, which can be transmitted over a
maximum copper wire cable length of 50
feet. The SP211EH/213EH series of data
communications interface products have
been designed to meet both the EIA protocol
standards, and the needs of the industry.
