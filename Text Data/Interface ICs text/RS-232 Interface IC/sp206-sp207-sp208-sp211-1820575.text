The SP206, SP207, SP208 and SP211 are multi-channel RS-232 line transceivers in a variety of
configurations to fit most communication needs. All models in this series feature low-power CMOS
construction and Exar Patented (5,306,954) on-board charge pump circuitry to generate the +/-10V
RS-232 voltage levels, using 0.1µF charge pump capacitors to save board space and reduce circuit
cost. The SP206 and SP211 models feature a low-power shutdown mode which reduces power sup-
ply drain to 1 µA.

fying the RS-232 specifications. Should the input
of the driver be left open, an internal 400kOhm
pull-up resistor to Vcc forces the input high, thus
committing the output to a low state. The slew
rate of the transmitter output is internally limited
to a maximum of 30V/µs in order to meet he EIA
standards (EIA RS-232D 2,1,7, Paragraph 5).
The transition of the loaded output from high to
low also meets the monotonicity requirements
of the standard.
