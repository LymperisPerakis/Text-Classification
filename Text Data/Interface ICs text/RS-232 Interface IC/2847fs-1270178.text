The V.11 drivers are driven between VCC and GND while                     228mW. Since the LTC2845 runs slow control signals, the
the V.10 drivers are driven between VCC and VEE. Assume                   AC power dissipation can be assumed to be equal to the DC

Current going into each 450Ω V.10 receiver termination =                  + 43% • (5.5V • 23mA) = 55mW. So for an X.21 DCE port
23mA – 2mA/2 = 10.5mA. From Equation (2), V.11 PRT =                      running at 10MBd, the LTC2847 dissipates approximately
79mW and V.10 PRT = 49.6mW.                                               718mW + 55mW = 773mW while the LTC2845 dissipates
From Equation (3), PDISS(2845) = 5V • (110mA – 23mA) +                    228mW.
