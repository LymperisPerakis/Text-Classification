*Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through hole wave solder processing only. They are not intended for use in Reflow solder processing applications.
NOTES:
 1. Intersil Pb-free plus anneal products employ special Pb-free material sets; molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte tin plate
    termination finish, which are RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations. Intersil Pb-free products are
    MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.
 2. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
