The MAX3388E/MAX3389E are 2.5V-powered EIA/TIA-                                                    ♦ VL Pin for Compatibility with Mixed-Voltage
232 and V.28/V.24 communications interfaces with low                                                 Systems
power requirements, high data-rate capabilities, and
enhanced electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection. The                                             ♦ Additional I/O for Hot-Sync Applications
MAX3388E/MAX3389E have two receivers and three                                                     ♦ ±15kV ESD Protection on Rx Inputs, Tx Outputs,
transmitters. All RS-232 inputs and outputs are protected                                            LIN, and SWIN

pins are active for the MAX3389E. An internal 62Ω switch is                                        ♦ Flow-Through Pinout
provided to switch power to external circuitry or modules.                                         ♦ LOUT Active During Shutdown (MAX3389E)
A proprietary low-dropout transmitter output stage
enables RS-232 compatible performance from a +2.35V                                                                                          Applications

pump requires only four small 0.1µF capacitors for oper-
ation from a +2.5V supply. The MAX3388E/MAX3389E                                                     PDAs and PDA Cradles
are capable of running at data rates up to 460kbps while                                             Cell Phone Data Cables

                    Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                    operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                    absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

The MAX3388E/MAX3389E maintain RS-232-compatible
transmitter output voltages even at high data rates. Figure

The MAX3388E/MAX3389E contain an internal switch                                                                V-
for powering external circuitry. This can be used to                   C2                                                         C4

power hot-sync circuitry or other low-power circuitry.
The switch on- resistance is typically 62Ω. The SWIN
side of the switch is ESD protected to ±15kV.                                          T_ IN                T_ OUT
                                        Logic-Level I/O
In addition to the traditional RS-232 I/O, the
MAX3388E/MAX3389E have a logic-level transceiver                                       R_ OUT                 R_ IN
from the RS-232 connector side to the CMOS-logic
side. The input impedance is typically 30kΩ, and the                                                        5kΩ                    CL
output is open drain. The logic level I/O is active during
shutdown for the MAX3389E.                                              VCC           SHDN
This I/O transceiver is useful for hot syncing or other                                             GND

protected to ±15kV.
           Typical PDA/Cell-Phone Application
The MAX3388E/MAX3389E designed with PDA applica-
tions in mind. Two transmitters and two receivers handle         Figure 5. Loopback Test Circuit
standard full-duplex communication protocol, while an
extra transmitter allows a ring indicator (RI) signal to alert
the UART on the PC. Without the ring indicator transmit-
ter, solutions for these applications would require soft-
ware-intensive polling of the cradle inputs.
                                                                            T1IN                                         2V/div
The RI signal is generated when a PDA, cellular phone, or
other “cradled” device is plugged into its cradle. This
generates a logic-low signal to RI transmitter input, creat-
ing +3.7V at the ring indicate pin. The PC’s UART RI input              T1OUT                                            5V/div
is the only pin that can generate an interrupt from signals
arriving through the RS-232 port. The interrupt routine for
this UART will then service the RS-232 full-duplex com-
munication between the PDA and the PC.                                  R1OUT                                            5V/div
As cell phone design becomes more like that of PDAs,                                                       CL = 1000pF
cell phones will require similar docking ability and com-
munication protocol. Cell phones operate on a single                                             1µs/div
lithium-ion (Li+) battery and generate a regulated out-
put voltage of +2.35V to +3V from the phone connector.           Figure 6. Loopback Test Results at 250kbps
The baseband logic coming from the phone connector
can be as low as 1.8V at the transceivers. To prevent
forward biasing of a device internal to the cell phone,
the MAX3388E/MAX3389E come with a logic power-
supply pin (VL) that limits the logic levels presented to
