Exar's SP385E is an enhanced version of the SP200 family of RS-232 line drivers/receivers. The
SP385E offers +3.3V operation for EIA-562 and EIA-232 applications. The SP385E features offered
maintains the same performance features offered in its predecessors. The SP385E is available in
plastic SOIC or SSOP packages operating over the commercial and industrial temperature ranges.
The SP385E is pin compatible to the LTC1385 EIA-562 transceiver with the exception that the drivers
are disabled with the ON/OFF pin.

Shutdown (ON/OFF)
The SP385E has a shut-down/standby mode
to conserve power in battery-powered systems.
To activate the shutdown mode, which stops
the operation of the charge pump, a logic "0" is
applied to the appropriate control line. The shut-
down mode is controlled on the SP385E by a
logic "0" on the ON/OFF control line (pin 18 for
the SOIC and pin 20 for the SSOP packages);
this puts the transmitter outputs in a tri-state
mode.

The higher CS value and lower RS value in the
