Mnemonic      Function
VCC           Power Supply Input (5 V ± 10%).
V+            Internally Generated Positive Supply (+9 V nominal).
V–            Internally Generated Negative Supply (−9 V nominal).
GND           Ground Pin. Must be connected to 0 V.
C1+, C1–      External Capacitor 1 is connected between these pins. A 0.1 μF capacitor is recommended, but larger capacitors (up to
              47 μF) can be used.
C2+, C2–      External Capacitor 2 is connected between these pins. A 0.1 μF capacitor is recommended, but larger capacitors (up to
              47 μF) can be used.
TIN           Transmitter (Driver) Inputs. These inputs accept TTL/CMOS levels. An internal 400 kΩ pull-up resistor to VCC is connected on
              each input.
TOUT          Transmitter (Driver) Outputs. These are RS-232 signal levels (typically ±9 V).
RIN           Receiver Inputs. These inputs accept RS-232 signal levels. An internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistor to GND is connected on
              each input.
ROUT          Receiver Outputs. These are TTL/CMOS output logic levels.
EN/EN         Receiver Enable (active high on ADM213E, active low on ADM211E). This input is used to enable/disable the receiver
              outputs. With EN = low for the ADM211E (EN = high for the ADM213E), the receiver outputs are enabled. With EN = high
              for the ADM211E (EN = low for the ADM213E), the receiver outputs are placed in a high impedance state. (See Table 3
              and Table 4.)
SHDN/SHDN     Shutdown Control (active low on ADM213E, active high on ADM211E). When the ADM211E is in shutdown, the charge
              pump is disabled, the transmitter outputs are turned off, and all receiver outputs are placed in a high impedance state.
              When the ADM213E is in shutdown, the charge pump is disabled, the transmitter outputs are turned off, and Receiver R1 to
              Receiver R3 are placed in a high impedance state; Receiver R4 and Receiver R5 on the ADM213E continue to operate
              normally during shutdown. (See Table 3 and Table 4.) Power consumption for all parts reduces to 5 μW in shutdown.
