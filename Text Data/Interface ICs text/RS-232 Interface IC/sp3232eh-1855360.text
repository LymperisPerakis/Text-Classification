The SP3232EH is a 2 driver / 2 receiver RS-232 transceiver solution intended for portable or
hand-held applications such as notebook or laptop computers. The data transmission rate of
460kbps can meet the demands of high speed RS-232 applications. This device has a high-
efficiency, charge-pump power supply that requires only 0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation.
This charge pump allows the SP3232EH device to deliver true RS-232 performance from
a single power supply ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V. The ESD tolerance of the SP3232EH
device exceeds +/-15kV for both Human Body Model and IEC61000-4-2 Air discharge test
methods.

 Since both V+ and V– are separately gen-
 erated from VCC, in a no–load condition V+
 and V– will be symmetrical. Older charge
 pump approaches that generate V– from
 V+ will show a decrease in the magnitude
 of V– compared to V+ due to the inherent
 inefficiencies in the design.
 The clock rate for the charge pump typi-
 cally operates at greater than 250kHz. The
 external capacitors can be as low as 0.1µF
 with a 16V breakdown voltage rating.
