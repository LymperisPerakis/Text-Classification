485/232      4       7                     Interface Select Input. A logic low enables RS232 mode and a high enables RS485 mode. The
                                           mode determines which transceiver inputs and outputs are accessible at the LTC2870 pins as
                                           well as which is controlled by the driver and receiver enable pins. Do not float.
RXEN         5       8                     Receiver Enable. A logic high disables RS232 and RS485 receivers leaving receiver outputs
                                           Hi-Z. A logic low enables the RS232 or RS485 receivers, depending on the state of the
                                           interface select input 485/232 . Do not float.
DXEN         6       9                     Driver Enable. A logic low disables the RS232 and RS485 drivers leaving the driver output in
                                           a Hi-Z state. A logic high enables the RS232 or RS485 drivers, depending on the state of the
                                           interface select input 485/232. Do not float.
RX232                       11      15     RS232 Receiver Enable. A logic high disables the RS232 receivers and input termination
                                           resistors leaving the RS232 receiver outputs in a Hi-Z state. A logic low enables the RS232
                                           receivers and resistors, subject to the state of the CH2 pin. Do not float.
RX485                        5       9     RS485 Receiver Enable. A logic high disables the RS485 receiver leaving the RS485 receiver
                                           output in a Hi-Z state. A logic low enables the RS485 receiver and resistors, subject to the
                                           state of the CH2 pin. Do not float.
DX232                       10      14     RS232 Driver Enable. A logic low disables the RS232 drivers leaving the RS232 driver outputs
                                           in a Hi-Z state. A logic high enables the RS232 drivers. Do not float.
DX485                        6      10     RS485 Driver Enable. A logic low disables the RS485 driver leaving the RS485 driver output in
                                           a Hi-Z state. A logic high enables the RS485 driver. Do not float.
H/F         27       2      37       3     RS485 Half-Duplex Select Input. A logic low is used for full-duplex operation where pins A and
                                           B are the receiver inputs and pins Y and Z are the driver outputs. A logic high is used for half-
                                           duplex operation where pins Y and Z are both the receiver inputs and driver outputs and pins
                                           A and B do not serve as the receiver inputs. The impedance on A and B and state of differential
                                           termination between A and B is independent of the state of H/F. The H/F pin has no effect on
                                           RS232 operation. Do not float.
TE485       28       3      38       4     RS485 Termination Enable. A logic high enables a 120Ω resistor between pins A and B and
                                           also between pins Y and Z. A logic low opens the resistors, leaving A/B and Y/Z unterminated.
                                           The LTC2870 termination resistors are never enabled in RS232 mode. Do not float.
FEN          9      12      13      17     Fast Enable. A logic high enables fast enable mode. In fast enable mode the integrated DC/
                                           DC converter is active independent of the state of driver, receiver, and termination enable pins
                                           allowing faster circuit enable times than are otherwise possible. A logic low disables fast
                                           enable mode leaving the state of the DC/DC converter dependent on the state of driver, receiver,
                                           and termination enable control inputs. The DC/DC converter powers down only when FEN is
                                           low and all drivers, receivers, and terminators are disabled (refer to Table 1). Do not float.
LB          26      1       36      2      Loopback Enable. A logic high enables logic loopback diagnostic mode, internally routing
                                           the driver input logic levels to the receiver output pins. This applies to both RS232 channels
                                           as well as the RS485 driver/receiver. The targeted receiver must be enabled for the loopback
                                           signal to be available on its output. A logic low disables loopback mode. In Loopback mode,
                                           signals are not inverted from driver inputs to receiver outputs. Do not float.
CH2                         4       8      RS232 Channel 2 Disable. A logic high disables RS232 receiver 2 and RS232 driver 2
                                           independent of the state of RX232 and DX232 pins. In this state, the disabled driver output
                                           becomes Hi-Z and the 5kΩ load resistor on the disabled receiver input is opened.
                                           A logic low allows both RS232 transceiver channels to be enabled or disabled together based
                                           on the RX232 and DX232 pins. Has no effect on RS485 operation. Do not float.

Driver Overvoltage and Overcurrent Protection
The RS232 and RS485 driver outputs are protected from
short circuits to any voltage within the absolute maximum
range ±15V. The maximum current in this condition is
90mA for the RS232 driver and 250mA for the RS485
driver.

                          This configuration allows for a two-wire interface (top two wires) operating in either RS485
                          half-duplex or RS232 full-duplex mode. A second pair of wires (bottom two wires) allows a
                          second RS232 interface operating in full duplex mode and also allows for RS485 operating in
                          full duplex mode. The two-wire application is comparable to the LTC1387 data sheet, Figure 14.

            Each channel supports half-duplex RS485 or full-duplex RS232. Up to four RS232 drivers can be
            operated simultaneously using one inductor and flying cap as shown. I/O interface on left can be
            simplified with additional logic gates as shown in Figure 44
