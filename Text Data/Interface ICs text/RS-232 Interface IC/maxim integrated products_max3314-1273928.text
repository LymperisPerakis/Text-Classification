                                                                                                                                                 MAX3314
The MAX3314 is a ±5V powered EIA/TIA-232-compati-               ♦ 1µA Low-Power Shutdown with Receiver Active
ble interface. It has one transmitter and one receiver in
a flow-through architecture. The transmitter has a low-         ♦ 30µA Operating Supply Current
dropout output stage providing minimum RS-232-com-              ♦ 460kbps (min) Data Rate
patible ±3.7V output levels while driving 3kΩ and
1000pf at 460kbps. Both +5V and -5V are supplied                ♦ 8-Pin SOT23 Package
externally.                                                     ♦ RS-232-Compatible Levels
The MAX3314 has a SHDN function that reduces sup-
ply current to 1µA. The transmitter is disabled and put
into 3-state mode while the receiver remains active.
The MAX3314 is available in 8-pin SOT23, µMAX and
SO packages.

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

          The MAX3314’s receiver converts RS-232 signals to
          CMOS-logic output levels. The receiver is rated to sig-
          nals up to ±25V. The MAX3314’s receiver will remain
