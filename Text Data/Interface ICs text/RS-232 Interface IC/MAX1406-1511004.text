The MAX1406 is an RS-232 IC designed to meet the               ♦ Enhanced ESD Protection:
stringent electrostatic discharge (ESD) requirements of            ±15kV Human Body Model
the European community. All transmitter outputs and
receiver inputs are protected to ±15kV using IEC1000-4-2             ±8kV IEC1000-4-2, Contact Discharge
Air-Gap Discharge, ±8kV using IEC 1000-4-2 Contact                   ±15kV IEC1000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge
Discharge, and ±15kV using the Human Body Model.
                                                               ♦ Latchup Free During an ESD Event
The MAX1406 has three RS-232 transmitters and three
RS-232 receivers, and is optimized for operation in            ♦ 16-Pin SSOP or SO Packages
printer, modem, and telecom applications. It is guaran-        ♦ Guaranteed 230kbps Data Rate
teed to run at data rates up to 230kbps, providing com-        ♦ Flow-Through Pinout
patibility with popular software for communicating with
personal computers. Power-supply current is less than          ♦ Pin Compatible with MC145406
500µA for IDD and ISS, and less than 1mA for ICC.
The MAX1406 is pin and functionally compatible with the         ______________Ordering Information
