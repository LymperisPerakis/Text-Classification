The SP3223 products are RS-232 transceiver solutions intended for portable applications
such as notebook and hand held computers. These products use an internal high-efficiency,
charge-pump power supply that requires only 0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. This charge
pump and Exar's driver architecture allow the SP3223 series to deliver compliant RS-232
performance from a single power supply ranging from +3.3V to +5.0V. The SP3223 is a 2-
driver/2-receiver device ideal for laptop/notebook computer and PDA applications.
The AUTO ON-LINE® feature allows the device to automatically "wake-up" during a shut-
down state when an RS-232 cable is connected and a connected peripheral is turned on.
Otherwise, the device automatically shuts itself down drawing less than 1µA.

 and SHUTDOWN = VCC, the device will shut down if
 there is no activity present at the Receiver inputs.
Receivers
The receivers convert ±5.0V EIA/TIA-232
levels to TTL or CMOS logic output levels.
Receivers have an inverting output that can
be disabled by using the EN pin.                         Figure 14. Loopback Test Circuit for RS-232 Driver
                                                         Data Transmission Rates
Receivers are active when the AUTO ON-
LINE® circuitry is enabled or when in shut-
down. During the shutdown, the receivers will
continue to be active. If there is no activity
present at the receivers for a period longer
than 100µs or when SHUTDOWN is enabled,
the device goes into a standby mode where
the circuit draws 1µA. Driving EN to a logic
HIGH forces the outputs of the receivers into
high-impedance. The truth table logic of the
SP3223 driver and receiver outputs can be
found in Table 2.                                        Figure 15. Loopback Test Circuit result at 250Kbps

is charged, the second switch (SW2) is on
while SW1 switches off. The voltage stored
in the capacitor is then applied through RS,
the current limiting resistor, onto the device         15A

switch is pulsed so that the device under

The higher CS value and lower RS value in

The lower current limiting resistor increases
