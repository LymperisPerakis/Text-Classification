The SP3222EU and the SP3232EU are 2 driver, 2 receiver RS-232 transceiver solutions
intended for portable or hand-held applications such as notebook or palmtop computers.
Their data transmission rate of 1000 kbps meets the demands of high speed RS-232 ap-
plications. The SP3222EU/SP3232EU series has a high-efficiency, charge-pump power
supply that requires only 0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. This charge pump allows the
SP3222EU/SP3232EU series to deliver true RS-232 performance from a single power supply
ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V. The ESD tolerance of the SP3222EU/SP3232EU devices are
over +/-15kV for both Human Body Model and IEC61000-4-2 Air discharge test methods. The
SP3222EU device has a low-power shutdown mode where the devices' driver outputs and
charge pumps are disabled. During shutdown, the supply current falls to less than 1µA.

These are stress ratings only and functional operation
of the device at these ratings or any other above those
indicated in the operation sections of the specifications
below is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum
rating conditions for extended periods of time may
affect reliability and cause permanent damage to the
device.

— VSS transfer — Phase two of the clock
connects the negative terminal of C2 to the VSS
storage capacitor and the positive terminal of
C2 to GND. This transfers a negative gener-
ated voltage to C3. This generated voltage is
regulated to a minimum voltage of -5.5V.
Simultaneous with the transfer of the volt-
age to C3, the positive side of capacitor C1
is switched to VCC and the negative side is
connected to GND.
Phase 3
— VDD charge storage — The third phase of
the clock is identical to the first phase — the
charge transferred in C1 produces –VCC in
the negative terminal of C1, which is applied
to the negative side of capacitor C2. Since
C2+ is at VCC, the voltage potential across C2
is 2 times VCC.
Phase 4
— VDD transfer — The fourth phase of
the clock connects the negative terminal
of C2 to GND, and transfers this positive
generated voltage across C2 to C4, the
VDD storage capacitor. This voltage is
regulated to +5.5V. At this voltage, the in-
ternal oscillator is disabled. Simultaneous
with the transfer of the voltage to C4, the
positive side of capacitor C1 is switched
