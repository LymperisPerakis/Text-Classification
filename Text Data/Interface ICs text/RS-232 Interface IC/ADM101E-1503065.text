GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADM101E is an RS-232 compatible line driver/receiver in
the Analog Devices Craft Port series, containing one driver
(transmitter) and one receiver. It is ideal for serial communication
in small portable devices such as mobile telephones, palmtop
personal computers and personal digital assistants, where a full,
RS-232 serial interface is not required, and only Tx and Rx lines
are required for low speed communication between devices.
The ADM101E operates from a single, 5 V supply, and generates
its own, on-chip, −5 V power supply, thus removing the need
for a negative power supply for the driver.
                                                                   Rev. B | Page 8 of 12

SHUTDOWN INPUT
The shutdown input allows the ADM101E to be put into an
ultralow power mode where the dc-dc converter is switched off
and the transmitter is disabled. The receiver remains active
during shutdown. Logic 0 at this input enables the ADM101E,
while a Logic 1 at this input shuts down the ADM101E.
