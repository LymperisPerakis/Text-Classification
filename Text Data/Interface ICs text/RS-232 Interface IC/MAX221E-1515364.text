rate capabilities.                                                 ±15kV—Human Body Model
The MAX221E features enhanced electrostatic discharge              ±8kV—IEC 1000-4-2, Contact Discharge
(ESD) protection. Both the transmitter output and receiver         ±15kV—IEC 1000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge

The MAX221E achieves a low 1µA supply current with               to BIOS
Maxim’s revolutionary AutoShutdown™ feature.

AutoShutdown saves power without changes to the
existing BIOS or operating system by entering low-
power shutdown mode when the RS-232 cable is dis-
connected or when the transmitter of the connected                                              Ordering Information
peripheral is off. The MAX221E wakes up and drives the
INVALID pin high when an active RS-232 cable is con-                  PART                  TEMP. RANGE                  PIN-PACKAGE

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
