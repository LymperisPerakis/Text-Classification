 ________________General Description                         _Next Generation Device Features
The MAX3224–MAX3227/MAX3244/MAX3245 are 3V-                 ♦ For Smaller Packaging:
powered EIA/TIA-232 and V.28/V.24 communications              MAX3228/MAX3229: +2.5V to +5.5V RS-232
interfaces with automatic shutdown/wakeup features
                                                              Transceivers in UCSP™
and high data-rate capabilities.
                                                            ♦ For Low-Voltage or Data Cable Applications:
All devices achieve a 1µA supply current using Maxim’s
revolutionary AutoShutdown Plus™ feature. These               MAX3380E/MAX3381E: +2.35V to +5.5V, 1µA,
devices automatically enter a low-power shutdown              2 Tx/2 Rx RS-232 Transceivers with ±15kV ESD-
mode when the RS-232 cable is disconnected or the             Protected I/O and Logic Pins
transmitters of the connected peripherals are inactive,     ♦ For Integrated ESD Protection:
and the UART driving the transmitter inputs is inactive

they sense a valid transition at any transmitter or receiv-
er input. AutoShutdown Plus saves power without               +3.0V to +5.5V, Up to 1Mbps, True RS-232
changes to the existing BIOS or operating system.             Transceivers (MAX3246E Available in UCSP)
The MAX3225/MAX3227/MAX3245 also feature
MegaBaud™ operation, guaranteeing 1Mbps for high-           _______________Ordering Information
speed applications such as communicating with ISDN

low-dropout transmitter output stage enabling true RS-
232 performance from a +3.0V to +5.5V supply with a          MAX3224CAP+            0°C to +70°C    20 SSOP
dual charge pump. The charge pump requires only four         MAX3224CTP+            0°C to +70°C    20 TQFN-EP*

 Note 1: V+ and V- can have maximum magnitudes of 7V, but their absolute difference cannot exceed 13V.
 Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
 operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
 absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
