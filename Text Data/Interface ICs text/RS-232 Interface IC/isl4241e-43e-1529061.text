Pin Descriptions
      PIN                                                                 FUNCTION
     VCC    System power supply input (2.7V to 5.5V).
      V+    Internally generated positive transmitter supply (+5.5V).
       V-   Internally generated negative transmitter supply (-5.5V).
     GND    Ground connection. This is also the potential of the thermal pad (PD).
      C1+   External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead.
      C1-   External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead.
      C2+   External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead.
      C2-   External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead.
      TIN   TTL/CMOS compatible transmitter Inputs.
     TOUT   ±15kV ESD Protected, RS-232 level (nominally ±5.5V) transmitter outputs.
      RIN   ±15kV ESD Protected, RS-232 compatible receiver inputs.
    ROUT    TTL/CMOS level receiver outputs.
    ROUTB   TTL/CMOS level, noninverting, always enabled receiver outputs.
   INVALID  Active low output that indicates if no valid RS-232 levels are present on any receiver input.
 FORCEOFF Active low to shut down transmitters and on-chip power supply. This overrides any automatic circuitry and FORCEON (see Table 2).
  FORCEON   Active high input to override automatic power-down circuitry thereby keeping transmitters active. (FORCEOFF must be high).
      EN    Active low receiver enable control.
    SHDN    Active low input to shut down transmitters and on-board power supply, to place device in low power mode.
      NC    No Connection
      PD    Exposed Thermal Pad. Connect to GND.

 CAUTION: Do not operate at or near the maximum ratings listed for extended periods of time. Exposure to such conditions may adversely impact product reliability and
 result in failures not covered by warranty.
 NOTE:
   1. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See
      Tech Brief TB379, and Tech Brief TB389.
   2. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.
