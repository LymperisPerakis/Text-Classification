The SP3203E provides a RS-232 transceiver solution for portable and hand-held applications
such as palmtops, PDA's and cell phones. The SP3203E uses an internal high-efficiency,
charge-pump power supply that requires only 0.1µF capacitors during 3.3V operation. This
charge pump and Exar's driver architecture allow the SP3203E to deliver compliant RS-232
performance from a single power supply ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V.
The SP3203E is a 3-driver/2-receiver device, with a unique VL pin to program the TTL input
and output logic levels to allow inter operation in mixed-logic voltage systems such as PDA's
and cell phones. Receiver outputs will not exceed VL for VOH and transmitter input logic levels
are scaled by the magnitude of the VL input.
                                                                                  SP3203E_101_031920

is charged, the second switch (SW2) is on
while SW1 switches off. The voltage stored
in the capacitor is then applied through RS,
the current limiting resistor, onto the device         15A

switch is pulsed so that the device under
test receives a duration of voltage.

The higher CS value and lower RS value in
the IEC61000-4-2 model are more stringent
than the Human Body Model. The larger
storage capacitor injects a higher voltage
to the test point when SW2 is switched on.
The lower current limiting resistor increases
the current charge onto the test point.
