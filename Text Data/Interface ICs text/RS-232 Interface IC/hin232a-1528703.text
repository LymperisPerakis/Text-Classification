 *Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through hole wave solder processing only. They are
 not intended for use in Reflow solder processing applications.
 NOTE: Intersil Pb-free plus anneal products employ special Pb-free material sets;
 molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte tin plate termination finish,
 which are RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering
 operations. Intersil Pb-free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow
 temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J
 STD-020.
