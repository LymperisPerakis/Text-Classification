The MAX562 is designed specifically for notebook and                         ♦ 230kbps Data Rate, LapLink™ Compatible
palmtop computers that need to transfer data quickly.
It runs at data rates up to 230kbps, and has a guaran-                       ♦ Operates from a 2.7V to 5.25V Supply
teed 4V/µs slew rate. This device meets the new                              ♦ Designed for EIA/TIA-562 and EIA/TIA-232 Applications
EIA/TIA-562 standard that guarantees compatibility with
RS-232 interfaces.                                                           ♦ Guaranteed 4.0V/µs Slew Rate
The MAX562 has low-power shutdown and keep-awake                             ♦ 3 Drivers, 5 Receivers
modes. In keep-awake mode, the transmitters are dis-

abled but all receivers are active, allowing unidirection-
al communication. In shutdown mode, the entire chip is                       ♦ Low-Power Shutdown and Keep-Awake Modes
disabled and all outputs are in a high-impedance state.
                                                                             ♦ Low-Cost, Surface-Mount External Capacitors
The MAX562 is available in a standard 28-pin SO pack-
age, and in a smaller footprint shrink small-outline
package (SSOP).                                                               ______________Ordering Information
