The MAX3311E/MAX3313E are low-power, 5V EIA/TIA-                ♦ ESD Protection for RS-232-Compatible I/O Pins
232-compatible transceivers. All transmitter outputs
and receiver inputs are protected to ±15kV using the              ±15kV—Human Body Model

pump. These transceivers require only three 0.1µF                 Package
capacitors and will run at data rates up to 460kbps
while maintaining RS-232-compatible output levels.
The MAX3311E features a 1µA shutdown mode. In
shutdown the device turns off the charge pump, pulls                                           Ordering Information
