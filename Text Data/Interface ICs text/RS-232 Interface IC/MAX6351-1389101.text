Note                  1:    Overtemperature limits are guaranteed by design and not production tested.
Note                  2:    The reset output is guaranteed to be in the correct state if either VCC1 or VCC2 is within its specified region of operation.
Note                  3:    The reset output(s) is asserted if either VCC1 or VCC2 drops below its associated trip point.
Note                  4:    Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
Note                  5:    WDI is internally serviced within the watchdog timeout period if WDI is left unconnected.
Note                  6:    The WDI input current is specified as the average input current when the WDI input is driven high or low.
