                            General Description                                                                                  Features
                                                                                                                                                    MAX221
The MAX221 is a +5V-powered, single transmit/receive           ♦ Single RS-232 Transceiver in a Small 16-Pin
RS-232 and V.28 communications interface with auto-              TSSOP Package
matic shutdown/wake-up features and high data rate
capabilities.                                                  ♦ 1µA Supply Current
The MAX221 achieves a low 1µA supply current with              ♦ AutoShutdown Saves Power Without
Maxim’s revolutionary AutoShutdown™ feature.                     Changes to BIOS
AutoShutdown saves power without changes to the
existing BIOS or operating system by entering low-             ♦ Guaranteed 250kbps Data Rate
power shutdown mode when the RS-232 cable is dis-
connected, or when the transmitter of the connected
peripheral is off. The MAX221 wakes up and drives the
INVALID pin high when an active RS-232 cable is con-
nected, signaling the host that a peripheral is connect-
ed to the communications port.                                                                    Ordering Information
The MAX221 is available in a 16-pin SSOP package as                 PART                      TEMP. RANGE               PIN-PACKAGE

         Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
         operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
         absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
