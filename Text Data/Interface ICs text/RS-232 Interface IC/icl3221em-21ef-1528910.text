ICL3221EM, ICL3221EF                                                                       4. Application Information
4.      Application Information
ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF interface ICs operate from a single +3V supply, ensure a 250kbps minimum data
rate, require only four small external 0.1µF capacitors, feature low power consumption, and meet all ElA RS-232C
and V.28 specifications.
4.1       Charge Pump
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF use regulated on-chip dual charge pumps as voltage doublers, and voltage
inverters to generate ±5.5V transmitter supplies from a VCC supply as low as 3.0V, which allows these devices to
maintain RS-232 compliant output levels over the ±10% tolerance range of 3.3V powered systems. The efficient
on-chip power supplies require only four small, external 0.1µF capacitors for the voltage doubler and inverter
functions at VCC = 3.3V. See “Capacitor Selection” on page 14 and Table 6 on page 15 for capacitor
recommendations for other operating conditions. The charge pumps operate discontinuously (they turn off as
soon as the V+ and V- supplies are pumped up to the nominal values), and provides significant power savings.
4.1.1 Charge Pump Abs Max Ratings
These 3V to 5V RS-232 transceivers have been fully characterized for 3.0V to 3.6V operation, and at critical
points for 4.5V to 5.5V operation. Furthermore, load conditions were favorable using static logic states only.
The specified maximum values for V+ and V- are +7V and -7V, respectively. These limits apply for VCC values set
to 3.0V and 3.6V (see Table 2). For VCC values set to 4.5V and 5.5V, the maximum values for V+ and
V- can approach +9V and -7V, respectively (Table 3). The breakdown characteristics for V+ and V- were
measured with ±13V.

4.2      Transmitters
The transmitters are proprietary, low dropout, inverting drivers that translate TTL/CMOS inputs to EIA/TIA-232
output levels. These transmitters are coupled with the on-chip ±5.5V supplies and deliver true RS-232 levels
across a wide range of single supply system voltages.
The transmitter output disables and assumes a high impedance state when the device enters the powerdown
mode (see Table 5 on page 11). These outputs can be driven to ±12V when disabled.
All devices ensure a 250kbps data rate for full load conditions (3kΩ and 1000pF), VCC ≥ 3.0V, with one transmitter
operating at full speed. Under more typical conditions of VCC ≥ 3.3V, RL = 3kΩ, and CL = 250pF, one transmitter
easily operates at 900kbps.
Transmitter inputs float if left unconnected, and can cause ICC increases. Connect unused inputs to GND for best
performance.
4.3      Receivers
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF devices contain standard inverting receivers that three-state using the EN or
FORCEOFF control lines. The receivers convert RS-232 signals to CMOS output levels and accept inputs up to
±25V while presenting the required 3kΩ to 7kΩ input impedance (see Figure 5 on page 11) even if the power is off
(VCC = 0V). The receivers’ Schmitt trigger input stage uses hysteresis to increase noise immunity and decrease
errors due to slow input signal transitions.
The ICL3221EM’s and ICL3221EF’s inverting receivers are disabled only when EN is driven high (see Table 5).
Standard receivers driving powered down peripherals must be disabled to prevent current flow through the
peripheral’s protection diodes (see Figures 6 and 7 on page 12). When disabled, the receivers cannot be used for
wake up functions, but the corresponding monitor receiver can be dedicated to this task as shown in Figure 7.

4.4       Low Power Operation
These 3V devices require a nominal supply current of 0.3mA, during normal operation (not in powerdown mode),
which is considerably less than the 5mA to 11mA current required by comparable 5V RS-232 devices, allowing
you to reduce system power simply by switching to this new family.
4.5       Powerdown Functionality
The already low current requirement drops significantly when the device enters powerdown mode. In
power-down, supply current drops to 1µA, because the on-chip charge pump turns off (V+ collapses to VCC, V-
collapses to GND), and the transmitter outputs three-state. Inverting receiver outputs can disable in powerdown;
see Table 5 for details. This micro-power mode makes these devices ideal for battery powered and portable
applications.
4.5.1 Software Controlled (Manual) Powerdown
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF devices provide a pin that allows you to force the IC into the low power, standby
state. Driving this pin high enables normal operation, and driving it low forces the IC into its powerdown state.
Connect FORCEOFF to VCC if the powerdown function is not needed. Note: All the receiver outputs remain
enabled during shutdown (see Table 5). For the lowest power consumption during powerdown, the receivers
should also be disabled by driving the EN input high (see Figures 6 and 7).

The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF use a two pin approach where the FORCEON and FORCEOFF inputs
determine the IC’s mode. For always enabled operation, FORCEON and FORCEOFF are both strapped high.
Under logic or software control, only the FORCEOFF input needs to be driven to switch between active and
powerdown modes. The FORCEON state is not critical because FORCEOFF overrides FORCEON. However, if
strictly manual control over powerdown is needed, you must strap FORCEON high to disable the automatic
powerdown circuitry.

4.5.2 INVALID Output
The INVALID output always indicates whether a valid RS-232 signal is present at any of the receiver inputs (see
Table 5 on page 11), giving you a way to determine when the interface block should power down. If an interface
cable is disconnected and all the receiver inputs are floating (but pulled to GND by the internal receiver pull down
resistors), the INVALID logic detects the invalid levels and drives the output low. The power management logic
then uses this indicator to power down the interface block. Reconnecting the cable restores valid levels at the
receiver inputs, INVALID switches high, and the power management logic wakes up the interface block. INVALID
can also be used to indicate the DTR or RING INDICATOR signal as long as the other receiver inputs are floating
or driven to GND (as in the case of a powered down driver). Connecting FORCEOFF and FORCEON together

With any of the control schemes, the time required to exit power-down and resume transmission is only 100µs. A
mouse or other application may need more time to wake up from shutdown. If automatic power-down is being
used, the RS-232 device reenters powerdown if valid receiver levels are not reestablished within 30µs of the
ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF powering up. Figure 9 illustrates a circuit that prevents the ICL3221EM and
ICL3221EF from initiating automatic powerdown for 100ms after powering up. The delay gives the slow-to-wake
peripheral circuit time to reestablish valid RS-232 output levels.

4.5.3 Automatic Powerdown
Even greater power savings are available by using the ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF’s automatic powerdown
function. When no valid RS-232 voltages (see Figure 10) are sensed on any receiver input for 30µs, the
charge-pump and transmitters powerdown and reduce supply current to 1µA. Invalid receiver levels occur
whenever the driving peripheral’s outputs are shut off (powered down) or when the RS-232 interface cable is
disconnected. The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF power back up whenever they detect a valid RS-232 voltage level
on any receiver input, which provides additional system power savings without changes to the existing operating
system.

                                   Figure 10. Definition of Valid RS-232 Receiver Levels
Automatic powerdown operates when the FORCEON input is low, and the FORCEOFF input is high. Tying
FORCEON high disables automatic powerdown, but manual powerdown is always available using the overriding
FORCEOFF input. Table 5 on page 11 summarizes the automatic powerdown functionality.
Devices with the automatic powerdown feature include an INVALID output signal that switches low to indicate that
invalid levels have persisted on all of the receiver inputs for more than 30µs (see Figure 11). INVALID switches
high 1µs after detecting a valid RS-232 level on a receiver input. INVALID operates in all modes (forced or
automatic power-down, or forced on), so it is also useful for systems employing manual powerdown circuitry.
When automatic powerdown is used, INVALID = 0 indicates that the ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF are in
power-down mode.
The time to recover from automatic powerdown mode is typically 100µs.

4.6      Receiver ENABLE Control
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF also feature an EN input to control the receiver outputs. Driving EN high
disables all the inverting (standard) receiver outputs placing them in a high impedance state, which is useful to
eliminate supply current, due to a receiver output forward biasing the protection diode, when driving the input of a
powered down (VCC = GND) peripheral (see Figure 6 on page 12).
4.7      Capacitor Selection
The charge pumps require 0.1µF capacitors for 3.3V operation. For other supply voltages, see Table 6 on page 15
for capacitor values. Do not use values smaller than those listed in Table 6. Increasing the capacitor values (by a
factor of 2) reduces ripple on the transmitter outputs and slightly reduces power consumption. C2, C3, and C4 can
be increased without increasing C1’s value; however, do not increase C1 without also increasing C2, C3, and C4 to
maintain the proper ratios (C1 to the other capacitors).

When using minimum required capacitor values, make sure that capacitor values do not degrade excessively with
temperature. If in doubt, use capacitors with a larger nominal value. The capacitor’s Equivalent Series Resistance
(ESR) usually rises at low temperatures and it influences the amount of ripple on V+ and V-.

4.8     Power Supply Decoupling
In most circumstances a 0.1µF bypass capacitor is adequate. In applications that are particularly sensitive to
power supply noise, decouple VCC to ground with a capacitor of the same value as the charge-pump capacitor C1.
Connect the bypass capacitor as close as possible to the IC.
4.9     Operation Down to 2.7V
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF transmitter outputs meet RS-562 levels (±3.7V), at full data rate, with VCC as low
as 2.7V. RS-562 levels typically ensure interoperability with RS-232 devices.
4.10    Transmitter Outputs when Exiting Powerdown
Figure 12 shows the response of two transmitter outputs when exiting powerdown mode. As they activate, the two
transmitter outputs properly go to opposite RS-232 levels, with no glitching, ringing, nor undesirable transients.
Each transmitter is loaded with 3kΩ in parallel with 2500pF. Note: The transmitters enable only when the
magnitude of the supplies exceed approximately 3V.

120kbps. For this test, all transmitters were simultaneously driving RS-232 loads in parallel with 1000pF at
120kbps. Figure 15 shows the loopback results for a single transmitter driving 1000pF and an RS-232 load at
250kbps. The static transmitters were also loaded with an RS-232 receiver.

4.12     Interconnection with 3V and 5V Logic
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF directly interface with 5V CMOS and TTL logic families. With the ICL3221EM
and ICL3221EF at 3.3V, and the logic supply at 5V, AC, HC, and CD4000 outputs can drive ICL3221EM and
ICL3221EF inputs, but ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF outputs do not reach the minimum VIH for these logic families.
See Table 7 for more information.

4.13     Pin Compatible Replacements for 5V Devices
The ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF are pin compatible with existing 5V RS-232 transceivers (see the “Features”
section on page 1 for details), which coupled with the low ICC and wide operating supply range, make the
ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF potential lower power, higher performance drop-in replacements for existing 5V
applications. As long as the ±5V RS-232 output swings are acceptable, and transmitter input pull-up resistors are
not required, the ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF should work in most 5V applications.
When replacing a device in an existing 5V application, it is acceptable to terminate C3 to VCC as shown in Figure 1
on page 1. Terminate C3 to GND if possible, as slightly better performance results from this configuration.

5.      ±15kV ESD Protection
All pins on the ICL3221EM and ICL3221EF devices include ESD protection structures, but the families
incorporate advanced structures that allow the RS-232 pins (transmitter outputs and receiver inputs) to survive
ESD events up to ±15kV. The RS-232 pins are particularly vulnerable to ESD damage because they typically
connect to an exposed port on the exterior of the finished product. Touching the port pins or connecting a cable
can cause an ESD event that might destroy unprotected ICs. The ESD structures protect the device whether or
not it is powered up, protect without allowing any latch-up mechanism to activate, and do not interfere with
RS-232 signals as large as ±25V.
5.1       Human Body Model (HBM) Testing
The Human Body Model (HBM) test method emulates the ESD event delivered to an IC during human handling.
The tester delivers the charge through a 1.5kΩ current limiting resistor so the test is less severe than the
IEC61000 test, which uses a 330Ω limiting resistor. The HBM method determines an IC’s ability to withstand the
ESD transients typically present during handling and manufacturing. Due to the random nature of these events,
each pin is tested with respect to all other pins. The RS-232 pins on “E” family devices can withstand HBM ESD
events to ±15kV.
5.2       IEC61000-4-2 Testing
The IEC61000 test method applies to finished equipment, rather than to an individual IC. Therefore, the pins most
likely to suffer an ESD event are those that are exposed to the outside world (the RS-232 pins in this case), and
the IC is tested in its typical application configuration (power applied) rather than testing each pin-to-pin
combination. The lower current limiting resistor coupled with the larger charge storage capacitor yields a test that
is much more severe than the HBM test. The extra ESD protection built into this device’s RS-232 pins allows the
design of equipment meeting Level 4 criteria without the need for additional board level protection on the RS-232
port.
5.3       Air-Gap Discharge Test Method
For the air-gap discharge test method, a charged probe tip moves toward the IC pin until the voltage arcs to it.
The current waveform delivered to the IC pin depends on factors such as approach speed, humidity, and
temperature, so it is difficult to obtain repeatable results. The “E” device RS-232 pins withstand ±15kV air-gap
discharges.
5.4       Contact Discharge Test Method
During the contact discharge test, the probe contacts the tested pin before the probe tip is energized, and
eliminate the variables associated with the air-gap discharge. The result is a more repeatable and predictable
test, but equipment limits prevent testing devices at voltages higher than ±8kV. All “E” family devices survive ±8kV
contact discharges on the RS-232 pins.
