ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on
the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.

EN55 022 and CISPR22 define the permitted limits of radiated
and conducted interference from information technology (IT)
equipment. The objective of the standard is to minimize the
level of emissions, both conducted and radiated. For ease of
measurement and analysis, conducted emissions are assumed to
predominate below 30 MHz, and radiated emissions are
assumed to predominate above 30 MHz.

rate to minimize the level of radiated emissions, yet they are fast
enough to support data rates of up to 230 kBaud.
