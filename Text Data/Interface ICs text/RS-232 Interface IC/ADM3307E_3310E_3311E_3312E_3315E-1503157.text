Table 4. Pin Function Descriptions
Mnemonic      Function
VCC           Power Supply Input 2.7 V to 3.6 V.
V+            Internally Generated Positive Supply, 7.25 V (6.5 V Nominal for ADM3310E, ADM3315E). Capacitor C4 is connected between
              VCC and V+.
V−            Internally Generated Positive Supply, −7.25 V (−6.5 V Nominal for ADM3310E, ADM3315E). Capacitor C5 is connected between
              GND and V−.
GND           Ground Pin. Must be connected to 0 V.
C1+, C1−      External Capacitor 1 is connected between these pins. A 0.1 µF capacitor is recommended, but larger capacitors up to 1 µF
              can be used.
C2+, C2−      External Capacitor 2 is connected between these pins. A 0.1 µF capacitor is recommended, but larger capacitors up to 1 µF
              can be used.
C3+, C3−      External Capacitor 3 is connected between these pins. A 0.1 µF capacitor is recommended, but larger capacitors up to 1 µF
              can be used.
TIN           Transmitter (Driver) Inputs. These inputs accept TTL/CMOS levels. An internal 400 kΩ pull-up resistor to VCC is connected on
              each input.
TOUT          Transmitter (Driver) Outputs. Typically ±5.5 V (±6.4 V for ADM3311E and ADM3312E).
RIN           Receiver Inputs. These inputs accept RS-232 signal levels. An internal 5 kΩ pull-down resistor (22 kΩ for ADM3315E) to GND is
              connected on each of these inputs.
ROUT          Receiver Outputs. These are TTL/CMOS levels.
EN            Receiver Enable. A high level three-states all the receiver outputs.
SD            Shutdown Control. A high level disables the charge pump and reduces the quiescent current to less than 1 µA. All
              transmitters and most receivers are disabled. One receiver remains active in shutdown (two receivers are active in shutdown
              for the ADM3310E).
              For ADM3307E, ROUT3 is active in shutdown.
              For ADM3310E, ROUT4 and ROUT5 are active in shutdown.
              For ADM3311E, ROUT5 is active in shutdown.
              For ADM3312E, ROUT3 is active in shutdown.
              For ADM3315E, ROUT3 is active in shutdown.
NC            No Connect.
