   Note
       All the grounding wires of this product must run on the solder within the mask of the PCM. It must also be
      externally terminated at a single point. Also, the grounding method should be considered for efficient heat
      dissipation.
       Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across
      output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the IC may be permanently
      damaged.Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the IC since it has
      power supply pins (VM, RS, OUT, GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are
      wired incorrectly, an operation error may occur or this IC may be destroyed.
      The logic input pins must be correctly wired, too. Otherwise, the IC may be damaged owing to a current running
      through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

Protection Features
  (1) Thermal shutdown (TSD)
      The thermal shutdown circuit turns off all the outputs when the junction temperature (Tj) exceeds 150°C (typ.).
      The outputs retain the current states.
      The TB62213AFNG exits TSD mode and resumes normal operation when the TB62213AFNG is rebooted or both
      the STANDBY pin are switched to ‘H’ → ‘L’ → ‘H.
  (2) POR for VMR and VCCR (Power-ON-resets: VM and VCC voltage monitor)
      The outputs are forced off until VM and VCC reach the rated voltages.
  (3) Overcurrent shutdown (ISD)
      Each phase has an overcurrent shutdown circuit, which turns off the corresponding outputs when the output
      current exceeds the shutdown trip threshold (above the maximum current rating: 3.0 A minimum).
      The TB62213AFNG exits ISD mode and resumes normal operation when the TB62213AFNG is rebooted or both
      the STANDBY pin are switched to ‘H’ → ‘L’ → ‘H.
      This circuit provides protection against a short circuit by temporarily disabling the device. Important notes on this
      feature will be provided later.

  About Absolute Maximum Ratings
            The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
            even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
            Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
            explosion or combustion.
            The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
            circumstances. The TB62213AFNG does not have overvoltage protection. Therefore, the device is damaged
            if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
            All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations
            described later should also be referred to.

  Note 1: Please have and use the margin for the absolute maximum rating.
  Note 2: There is no problem in the condition of 500ns or less at the risetime of the CLK signal even if a frequency less
           than it is input though the lower bound of the frequency of the input of the signal of the CLK input is assumed
           to be 1kHz.
           Please note that repeated input of the signal by chattering can be generated when standing up of the signal
           becomes duller.

  Note: VIN (L → H) is defined as the VIN voltage that causes the outputs to change when a pin under test is gradually
          raised from 0 V. V IN (H → L) is defined as the V IN voltage that causes the outputs to change when the pin is then
          gradually lowered.
          The difference between V IN (L → H) and V IN (H → L) is defined as the input hysteresis.

    Note 1: Thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry
             When the junction temperature of the device reaches the threshold, the TSD circuitry is tripped, causing the
             internal reset circuitry to turn off the output transistors.
             The TSD circuitry is tripped at a temperature between 140°C (min) and 170°C (max). Once tripped, the TSD
             circuitry keeps the output transistors off until both the STANDBY pin are switched to Low or the
             TB62213AFNG is rebooted. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error, therefore is not
             recommended to be used aggressively.
    Note 2: Overcurrent shutdown (ISD) circuitry
             When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuitry is tripped, causing the internal reset circuitry
             to turn off the output transistors (OSCM is stopped.).
             To prevent the ISD circuitry from being tripped owing to switching noise, it has a masking time of four OSCM
             cycles. Once tripped, it takes a maximum of four OSCM cycles to exit ISD mode and resume normal
             operation.
             The ISD circuitry remains active until both the STANDBY pin are switched to Low or the TB62213AFNG is
             rebooted.
             The TB62213AFNG remains in Standby mode while in ISD mode.
Back-EMF
    While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the
motor current recirculates back to the power supply owing to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
    If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might
rise above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
characteristics. It must be fully verified that there is no risk that the TB62213AFNG or other components will be
damaged or fail owing to the motor back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
•   The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as
    an output short circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee complete IC safety.
•   If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the
    device may be damaged owing to an output short circuit.
•   The ISD circuit is only intended to provide temporary protection against an output short circuit. If such a
    condition persists for a long time, the device may be damaged owing to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must
    be removed immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
    Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Otherwise, it may cause device breakdown, damage
    and/or deterioration.

Calculation of the Predefined Output Current
  For PWM constant-current control, the TB62213AFNG uses a clock generated by the OSCM oscillator circuit.
  The peak output current can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RRS) and the reference voltage (VREF), as
  follows:
         IOUT = VREF/5/RRS(Ω)
  where, 1/5 is the VREF decay rate, VREF(GAIN). For the value of VREF(GAIN), see the Electrical Characteristics table.
 For example, when VREF = 3 V and IOUT = 1.8 A. Necessary RRS is 0.33 Ω(≥ 1.1 W).
Calculation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (chopper reference frequency)
  OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopper frequency (fchop) are computable in the following expressions.
         fOSCM=1/[0.56×{C×(R1+500)}]        ………C,R1: External constant for OSCM (C=270pF , R1=3.6k Ω )
         fchop = fOSCM / 16

    Note: Bypass capacitors should be added as necessary.
          It is recommended to use a single ground plane for the entire board whenever possible, and a grounding
         method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
          In cases where mode setting pins are controlled via switches, either pull-down or pull-up resistors should
         be added to them to avoid floating states.
          For a description of the input values, see the output function tables.
            The above application circuit example is presented only as a guide and should be fully evaluated prior to
          production. Also, no intellectual property right is ceded in any way whatsoever in regard to its use.
            The external components in the above diagram are used to test the electrical characteristics of the device:
          it is not guaranteed that no system malfunction or failure will occur.
Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD (VM) and GND traces to avoid short-circuits across output pins or to
the power supply or ground. If such a short-circuit occurs, the TB62213AFNG may be permanently damaged. Also, if the device is
installed in a wrong orientation, a high voltage might be applied to components with lower voltage ratings, causing them to be
damaged. The TB62213AFNG does not have an overvoltage protection circuit. Thus, if a voltage exceeding the rated maximum
voltage is applied, the TB62213AFNG will be damaged; it should be ensured that it is used within the specified operating conditions.

IC Usage Considerations
    Notes on handling of ICs
The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or
deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the case of
over-current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed its absolute
maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise occurs from the wiring or
load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the
effects of the flow of a large current in the case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time
and insertion circuit location, are required.
If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the design to
prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush current at power ON or
the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury,
smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is
unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or
ignition.
Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of
power supplies are connected properly. Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute
maximum rating, and exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
in injury by explosion or combustion. In addition, do not use any device that has been inserted incorrectly.
Please take extra care when selecting external components (such as power amps and regulators) or external devices
(for instance, speakers). When large amounts of leak current occurs from capacitors, the DC output level may
increase. If the output is connected to devices such as speakers with low resist voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may
cause smoke or ignition. (The over-current may cause smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay
attention when using a Bridge Tied Load (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker
directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Over current detection circuit
Over current detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
circumstances. If the Over current detection circuits operate against the over current, clear the over current status
immediately.
Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can cause the
over current protection circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation. In addition, depending on
the method of use and usage conditions, if over current continues to flow for a long time after operation, the IC may
generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can cause the
thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device so that heat
is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time and condition. These ICs
generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life,
deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, please design the device taking into considerate the
effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the motor’s power
supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor
power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take
the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
