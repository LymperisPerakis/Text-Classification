    Caution 1: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
                 between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is
                 operated over the absolute maximum ratings.
    Caution 2: Should by any chance the maximum junction temperature rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in deterioration of the
                 properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, design a PCB boards with thermal resistance taken into consideration by
                 increasing board size and copper area so as not to exceed the maximum junction temperature rating.
    (Note 1) Do not exceed Tjmax=150 °C.

Function Explanation – continued
  VBB1, VBB2/Power Supply Pin
    The wire is thick, short and has low impedance, because Motor’s drive current is flowing in it. The VBB1 pin and the VBB2
    pin voltage may have great fluctuation, so arrange the bypass capacitor of about 100 µF to 470 µF as close to the pin as
    possible and adjust the VBB1 pin and the VBB2 pin voltage are stable. Increase the capacity as needed especially, when a
    large current is used or those motors that have great back electromotive force are used.
    In addition, for the purpose of reducing of power supply’s impedance in wideband, it is recommended to set parallel
    connection of multi-layered ceramic capacitor of 0.01µF to 0.1µF etc. Extreme care must be used to make sure that the
    VBB1 pin and the VBB2 pin voltage does not exceed the rating even for a moment. The VBB1 pin and the VBB2 pin are
    shorted inside the IC, but be sure to short externally the VBB1 pin and the VBB2 pin when using. If used without shorting,
    malfunction or destruction may occur because of concentration of current routes etc. Still more, in the power supply pin,
    there is built-in clamp component for preventing of electrostatic destruction. When a steep pulse signal or voltage such as a
    surge exceeding the absolute maximum rating is applied, this clamp component operates, and the IC might be destroyed as
    a result. Be sure that the maximum absolute rating must not be exceeded. It is effective to mount a Zener diode of about the
    maximum absolute rating. Moreover, the diode for preventing electrostatic destruction is inserted between the VBB1 pin, the
    VBB2 pin and the GND pin. Be careful about the reverse voltage because the IC might be destroyed as a result if reverse
    voltage is applied to the VBB1 pin, the VBB2 pin and the GND pin
  GND/Ground Pin
    In order to reduce the electric noise by switching current and to stabilize the internal reference voltage of the IC, make the
    wiring impedance from this pin as low as possible to achieve the lowest electrical potential no matter what operating state it
    can be. Moreover, design the patterns not to have any common impedance with other GND patterns.
  OUTxA(Note16), OUTxB(Note 17)/H Bridge Output Pin
    Motor’s drive current is flowing in it, so the wire is thick, short and has low impedance. It is also effective to add a Schottky
    diode if output has positive or negative great fluctuation when large current is used. For example, counter electromotive
    voltage etc. Moreover, in the output Pin, there is built-in clamp component for preventing of electrostatic destruction. When a
    steep pulse signal or voltage such as a surge exceeding the absolute maximum rating is applied, this clamp component
    operates, and the IC might be destroyed in the end. Be be sure that the maximum absolute rating must not exceeded.
    (Note 16) x=1, 2, 3 or 4
    (Note 17) x=1, 2, 3 or 4
  SENSEx(Note 18)/Connection Pin of Resistor for Detecting of Output Current
    Connect the resistor of 0.1Ω to 0.3Ω for current detection between this pin and GND. Determine the resistor so that power
    consumption W=IOUT2•R [W] of the current-detecting resistor does not exceed the maximum absolute rating of the resistor. In
    addition, it has a low impedance and does not have a common impedance with other GND patterns because motor’s drive
    current flows in the pattern through the SENSEx pin to current-detecting resistor to GND. Do not exceed the rating because
    there is the possibility of circuits’ malfunction etc., if the SENSE pin voltage exceeds the maximum rating (0.7 V). Moreover,
    be careful because if the SENSEx pin is shorted to GND, large current flows without normal PWM constant current control,
    and OCP or TSD might operate. If there is a possibility of malfunction, such as output does not flow even when the SENSEx
    pin is open, please do not to such a state.
     (Note 18) x=1, 2, 3 or 4
  VREFx(Note 19)/Output Current Value Setting Pin
    This is the pin to set the output current value. It can be set by the VREF pin voltage and current-detecting resistor (SENSE
    resistor).
    (Note 19) x=1 or 2
                𝑉𝑅𝐸𝐹
    𝐼𝑂𝑈𝑇 =               / 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸           [A]
                   3
    Where:
    IOUT is the output current.
    VREF is the voltage of output current value-setting pin.
    SENSE is the current-detecting resistor.
    Avoid using the IC with the VREFx pin is open because if it is open, it may have malfunctions such as flowing a large current
    by unstable input, the increased the VREFx pin voltage and increased setting current. The input voltage range must be kept
    because a large current might flow to output and OCP or TSD might operate if the voltage of over 1.5 V is applied on the
    VREFx pin. Besides, select the resistance value in consideration of the outflow current (Max 2 µA) if it is inputted by
    resistance division. The minimum current, which can be controlled by the VREFx pin voltage, is determined by motor coil’s L,
    R values and minimum ON time because there is a minimum ON time in PWM drive.

  EXP-PAD
    For VQFN036V6060 package, the heat-radiating metal is mounted on the IC’s backside. It is the precondition that making
    the heat-radiating treatment when in use. Therefore, it must be connected by solder with the GND plane on the board and
    ensure the sufficient heat-radiation area by taking the GND pattern as wide as possible. Moreover, the backside metal is
    shorted with IC chip’s backside and becomes the GND potential, so there is the danger of malfunction and destruction if
    shorted with potentials other than GND. Never design any wiring patterns other than GND through the IC's backside.

Protection Circuits
    Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
      This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit for thermal protection. When the IC’s chip temperature rises to 175 °C (Typ)
      or more, the motor output becomes OPEN. Also, when the temperature returns to 150 °C (Typ) or less, it automatically
      returns to normal operation. However, if heat is continued to be added externally even while TSD is in operation, heat
      overdrive can lead to destruction.
    Over Current Protection (OCP)
      This IC has a built in over current protection circuit as a provision against destruction when the motor outputs are shorted
      each other or VBB1, VBB2-motor output or motor output-GND is shorted. This circuit latches the motor output to OPEN
      condition when the regulated current flows for 4 µs (Typ). It returns with power reactivation by a reset of the PS pin. The
      over current protection circuit’s only aim is to prevent the destruction of the IC from irregular situations such as motor
      output shorts, and is not meant to be used as protection or security for the set. Therefore, sets should not be designed to
      take into account this circuit’s functions. After OCP operating, if irregular situations continue and the return by power
      reactivation or a reset of the PS pin is carried out repeatedly, then OCP operates repeatedly and the IC may generate heat
      or otherwise deteriorate. When the L value of the wiring is great due to the wiring being long of faults, ground faults and
      shorting, there is a possibility of destruction after the over current has flowed and the output pin voltage jumps up and the
      absolute maximum values can be exceeded. Also, when current which is the output current rating or more and the OCP
      detection current or less flows, the IC can heat up to over Tjmax=150 °C and can deteriorate, so current which exceeds
      the output rating should not be applied.
    Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO)
      This IC has a built-in under voltage lockout function to prevent false operation such as IC output during power supply
      under voltage. When the applied voltage to the VBB1 pin and the VBB2 pin goes 5 V (Typ) or less, the motor output is set
      to OPEN. This switching voltage has a 1 V (Typ) hysteresis to prevent malfunction such as noise etc. Be aware that this
      circuit does not operate during power save mode. Also, the electrical angle is reset when the UVLO circuit operates.
    Over Voltage Lockout (OVLO)
      This IC has a built-in over voltage lockout function to protect the IC output and the motor during power supply over voltage.
      When the applied voltage to the VBB1 pin and the VBB2 pin goes 32 V (Typ) or more, the motor output is set to OPEN.
      This switching voltage has a 1 V (Typ) hysteresis and a 4 µs (Typ) mask time to prevent malfunction such as noise etc.
      Although this over voltage locked out circuit is built-in, there is a possibility of destruction if the absolute maximum value
      for power supply voltage is exceeded, therefore the absolute maximum value should not be exceeded. Be aware that this
      circuit does not operate during power save mode.
    Ghost Supply Prevention (protects against malfunction when power supply is disconnected)
      If a control signal (logic input, VREFx(Note 22)) is input when there is no power supplied to this IC, there is a function which
      prevents a malfunction where voltage is supplied to power supply of this IC or other IC in the set via the electrostatic
      destruction prevention diode from these input pins to the VBB1 pin and VBB2 pin. Therefore, there is no malfunction of the
      circuit even when voltage is supplied to these input pins while there is no power supply.
      (Note 22) x=1 or 2
    Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
      The IC is not designed for using in the presence of strong electromagnetic field. Be sure to confirm that no malfunction is
      found when using the IC in a strong electromagnetic field.

PWM Constant Current Control
  1) Current control operation
    The output current increases due to the output transistor turned on. When the voltage on the SENSEx(Note 23) pin, the output
    current is converted voltage due to connect the external resistance to the SENSEX pin, reaches the voltage value set by the
    internal 2-bit DAC and the VREFx(Note 24) input voltage, the current limit comparator engages and enters current decay mode.
    Thereafter the output turned on again after a period of time determined the internal timer. The process repeats itself
    constantly.
    (Note 23) x=1, 2, 3 or 4
    (Note 24) x=1 or 2
  2) Noise-masking function
    In order to avoid misdetection of current detection comparator due to SENSEx spikes noise that may occur when the output
    turns on, the IC employs the minimum ON-time (tONMIN). It invalids the current detection for the minimum ON-time of 1 µs
    (Typ) from the output transistor turned on. This allows constant-current drive without the need for an external filter.
  3) Internal Timer
    IC internal voltage repeat charging and discharging between VL to VH.
    The detection of the internal comparator is masked while charging from VL to VH in order to cancel noise. This period
    defines the minimum ON-time (tONMIN) of the motor output transistor. The internal voltage begins discharging once the
    voltage reaches VH. When the output current reaches the current limit during this period, then the IC enters decay mode. It
    reaches VL, at which point the IC internal voltage is switched back ON. The current output and internal terminal begin
    charging simultaneously.

  The merits of each decay mode are as follows:
    SLOW DECAY
      The voltage of motor coils is small and the regenerative current decreases slowly. So the output current ripple is small and
      this is favorable for motor torque. However, output vibration increase without following the change in the current limit value
      according to increase in output current due to deterioration of current controllability in the low-current region and it is easily
      influenced by EMF when high-pulse-rate in HALF STEP or QUARTER STEP modes. Thus, this decay mode is most suited
      to FULL STEP modes or low-pulse-rate as HALF STEP or QUARTER STEP modes.
    FAST DECAY
      FAST DECAY decreases the regeneration current much more quickly than slow decay, greatly reducing distortion of the
      output current waveform. However, FAST DECAY yields a much larger output current ripple, which decreases the overall
      average current running through the motor. This causes two problems: first, the motor torque decreases (increasing the
      current limit value can help eliminate this problem, but the rated output current must be taken into consideration); and
      second, the power loss within the motor increases and thereby radiates more heat. If neither of these problems is of
      concern, then FAST DECAY can be used for high-pulse-rate HALF STEP or QUARTER STEP drive.
    Additionally, this IC has MIX DECAY as a method to remedy the problems caused by the above SLOW DECAY and FAST
    DECAY. In this IC, SLOW DECAY / MIX DECAY (60 % Typ SLOW DECAY) can be selected.
    Switching between SLOW DECAY and FAST DECAY during current decay can improve current control without increasing
    current ripple.

About translator circuit operation in CLK-IN drive system                  - Description for CH1 (CH2: same as CH1)-
    This series builds in translator circuit and can drive stepping motor in CLK-IN drive mode.
    The operation of the translator circuit in CLK-IN drive mode is described as below.
  Reset Operation
      The translator circuit is initialized by power ON reset function and the PS pin.
        Initializing operation when power supply is turned on
        (1) If power supply is turned on at PS=L (Use this sequence as a general rule)
           When power supply is turned on, the power ON reset function operates in the IC and initialized, but as long as it is
           PS=L, the motor output is the OPEN state. After power supply is turned on, because of the changing of PS=L→H, the
           motor output becomes the ACTIVE state, and the excitation is started at the initial electrical angle.
           But at the time of PS=L→H, it returns from the standby state to the normal state and there is a delay of 40 µs (Max)
           until the motor output has become the ACTIVE state.
                          Reset is released              ACTIVE

        (2) If power supply is turned on at PS=H
           When power supply is turned on, the power ON reset function operates in the IC and be initialized before the motor
           output becomes the ACTIVE state during ENABLE1=H, and the excitation is started at the initial electrical angle.
        Initializing operation during motor operating
           Input the reset signal to the PS pin when the translator circuit is initialized during motor fundamentally operating.
           (Refer to P.14) But at the time of PS=L→H, it returns from the standby state to the normal state and there is a delay of
           40 µs (Max) until the motor output has become the ACTIVE state, so be careful.
  Control Input Timing
    Please observe the following input timing because basically the translator circuit operates at the rising edge of CLK signal. If
    you disobey this timing and input, then there is the possibility that the translator circuit does not operate as expected. In
    addition, at the time of PS=L→H, it returns from the standby state to the normal state and there is a delay of 40 µs (Max) until
    the motor output has become the ACTIVE state. Be careful that the phase advance operation does not work even if CLK is
    input within this delay interval.

     To reset the translator circuit while the motor is working, input the PS pin to L. The reset operation works regardless of other
     input signals. At this time, the IC internal circuit turns to the standby mode and makes the motor output OPEN.

     The switch of CW_CCW is reflected by the rising edge of CLK1 that comes immediately after the changes of the CW_CCW 1
     signal. However, even if the control on driver IC side supports, the motor cannot follow and might make a step-out or a
     misstep depending on the state of operation of the motor at the switching. Evaluate the switching sequence sufficiently.

About translator circuit operation in CLK-IN drive system – continued
  ENABLE Switch Timing Chart (FULL STEP, MODE01=L, MODE11=L)
    The switch of the ENABLE signal is reflected by the change in the ENABLE signal with regardless of other input signals.
    In the section of ENABLE1=L, because the motor output becomes OPEN and the CLK input is cut off, the phase advance
    operation of the internal translator circuit stops. Therefore, the progress of ENABLE1=L to H is completed before the input of
    ENABLE1=L. Switching of the excitation mode (MODE01, MODE11) is performed even in the ENABLE1=L section. If
    excitation mode is switched in ENABLE1=L interval, it returns ENABLE1=L to H with the excitation mode which is after
    switched.

  About the Switch of the Motor Excitation Mode
    The switch of the excitation mode be done at the same time as changing of the signal MODE01 and MODE11 regardless of
    the CLK signal. This product has a function which prevents the motor step-out caused by discrepancies of torque vector of
    transitional excitations while excitation mode switching. However, even if the control on driver IC side supports, the motor
    cannot follow and might make a step-out or a misstep depending on the state of operation of the motor at the switching.
    Evaluate the switching sequence sufficiently.
  Cautions of Bidirectional Switch of CW_CCW1 and Excitation Modes (MODE01, MODE11)
    As shown in the figure below, the area between the end of reset discharge (PS=L→H) and beginning of the first CLK signal
    input is defined as interval A, while the area from the end of the first CLK signal input is defined as interval B.
       Interval A
          => For CW_CCW1, no limitation is applied on switch of excitation mode.
       Interval B
          => In CLK 1 period, or in ENABLE1=L interval, CW_CCW1 and excitation mode cannot be switched together.
            Violation of this restriction may lead to misstep (with one extra leading phase) or step-out.
            Therefore, in case that CW_CCW1 and excitation modes are switched simultaneously, the PS pin must be input reset
            signal. Then start to operate in interval A before carrying out such bidirectional switch.
                               Interval A                                 Interval B

Power Dissipation
    Confirm that the IC’s chip temperature Tj is not over 150 °C in consideration of the IC’s power consumption (W), thermal
    resistance (°C/W) and ambient temperature (Ta). When Tj=150 °C is exceeded, the functions as a semiconductor do not
    operate and problems such as parasitism and leaks occur. Constant use under these circumstances leads to deterioration
    and eventually destruction of the IC. Tjmax=150 °C must be strictly obeyed under all circumstances.
  Thermal Calculation
    The IC’s consumed power can be estimated roughly with the power supply voltage (VBB ), circuit current (ICC), output ON
    resistance (RONH, RONL) and motor output current value (IOUT).
    The calculation method during FULL STEP drive, SLOW DECAY mode is shown here:
    𝑊𝑉𝐵𝐵 = 𝑉𝐵𝐵 × 𝐼𝐶𝐶                [W]
    where:
    WVBB is the consumed power of the VBB.
    VBB is the power supply voltage.
    ICC is the circuit current.
    𝑊𝐷𝑀𝑂𝑆 = 𝑊𝑂𝑁 + 𝑊𝐷𝐸𝐶𝐴𝑌 [W]
    𝑊𝑂𝑁 = (𝑅𝑂𝑁𝐻 + 𝑅𝑂𝑁𝐿 ) × 𝐼𝑂𝑈𝑇 2 × 2 × 𝑜𝑛_𝑑𝑢𝑡𝑦 [W]
    𝑊𝐷𝐸𝐶𝐴𝑌 = (2 × 𝑅𝑂𝑁𝐿 ) × 𝐼𝑂𝑈𝑇 2 × 2 × (1 − 𝑜𝑛_𝑑𝑢𝑡𝑦) [W]
    where:
    WDMOS is the consumed power of the output DMOS.
    WON is the consumed power during output ON.
    WDECAY is the consumed power during current decay.
    RONH is the upper P-channel DMOS ON-resistance.
    RONL is the lower N-channel DMOS ON-resistance.
    IOUT is the motor output current value.
                                    𝑡
    on_duty is PWM on duty= 𝑂𝑁⁄𝑡
                                         𝐶𝐻𝑂𝑃
    “ 2 ” is the H bridge A and B.
    tON varies depending on the L and R values of the motor coil and the current set value. Confirm by actual measurement, or
    make an approximate calculation.
    tCHOP is the chopping period, which is determined by the internal timer. Refer to P.9, 10 for details.

       𝑊_𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑊𝑉𝐶𝐶 + 𝑊𝐷𝑀𝑂𝑆 [W]
       𝑇𝑗 = 𝑇𝑎 + 𝜃𝑗𝑎 × 𝑊_𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 [°C]
       where:
     W_total is the consumed total power of IC.
     Tj is the junction temperature.
     Ta is the air temperature.
     Θja is the thermal resistance value.
    However, the thermal resistance value θja [°C/W] differs greatly depending on circuit board conditions. The calculated values
    above are only theoretical. For actual thermal design, perform sufficient thermal evaluation for the application board used,
    and create the thermal design with enough margin not to exceed Tjmax=150°C. Although unnecessary with normal use, if
    the IC is to be used under especially strict heat conditions, consider externally attaching a Schottky diode between the motor
    output pin and GND to abate heat from the IC.

  Temperature Monitoring
    In respect of BD63888MUV, there is a way to directly measure the approximate chip temperature by using the TESTx(Note 25)
    pin with a protection diode for prevention from electrostatic discharge. However, temperature monitor using this TESTx pin is
    only for evaluation and experimenting, and must not be used in actual usage conditions.
    (Note 25) x=1 or 2
    (1) Measure the pin voltage when a current of IDIODE=50 µA flows from the TESTx pin to the GND, without supplying VBB1,
          VBB2 to the IC. This is measurement of the VF voltage inside the diode.
    (2) Measure the temperature characteristics of this pin voltage. (V F has a linear negative temperature factor against the
          temperature.) With the results of these temperature characteristics, chip temperature can calibrate from the TESTx pin
          voltage.
    (3) Supply VBB1, VBB2, confirm the TESTx pin voltage while running the motor, and calculate approximately the chip
          temperature from the results of (2).

Operational Notes
     1.   Reverse Connection of Power Supply
          Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
          connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
          supply pins.
     2.   Power Supply Lines
          Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at
          all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
          capacitors.
     3.   Ground Voltage
          Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
     4.   Ground Wiring Pattern
          When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
          connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
          ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
          on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
     5.   Recommended Operating Conditions
          The function and operation of the IC are guaranteed within the range specified by the recommended operating
          conditions. The characteristic values are guaranteed only under the conditions of each item specified by the electrical
          characteristics.
     6.   Inrush Current
          When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
          instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
          supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and
          routing of connections.
     7.   Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
          Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
     8.   Testing on Application Boards
          When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
          subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
          should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
          process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
          transport and storage.
     9.   Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
          Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
          damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
          Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
          unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
     10. Unused Input Pins
          Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
          extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
          charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
          cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
          power supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
     11. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
          This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
          isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
          parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
          When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
          When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
          Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
          interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
          operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be
          avoided.

                                                   Figure 9. Example of monolithic IC structure
     12. Ceramic Capacitor
          When using a ceramic capacitor, determine a capacitance value considering the change of capacitance with
          temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
     13. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
          This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
          be within the IC’s maximum junction temperature rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the
          junction temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF power output pins. The IC should
          be powered down and turned ON again to resume normal operation because the TSD circuit keeps the outputs at the
          OFF state even if the Tj falls below the TSD threshold.
          Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
          circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
          heat damage.
     14. Over Current Protection Circuit (OCP)
          This IC incorporates an integrated overcurrent protection circuit that is activated when the load is shorted. This
          protection circuit is effective in preventing damage due to sudden and unexpected incidents. However, the IC should
          not be used in applications characterized by continuous operation or transitioning of the protection circuit.

                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

Precaution for Electrostatic
    This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper
    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
              [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
              [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
              [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
