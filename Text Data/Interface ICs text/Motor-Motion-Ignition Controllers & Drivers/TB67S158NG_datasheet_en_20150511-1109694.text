    3-1. Application Notes
1) All the grounding wires of the device must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated at
only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
2) When setting pin of each mode is controlled by SW, the voltage should be pull-up to the power supply which is
the same voltage of the input signal or pull-down to the GND in order to avoid Hi-Z.
3) Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across
output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently
damaged.
4) Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power
supply pins (VM, OUT, GND, etc.) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired
incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running
through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

Functional description
ISD (over current detection)
ISD turns off the output of the motor when it detects over current (exceeding absolute maximum rating) in the
output transistors. It is cleared when VM power supply is applied again or configured standby mode.
TSD (thermal shutdown circuit)
TSD turns off all outputs of the motor when it detects abnormal temperature (Tj =160°C (typ.)) of the IC. It is
cleared when VM power supply is applied again or configured standby mode.
VMR (VM power supply monitor) circuit
When the voltage of VM is higher than the specified value, output is set high level. When it is lower than the
 specified value, output is set low (internal status).
POR (Power On Reset) circuit
When both VMR and VCCR are high: Logic transistors = active, Other states: Logic transistors = OFF

Absolute maximum ratings
     The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for
   a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or
   deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion. The value of even one parameter of the absolute
   maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any circumstances. The device does not have overvoltage
   detection circuit. Therefore, the device is damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied. All voltage
   ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations described later
   should also be referred to.

    Note1) About Thermal shutdown (TSD)
          When the junction temperature of the IC reaches the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit operates and turns off the
          output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is provided to avoid misdetection by switching. (As for details,
          refer to the section of “Blanking time of TSD”.) The IC drives in the standby mode while TSD operates. Once the
          TSD circuit is triggered, the detect latch signal can be cleared by reasserting the VM power supply, or setting the
          device to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error, therefore it is not
          recommended to be used aggressively.
    Note2) About Over-current detection (ISD)
          When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit operates and turns off the output transistors.
          Noise rejection blanking time is provided to avoid misdetection by switching. (As for details, refer to the section of
          “Blanking time of ISD”.) While ISD operates, the IC drives in the standby mode. After ISD circuit is triggered, the
          detect latch signal can be cleared by reasserting the VM power supply, or setting the device to standby mode.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor current
recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF. If the power supply does not have enough
sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the
motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must be fully verified that there is no risk that
the device or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an output
short-circuits; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety. If the device is used beyond the specified
operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device may be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such condition persists
for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed immediately by
external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

Power consumption of the IC
 Power consumption of the IC is separated into two; consumed by output transistors and by logic transistors.
  1. Power consumption of power transistors (when RON (D-S) = 0.5 Ω)
 Electrical power of output block is consumed by transistors.
 Electrical power of the transistors in one motor drive is indicated as follows;
       P (out) = 2 (number of channels) × Iout (A)2 × Ron (Ω) ...................................................................................... (1)
       When Ron = 0.5 Ω and Iout = 1.0 A,
                                2
       P (out) = 2 (ch) × 1.0(A) × 0.5 (Ω) ....................................................................................................................... (2)
                = 1.0(W)
  2. Power consumption of logic and IM system
  It is calculated by separating the states into driving mode and turning off mode.
       I (IM2) = 2 mA (max)
 Power consumption can be estimated from below formula.
       P (IM) = 24 (V) × 0.002 (A) .................................................................................................................................. (3)
                =0.048 (W)
  3. Power consumption
 Whole power consumption (P) is calculated from the result of the calculations of (2) and (3).
       P = P (out) + P (IM) = 1.048 (W)
    As for thermal design for the board, take enough margin to design after evaluating the IC with the actual board.

IC Usage Considerations
    Notes on handling of ICs
          (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
                even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
                breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
          (2)
               Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
                case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
                exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
                pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
                breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the
                case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit
                location, are required.
          (3)    If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
                design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
                current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
                IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
                protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing
                IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
          (4)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
                terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
                Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
                exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
                injury by explosion or combustion.
                In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
                applied even just once.
           (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
               components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
               If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback condenser, the IC
               output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
               withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
               smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
               (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
 Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
 circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
 immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
 depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after
 operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
 Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
 operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 thermal shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
 When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
 appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time or under any
 condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
 decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
 into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
 When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
 supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s
 motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To
 avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
