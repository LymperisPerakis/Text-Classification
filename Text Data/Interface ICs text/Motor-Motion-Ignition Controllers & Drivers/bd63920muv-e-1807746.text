● Input mode in the case of CLK-IN drive (SELECT1=L)
  ○CLK／Clock input terminal for advancing the electrical angle
    CLK is reflected at rising edge. The Electrical angle advances by one for each CLK input.
    Motor’s misstep will occur if noise is picked up at the CLK terminal, so please design the pattern in such a way that there is
    no noise plunging

  ○VCC1,VCC2／Power supply terminal
    Motor’s drive current is flowing in it, so please wire in such a way that the wire is thick & short and has low impedance.
    Voltage VCC may have great fluctuation, so please arrange the bypass capacitor of about 100µ～470µF as close to the
    terminal as possible and adjust in such a way that the voltage VCC is stable. Please increase the capacity if needed
    especially when a large current is used or those motors that have great back electromotive force are used. In addition, for
    the purpose of reducing of power supply’s impedance in wide frequency bandwidth, parallel connection of multi-layered
    ceramic capacitor of 0.01µ～0.1µF etc is recommended. Extreme care must be used to make sure that the voltage VCC
    does not exceed the rating even for a moment. VCC1 & VCC2 are shorted inside IC, so please be sure to short externally
    VCC1 & VCC2 when using. If used without shorting, malfunction or destruction may occur because of concentration of
    current routes etc., so please make sure that they are shorted when in use. Still more, in the power supply terminal, there is
    built-in clamp component for preventing of electrostatic destruction. If steep pulse or voltage of surge more that maximum
    absolute rating is applied, this clamp component operates, as a result there is the danger of destruction, so please be sure
    that the maximum absolute rating must not be exceeded. It is effective to mount a Zener diode of about the maximum
    absolute rating. Moreover, the diode for preventing of electrostatic destruction is inserted between VCC terminal and GND
    terminal, as a result there is the danger of IC destruction if reverse voltage is applied between VCC terminal and GND
    terminal, so please be careful.
  ○GND／Ground terminal
    In order to reduce the noise caused by switching current and to stabilize the internal reference voltage of IC, please wire in
    such a way that the wiring impedance from this terminal is made as low as possible to achieve the lowest electrical potential
    no matter what operating state it may be.
  ○OUT1A,OUT1B,OUT2A,OUT2B／H Bridge output terminal
    Motor’s drive current is flowing in it, so please wire in such a way that the wire is thick & short and has low impedance. It is
    also effective to add a Schottky diode if output has positive or negative great fluctuation when large current is used etc, for
    example, if counter electromotive voltage etc. is great. Moreover, in the output terminal, there is built-in clamp component
    for preventing of electrostatic destruction. If steep pulse or voltage of surge more than maximum absolute rating is applied,
    this clamp component operates, as a result there is the danger of even destruction, so please be sure that the maximum
    absolute rating must not be exceeded.
  ○RNF1,RNF2／Connection terminal of resistor for detecting of output current
    Please connect the resistor of 0.1Ω～0.3Ω for current detection between this terminal and GND. In view of the power
    consumption of the current-detecting resistor, please determine the resistor in such a way that W=IOUT2･R[W] does not
    exceed the power dissipation of the resistor. In addition, please wire in such a way that it has a low impedance and does
    not have a impedance in common with other GND patterns because motor’s drive current flows in the pattern through RNF
    terminal～current-detecting resistor～GND. Please do not exceed the rating because there is the possibility of circuits’
    malfunction etc. if RNF voltage has exceeded the maximum rating (0.7V). Moreover, please be careful because if RNF
    terminal is shorted to GND, large current flows without normal PWM constant current control, then there is the danger that
    OCP or TSD will operate. If RNF terminal is open, then there is the possibility of such malfunction as output current does
    not flow either, so please do not let it open.
  ○RNF1S,RNF2S／Input terminal of current limit comparator
    In this series, RNFS terminal, which is the input terminal of current limit comparator, is independently arranged in order to
    decrease the lowering of current-detecting accuracy caused by the wire impedance inside the IC of RNF terminal.
    Therefore, please be sure to connect RNF terminal and RNFS terminal together when using in the case of PWM constant
    current control. In addition, because the wires from RNFS terminal is connected near the current-detecting resistor in the
    case of interconnection, the lowering of current-detecting accuracy, which is caused by the impedance of board pattern
    between RNF terminal and the current-detecting resistor, can be decreased. Moreover, please design the pattern in such a
    way that there is no noise plunging. In addition, please be careful because if terminals of RNF1S & RNF2S are shorted to
    GND, large current flows without normal PWM constant current control and, then there is the danger that OCP or TSD will
    operate.
  ○VREF／Output current value setting terminal
    This is the terminal to set the output current value. The output current value can be set by VREF voltage and
    current-detecting resistor (RNF resistor).
    Output current IOUT [A] = {VREF [V] / 5(division ratio inside IC)} / RNF [Ω] . . . (ALL step modes except Full Step B)
    Output current IOUT [A] = {VREF [V] / 5(division ratio inside IC)}＊0.7071 / RNF [Ω] . . . (Full Step B)
    Please avoid using it with VREF terminal open because if VREF terminal is open, the input is unsettled, and the VREF
    voltage increases, and then there is the possibility of such malfunctions as the setting current increases and a large current
    flows etc. Please keep to the input voltage range because if the voltage of over 3V is applied on VREF terminal, then there
    is also the danger that a large current flows in the output and so OCP or TSD will operate. Besides, please take into
    consideration the outflow current (max.2μA) if inputted by resistance division when selecting the resistance value. The
    minimum current, which can be controlled by VREF voltage, is determined by motor coil’s L & R values and minimum ON
    time because there is a minimum ON time in PWM drive.

  ○CR／Connection terminal of CR for setting chopping frequency
    This is the terminal to set the chopping frequency of output. Please connect the external C(470p～3300pF) and R(10k～
    200kΩ) between this terminal and GND. Please refer to P10.
    Please interconnect from external components to GND in such a way that the interconnection does not have impedance in
    common with other GND patterns. In addition, please carry out the pattern design in such ways as keeps such steep pulses
    as square wave etc. away and that there is no noise plunging. Please mount the two components of C and R if being used
    by PWM constant current control because normal PWM constant current control becomes impossible if CR terminal is open
    or it is biased externally.
  ○MTH／Current decay mode-setting terminal
    This is the terminal to set the current decay mode. Current decay mode can be optionally set according to input voltage.
       MTH terminal input voltage[V] Current decay mode
                     0~0.3                   SLOW DECAY
                    0.4~1.0                    MIX DECAY
                    1.5~3.5                   FAST DECAY
    Please connect to GND if using at SLOW DECAY mode.
    Please avoid using with MTH terminal open because if MTH terminal is open, the input is unsettled, and then there is the
    danger that PWM operation becomes unstable. Besides, please take into consideration the outflow current (max.2μA) if
    inputted by resistance division when selecting the resistance value.
  ○TEST／Terminal for inspection
    This terminal is used for delivery inspection on IC, and shall be grounded before use.
    In addition, malfunctions may be caused by application without grounding.
  ○NC terminal
     This terminal is unconnected electrically with IC internal circuit.

  ○Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
    This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit for thermal protection.
    When the IC’s chip temperature rises above 175℃(Typ) the motor output becomes OPEN. Also, when the temperature
    returns to under 150℃(Typ), it automatically returns to normal operation. However, even when TSD is in operation, if heat
    is continued to be added externally, heat overdrive can lead to destruction.
  ○Over Current Protection (OCP)
    This IC has a built in over current protection circuit as a provision against destruction when the motor outputs are shorted
    each other or VCC-motor output or motor output-GND is shorted. This circuit latches the motor output to OPEN condition
    when the regulated threshold current flows for 4μs (Typ). It returns with power reactivation or a reset of the PS terminal.
    The over current protection circuit’s only aim is to prevent the destruction of the IC from irregular situations such as motor
    output shorts, and is not meant to be used as protection or security for the set. Therefore, sets should not be designed to
    take into account this circuit’s functions. After OCP operating, if irregular situations continues and the return by power
    reactivation or a reset of the PS terminal is carried out repeatedly, then OCP operates repeatedly and the IC may generate
    heat or otherwise deteriorate. When the L value of the wiring is great due to the wiring being long, after the over current has
    flowed and the output terminal voltage jumps up and the absolute maximum values may be exceeded and as a result, there
    is a possibility of destruction. Also, when current which is over the output current rating and under the OCP detection
    current flows, the IC can heat up to over Tjmax=150℃ and can deteriorate, so current which exceeds the output rating
    should not be applied.
  ○Under Voltage Lock Out (UVLO)
    This IC has a built-in under voltage lock out function to prevent false operation such as IC output during power supply under
    voltage. When the applied voltage to the VCC terminal goes under 5V (Typ), the motor output is set to OPEN.
    This switching voltage has a 1V (Typ) hysteresis to prevent false operation by noise etc. Please be aware that this circuit
    does not operate during power save mode. Also, the electrical angle is reset when the UVLO circuit operates during CLK-IN
    drive mode.
  ○Over Voltage Lock Out (OVLO)
    This IC has a built-in over voltage lock out function to protect the IC output and the motor during power supply over voltage.
    When the applied voltage to the VCC terminal goes over 32V (Typ), the motor output is set to OPEN.
    This switching voltage has a 1V (Typ) hysteresis and a 4μs (Typ) mask time to prevent false operation by noise etc.
    Although this over voltage locked out circuit is built-in, there is a possibility of destruction if the absolute maximum value for
    power supply voltage is exceeded, therefore the absolute maximum value should not be exceeded. Please be aware that
    this circuit does not operate during power save mode.
  ○Ghost Supply Prevention (protects against malfunction when power supply is disconnected)
    If a signal (logic input, MTH, VREF) is input when there is no power supplied to this IC, there is a function which prevents
    the false operation by voltage supplied via the electrostatic destruction prevention diode from these input terminals to the
    VCC to this IC or to another IC’s power supply. Therefore, there is no malfunction of the circuit even when voltage is
    supplied to these input terminals while there is no power supply.

  ○PWM Constant current control
  1) Current control operation
    When the output transistor is turned on, the output current increases, raising the voltage over the current sense resistor.
    When the voltage on the RNF pin reaches the voltage value set by the internal 2-bit/4-bit DAC and the VREF input voltage,
    the current limit comparator engages and enters current decay mode. The output is then held off for a period of time
    determined by the RC time constant connected to the CR pin. The process repeats itself constantly for PWM operation.
  2) Noise-masking function
    In order to avoid misdetection of output current due to RNF spikes that may occur when the output turns ON, the IC
    employs an automatic current detection-masking period during charging of CR (tONMIN 0.7µs Typ) and during change in
    internal PHASE (tONMIN2 1.5µs Typ: fixed in internal circuit), during which current detection is disabled immediately after the
    output transistor is turned on. This allows for constant-current drive without the need for an external filter. This
    noise-masking period defines the minimum ON-time for the motor output transistor.
  3) CR Timer
    The CR filter connected to the CR pin is repeatedly charged and discharged between the VCRH and VCRL levels. The
    output of the internal comparator is masked while charging from VCRL to VCRH in order to cancel noise. (As mentioned
    above, this period defines the minimum ON-time of the motor output transistor.) The CR terminal begins discharging once
    the voltage reaches VCRH. When the output current reaches the current limit during this period (i.e. RNF voltage reaches
    the decay trigger voltage), then the IC enters decay mode. The CR continues to discharge during this period until it reaches
    VCRL, at which point the IC output is switched back ON. The current output and CR pin begin charging simultaneously.
    The CR charge time (tONMIN) and discharge time (tdischarge) are set by external components, according to the following
    formulas. The total of tONMIN and tdischarge yield the chopping period, tchop.

Attach a resistor of at least 10 kΩ to the CR terminal (10 kΩ~200 kΩ recommended) as lower values may keep the RC from
reaching the VCRH voltage level. A capacitor in the range of 470 pF – 3300 pF is also recommended. As the capacitance value
is increased, however, the noise-masking period (tonmin) also increases, and there is a risk that the output current may exceed
the current limit threshold due to the internal L and R components of the output motor coil. Also, ensure that the chopping period
(tchop) is not set longer than necessary, as doing so will increase the output ripple, thereby decreasing the average output
current and yielding lower output rotation efficiency. The optimal value should reduce the motor drive noise while keeping
distortion of the output current waveform to a minimum.

 The merits of each decay mode are as follows:
    ○SLOW DECAY
      During current attenuation, the voltage between motor coils is small and the regeneration current decreases slowly,
      decreasing the output current ripple. This is favorable for keeping motor torque high. However, due to fall-off of current
      control characteristics in the low-current region, or due to reverse EMF of the output motors exhibited when using
      high-pulse-rate half-step or quarter-step modes, the output current increases, distorting the output current waveform and
      increasing motor vibration. Thus, this decay mode is most suited to full-step modes, or low-pulse-rate half-step or
      quarter-step modes.
    ○FAST DECAY
      Fast decay decreases the regeneration current much more quickly than slow decay, greatly reducing distortion of the
      output current waveform. However, fast decay yields a much larger output current ripple, which decreases the overall
      average current running through the motor. This causes two problems: first, the motor torque decreases (increasing the
      current limit value can help eliminate this problem, but the rated output current must be taken into consideration); and
      second, the power loss within the motor increases and thereby radiates more heat. If neither of these problems is of
      concern, then fast decay can be used for high-pulse rate half- or quarter-step drive.
    Additionally, this IC allows for a mixed decay mode that can help improve upon problems that arise from using fast or slow
    decay alone. In this mode, the IC switches automatically between slow and fast decay, improving the current control
    characteristics without increasing the output current ripple. The ratio of fast to slow decay is set externally via the voltage
    input to the MTH pin; therefore, the optimal mix of slow and fast decay can be achieved for each application. Mixed decay
    mode operates by splitting the decay period into two sections, the first X%(t1-t2) of which operates the IC in slow decay
    mode, and the remainder(t2-t3) of which operates in fast decay mode. However, if the output current (i.e., the voltage on
    the RNF pin) does not reach the set current limit during the first X% (t1-t2) decay period, the IC operates in fast decay
    mode only.

Translator circuit
This series builds in translator circuit and can drive stepping motor in CLK-IN mode.
The operation of the translator circuit in CLK-IN drive mode is described as below.
○Reset operation
  The translator circuit is initialized by power ON Reset function and PS terminal.
     ・Initializing operation when power supply is turned on
       ①If power supply is turned on at PS=L (Please use this sequence as a general rule)
       When power supply is turned on, the power ON reset function operates in IC and initialized, but as long as it is PS=L,
       the motor output is the OPEN state. After power supply is turned on, because of the changing of PS=L⇒H, the motor
       output becomes the ACTIVE state, and the excitation is started at the initial electrical angle.
       But at the time of PS=L⇒H, it returns from the standby state to the normal state and there is a delay of 40µs(max.)
       until the motor output has become the ACTIVE state.
                           Reset is released              ACTIVE

       ②If power supply is turned on at PS=H
       When power supply is turned on, the power ON function in IC operates, and initialized before the motor output
       becomes the ACTIVE state, and the excitation is started at the initial electrical angle.
     ・Initializing operation during motor operating
       Please input the reset signal to PS terminal when the translator circuit is initialized during motor operating. (Refer to P.19)
       But at the time of PS=L⇒H, it returns from the standby state to the normal state and there is a delay of 40µs (max.) until
       the motor output has become the ACTIVE state, so please be careful.
○Control input timing
  Please input as shown below because the translator circuit operates at the rising edge of CLK signal. If you disobey this
  timing and input, then there is the possibility that the translator circuit does not operate as expected. In addition, at the time
  of PS=L⇒H, it returns from the standby state to the normal state and there is a delay of 40µs (max.) until the motor output
  has become the ACTIVE state, so within this delay interval there is no phase advance operation even if CLK is inputted.

・CW_CCW Switch timing chart (FULL STEP A, MODE0=L, MODE1=L, MODE2=L, ENABLE=H, SELECT1=L)
    The switch of CW_CCW is reflected by the rising edge of CLK that comes immediately after the changes of the CW_CCW
    signal. However, depending on the state of operation of the motor at the switch the motor cannot follow even if the control
    on driver IC side is correspondent and there are possibilities of step-out and mistake step in motor, so please evaluate the
    sequence of the switch enough.

    translator circuit stop and CLK input is canceled. Therefore, the progress of ENABLE=L→H is completed before the input of
    ENABLE=L. Excitation mode (MODE0, MODE1, MODE2) also switches within ENABLE=L interval. Where excitation mode
    switched within ENABLE=L interval, restoring of ENABLE=L→H was done in the excitation mode after switch.

・About the switch of the motor excitation mode
    The switch of the excitation mode can be done with regardless of the CLK signal at the same time as changing of the signal
    MODE0, MODE1, MODE2 and SELECT2. The following built-in function can prevent motor out-of-step caused by
    discrepancies of torque vector of transitional excitations during switch between excitation modes. However, due to
    operation state of motor during switch, motor may not act following control on IC side of controller, and thereby lead to
    out-of-step or miss step. Therefore, switch sequence shall be evaluated sufficiently before any decision.
・Cautions of bidirectional switch of CW_CCW and excitation modes (MODE0, MODE1, MODE2, SELECT2)
    As shown in the figure below, the area between the end of reset discharge (PS=L→H) and beginning of the first CLK signal
    input is defined as interval A, while the area post the end of the first CLK signal input is defined as interval B.
    Interval A
       => For CW_CCW, no limitation is applied on switch of excitation mode.
    Interval B
       => In CLK1 period, or within ENABLE=L interval, CW_CCW and excitation mode can’t be switched together.
         Violation of this restriction may lead to false step (with one extra leading phase) or out-of-step.
         Therefore, in case that CW_CCW and excitation modes are switched simultaneously, PS terminal must be input with
         reset signal. Then start to operate in interval A before carrying out such bidirectional switch.

BD63920MUV
Power dissipation
  Please confirm that the IC’s chip temperature Tj is not over 150℃, while considering the IC’s power consumption (W),
  Thermal Resistance(°C/W) and ambient temperature (Ta). When Tj=150℃ is exceeded the functions as a semiconductor do
  not operate and problems such as parasitism and leaks occur. Constant use under these circumstances leads to deterioration
  and eventually destruction of the IC. Tjmax=150℃ must be strictly obeyed under all circumstances.
Thermal Calculation
  The IC’s consumed power can be estimated roughly with the power supply voltage (VCC), circuit current (ICC), output ON
  resistance (RONH､RONL) and motor output current value (IOUT).
  The calculation method during FULL STEP drive, SLOW DECAY mode is shown here:
         Consumed power of the Vcc [W] = VCC [V]･ICC [A] ･･･････①
         Consumed power of the output DMOS [W] = (RONH[Ω] + RONL[Ω])･IOUT [A]2･2[ch]･on_duty
                                                                            During output ON
                                                                      + (2･RONL[Ω])･IOUT [A]2･2[ch]･(1 - on_duty) ･･･････②
                                                                            During current decay
         However, on duty: PWM on duty = ton / (tchop)
         ton varies depending on the L and R values of the motor coil and the current set value. Please confirm by actual
         measurement, or make an approximate calculation.
         tchop is the chopping period, which depends on the external CR. See P.8 for details.

               Junction temperature Tj = Ta[℃] + θja[℃/W]･W_total [W]
         However, the thermal resistance valueθja [℃/W] differs greatly depending on circuit board conditions. Refer to the
         derating curve on P.25.Also, we are taking measurements of thermal resistance valueθja of boards actually in use.
         Please feel free to contact our salesman. The calculated values above are only theoretical. For actual thermal design,
         please perform sufficient thermal evaluation for the application board used, and create the thermal design with enough
         margin to not exceed Tjmax=150℃.Although unnecessary with normal use, if the IC is to be used under especially
         strict heat conditions, please consider externally attaching a Schottky diode between the motor output terminal and
         GND to abate heat from the IC.
○Temperature Monitoring
  In respect of BD63920MUV, there is a way to directly measure the approximate chip temperature by using the TEST terminal
  with a protection diode for prevention from electrostatic discharge. However, temperature monitor using this TEST terminal is
  only for evaluation and experimenting, and must not be used in actual usage conditions.
  (1) Measure the terminal voltage when a current of Idiode=50μA flows from the TEST or MODEx terminal to the GND, without
  supplying VCC to the IC. This measurement is of the Vf voltage inside the diode.
  (2) Measure the temperature characteristics of this terminal voltage. (Vf has a linear negative temperature factor against
  the temperature.) With the results of these temperature characteristics, chip temperature may be calibrated from the
  TEST terminal voltage.
  (3) Supply VCC, confirm the TEST terminal voltage while running the motor, and the chip temperature can be
  approximated from the results of (2).
                                                                 -Vf[mV]

BD63920MUV
Operational Notes
       1. Reverse Connection of Power Supply
           Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
           connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
           supply pins.
       2. Power Supply Lines
           Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the
           digital and analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog
           block. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and
           aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic capacitors.
       3. Ground Voltage
           Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
       4. Ground Wiring Pattern
           When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
           connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
           ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
           on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
       5. Thermal Consideration
           Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
           deterioration of the properties of the chip. The absolute maximum rating of the Pd stated in this specification is when
           the IC is mounted on a 70mm x 70mm x 1.6mm glass epoxy board. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum
           rating, increase the board size and copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
       6. Recommended Operating Conditions
           These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately
           obtained. The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
       7. Inrush Current
           When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may
           flow instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
           supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring,
           and routing of connections.
       8. Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
            Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
       9. Testing on Application Boards
           When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
           subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
           should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
           process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
           transport and storage.
       10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
           Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
           damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
           Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment)
           and unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
       11. Unused Input Pins
           Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
           extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
           charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
           cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
           power supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
       12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
           This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
           isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
           parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
           Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
           interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
           operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should
           be avoided.
                                                  Figure 11. Example of monolithic IC structure
       13. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
           This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
           be within the IC’s power dissipation rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the junction
           temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF all output pins.When the Tj falls below
           the TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
           Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
           circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
           heat damage.
       14. Over Current Protection Circuit (OCP)
           This IC incorporates an integrated overcurrent protection circuit that is activated when the load is shorted. This
           protection circuit is effective in preventing damage due to sudden and unexpected incidents. However, the IC should
           not be used in applications characterized by continuous operation or transitioning of the protection circuit.
       15. Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field(BD63920MUV)
           The IC is not designed for using in the presence of strong electromagnetic field. Be sure to confirm that no
           malfunction is found when using the IC in a strong electromagnetic field.
       16. Metal on the backside (Define the side where product markings are printed as front) (BD63920MUV)
           The metal on the backside is shorted with the backside of IC chip therefore it should be connected to GND. Be aware
           that here is a possibility of malfunction or destruction if it is shorted with any potential other than GND.
       17. TEST Terminal(BD63920MUV)
           Be sure to connect TEST pin to GND.

                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
