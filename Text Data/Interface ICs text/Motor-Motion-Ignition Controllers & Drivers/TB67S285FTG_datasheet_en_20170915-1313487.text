Block diagram
Some of the functional blocks, circuits, or constants in the block diagram may be omitted or simplified for explanatory
purpose.
Note: All the grounding wires of the TB67S285FTG should run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated
      at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across output pins or
to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently damaged.
Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power supply pins
(VM, RSGND line, OUT line, and GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired incorrectly,
an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running
through the IC that is larger than the specified current. Careful attention should be paid to design patterns and mountings.

Note: DOUT outputs a signal at the CLOCK down-edge to keep the setup hold time with the COUT signal. Therefore, for
      example, when fixing the CLOCK signal to High before the serial data input, please configure it after inputting the
      CLOCK down edges. In this case, the number of the CLOCK down edges should be equal to that of the up edges,
      which are inputted during data transfer.

2. Internal signal (TRQ1, TRQ2, TRQ3, and TRQ4) function
Constant current PWM threshold can be adjusted by switching the TRQ configuration. The current ratio of the constant
current PWM threshold (IOUT) can be configured to 100 % by applying VREF voltage externally. Moreover, this current
ratio can be switched arbitrary by using TRQ function.

from OUT (+) to OUT (-) in charging. When the signal is set to Low, the current direction is from OUT (-) to OUT (+) in
charging.

ENABLEB become Low.

7. STANDBY function (low active)
Standby function is switched between on and off. When standby function is ON, all of the internal oscillator (OSCM) circuit
and output MOSFET are turned off. Error detect states can be also released by this standby function because the internal
logic circuits are initialized. When standby function is OFF, the operation is returned to the normal mode.
        STANDBY                                                           Function

8. LO1, LO2 (Error Output: error detect flag output) function
The LO1 and LO2 are signals that are flagged when the error status is detected. Both pins are open drain type, therefore to
use the function properly, the LO1 and LO2 pins should be pulled up to the VCC. (Set the pull-up resistor in the range of 10
kΩ to 100 kΩ.) During normal operation, the pin is high-impedance (Internal MOSFET is turned off and the pin voltage is
VCC). Once the error detect function (thermal shutdown (TSD), over current detection (ISD), or motor load open (OPD))
operates, the pins will output Low level (Internal MOSFET is turned ON) as follows.
Reasserting the VM power or using the standby mode to release the error detection status, the LO1 and LO2 pins will show
“normal operation” status again. If function of LO1 or LO2 is not used, leave the pins open.

9. OSCM (internal oscillator) function
OSCM is used to set the internal oscillator frequency for constant current PWM control. The values of the resistor and the
capacitor connected to this pin will set the OSCM frequency. Please connect the pull-up resistor to the VCC when PWM
frequency is set by the external components. Also, to use an internal ‘fixed value OSCM frequency’ (not using any external
components), disconnect the ROSC resistor and short the OSCM pin to the GND. Note that when using the internal ‘fixed
value OSCM frequency’, do not input any control signal for 20 μs (typ.) after power on or standby release. (It takes 20 μs to
judge the existence of the external components and switch to the ‘fixed value OSCM frequency’ mode.) The ‘fixed value
OSCM frequency’ will be around 0.92 MHz, so the fchop will be around 57 kHz.

                                                                      and short the COSC capacitor (short the
                                                                      OSCM pin to the GND).
Note: The equivalent circuit diagrams may be simplified or omitted for explanatory purposes.
Note: The oscillator frequency can be adjusted by controlling the values of resistor (ROSC) and capacitor (COSC). When
       conforming the frequency, it is recommended to fix the capacitor to 270 pF and change the ROSC value. For details,
       please refer to the following descriptions.
OSCM oscillator frequency (chopping frequency) calculation
OSCM oscillator frequency can be calculated by using the external component values (ROSC and COSC), and the formula
is shown below. (COSC is fixed to 270 pF.)
           fOSCM = 4.0 x ROSC(-0.8)
COSC and ROSC are external components to set the oscillator frequency. When adjusting the oscillator frequency with
components, it is recommended to fix COSC to 270 pF and change the constant number of ROSC.
Moreover, the relation between the chopping frequency for constant current PWM (fchop) and the OSCM oscillator
frequency (fOSCM) is as follows;
           fchop = fOSCM / 16
For normal operation, setting the frequency in the range of 50 kHz to 70 kHz and adjusting suitably as needed is
recommended
When the chopping frequency is set high, the current ripple will be smaller, which will lead to a higher reproducibility of a
waveform. However, the chopping frequency per unit time is increased and so the gate loss and the switching loss of the
integrated MOSFET will be larger, which will lead to an additional heat generation. On the other hand, when the chopping
frequency is set low, the current ripple will be larger but the heat generation is reduced. Please set the frequency according
to the usage conditions and environment.

10. Active Gain Control (Anti-stall) function
AGC0, AGC1 pins control the Active Gain Control to turn on or off. When both pins are set to High, the AGC is turned on.
The PWM current threshold will be reduced in a phased manner where the upper limited current is determined by VREF.
When both pins are set to Low, the AGC is turned off and the current, which is set by VREF, flows.
Note: Built-in digital filter of 0.625 μs (±20 %) is adopted to AGC0 and AGC1 pins.

Normally, set these pins as follows; AGC0, AGC1= (High, High) or (Low, Low). Please do not switch the AGC0 pin level
during operation.
Note 1: Use this configuration when switching ON or OFF of AGC during operation. As for concrete usage method, refer to
        the application note.
11. CLIM (AGC bottom current limit) function
The CLIM0 and CLIM1 pins set the bottom current limit of the AGC. When AGC is active, the PWM current threshold will be
reduced in a phased manner. By using the CLIM function, the motor current will not go below the bottom limit. The CLIM0 is
a 2 stated logic input, and the CLIM1 is a 4 stated logic input.
Note: Built-in digital filter of 0.625 μs (±20 %) is adopted to CLIM0 and CLIM1 pins.

Note: Resistance accuracy should be within ±20 %.
12. BOOST (current boost) function
The BOOST pin sets the current boost level when the load torque is increased. When AGC is turned on, the PWM current
threshold will be reduced in a phased manner. However, once the load torque is increased, the device will then boost the
PWM current threshold to prevent the motor from stalling. The BOOST pin is a 4 stated logic input pin.
Note: Built-in digital filter of 0.625 μs (±20 %) is adopted to BOOST pin.

13. FLIM (AGC Frequency limit) function
The FLIM pin sets the bottom frequency limit for the AGC to be active. It can reduce the resonance frequency of the motor

Timing charts may be simplified for explanatory purpose.
The basic constant current PWM sequence is a loop of Charge→Fast Decay→Slow Decay→Charge→・・・ to keep the peak
current below the threshold. The chopping frequency (fchop) is a period of 16 counts per cycle of OSCM oscillator
frequency (fOSCM). The sequence of Charge, Fast Decay, and Slow Decay is switched within this fchop cycle.
First, the motor current is charged (Charge sequence) until it reaches the constant current threshold (NFth), which is set by
the VREF reference voltage. Once the motor current reaches the constant current threshold (NFth), a partial motor current
recirculates back to the power supply (Fast Decay sequence). When the motor current reaches the fixed value (ADMDth)
during recirculation; for the rest of the fchop cycle, the motor is controlled to naturally discharge and hold the motor current
as much as possible (Slow Decay sequence).

Constant current threshold calculation
The constant current PWM threshold can be set by applying voltage to the VREF pin and adjusting TRQ function.
IOUT=VREF × 0.833 × TRQ setting
Example: When Current ratio is 100 %, VREF voltage is 2.0 V, and TRQ setting is 100%, the constant current PWM
threshold is calculated from following formula.
IOUT = 2.0 × 0.833 × 1 = 1.67 A

Tj: Junction temperature while the IC is active. Tj (max) is limited by the thermal shutdown (TSD) threshold.
    Please set the usage conditions so that the peak Tj is kept under 120°C for indication.
Caution) Absolute maximum ratings
The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or
deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion. The value of even one parameter of the absolute
maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any circumstances. All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must
always be followed. Other notes and considerations described in the datasheet should also be referred to.

Note 1: Thermal shutdown (TSD)
When the IC detects an over temperature, the internal circuit turns off the output MOSFETs. It has a dead band time to
avoid TSD misdetection, which may be triggered by external noise. Reassert the VM power supply or use the standby mode
by STANDBY pin to release this function. The TSD is triggered when the device is over heated irregularly. Make sure not to
use the TSD function aggressively.
Note 2: Over current detection (ISD)
When the IC detects an over current, the internal circuits turns off the output MOSFETs. It has a dead band time to avoid
ISD misdetection, which may be triggered by external noise. Reassert the VM power supply or use the standby mode by
STANDBY pin to release this function. The ISD is triggered when the motor current is over rated irregularly. Make sure not
to use the ISD function aggressively.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor current
recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above
the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must be
fully verified that there is no risk that the TB67S285FTG or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor
back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an output
short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device may be
damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a condition persists
for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed immediately by
external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
[1] The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
     moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
      Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result injury by explosion
      or combustion.
[2] Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in case of over current
     and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed its absolute maximum ratings,
     when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large
     current to continuously flow and the breakdown can lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large
     current in case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are
     required.
[3] If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the design to prevent
     device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush current at power ON or the negative
     current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
      Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection
      function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
[4] Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
      Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
      Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and exceeding the rating(s)
      may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result injury by explosion or combustion.
      In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation or incorrectly even
      just one time.
[5] Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load components (such as
     speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
     If there is a large amount of leakage current such as input or negative feedback condenser, the IC output DC voltage
     will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure
     can cause smoke or ignition. (The over current can cause smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay
     attention when using a Bridge Tied Load (BTL) connection type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.
                                                               25                                                2017-09-15


                                                                                                      TB67S285FTG
Points to remember on handling of ICs
(1) Over current Protection Circuit
      Over current protection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
      circumstances. If the over current protection circuits operate against the over current, clear the over current status
      immediately.
      Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can cause the
      over current protection circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation. In addition, depending on the
      method of use and usage conditions, if over current continues to flow for a long time after operation, the IC may
      generate heat resulting in breakdown.
(2) Thermal Shutdown Circuit
      Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
      operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
      Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can cause the
      thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
(3) Heat Radiation Design
     In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device so that heat is
     appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time and condition. These ICs
     generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life,
     deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, please design the device taking into considerate the
     effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
(4) Back-EMF
      When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the motor’s power
      supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor
      power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem,
      take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
                                                               26                                              2017-09-15
