            Input mode in the case of CLK-IN drive (SELECT=L)
            CLK/Clock Input Terminal for Advancing Electrical Angle
            The electrical angle advances by one for each CLK input and only reflected at CLK’s rising edge.
            Motor misstep will occur if noise is picked up at the CLK terminal, so please design the pattern in such a way that
            there is no noise being introduced.

            Please refer to the P.13, 14 for the timing chart & motor torque vector of various excitation modes.
            Unrelated to CLK, change in setting is reflected instantly (refer to P.16).
            CW_Terminal/Motor Rotating Direction Setting
            Set the motor’s rotating direction. Change in setting is reflected at the CLK rising edge immediately after the
            change in setting (refer to P.15)
                   CW                                                    Rotating direction

            Turns ON or OFF all output transistors (motor output is open).
            When ENABLE=L, input to CLK is blocked, and phase advance operation of internal translator circuit is stopped.
            However, during excitation mode (MODE0, MODE1) switch when ENABLE=L, setting ENABLE=L→H resets the
            IC and the new excitation mode will be applied (See P.16).

            PS/Power Save Terminal
            Setting PS=L will cause the circuit to enter standby state and make motor output OPEN. In standby state,
            translator circuit, and electrical angle are initialized.
            Please take note that there is a delay of 40µs (max) before returning from standby state to normal state then the
            motor output becomes ACTIVE (refer to P.12).

             VCC1,VCC2/Power Supply Terminal
             Since the motor’s drive current is passing through it, please wire the power supply in such a way that the wire is
             thick and short, and has low impedance.
             VCC voltage may suffer from great fluctuation, so it is necessary to connect a bypass capacitor of about 100µF to
             470µF as close to the terminal as possible and adjust in such a way that the VCC voltage is stable. Please
             increase the capacitance if needed especially when a large current is required or those motors that have great
             back electromotive force are used.
             In addition, for the purpose of reducing the power supply’s impedance in wide frequency bandwidth, parallel
             connection of multi-layered ceramic capacitor of 0.01µF to 0.1µF is recommended. Extreme care must be
             observed to make sure that the VCC voltage does not exceed the voltage rating even for a moment.
             VCC1 & VCC2 are shorted internally, so please be sure to short VCC1 & VCC2 externally when operating. It might
             cause malfunction or destruction if not shorted externally because of the concentration of current in a certain route.
             Moreover, in the power supply terminal, there is built-in clamp component for preventing an electrostatic
             destruction. If a steep pulse or surge voltage of more than that of maximum absolute rating is present, this clamp
             component operates and as a result there is the danger of destruction, so please be sure that the maximum
             absolute rating is not to be exceeded. It is effective to mount a Zener diode of about the maximum absolute rating.
             In addition, the diode for preventing an electrostatic destruction is inserted between VCC terminal and GND
             terminal, as a result there is the danger of IC destruction if a voltage of reverse polarity is applied between VCC
             terminal and GND terminal, so please be careful.
             GND/Ground Terminal
             In order to reduce the noise caused by switching current, and to stabilize the internal reference voltage of IC,
             please wire in such a way that the wiring impedance from this terminal is made as low as possible to achieve the
             lowest electrical potential no matter what operating state it may be. Moreover, please design patterns not to have
             any common impedance with other GND patterns.

            OUT1A,OUT1B,OUT2A,OUT2B/H Bridge Output Terminal
            Since the motor’s drive current is passing through it, please wire in such a way that the wire is thick and short, and
            has low impedance. It is also effective to add a Schottky diode if the output has a big positive or negative
            fluctuation when large current is present (i.e. counter electromotive voltage is big). Moreover, in the output terminal,
            there is a built-in clamp component for preventing an electrostatic destruction. If a steep pulse or surge voltage of
            more than that of maximum absolute rating is present, this clamp component operates and as a result there is the
            danger of destruction, so please be sure that the maximum absolute rating is not to be exceeded.
            RNF1,RNF2/Connecting terminal of Resistor for Detecting of Output Current
            Please connect a resistor of 0.1Ω to 0.3Ω for current detection between this terminal and GND. In view of the
            power consumption of the current-detecting resistor, please determine the resistor in such a way that W=IOUT ･R
                                                                                                                               2
            [W] does not exceed the power dissipation of the resistor. In addition, please wire in such a way that it has low
            impedance and does not have impedance common with other GND patterns because motor’s drive current passes
            through RNF terminal to current-detecting resistor to GND. Do not exceed the rating because there is the
            possibility of circuit malfunction (i.e. RNF voltage exceeded the maximum rating of 0.7V). Moreover, please be
            careful because if RNF terminal is shorted to GND, large current flows without normal PWM constant current
            control, then there is the possibility that OCP or TSD will operate. If RNF terminal is open, then there is the danger
            of malfunction as output current does not flow either, so please do not leave open.
            RNF1S,RNF2S/Input Terminal of Current Limit Comparator
            In this series, RNFS terminal, which is the input terminal of current limit comparator, is independently arranged in
            order to decrease the error of current-detecting accuracy caused by the internal wire impedance of RNF terminal.
            Therefore, connect RNF terminal and RNFS terminal together when using PWM constant current control. In
            addition, because the wires from RNFS terminal is connected near the current-detecting resistor in the case of
            interconnection, the lowering of current-detecting accuracy that is caused by the impedance of board pattern
            between RNF terminal and the current-detecting resistor can be decreased. Moreover, design the pattern in such
            a way that there is no noise being introduced. In addition, please be careful when terminals of RNF1S & RNF2S
            are shorted to GND, large current flows without normal PWM constant current control, then there is the possibility
            that OCP or TSD will operate.
            VREF/Output Current Value Setting Terminal
            This is the terminal to set the output current value. The output current value can be set by VREF voltage and
            current-detecting resistor (RNF resistor).
             Output current IOUT [A ] = {VREF [V ] / 5(division ratio inside IC)}/ RNF [Ω]
            Please avoid IC operation with VREF terminal open because if VREF terminal is open, the input is unsettled, and
            the VREF voltage increases, and then there is the possibility of malfunctions such as the setting current increases,
            then a large current flows. Please do not exceed 3V because if it exceeds 3V, then there is also the danger that a
            large current flows in the output and so OCP or TSD will operate. Moreover, please take into consideration the
            outflow current of 2µA (Max) if configuring by voltage division when selecting the resistance value. The minimum
            current, which can be controlled by VREF voltage, is determined by motor coil’s L & R values and minimum ON
            time since there is a minimum ON time in PWM drive.
            CR/Connecting terminal of CR for Setting Chopping Frequency
            This is the terminal to set the chopping frequency of output. Please connect the external C (470p to 1500pF) and
            R (10k to 200kΩ) between this terminal and GND. Please refer to P11. Please interconnect from external
            components to GND in such a way that the interconnection does not have impedance in common with other GND
            patterns. In addition, please design the pattern in such a way that it keeps steep pulses such as square wave
            away and that there is no noise being introduced. Please mount the two components C and R if operating by PWM
            constant current control because normal PWM constant current control becomes impossible if CR terminal is open
            or is biased externally.
            MTH/Current Decay Mode-setting Terminal
            This is the terminal to set the current decay mode. Current decay mode can be optionally set according to input
            voltage.
               MTH terminal input voltage[V] Current decay mode
                             0 to 0.3                     SLOW DECAY
                            0.4 to 1.0                     MIX DECAY
                            1.5 to 3.5                    FAST DECAY
            Please connect to GND if utilizing SLOW DECAY mode.
            Please avoid IC operation with MTH terminal open because if MTH terminal is open, the input is unsettled, and
            then there is the danger that PWM operation becomes unstable. Moreover, please take into consideration the
            outflow current of 2µA (Max) if configuring by voltage division when selecting the resistance value.
            NC Terminal
            This terminal is unconnected electrically with IC internal circuit.

            Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
            This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit for thermal protection. When the IC’s chip temperature rises above
            175°C (Typ), the motor output becomes OPEN. Also, when the temperature decreases less than 150°C (Typ), it
            automatically returns to normal operation. However, even when TSD is in operation and heat is continuously
            added externally, heat overdrive can lead to destruction.
            Over-Current Protection (OCP)
            This IC has a built in over-current protection circuit as a provision against destruction when the motor outputs are
            shorted to each other, or VCC-motor output or motor output-GND is shorted. This circuit latches the motor output
            to OPEN condition when the regulated threshold current flows for 4µs (Typ). It resumes normal operation by
            re-applying main power supply or a reset of the PS terminal. The over-current protection circuit only aims to
            prevent the destruction of the IC from irregular situations such as motor output shorts, and is not meant to be used
            as protection or security for the set. Therefore, sets should not be designed to take into account this circuit’s
            function. After OCP operation, if irregular situations continue and the resume on normal operation by power
            reactivation or a reset of the PS terminal is carried out repeatedly, then OCP operates repeatedly and the IC may
            generate heat or otherwise deteriorate. When the L value of the wiring is great due to the wiring being long, after
            the over-current has flowed and the output terminal voltage jumps up, the absolute maximum values may be
            exceeded and as a result, there is a possibility of destruction. Also, when current is over the output current rating
            and under the OCP detection current, the IC can heat up to over Tjmax=150°C and can deteriorate, so current
            which exceeds the output rating should not be applied.
            Under Voltage Lock Out (UVLO)
            This IC has a built-in under voltage lock out function to prevent false operation such as IC output during power
            supply under voltage. When the applied voltage to the VCC terminal goes under 15V (Typ), the motor output is set
            to OPEN. This protection circuit has a 1V (Typ) hysteresis to prevent false operation cause by noise. Please be
            aware that this circuit does not operate during power save mode. Also, the electrical angle is reset when the UVLO
            circuit operates during CLK-IN drive mode.
            Over Voltage Lock Out (OVLO)
            This IC has a built-in over voltage lock out function to protect the IC output and the motor during power supply
            over voltage. When the applied voltage to the VCC terminal goes over 32V (Typ), the motor output is set to OPEN.
            This protection circuit has a 1V (Typ) hysteresis and a 4µs (Typ) mask time to prevent false operation cause by
            noise. Although this over voltage locked out circuit is built-in, there is a possibility of destruction if the absolute
            maximum value for power supply voltage is exceeded. Please be aware that this circuit does not operate during
            power save mode.
            Ghost Supply Prevention (protects against malfunction when power supply is disconnected)
            If a signal from logic input (e.g. MTH, VREF) is supplied when there is no power supplied to this IC, there is a
            function which prevents the false operation via the electrostatic discharge protection diode from these input
            terminals to VCC or to another IC’s power supply.

PWM Constant Current Control
 Current Control Operation
   When the output transistor is turned ON, the output current increases, and as a result increases the voltage at the current
  sense resistor. Once the voltage at the RNF pin reaches the voltage value set by the internal 2-bit DAC, and the VREF
   input voltage, the current limit comparator engages and enters current decay mode. The output is then turned OFF for a
   period of time determined by the RC time constant connected to the CR pin. The process repeats itself constantly for PWM
   operation.
Noise-masking Function
    In order to avoid misdetection of output current due to RNF spikes that may occur when the output turns ON, the IC
    employs an automatic current detection-masking period (tONMIN), during which current detection is disabled immediately
    after the output transistor is turned ON. This allows for constant-current drive without the need for an external filter. This
    noise-masking period defines the minimum ON-time for the motor output transistor.
CR Timer
   The CR filter connected to the CR pin is repeatedly charged and discharged between the VCRH and VCRL levels. The
   output of the internal comparator is masked while charging from VCRL to VCRH in order to cancel noise. As mentioned
   above, this operation defines the minimum ON-time of the motor output transistor. The CR terminal begins discharging
   once the voltage reaches VCRH. When the output current reaches the current limit during this period (i.e. RNF voltage
   reaches the decay trigger voltage), then the IC enters decay mode. The CR continues to discharge during this period until it
   reaches VCRL; at this point the IC output is switched back ON. The current output, and CR pin begin charging
   simultaneously.
   The CR charge time (tONmin) and discharge time (tdischarge) are set by external components, according to the following
   formulas. The sum of tONMIN and tdischarge yields the chopping period, tchop.

              Attach a resistor of at least 10kΩ to the CR terminal (10kΩ to 200kΩ is recommended) as lower values may keep
              the RC from reaching the VCRH voltage level. A capacitor in the range of 470pF to 1500pF is recommended. As
              the capacitance is increased, the noise-masking period (tONMIN) also increases, and there is a risk that the output
              current may exceed the current limit threshold due to the internal L and R components of the output motor coil.
              Also, ensure that the chopping period (tCHOP) is not set longer than necessary doing so will increase the output
              ripple, in effect decreasing the average output current, and yielding lower output rotation efficiency. The optimal
              value should reduce the motor drive noise while keeping distortion of the output current waveform to a minimum.

Current Decay Mode
            The IC allows for a mixed decay mode in which the ratio of fast and slow decay can be optionally set.
            The following diagrams show the operating state of each transistor and the regenerative current path during
            attenuation for each decay mode:

                                    Figure 5. Route of Regenerated Current during Current Decay
            The merits of each decay mode are as follows:
                 SLOW DECAY
                 During current attenuation, the voltage between motor coils is small and the regeneration current decreases
                 slowly decreasing the output current ripple. This is favorable for keeping motor torque high. However, due to
                 fall-off of current control characteristics in the low-current region, or reverse EMF of the output motors
                 exhibited when using high-pulse-rate half-step or quarter-step modes, the output current increases, distorting
                 the output current waveform, and increasing motor vibration. Thus, this decay mode is most suited to full-step
                 modes, or low-pulse-rate half-step or quarter-step modes.
                 FAST DECAY
                 Fast decay decreases the regeneration current more quickly than slow decay, greatly reducing distortion of
                 the output current waveform. However, fast decay yields a larger output current ripple, in effect decreases the
                 overall average current running through the motor. This creates two problems: first, the motor torque
                 decreases. Increasing the current limit value can help eliminate this problem, but the rated output current must
                 be taken into consideration; second, the power loss within the motor increases and thereby produces more
                 heat. If neither of these problems is of concern, then fast decay can be used for high-pulse rate half- or
                 quarter-step drive.
                 Additionally, this IC allows for a mixed decay mode that can help improve problems that arise from using fast
                 or slow decay mode. In this mode, the IC switches automatically between slow and fast decay, improving the
                 current control characteristics without increasing the output current ripple. Mixed decay mode operates by
                 splitting the decay period into two sections, the first X% (t1-t2) operates the IC in slow decay mode, and the
                 remainder (t2-t3) operates in fast decay mode. However, if the output current (i.e. the voltage on the RNF pin)
                 does not reach the set current limit during the first X% (t1-t2) decay period, the IC operates in fast decay mode
                 only.

        Translator Circuit
        This IC has a built-in translator circuit that can drive stepper motor in CLK-IN mode.
        The operation of the translator circuit in CLK-IN mode is described below.
            Reset Operation
            The translator circuit is initialized by power ON, Reset function, or PS terminal.
                 Initializing Operation when Power Supply is Turned ON
                 ① If power supply is turned ON at PS=L (Please use this sequence as a general rule)
                      When power supply is turned ON, the power ON reset function operates and initialized, but as long as it is
                      PS=L, the motor output is in OPEN state. After power supply is turned ON and changing of PS=L→H, the
                      motor output becomes ACTIVE, and the excitation is started at the initial electrical angle. At the time of
                      PS=L→H, there is a delay of 40µs (max) until the motor output becomes ACTIVE.
                                       Reset is released        ACTIVE
                                                     Delay                         ①                                 ②
                       PS

                 OUT1B
                                           Motor output OPEN                                   Motor output ON
                 ② If power supply is turned ON at PS=H
                      When power supply is turned ON, the power ON function in IC operates, and initialized before the motor
                      output becomes ACTIVE, and the excitation is started at the initial electrical angle.
                 Initializing Operation during Motor Operation
                 Please input the reset signal to PS terminal when the translator circuit is initialized during motor operation.
                 (Refer to P.15) But at the time of PS=L→H, there is a delay of 40µs (max) until the motor output becomes
                 ACTIVE, so please be careful.
            Control Input Timing
            Please input signals as shown below since the translator circuit operates at the rising edge of a CLK signal. If the
            timing is not followed, then there is the possibility that the translator circuit will not operate as expected. In addition,
            at the time of PS=L→H, there is a delay of 40µs (Max) until the motor output becomes ACTIVE, so within this
            delay interval there is no phase advance operation even if CLK is inputted.

                 CW Switch Timing Chart (FULL STEP, MODE0=L, MODE1=L, ENABLE=H)
                 The switching of CW is reflected at the rising edge of the CLK. However, depending on the state of the motor
                 output at the switch, the motor cannot follow even if the control on driver side corresponds and there are
                 possibilities of step-out or misstep in motor. So please consider the sequence of the switch sufficiently.

                 ENABLE Switch Timing Chart (FULL STEP, MODE0=L, MODE1=L, ENABLE=H)
                 The switching of ENABLE signal is reflected regardless of other input signals.
                 When ENABLE=L, the motor output becomes OPEN and the electrical angle won’t advance because the
                 translator circuit stops, and CLK input is cancelled. Therefore, the previous state will resume after
                 ENABLE=L→H. Excitation mode (MODE0, MODE1) can be switched within ENABLE=L interval. When
                 excitation mode is switched within ENABLE=L interval, restoring of the excitation mode is done after
                 ENABLE=L→H.
                                                                        Output off & Translator stop

                 Switching of Motor Excitation Mode
                 The switching of the excitation mode can be done regardless of the CLK signal at the same time as changing
                 of the signal MODE0 and MODE1. The following built-in function can prevent motor out-of-step caused by
                 discrepancies of torque vector of transitional excitations during switch between excitation modes. However,
                 due to operation state of motor during switch, motor may not act following control on IC side of controller, and
                 thereby lead to out-of-step or miss step. Therefore, switch sequence shall be evaluated sufficiently before any
                 decision.
                 Cautions of Bidirectional Switch of CW and Excitation Modes (MODE0,MODE1)
                 As shown in the Figure below, the area between the end of reset discharge (PS=L→H) and beginning of the
                 first CLK signal input is defined as interval A, while the area post the end of the first CLK signal input is
                 defined as interval B.
                 Interval A
                          => For CW, no limitation is applied on switch of excitation mode.
                 Interval B
                          => In CLK1 period, or within ENABLE=L interval, CW and excitation mode can’t be switched together.
                 Violation of this restriction may lead to false step (with one extra leading phase) or out-of-step.
                 Therefore, in case that CW and excitation modes are switched simultaneously, PS terminal must be input with
                 reset signal. Then start to operate in interval A before carrying out such bidirectional switch.
                                         interval A                             interval B

         Power Dissipation
         Please ensure that the IC’s chip temperature Tj is not over 150°C, while considering the IC’s power consumption (W),
         package power dissipation (Pd), and ambient temperature (Ta). When Tj=150°C is exceeded the functions of the
         semiconductor do not operate as expected, and problems such as parasitism and leaks occur. Constant use under
         these circumstances leads to deterioration and eventually destruction of the IC. Tjmax≤150°C must be strictly obeyed
         under all circumstances.
              Thermal Consideration
              The IC’s power consumption can be estimated roughly with power supply voltage (VCC), circuit current (ICC), output
              ON-Resistance (RONH, RONL), and motor output current value (IOUT).
              The calculation method during FULL STEP drive, SLOW DECAY mode is shown below:

              When ON duty:         PWM on duty = t ON / (t CHOP )
              tON varies depending on the L and R values of the motor coil and the current set value. Please confirm by actual
              measurement, or make an approximate calculation.
              tCHOP is the chopping period, which depends on the external CR. See P.10 for details.

              However, the thermal resistance value θja [°C/W] differs greatly depending on circuit board conditions. Refer to
              the derating curve on P.21. Also, we are taking measurements of thermal resistance value θja of actual boards in
              use. Please feel free to contact our sales department. The calculated values above are only theoretical. For actual
              thermal design, please perform sufficient thermal evaluation for the application board used, and create the thermal
              design with enough margin to not exceed Tjmax=150°C. Although unnecessary with normal use, if the IC is to be
              used under strict heat conditions, please consider inserting an external Schottky diode between the motor output
              terminal and GND to abate heat from the IC.
              Temperature Monitoring
              In case of CLK-IN drive, there is a way to approximately measure the chip temperature by using the electrostatic
              discharge protection diode of TEST pin. For PARALLEL-IN drive, the logic terminal (I0x or I1x) can be used when
              at L state. Temperature monitoring using this method is only for evaluation and experimenting purposes, and must
              not be used in actual usage conditions.
              •    Measure the terminal voltage when a current of IDIODE=50µA passes from the TEST or I0x or I1x terminal to
                   the GND without supplying VCC to the IC. This measurement is the Vf voltage of the internal diode.
              •    Measure the temperature characteristics of this terminal voltage. Vf has a linear negative temperature factor
                   against temperature. With these results of temperature characteristics, chip temperature may be calibrated
                   from the TEST or I0x or I1x terminal voltage.
              •    Supply VCC, monitor the TEST or I0x or I1x terminal voltage while running the motor, and the chip
                   temperature can be approximated from the results of (2).

Operational Notes
    1.  Reverse Connection of Power Supply
        Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
        connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power supply
        terminals.
    2.  Power Supply Lines
        Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the
        digital and analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog
        block. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and
        aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic capacitors.
    3.  Ground Voltage
        Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
    4.  Ground Wiring Pattern
        When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
        connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
        ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
        on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
    5.  Thermal Consideration
        Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded, the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
        deterioration of the properties of the chip. The absolute maximum rating of the Pd stated in this specification is when
        the IC is mounted on a 70mm x 70mm x 1.6mm glass epoxy board. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating,
        increase the board size and copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
    6.  Recommended Operating Conditions
        These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained.
        The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
    7.  Inrush Current
        When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
        instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power supply.
        Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and routing
        of connections.
    8.  Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
        Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
    9.  Testing on Application Boards
        When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may subject
        the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply should
        always be turned OFF completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection process.
        To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during transport
        and storage.
    10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
        Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
        damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
        Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
        unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
    11. Unused Input Terminals
        Input terminals of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance
        and extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
        charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
        cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input terminals should be connected to
        the power supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
    12. Regarding Input Pins of the IC
        This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
        isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
        parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
                     When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
                     When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
        Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
        interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
        operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be
        avoided.
                                               Figure 10. Example of Monolithic IC Structure
    13. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
        Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe
        Operation (ASO).
    14. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
        This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always be
        within the IC’s power dissipation rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the junction
        temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF all output pins. When the Tj falls below the
        TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
        Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
        circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from heat
        damage.
    15. Over-Current Protection Circuit (OCP)
        This IC has a built-in overcurrent protection circuit that activates when the output is accidentally shorted. However, it is
        strongly advised not to subject the IC to prolonged shorting of the output.

Power Dissipation
                               HTSSOP-B54 is designed with heat-remission metal on the backside of IC to perform heat dissipation treatment using
                               through hole from backside. It is possible to increase power dissipation considerably by ensuring sufficient heat-releasing
                               area on both top and back sides such as copper foil. Please note that the power dissipation described below may not be
                               assured without being shorted. The back metal is shorted with the backside of the IC chip that is a GND potential. There is
                               a possibility for malfunction if it is shorted with any potential other than GND, which should be avoided. The back metal
                               should be soldered onto the GND to short. Please be careful that this package is designed to be used after performing heat
                               dissipation treatment on the back metal, and to improve heat dissipation efficiency.

                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
