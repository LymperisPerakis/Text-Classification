Description of Blocks
  1.    Power-Saving Function
            A power-saving function is included, which allows the system to save power when not driving the motor. The voltage
            level on this pin should be set high so as to keep the operation mode. (See the Electrical Characteristics; p.4/14)
  2.    Motor Control Input
             (a) IN1A, IN1B, IN2A and IN2B pin
                 Logic level controls the output logic of H-Bridge.
                 (See the Electrical Characteristics; p.4/14, and I/O Truth Table; p.7/14)
             (b) SEL pin
                 Logic level sets the IN/IN or EN/IN drive mode.
                 (See the Electrical Characteristics; p.4/14 and I/O Truth Table; p.7/14)
  3.    Photo-Interrupter Regulator
            The BIAS pin can output VCC voltage for photo-interrupter during the operation mode.
            When connecting photo-interrupter to this pin, pay attention to the ON resistance of internal power transistor.

     (Note 2) Must not exceed Pd, ASO, or Tjmax of 150°C
     Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
     between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is operated over
     the absolute maximum ratings.

The Wave-Shaping Circuit Convert
       The wave-shaping circuit converts the distorted output signal of the photo-interrupter into rectangular wave. The
       hysteresis function prevents chatter of the output signal by the noise included in the input signal. This function enables to
       output the rectangular signal.

Operational Notes
     1.   Reverse Connection of Power Supply
          Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
          connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
          supply pins.
     2.   Power Supply Lines
          Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the
          digital and analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog
          block. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and
          aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic capacitors.
     3.   Ground Voltage
          Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
     4.   Ground Wiring Pattern
          When using both small-signal(GND) and large-current ground(PGND) traces, the two ground traces should be routed
          separately but connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the
          small-signal ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause
          variations on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
     5.   Thermal Consideration
          Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
          deterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size
          and copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
     6.   Recommended Operating Conditions
          These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained.
          The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
     7.   Inrush Current
          When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
          instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
          supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and
          routing of connections.
     8.   Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
          Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
     9.   Testing on Application Boards
          When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
          subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
          should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
          process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
          transport and storage.
     10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
          Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
          damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
          Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
          unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
     11. Unused Input Pins
          Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
          extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small charge
          acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and cause
          unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the power
          supply or ground line.

     12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
          This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
          isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
          parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
          When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
          When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
          Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
          interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
          operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be
          avoided.

     13. Ceramic Capacitor
          When using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with
          temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
     14. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
          Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe
          Operation (ASO).
     15. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
          This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
          be within the IC’s power dissipation rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the junction
          temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF all output pins. When the Tj falls below
          the TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
          Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
          circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
          heat damage.
     16. Disturbance light
          In a device where a portion of silicon is exposed to light such as in a WL-CSP, IC characteristics may be affected due
          to photoelectric effect. For this reason, it is recommended to come up with countermeasures that will prevent the chip
          from being exposed to light.

              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
