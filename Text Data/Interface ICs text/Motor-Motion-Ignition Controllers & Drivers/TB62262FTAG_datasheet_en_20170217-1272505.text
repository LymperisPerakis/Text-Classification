Notes
  All the grounding wires of the TB62262FTAG must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally
  terminated at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
  Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across
  output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently
  damaged.
  Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power
  supply pins (VM, RS, OUT, GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired
  incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
  The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current
  running through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

  Function explanation (Stepping motor)
1. CLK Function
Each up-edge of the CLK signal will shift the motor’s electrical angle per step.
         CLK Input                                                            Function
         Up-edge            Shifts the electrical angle per step.
        Down-edge           (State of the electrical angle does not change.)
2. ENABLE function
The ENABLE pin controls the ON and OFF of the corresponding output stage. This pin serves to select if the motor
is stopped in Off (High impedance) mode or activated. Please set the ENABLE pin to ‘L’ during VM power-on and
power-off sequence.
       ENABLE Input                                                           Function
              H               Output stage=‘ON’ (Normal operation mode)
              L               Output stage=’OFF’ (High impedance mode)
3. CW/CCW function and the output pin function (Output logic at the time of a charge start)
The CW/CCW pin controls the rotation direction of the motor. When set to ‘Clockwise’, the current of OUTA is output
first, with a phase difference of 90°. When set to ‘Counter clockwise”, the current of OUTB is output first with a
phase difference of 90°.
                CW/CCW Input                                       OUT (+)                          OUT (-)
         H : Clockwise operation(CW)                                  H                               L
    L : Counter clockwise operation(CCW)                              L                               H

            L                 L
                                        set to ‘OFF’ status)
            L                H          Full step resolution
           H                  L         Half step resolution
           H                 H          Quarter step resolution
When switching the DMODE1, 2; setting the RESET signal to Low (will set the electrical angle to the initial status),
is recommended.

For PWM constant-current control, this IC uses a clock generated by the OSCM oscillator.
The peak output current (Setting current value) can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RS) and the reference
voltage (Vref), as follows:
                                         Vref(V)
           IOUT(max) = Vref(gain) ×
                                         RRS(Ω)
            Vref(gain) : the Vref decay rate is 1/ 5.0 (typ.)
For example: In the case of a 100% setup
when Vref = 3.0 V, Torque = 100%, RS = 0.51 Ω, the motor constant current (Setting current value) will be
calculated as:
           IOUT = 3.0V / 5.0 / 0.51Ω = 1.18 A
Calculation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (chopper reference frequency)
An approximation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopper frequency (fchop)
can be calculated by the following expressions.
fOSCM = 1/[0.56x{Cx(R1+500)}]
         *C,R1: External components for OSCM (C = 270 pF, R1 = 3.6 kΩ=> fOSCM = 1.6 MHz (Typ.))
fchop = fOSCM / 16
         *fOSCM = 1.6 MHz => fchop = About 100 kHz
If chopping frequency is raised, Rippl of current will become small and wave-like reproducibility will improve.
However, the gate loss inside IC goes up and generation of heat becomes large.
By lowering chopping frequency, reduction in generation of heat is expectable. However, Rippl of current may
become large. It is a standard about about 70 kHz. A setup in the range of 50 to 100 kHz is recommended.

   Note 1: Usually, the maximum current value at the time should use 70% or less of the absolute maximum
              ratings for a standard on thermal rating. The maximum output current may be further limited in view
              of thermal considerations, depending on ambient temperature and board conditions. (It will depend on
              the heat generation.)
   Note 2:     Device alone (Ta =25°C)
               When Ta exceeds 25°C, it is necessary to do the derating with 10.4 mW/°C.
       Ta: Ambient temperature
       Topr: Ambient temperature while the IC is active
       Tj: Junction temperature while the IC is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the
            thermal
            shutdown (TSD) circuitry. It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that the
            maximum junction temperature, Tj (MAX), will not exceed 120°C.
Caution) Absolute maximum ratings
         The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
         even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
         Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
         explosion or combustion.
         The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
         circumstances. The TB62262FTAG does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is
         damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
         All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations
         described later should also be referred to.

Note1: About TSD
When the junction temperature of the device reached the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit is triggered; the internal
reset circuit then turns off the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection.
Once the TSD circuit is triggered, the device will be set to standby mode, and can be cleared by reasserting the VM
power source, or setting the DMODE pins to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal
error, therefore is not recommended to be used aggressively.
Note2: About ISD
When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit then turns off
the output transistors. To prevent the ISD circuitry from being tripped due to switching noise, it has a masking
time .Once the ISD circuit is triggered, the device keeps the output off until power-on reset (POR), is reasserted or
the device is set to standby mode by DMODE pins. For fail-safe, please insert a fuse to avoid secondary trouble.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor
current recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise
above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
characteristics. It is no problem to the destruction and the operation of the IC by the back electromotive force, also
please fully confirm that there is no malfunction or damage to the peripheral circuit.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an
output short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device
may be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a
condition persists for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be
removed immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

IC Usage Considerations
    Notes on handling of ICs
          (1) The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
               even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
               breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
          (2) Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
               terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
               Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
               exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
               injury by explosion or combustion.
               In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
               applied even just once.
          (3) Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
               case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
               exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
               pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
               breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the
               case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit
               location, are required.
          (4)   If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
               design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
               current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
               IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
               protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing
               IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
          (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
              components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
              If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback capacitor, the IC
              output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
              withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
              smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
              (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
 Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
 circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
 immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
 depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after
 operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
 Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
 operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 thermal shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
 When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
 appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time or under any
 condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
 decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
 into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
 When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
 supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s
 motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To
 avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
