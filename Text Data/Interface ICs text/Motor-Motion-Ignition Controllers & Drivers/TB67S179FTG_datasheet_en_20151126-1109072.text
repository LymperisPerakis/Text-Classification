Application Notes
All the grounding wires of the device must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated at only one
point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD (VM) and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across
output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently damaged.
Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power supply
pins (VM, RSGND, OUT, GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired incorrectly, an
operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running
through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

         ↑ (Low to High)                    Shifts the electrical angle per step.
         ↓ (High to Low)            － (State of the electrical angle does not change.)
ENABLE function
The ENABLE pin controls the ON and OFF of the corresponding output stage. For accurate operation, please
set the ENABLE to Low during VM power-on and power-off sequence.

RESET function
The RESET pin controls the reset of the internal electrical angle. For accurate operation, please set the RESET pin to
‘High’ during VM power-on. Switch the RESET to ‘Low’, once the
VM voltage has reached the operation range.
                RESET                                                         Function

(*) [Full step, Torque 100%] written above shows the initial status of the logic. (During Standby mode, the internal oscillator
   and motor output is set to OFF, therefore does not mean that the device will operate at [Full step, Torque 100%])
Standby mode function
Setting all of the DMODE pins(DMODE0,DMODE1,and DMODE2) to Low will set the device to Standby mode. During
Standby mode, the internal bias current is cut so that the device be set to low power mode. Also, setting the device to
Standby mode will release the error detection such as TSD and ISD. Moreover, the electrical angle is initialized by setting
the Standby mode.
              Standby mode                                                       Function
        ON (DMODE0,1,2=L,L,L)                                   Standby mode: ON (Low power mode)
 OFF (other than DMODE0,1,2=L,L,L)                             Standby mode: OFF (Normal operation)
After the device detects an error such as TSD or ISD, setting the device to Standby mode to OFF and then ON again
will release the error detect latch signal. (Reasserting the VM power will also release the error detect latch signal.)
In the Standby mode, the internal functions are suspended. Therefore, during the startup period (10μs after setting the
Standby mode: OFF), please do not send any control signals. (If the signal is sent to the device during the startup period,
the device may not be able to accept the signal correctly.)

Constant-current threshold setting
The constant-current threshold can be set by asserting the VREF voltage.
IOUT = VREF × 3/4 × IOUT(RATIO)
Example: Current setting 100%, VREF=2.0V: The constant current threshold (peak current) will be as shown below.
IOUT = 2.0×3/4×1.0=1.5A
To set the constant-current function ‘off’, connect the VCC and VREF pin directly (do not use any external power supply).
Fixed off time setting
To set the fixed off time for constant-current PWM control, please connect a pull-down resistance to the OSCM pin.
The relation between the pull-down resistance (ROSCM) and fixed off time is as shown below.

Caution) Absolute maximum ratings
The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or
combustion.
The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any circumstances. The
device does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated
maximum is applied.
All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations described
later should also be referred to.
Note: Allowable power dissipation
       When Ta exceeds 25°C, the derating at 10.4 mw/°C is required.

(*) About Thermal shutdown (TSD)
When the junction temperature of the device reached the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit is triggered; the internal reset
circuit then turns off the output stage. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection by the switching and so
on.
Once the TSD circuit is triggered; the detect latch signal can be cleared by reasserting the VM power source, or setting
the device to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error, therefore is not recommended
to be used aggressively.
(*) About Over-current detection (ISD)
When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit then turns
off the output stage. The masking time is built in the IC to avoid misdetection by the switching and so on. Once the ISD
circuit is triggered, the detect latch signal can be cleared by reasserting the VM power source, or setting the device to
standby mode. The ISD function is a function to detect that the over-current flows into the motor output, therefore, is not
recommended to be used aggressively.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor current
recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above
the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must
be fully verified that there is no risk that the device or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor
back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an output
short-circuits; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device may
be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such condition persists
for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed immediately by
external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
      (1)   The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
            even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
            breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
      (2)   Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the case
            of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed its
            absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise occurs
            from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can lead to smoke
            or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the case of breakdown, appropriate
            settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are required.
      (3)   If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the design
            to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush current at power
            ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF. IC breakdown may
            cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the
            power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown
            may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
      (4)   Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
            terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
            Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and exceeding the
            rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or
            combustion.
            In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is applied
            even just once.
      (5)   Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
            components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
            If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback condenser, the IC
            output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input withstand
            voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause smoke or
            ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load (BTL)
            connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
・Over current detection Circuit
Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances.
If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status immediately.
Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the overcurrent
detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition, depending on the method
of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after operation, the IC may generate heat
resulting in breakdown.
・Thermal Shutdown Circuit
Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits operate
against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the thermal
shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
・Heat Radiation Design
When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time or under any condition.
These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life,
deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take into consideration the
effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
・Back-EMF
When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power supply
owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor power supply
and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the
effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
