                                                 Interface circuit (relay and lamp driver)
Features
■   High output current
■   Adjustable short-circuit protection to ground
■   Internal thermal protection with hysteresis to
    avoid the intermediate output levels
■   Large supply voltage range: 8 to 30V
■   Short-circuit protection to VCC                                     SO-14
■   Open ground protection
Description
The TDE3247 is a monolithic amplifier designed
for high current and high voltage applications,
specifically to drive lamps, relays and stepping
motors.
The Device is essentialy blow-out proof. Current
limiting is available to limit the peak output current
to a safe value, the adjustment only required an
external resistor.
In addition, thermal shut-down is provided to keep
the IC from overheating.
If external dissipation becomes too high, the
driver will shut-down to prevent excessive
heating.
The output is also protected against short-circuit
with the positive power supply.
The device operates over a wide range of supply
voltage from standard ±15V operational amplifier
supplies down to the single 12V or 24V used for
industrial electronic systems.
