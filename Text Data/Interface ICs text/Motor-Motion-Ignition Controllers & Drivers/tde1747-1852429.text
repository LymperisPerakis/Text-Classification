Description
The TDE1747 is a monolithic comparator
designed for high current and high voltage
applications, specifically to drive lamps, relays,
stepping motors.
This device is essentially blow-out proof. Current
limiting is available to limit the peak output current
to safe values.
Adjustment only requires one external resistor. In
addition, thermal shut down is provided to keep
the IC from overheating. If internal dissipation
becomes too high, the driver will shut down to
prevent excessive heating. TDE1747 has an open
ground protection. The output is also protected
from shortcircuits with the positive power supply.
The device operates over a wide range of supply
voltages from standard ± 15V operational
amplifier supplies down to the single +12V or
+24V used for industrial electronic systems.                .

1. For operating at high temperature, the TDE1747, must be derated based on a +150°C maximum junction temperature and
   junction-ambient thermal resistance of 120°C/W for DIP-8 and 100°C/W for the SO14.
2. The offset voltage given is the maximum value of input voltage required to drive the output voltage within 2V of the ground
   or the supply voltage.
