Protection Features
         (1)    Thermal shutdown (TSD)
                The thermal shutdown circuit turns off all the outputs when the junction temperature (Tj) exceeds 150°C (typical).
                The outputs retain the current states.
                The TB62208FNG exits TSD mode and resumes normal operation when the TB62208FNG is rebooted or the
                 STANDBY pin is changed from High to Low and then to High.
         (2)    Power-on-resets (PORs) for VMR and VCCR (VM and VCC voltage monitor)
                The outputs are forced off until VM and VCC reach the rated voltages.
         (3)    Overcurrent shutdown (ISD)
                Each phase has an overcurrent shutdown circuit, which turns off the corresponding outputs when the output
                current exceeds the shutdown trip threshold (above the maximum current rating: 2.0 A minimum).
                The TB62208FNG exits ISD mode and resumes normal operation when the STANDBY pin is changed from High
                to Low and then to High.
              This circuit provides protection against short-circuit by temporarily disabling the device. Important notes on this
              feature will be provided later.

  Note 1: As a guide, the maximum output current should be kept below 1.0 A per phase. The maximum
             output current may be further limited by thermal considerations, depending on ambient
             temperature and board conditions.
  Ta: Ambient temperature
  Topr: Ambient temperature while the TB62208FNG is active
  T j:    Junction temperature while the TB62208FNG is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited
          by the thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry. Please design to keep the maximum current below a
          certain level so that the maximum junction temperature, Tj(max), will not exceed 120℃.
  Cautions on absolute maximum ratings:
       The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
       exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
       Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
       injury by explosion or combustion.
       The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under
       any circumstances. The TB62208FNG does not have overvoltage protection. Therefore, the device is
       damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
       All voltage ratings including supply voltages must always be followed. The section on the protection
       features on the latter page should also be referred to.

    (Note 2)
    Note 1: Thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry
              When the junction temperature of the device has reached the threshold, the TSD circuitry is tripped, causing the
              internal reset circuitry to turn off the output transistors.
              The TSD circuitry is tripped at a temperature between 140°C (min) and 160°C (max). Once tripped, the TSD
              circuitry keeps the output transistors off until STANDBY is deasserted High.
    Note 2: Overcurrent shutdown (ISD) circuitry
              When the output current has reached the threshold, the ISD circuitry is tripped, causing the internal reset circuitry
              to turn off the output transistors.
              To prevent the ISD circuitry from being tripped due to switching noise, it has a masking time of four CR oscilator
              cycles. Once triped, it takes a maximum of four cycles to exit ISD mode and resume normal operation.
              The ISD circuitry remains active until the STANDBY pin is changed from Low to High again.
              The TB62208FNG remains in Standby mode while in ISD mode.
Back-EMF
・    While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor current
     recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
     If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above
     the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must
     be fully verified that there is no risk that the TB62208FNG or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor
     back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
・The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an output
  short-circuit.
・If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly; then the device may be
  damaged due to an output short-circuit.
・The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a condition persists
  for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed immediately by
  external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Otherwise, it may cause the device breakdown,
damage and/or deterioration.

The TB62208FNG switches among Charge, Slow Decay and Fast Decay modes automatically for constant-current control.
   The equivalent circuit diagrams are simplified or some parts of them may be omitted for explanatory purposes.
Calculation of the Predefined Output Current
           For PWM constant-current control, the TB62208FNG uses a clock generated by the CR oscillator. The peak output
       current can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RRS) and the reference voltage (Vref), as follows:
                Iout = Vref / 5 / RRS (Ω)
           where, 1/5 is the Vref decay rate, Vref(GAIN). For the value of Vref(GAIN), see the Electrical Characteristics table.
           For example, when Vref = 3 V, to generate an output current (IOUT) of 0.8 A, RRs = 0.75Ω. (≥ 0.5 W)
                                                                    13                                                   2011-01-28

IC Power Consumption
       The power consumed by the TB62208FNG is approximately the sum of the following two: 1) the power consumed
     by the output transistors, and 2) the power consumed by the logic and pre-drivers.
     •   The power consumed by the output transistors is calculated, using the RON(D–S) value of 1.5 Ω.
         Whether in Charge, Fast Decay or Slow Decay mode, two of the four transistors comprising each H-bridge
         contribute to its power consumption at a given time.
           Thus the power consumed by each H-bridge is given by:
                                                          2
                P (out) = IOUT (A) × VDS (V) = 2 × IOUT × RON ..............................................(1)
           In two-phase excitation mode (in which two phases have a phase difference of 90°), the average power
         consumption in the output transistors is calculated as follows:
                RON = 1.50 Ω (＠1.0 A)
                IOUT (Peak: max) = 1.0 A
                VM = 24 V
                                  2
                P (out) = 2 × 1.0 (A) × 1.50 (Ω) = 3.0 (W)........................................................(2)
         •   The power consumption in the IM domain is calculated separately for normal operation and standby modes:
                I (IM3) = 5.0 mA (typ.): Normal operation mode
                I (IM1) = 2.0 mA (typ.): Standby mode
           The current consumed in the logic portion of the TB62208FNG is indicated as IMx. The logic operates off a
         voltage regulator that is internally connected to the VM power supply. It consists of the logic connected to VM (24 V)
         and the network affected by the switching of the output transistors. The total power consumed by IMx can be
         estimated as:
                P (IM) = 24 (V) × 0.005 (A) = 0.12 (W)............................................................(3)
           Hence, the total power consumption of the TB62208FNG is:
                P = P (out) + P (IM) = 3.16 (W)
                   The standby power consumption is given by:
                P (Standby) + P (out) = 24 (V) × 0.002 (A) = 0.048 (W)
           Board design should be fully verified, taking thermal dissipation into consideration.

                  An overcurrent starts to flow into the output
                  transistors.
  The overcurrent shutdown (ISD) circuitry has a masking time to prevent current spikes during Irr and switching from
erroneously tripping the ISD circuitry. The masking time is a function of the chopper frequency obtained by CR:
            Masking time = 4 × OSCM period
  The minimum and maximum times taken to turn off the output transistors since an overcurrent flows into them are:
            Min: 4 × OSCM period
            Max: 8 × OSCM period
  It should be noted that these values assume a case in which an overcurrent condition is detected in an ideal manner. The
ISD circuitry might not work, depending on the control timing of the output transistors.
  Therefore, a protection fuse must always be added to the VM power supply as a safety precaution. The optimal fuse
capacitance varies with usage conditions, and one that does not adversely affect the motor operation or exceed the power
dissipation rating of the TB62208FNG should be selected.

 Note:      Bypass capacitors should be added as necessary.
 It is recommended to use a single ground plane for the entire board whenever possible, and an efficient grounding
 method should be considered for heat dissipation.
 In cases where mode setting pins are controlled via switches, either pull-down or pull-up resistors should be
 added to them to avoid floating states.
 For a description of the input values, see the “Output Function Table.”
 The above application circuit example is presented only as a guide and should be fully evaluated prior to
 production. Also, no intellectual property right is ceded in any way whatsoever in regard to its use.
 The external components in the above diagram are used to test the electrical characteristics of the device; it is not
 guaranteed that no system malfunction or failure will not occur.
         Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD (VM) and GND traces to avoid short-circuits
         across output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short-circuit occurs, the TB62208FNG may be
         permanently damaged. Also, if the device is installed in a wrong orientation, a high voltage might be applied to
         components with lower voltage ratings, causing them to be damaged. The TB62208FNG does not have an
         overvoltage protection circuit. Thus, if a voltage exceeding the rated maximum voltage is applied, the
         TB62208FNG will be damaged; it should be ensured that it is used within the specified operating conditions.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
      (1)   The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
            even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
            Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result injury
            by explosion or combustion.
      (2)   Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in case of
            over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed its
            absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise occurs
            from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can lead smoke or
            ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case of breakdown, appropriate settings,
            such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are required.
      (3)   If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
            design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush current
            at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF. IC
            breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
            Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the
            protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or
            ignition.
      (4)   Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
            Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
            Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and exceeding the
            rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result injury by explosion or
            combustion.
            In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation or
            incorrectly even just one time.
                                                           23                                             2011-01-28


                                                                                                    TB62208FNG
      (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
          components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
          If there is a large amount of leakage current such as input or negative feedback condenser, the IC output
          DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input withstand voltage,
          overcurrent or IC failure can cause smoke or ignition. (The over current can cause smoke or ignition from
          the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load (BTL) connection type IC
          that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.
Points to remember on handling of ICs
      (1) Over current Protection Circuit
          Over current protection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under
          all circumstances. If the Over current protection circuits operate against the over current, clear the over
          current status immediately.
          Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can
          cause the over current protection circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation. In
          addition, depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if over current continues to flow for a long
          time after operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
      (2) Thermal Shutdown Circuit
          Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown
          circuits operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
          Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can
          cause the thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
      (3) Heat Radiation Design
          In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device so
          that heat is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time and
           condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can
           lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, please design
           the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
      (4) Back-EMF
          When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the
          motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is
          small, the device’s motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond maximum
          ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
