  Application Notes
     All the grounding wires of the TB62269FTG must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally
     terminated at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
     Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD (VM) and GND traces, to avoid short circuits
     across output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the TB62269FTG may be
     permanently damaged.
     Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the TB62269FTG since it has
     power supply pins (VM, RS, OUT, GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are
     wired incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the TB62269FTG may be destroyed.
     The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the TB62269FTG may be damaged owing to a
     current running through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

   Note 1: As a guide, the maximum output current should be kept below 1.4 A per phase. The maximum output current
             may be further limited in view of thermal considerations, depending on ambient temperature and board
             conditions.
  Note 2:    Stand-alone (Ta =25°C)
             When Ta exceeds 25°C, it is necessary to do the deleting with 10.4mW/°C.
          Ta: Ambient temperature
          Topr: Ambient temperature while the TB62269FTG is active
          Tj: Junction temperature while the TB62269FTG is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the
              thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry. It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that
              the maximum junction temperature, Tj (MAX), will not exceed 120°C.
Caution）Absolute maximum ratings
        The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even
        for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
        Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
        explosion or combustion.
        The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
        circumstances. The TB62269FTG does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is damaged
        if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
        All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations
        described later should also be referred to.

    circuit operation
   Note 1: Thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry
            When the junction temperature of the device reaches the threshold, the TSD circuitry is tripped, causing the
             internal reset circuitry to turn off the output transistors.The TSD circuitry is tripped at a temperature between
             140°C (min) and 170°C (max). Once tripped, the TSD circuitry keeps the output transistors off until the TSD
             circuitry is released. The TSD status is released once the TB62269FTG is rebooted or all the
             D_MODEpins(D_MODE0,1,2) are switched to Low(set to STANDBY status). The TSD circuitry does not
             necessarily guarantee the complete safety of the device; therefore do not use the TSD circuitry actively.
   Note 2: Overcurrent shutdown (ISD) circuitry
            When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuitry is tripped, causing the internal reset circuitry
             to turn off the output transistors.To prevent the ISD circuitry from being tripped owing to switching noise, it has
             a masking time of four CR oscillator cycles. Once tripped, it takes a maximum of four cycles to exit ISD mode
             and resume normal operation.The ISD circuitry remains active until all the D_MODE(DMODE_0,1,2) pins are
             switched to Low or the TB62269FTG is rebooted. The TB62269FTG remains in Standby mode while in ISD
             mode.
  Note 3: When the power supply voltage (VCC) for operating internal circuit is divided by the external resistor and used
            as Vref input voltage, the accuracy of the output current setting value becomes ±8% together with the VCC
            output voltage accuracy and the Vref decay ratio accuracy.
  Note 4: Even when the logic input signal is input under the condition that the VM voltage is not supplied, the
            electromotive force and the leakage current by the signal input are not generated. However, before VM is
            rebooted, logic input signal should be controlled not to let the motor operating by rebooting VM.
Back-EMF
   While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the
   motor current is fed back to the power supply owing to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
   If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might
   rise above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
   characteristics. It must be fully verified that there is no risk that the TB62269FTG or other components will be
   damaged or fail owing to the motor back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
   The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as
   an output short circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee complete IC safety.
   If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the
   device may be damaged owing to an output short circuit.
   The ISD circuit is only intended to provide temporary protection against an output short circuit. If such a
   condition persists for a long time, the device may be damaged owing to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must
   be removed immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Otherwise, it may cause device breakdown, damage
  and/or deterioration.

                                                                                                    TB62269FTG
   Calculation of the Setting Output Current
For PWM constant-current control, the TB62269FTG uses a clock generated by the CR oscillator. The peak output current
can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RRS) and the reference voltage (Vref), as follows:
                                        Vref(V)
      Iout(Max) = Vref(gain) x
                                        RRS(Ω)
    Vref(gain): Vref decay ratio is 1 / 5.0 (typ.).
    Ex.): In case of 100% setting,
       When Vref = 3.0 V, Torque = 100%, and RS = 0.51Ω,
    constant current output of the motor (peak current) is calculated as follows;
       Iout = 3.0V / 5.0 / 0.51Ω= 1.18 A.
Calculation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (chopper reference frequency)
   OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopper frequency (fchop) are computable in the following expressions.
      fOSCM=1/[0.56x{Cx(R1+500)}]                ………C, R1: External constant for OSCM (C=270pF, R1=3.6kΩ)
      fchop = fOSCM / 16
     Because the loss of the gate in IC rises, generation of heat grows though wavy reproducibility goes up because the
   pulsating flow of the current decreases when the chopper frequency is raised.
     There is a possibility of the current pulsating flow increasing though a decrease in generation of heat can be
   expected by lowering the chopper frequency.
     The thing set within the range of the frequency from 50 to about 100 kHz based on the frequency generally of about
   70 kHz is recommended.

IC Power Consumption
   The power consumed by the TB62269FTG is approximately the sum of the following; 1) the power consumed by the
output transistors, and 2) the power consumed by the digital logic portion.
1. Power consumption of output transistors using the Ron (upper + lower) value of 1.0 Ω
   The power of the output transistors is consumed by upper and lower H-bridge.
   The power consumed by each H-bridge is given by:
        P (out) = Iout (A) × VDS (V) = Iout (A)^2 × Ron (Ω) ............................................................................... (1)
    In full step mode (in which two phases have a phase difference of 90°), the average power consumption in the output
    transistors is calculated as follows:
        Ron = 1.0Ω, Iout (peak: Max) = 1.0 A, VM = 24 V
        P (out) = 2 (Tr) × 1.0 (A)^2 × 1.0(Ω) ....................................................................................................... (2)
                 = 2.0 (W)
2. Power consumption of logic portion and IM domain
    The power consumption of logic portion and the IM domain is calculated separately for normal operation and standby
modes.
        I (IM3) = 5 mA (typ.)               : Normal operation mode/1axis
        I (IM2) = 3.5 mA (typ.)             : Standby mode
   The output domain is connected to VM (24V). It consists of the digital logic connected to VM (24 V) and the network
affected by the switching of the output transistors.
       The total power consumed by IM can be estimated as:
        P (IM) = 24 (V) × 0.005 (A) .................................................................................................................... (3)
                 = 0.12 (W)
3. Power consumption
       Hence, the total power consumption of the TB62269FTG is:
        P = P (out) + P (IM) = 2.12 (W)
   The standby power consumption per axis is given by:
        P (Standby) = 24 (V) × 0.0035 (A) = 0.084 (W)
       Board design should be fully verified, taking thermal dissipation into consideration.

IC Usage Considerations
    Notes on handling of ICs
          (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
                even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
                breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
          (2)
               Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
                case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
                exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
                pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
                breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the
                case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit
                location, are required.
          (3)    If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
                design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
                current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
                IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
                protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing
                IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
          (4)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
                terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
                Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
                exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
                injury by explosion or combustion.
                In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
                applied even just once.
           (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
               components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
               If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback condenser, the IC
               output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
               withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
               smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
               (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
immediately.
Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after operation,
the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the thermal
shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time or under any
condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor
power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this
problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
