Note: Some of the functional blocks, circuits, or constants in the block diagram may be omitted or simplified for explanatory purpose.
Note: All the grounding wires of the TB67S128FTG should run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be
     considered for efficient heat dissipation. Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across output pins or to the power
     supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently damaged. Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the
     device since it has power supply pins (VM, RS line, OUT line, and GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired incorrectly, an operation error
     may occur or the device may be destroyed. The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running through the IC
     that is larger than the specified current. Careful attention should be paid to design patterns and mountings.

8. Functional Description 1 (for CLK mode when IF_SEL pin = L)
8.1. CLK Function
Each up-edge of the CLK signal will shift the motor’s electrical angle per step.
When EDG_SEL pin = L (Single Edge)
      CLK pin input                                                   Function
         Up-edge                                       Shifts the electrical angle per step.
       Down-edge                                 (State of the electrical angle does not change.)
  When EDG_SEL pin = H (Double Edge)
      CLK pin input                                                   Function
         Up-edge                                       Shifts the electrical angle per step.
       Down-edge                                       Shifts the electrical angle per step.
8.2. ENABLE Function
The ENABLE pin controls the ON and OFF of the stepping motor outputs. Motor operation starts and stops by setting
H and L to the ENABLE pin. (When ENABLE pin is set to L (OFF), all of the MOSFETs turn off and become high
impedance (hereafter, Hi-Z).)
Setting the ENABLE pin to L, and avoiding the motor to operate during VM power-on and power-off (i.e., outside of
the operating voltage range) is recommended. Then, switch the ENABLE pin to H after the VM reaches the target
voltage and becomes stable.
    ENABLE pin input                                                  Function
             L                             OFF (High impedance mode, later omitted Hi-Z mode later)
             H                                             ON (Normal operation mode)
8.3. CW/CCW Function and the Output Pin Function (Output logic at the time of a
       charge start)
The CW/CCW pin controls the rotation direction of the motor. When set to H, the current of OUT_A is output first,
with a phase difference of 90°. When set to L, the current of OUT_B is output first with a phase difference of 90°.

  L: Counter clockwise operation (CCW)                        L                                     H
       H: Clockwise operation (CW)                            H                                     L

8.13. Selectable Mixed Decay Function
The Selectable Mixed Decay can adjust the current regeneration amount during the period of current regeneration
(Decay) using pins.
Though the Mixed Decay is determined by controlling 2 different types of decay (Fast Decay and Slow Decay), this
function enables the user to select the ratio of the Mixed Decay using MDT0 and MDT1 pin. (2bit, 4 function)

The Charge period is determined by the operating status.
Therefore the NF detect timing with in the chopping cycle will change. If NF is detected in the early period of the
fchop cycle, the Slow Decay will be longer. If NF is detected in the late period of the fchop cycle, the Slow Decay will
be shorter, as shown above.
Note: The chopping cycle is determined as: fchop - (Charge + Fast decay) = Slow Decay
        (Fast Decay ratio can be changed by MDT0 pin and MDT1 pin setting.)

9. Functional Description 2 (for Serial mode when IF_SEL pin = H)
When IF_SEL pin = H, the interface is serial input. It performs setting and motor control in the following 32 bit
format.
When BANK_EN pin is L, initial setting is performed. When the BANK_EN pin is H, the motor is controlled.
For the motor control, each current value is set in the serial setting, and the output is updated to the set current
value at the timing of the LATCH signal.

10. Stepping Motor Application Features
      (Anti-stall, RS resistor less PWM)
10.1. Active Gain Control (Anti-stall) Function
AGC pins will set the Active Gain Control to turn on or off. When this pins are set to H, the AGC is turned on, and
when this pins are set to L, the AGC is turned off.
When the AGC is ON, the motor current is equal or more than the value by setting the VREF pin. The TB67S128FTG
reduces gradually the motor current depending on the load torque.
When the AGC is OFF, the motor current is the value by setting the VREF pin.

11. Common Function (When CLK Mode and Serial Mode)
11.1. LO (Error detect flag output) Function
When an error detection function performs, the LO function outputs an error detection as a signal from LO0 and LO1
pins to the outside of TB67S128FTG.
The LO0 and LO1 pins are open-drain output pins. The LO0 and LO1 pins need to be pulled up to VCC level via 10
k to 100 kΩ resistor.
During regular operation, the level of LO0 and LO1 pins will stay Hi-Z (the internal MOSFET is OFF, the level of
these pins are VCC level).
When the thermal shutdown (TSD), Over current (ISD), or motor load open (OPD) occurs, the LO0 and/or LO1 pins
will become L (the internal MOSFET is ON).
When the error detection is released by reasserting the VM power supply or setting the device to STANDBY mode,
the LO0 and LO1 pins show “normal status”.
Leave the LO0 and LO1 pins open when not using these functions.

14. Calculation of the OSCM Oscillation Frequency
      (chopper reference frequency)
An approximation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopper frequency (fchop) can be calculated by
the following expressions.
                                                                         1
                                            fOSCM =
                                                        0.56 × {COSC × (ROSC + 500)}
                                                                      fOSCM
                                                             fchop =

Note: COSC: Capacitor connected to OSCM pin, ROSC: Resistor connected to OSCM pin
For example:
   When COSC = 270 pF and ROSC = 5.1 kΩ, fOSCM frequency will be calculated by following expressions.
                                                                1
                                   fOSCM =                                        ≈ 1.2 (MHz)(typ. )

                                             fchop =             =            ≈ 75 (kHz)
                                                          16           16
If chopping frequency is raised, Rippl of current will become small and wave-like reproducibility will improve.
However, the gate loss inside IC goes up and generation of heat becomes large.
By lowering chopping frequency, reduction in generation of heat is expectable. However, Rippl of current may become
large.
It is a standard about 70 kHz. A setup in the range of 50k to 100 kHz is recommended.

Note1: Usually, the maximum current value at the time should use 70% or less of the absolute maximum ratings for a
       standard on thermal rating. The maximum output current may be further limited in view of thermal considerations,
       depending on ambient temperature and board conditions.
Note2: Device alone (Ta =25°C)
       When Ta exceeds 25°C, it is necessary to do the derating with 9.6 mW/°C.
       Ta: Ambient temperature
       Topr: Ambient temperature while the IC is active
       Tj: Junction temperature while the IC is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the thermal
            shutdown (TSD) circuitry. It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that the maximum
            junction temperature, Tj (MAX), will not exceed 120°C.
Caution) Absolute maximum ratings
         The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even
         for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
         Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
         explosion or combustion.
         The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
         circumstances. The TB67S128FTG does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is damaged
         if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
         All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations
         described later should also be referred to.

 Note: When the logic signal is applied to the device whilst the VM power supply is not asserted; the device is designed not
        to function, but for safe usage, please apply the logic signal after the VM power supply is asserted and the VM
        voltage reaches the proper operating range.
 Note1: VIN(H) is defined as the VIN voltage that causes the outputs (OUT_A+ pin, OUT_A- pin, OUT_B+ pin, OUT_B- pin)
         to change when a pin under test is gradually raised from 0 V.VIN(L) is defined as the VIN voltage that causes the
         outputs (OUT_A+ pin, OUT_A- pin, OUT_B+ pin, OUT_B- pin) to change when the pin is then gradually lowered.
         The difference between VIN(H) and VIN(L) is defined as the VIN(HYS).

              threshold (Note2)
Note1: About TSD
When the junction temperature of the device reached the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit is triggered; the internal reset
circuit then turns off the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection. Once the TSD
circuit is triggered, the device will be set to standby mode, and can be cleared by reasserting the VM power source, or
setting the MODE pins to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error, therefore is not
recommended to be used aggressively.
Note2: About ISD
When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit then turns off the output
transistors. Once the ISD circuit is triggered, the device keeps the output off until power-on reset (POR), is reasserted or
the device is set to standby mode by MODE pins. For fail-safe, please insert a fuse to avoid secondary trouble.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor current
recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above
the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must
be fully verified that there is no risk that the TB67S128FTG or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor
back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an output
short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device may
be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a condition persists
for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed immediately by
external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

IC Usage Considerations
Notes on handling of ICs
      (1)   The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
            exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
            Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
            injury by explosion or combustion.
      (2)   Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in
            case of over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
            exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
            pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
            breakdown can lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case of
            breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are
            required.
      (3)   If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
            design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
            current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power
            OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
            Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable,
            the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury,
            smoke or ignition.
      (4)   Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
            Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
            Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
            exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
            injury by explosion or combustion.
            In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation
            or incorrectly even just one time.
       (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
           components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
           If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback condenser, the IC
           output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
           withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
           smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied
           Load (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.
                                                   45                                                 2018-06-11


                                                                                             TB67S128FTG
Points to remember on handling of ICs
      (1)  Over current Protection Circuit
           Over current protection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs
           under all circumstances. If the Over current protection circuits operate against the over current, clear
           the over current status immediately.
           Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings
           can cause the over current protection circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
           In addition, depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if over current continues to flow for
           a long time after operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
      (2)  Thermal Shutdown Circuit
           Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal
           shutdown circuits operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
           Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings
           can cause the thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
      (3)  Heat Radiation Design
           In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device
           so that heat is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time
           and condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design
           can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, please
           design the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
      (4)  Back-EMF
           When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the
           motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply
           is small, the device’s motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond
           absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in
           system design.
