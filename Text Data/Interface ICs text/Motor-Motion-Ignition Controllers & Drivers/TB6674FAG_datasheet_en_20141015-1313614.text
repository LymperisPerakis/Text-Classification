    Over Current Protection (ISD) Circuit
          The IC has the over current protection circuit that monitors the current flowing through each output
          power transistor. If a current, which is out of the detecting current, is sensed at any one of these
          transistors, all output transistors are turned off (Hi-Z). (However, ISD is not included in upper PchDMOS
          when PS is high level (Vs2A is 5 V usage) because ON resistance is large.
          Masking time is 20 μs. The operation does not recover automatically (latch method). There are two
          recovery methods written below.
          (1) Power monitor turns on when any of the power supply decreases and reaches the specified voltage.
          (2) Vs2B is set low level for 20 μs or more and then set high. The operation recovers in 10 μs.
          Reference design target of detecting current is as follows;
          PS = L, VS1A (12 V) :PchDMOS = 1.1 A
          PS = H/PS = L in common :Lower NchDMOS = 1.4 A
          Please reduce the external noise to prevent malfunction for ISD.

Thermal Shutdown Circuit (TSD)
     The TB6674FAG has a thermal shutdown circuit. If the junction temperature (Tj) exceeds 160°C (design
     target only), all the outputs are tuned off (Hi-Z).
     It recovers automatically at 140°C. It has a hysteresis width of 20°C.

              Note 1: Connect the VS2A terminal to the lower supply voltage (5 V).

              Note 3: Utmost care is necessary in the design of the output, VCC, VS1A/B, and GND lines since the IC may be
                      destroyed by short-circuiting between outputs, air contamination faults, or faults due to improper grounding,
                      or by short-circuiting between contiguous terminals.
              Note 4: By our short-circuited examination of neighboring terminals, when 9 and 10 terminals or 15 and 16 terminals
                      are short-circuited, the TB6674FAG might to be destroyed and cause the trouble of smoking etc. Please use
                      an appropriate fuse to the power supply line.
              Note 5: Connect VS1A terminal and VS1B terminal externally.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
[1] The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
     exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
     Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
     injury by explosion or combustion.
[2] Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in
     case of over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
     exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
     pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
     breakdown can lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case
     of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location,
     are required.
[3] If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into
     the design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the
     inrush current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at
     power OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
     Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is
     unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause
     injury, smoke or ignition.
[4] Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
     Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
     Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
     exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
     injury by explosion or combustion.
     In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation
     or incorrectly even just one time.
                                                     16                                       2014-10-15

Points to remember on handling of ICs
(1) Heat Radiation Design
    In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the
    device so that heat is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at
    any time and condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat
    radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown.
    In addition, please design the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation with
    peripheral components.
(2) Back-EMF
    When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to
    the motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power
    supply is small, the device’s motor power supply and output terminals might be exposed to
    conditions beyond absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF
    into consideration in system design.
