Stepping Motor Driver IC
   The TB6608FNG is a PWM constant-current type stepping
motor driver IC designed for sinusoidal-input micro-step control of
stepping motors.
   The TB6608FNG can be used in applications that require
2-phase, 1-2-phase, W1-2-phase and 2W1-2 phase excitation
modes. The TB6608FNG is capable of forward and reverse driving
of a 2-phase bipolar stepping motor using only a clock signal.

Relationship between the ENABLE Input and the Phase Current and MO Outputs
  Example 1: 1-2-phase excitation (M1: H, M2: L)
    Setting the ENABLE signal Low disables only the output signals. On the other hand, internal logic functions
  continue to operate in accordance with the CK signal.
    Therefore, when the ENABLE signal goes High again, the output current generation is restarted as if phases
  proceeded with the CK signal.

Relationship between the RESET Input and the Phase Current and MO Outputs
  Example 1: 1-2-phase excitation (M1: H, M2: L)
    Setting the RESET signal Low causes the outputs to be put in the Initial state and the MO output to be
  Low. (Initial state: A-channel output current is at its peak (100%).) When the RESET signal goes High again,
  the output current generation is resumed at the next rising edge of the CK signal with the state following the
  Initial state. If RESET goes High when CK is already High, the output current generation is resumed
  immediately without waiting for the next rising edge of CK with the state following the Initial state.

Chopper Control
  Turning on the power (chop on) causes a current to flow into the coils. Once the VRF voltage reaches Vref, it is
detected by the comparator and the power is turned off (chop off).
  The off timer/counter counts the number of falling edges of the internal CK signal, which is derived from the OSC
signal, and generates the motor-driving PWM signal based on the turn-off time of four CK cycles.

  The upper limit of the current across the motor coil (i.e., the peak current in each excitation mode), I (Limit), can
be calculated as follows:
        I (Limit) = Vref/RNF
  Vref equals to 0.125 V when TQ is Low, while it equals to 0.5 V when TQ is High.
  RNF is the value of resistors used for output current detection. One of those resistors is connected between RFA
and GND, and the other is connected between RFB and GND.
  Timing chart may be simplified for the sake of brevity.

PWM Control
  In PWM mode, the motor operating mode changes between CW/CCW and short brake alternately.
  To eliminate shoot-through current that flows from supply to ground due to the simultaneous conduction of
high-side and low-side transistors in the bridge output, a dead time of 200 ns (design target value) is generated in
the IC when transistors switch from on to off (t2), or vice versa (t4).
  This permits a synchronous rectification PWM operation without controlling the dead time externally.

1. Constant-Current Chopping
   When VRF reaches the predefined Vref voltage, the constant-current regulator enters Discharge mode.
   After four cycles of CK, an internal clock generated by OSC, the regulator moves from Discharge mode to
   Charge mode.

2. Changing the Predefined Current to the Lower Value
   During deceleration, the regulator enters fast-decay mode immediately after the end of the current decay
   slope of slow-decay mode. The distortion of the current waveform can be reduced by the regenerative current
   from a coil that flows back to the power supply. Two CK cycles later, the regulator exits fast decay mode and
   enters Charge mode. (The fast-decay time, which is specified herein as two CK cycles, varies depending on
   the mode setting. A detailed description of the mode setting is provided in the Current Decay Mode section.)
   When VRF reaches the reference voltage (Vref), the regulator enters Discharge mode. Four CK cycles later,
   the regulator exits Discharge mode and enters Charge mode. If VRF > Vref when it enters Charge mode,
   however, it then reenters Discharge mode. Four CK cycles later, VRF is again compared against Vref. If
   VRF < Vref, the regulator remains in Charge mode until VRF reaches Vref.

3. Changing the Predefined Current to the Higher Value
   Even when the Vref voltage is increased, the regulator remains in Discharge mode for four CK cycles and
   then enters Charge mode. During acceleration, the current decays only in slow-decay mode.

   If no distortion can be observed in the output current waveform, the DCY pin should be kept High. The distortion
reduction depends on the motor characteristics. If any distortion can be observed, the DCY pin should be kept Low.
Also, it should be ensured that the DCY input is set High only when the coil of a motor has an inductance of 1.5 mH
or higher where fosc is no less than 100 kHz.
Thermal Shutdown (TSD) Circuit
   The TB6608FNG includes a thermal shutdown circuit, which turns the output transistors off when the junction
temperature (Tj) exceeds 160°C (typ.).
   The output transistors are automatically turned on when Tj cools past the shutdown threshold, which is lowered
by a hysteresis of 40°C.
        TSD = 160°C (design target value)
        ∆TSD = 40°C (design target value)
   * In thermal shutdown mode, the internal circuitry and outputs assume the same states as in Enable Wait mode.
       Upon exit from thermal shutdown mode, they revert to those states which they assume when taken out of

Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) Circuit
  The TB6608FNG includes an undervoltage lockout circuit, which puts the output transistors in the
high-impedance state when VCC decreases to 2.0 V (typ.) or lower.
  The output transistors are automatically turned on when VCC increases past the lockout threshold, which is
raised to 2.03 V by a hysteresis of 0.03 V.
  Even when UVLO circuit is tripped, internal circuitry continues to operate in accordance with the CK input like
when ENABLE is set Low. Thus, after the TB6608FNG exits the UVLO mode, the RESET signal should be asserted
for putting the TB6608FNG in the Initial state if necessary.

   Note 1: Capacitors for the power supply lines should be connected as close to the IC as possible.
   Note 2: The STBY pin must be set Low upon powering on and off the device. Otherwise, a large current might
           abruptly flow through the output pins.
           Also, at the power-on, VM must be applied after applying VCC. At the power-off, VCC must be turned off after
           turning off VM.
Usage Considerations
  A large current might abruptly flow through the IC in case of a short-circuit across its outputs, a short-circuit to
power supply or a short-circuit to ground, leading to a damage of the IC. Also, the IC or peripheral parts may be
permanently damaged or emit smoke or fire resulting in injury especially if a power supply pin (VCC, VM) or an
output pin (AO1, AO2, BO1, BO2) is short-circuited to adjacent or any other pins.
  These possibilities should be fully considered in the design of the output, VCC, VM and ground lines.
  Install this IC correctly. If not, (e.g., installing it in the wrong position,) the IC may be damaged permanently.
  Fuses should be connected to the power supply lines.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on Handling of ICs
      (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
           exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
           Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
           injury by explosion or combustion.
      (2)  Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in case
           of over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed
           its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise
           occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can
           lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case of breakdown,
           appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are required.
      (3)  If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
           design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
           current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
           IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
           Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable,
           the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury,
           smoke or ignition.
      (4)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
           Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
           Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
           exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
           injury by explosion or combustion.
           In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation or
           incorrectly even just one time.
                                                        28                                           2014-10-01


                                                                                               TB6608FNG
Points to Remember on Handling of ICs
   (1)  Thermal Shutdown Circuit
        Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal
        shutdown circuits operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
        Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings
        can cause the thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
   (2)  Heat Radiation Design
        In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device
        so that heat is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any
        time and condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation
        design can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition,
        please design the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral
        components.
   (3)  Back-EMF
        When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the
        motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply
        is small, the device’s motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond
        maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system
        design.
