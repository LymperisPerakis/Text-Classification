Application Notes
  All the grounding wires of the TB67S261 must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated
  at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
  Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD(VM) and GND traces, to avoid short circuits
  across output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently
  damaged.
  Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power
  supply pins (VM, RS, OUT, GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired
  incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
  The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current
  running through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

Calculation of the Predefined Output Current
For PWM constant-current control, this IC uses a clock generated by the OSCM oscillator.
The peak output current (Setting current value) can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RS) and the reference
voltage (Vref), as follows:
                                            Vref(V)
             Iout(max) = Vref(gain) ×
                                            RRS(Ω)
              Vref(gain) : the Vref decay rate is 1/ 5.0 (typ.)
For example : In the case of a 100% setup
when Vref = 3.0 V, Torque=100%,RS=0.51Ω, the motor constant current (Setting current value) will be
calculated as:
             Iout = 3.0V / 5.0 / 0.51Ω= 1.18 A
Calculation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (chopper reference frequency)
An approximation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopper frequency (fchop)
can be calculated by the following expressions.
fOSCM=1/[0.56x{Cx(R1+500)}]
                  ………C,R1: External components for OSCM (C=270pF , R1=5.1kΩ => fOSCM= 1.12MHz(Typ.))
fchop = fOSCM / 16
                  ………fOSCM=1.12MHz => fchop =About 70kHz
If chopping frequency is raised, Rippl of current will become small and wave-like reproducibility will improve. However, the
gate loss inside IC goes up and generation of heat becomes large.
By lowering chopping frequency, reduction in generation of heat is expectable. However, Rippl of current may become
large. It is a standard about about 70 kHz. A setup in the range of 50 to 100 kHz is recommended.

   Note 1: Usually, the maximum current value at the time should use 70% or less of the absolute maximum ratings for
            a standard on thermal rating. The maximum output current may be further limited in view of thermal
            considerations, depending on ambient temperature and board conditions.
   Note 2:   Device alone (Ta =25°C)
             When Ta exceeds 25°C, it is necessary to do the derating with 10.4mW/°C.
      Ta: Ambient temperature
      Topr: Ambient temperature while the IC is active
      Tj: Junction temperature while the IC is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the thermal
         shutdown (TSD) circuitry. It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that the
         maximum junction temperature, Tj (MAX), will not exceed 120°C.
Caution)Absolute maximum ratings
        The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even
        for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
        Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
        explosion or combustion.
        The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
        circumstances. The TB67S261FTG does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is
        damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
        All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations
        described later should also be referred to.

Note: VIN (H) is defined as the VIN voltage that causes the outputs (OUTA,OUTB) to change when a pin under test
is gradually raised from 0 V. VIN (L) is defined as the VIN voltage that causes the outputs (OUTA, OUTB) to change
when the pin is then gradually lowered from 5V. The difference between VIN (H) and VIN (L) is defined as the VIN
(HYS).
Note: When the logic signal is applied to the device whilst the VM power supply is not asserted; the device is
designed not to function, but for safe usage, please apply the logic signal after the VM power supply is asserted and
the VM voltage reaches the proper operating range.

              threshold (Note2)
Note1: About TSD
When the junction temperature of the device reached the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit
then turns off the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection. Once the TSD circuit is
triggered, the device will be set to standby mode, and can be cleared by reasserting the VM power source, or setting the
DMODE pins to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error, therefore is not
recommended to be used aggressively.
Note2: About ISD
When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit then turns off the output
transistors. Once the ISD circuit is triggered, the device keeps the output off until power-on reset (POR), is reasserted or the device is
set to standby mode by DMODE pins. For fail-safe, please insert a fuse to avoid secondary trouble.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the
motor current recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might
rise above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
characteristics.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an
output short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device
may be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a
condition persists for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be
removed immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

IC Usage Considerations
    Notes on handling of ICs
          (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
                even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
                breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
          (2)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
                terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
                Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
                exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
                injury by explosion or combustion.
                In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
                applied even just once.
          (3) Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
                case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
                exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
                pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
                breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the
                case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit
                location, are required.
          (4)    If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
                design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
                current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
                IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
                protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing
                IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
           (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
               components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
               If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback condenser, the IC
               output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
               withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
               smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
               (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
 Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
 circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
 immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
 depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after
 operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
 Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
 operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 thermal shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
 When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
 appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time or under any
 condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
 decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
 into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
 When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
 supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s
 motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To
 avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
