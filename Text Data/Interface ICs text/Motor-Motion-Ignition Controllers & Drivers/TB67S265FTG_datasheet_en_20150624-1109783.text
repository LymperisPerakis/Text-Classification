Application Notes
All the grounding wires of the TB67S265 must run on the solder mask on the PCB, and be externally connected at a
single point. Also, the grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across
output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently damaged.
Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power
supply pins (VM, RS, OUT, GND) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired
incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running
through the IC that is larger than the specified current.

Function explanation (Stepping motor mode)
The motor current is defined as plus when the current flows from OUT_X+              to OUT_X-, and defined minus when the
current flows from OUT_X-     to OUT_X+.

    Note 1: Usually the maximum current value should be controlled below 70%(IOUT≦1.4A) or less of the absolute
            maximum ratings for a standard based on thermal rating. The maximum output current may be further limited
            due to thermal considerations, depending on ambient temperature and board conditions.
    Note 2: Device alone. (Ta =25°C)
             If the ambient temperature is above 25°C, the power dissipation must be de-rated by 10.4mW/°C.
    Ta: Ambient temperature
    TOPR : Ambient temperature while the device is active
    Tj: Junction temperature while the device is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the thermal
            shutdown(TSD) circuitry. It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that the maximum
            junction temperature, Tj(max), will not exceed 120°C.
Caution) Absolute maximum ratings
          The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
          even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
          Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
          injury by explosion or combustion.
          The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under
          any circumstances. The device does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is
          damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
          All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and
          considerations described later should also be referred to.

(Note 1) About Thermal shutdown (TSD)
When the junction temperature of the device reaches the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit is triggered; the internal
reset circuit then turns off the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection.
Once the TSD circuit is triggered; the detect latch signal can be cleared by reasserting the VM power source, or
setting the device to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error, therefore
is not recommended to be used aggressively.
(Note 2) About Over-current detection (ISD)
When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit then turns
off the output transistors. In order to avoid malfunction due to the switching, IC have a dead time. Once the ISD circuit is
triggered, the detect latch signal can be cleared by reasserting
the VM power source, or setting the device to standby mode. For fail-safe, please insert a fuse to avoid secondary
trouble.
Back-EMF
While the motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the
motor current recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might
rise above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
characteristics. It must be fully verified that there is no risk that the device or other components will
be damaged or fail due to the motor back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an
output short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device
may be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such condition
persists for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed
immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

                                                                                                     TB67S265FTG
Calculation of the Predefined Output Current
For PWM constant-current control, this IC uses a clock generated by the OSCM oscillator.
The peak output current (Peak current) can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RS) and the reference voltage
(Vref), as follows:
                                            Vref(V)
             IOUT(max) = Vref(gain) ×
                                            RRS(Ω)
              Vref(gain) : the Vref decay rate is 1/ 5.0 (typ.)
For example : In the case of a 100% setup
when Vref = 3.0 V, Torque=100%,RS=0.51Ω, the motor constant current (Peak current) will be
calculated as:
             IOUT = 3.0V / 5.0 / 0.51Ω= 1.18 A
Calculation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (chopper reference frequency)
An approximation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopper frequency (fchop)
can be calculated by the following expressions.
fOSCM=1/[0.56x{Cx(R1+500)}]
                  ………C,R1: External components for OSCM (C=270pF , R1=5.1kΩ => fOSCM= 1.12MHz(Typ.))
fchop = fOSCM / 16
                  ………fOSCM=1.12MHz => fchop =About 70kHz
If chopping frequency is raised, Rippl of current will become small and wave-like reproducibility will improve. However, the
gate loss inside IC goes up and generation of heat becomes large.
By lowering chopping frequency, reduction in generation of heat is expectable. However, Rippl of current may become
large. It is a standard about about 70 kHz. A setup in the range of 50 to 100 kHz is recommended.
                                                                18                                             2015-6-24


                                                                                               TB67S265FTG
 Power consumption of the IC
Power of the IC is consumed by the transistor of the output block and that of the logic block mainly.
Power consumption of the motor output block
Power of the output block (P(out)) is consumed by MOSFET of upper and lower H-Bridge.
P(out) =Number of H-Bridge × IOUT (A) × VDS (V) = 2 (ch) × IOUT (A) × IOUT (A) × Ron (Ω)……….(1)
When the current waveform of the motor output corresponds to the ideal waveform, average power of output block
can be provided as follows;
When Ron = 0.6Ω, IOUT (peak: Max) = 1.0 A, VM = 24 V
P(out) = 2 (ch) × 1.0 (A) × 1.0 (A) × 0.6 (Ω)…………………………………………………......(2)
= 1.2(W)
Power consumption of logic and IM systems.
Power consumptions of logic and IM systems are calculated by separating the states (operating and stopping).
I (IM3) = 5.5 mA (typ.)          : Operating
I (IM2) = 3.5 mA (typ.)          : Stopping
Output system is connected to VM (24V). (Output system: Current consumed by the circuit connected to VM +
Current consumed by switching output steps)
Power consumption is calculated as follows;
P (IM) = 24 (V) × 0.0055 (A)……………………………………………………………………….(3)
= 0.132 (W)
Power consumption
Total power consumption P(total) is calculated from the values of formula (2) and (3).
P(total) = P(out) + P (IM) = 1.2+ 0.132 = 1.332(W)
Standby mode is released. The power consumption in non-operation mode of the motor (waiting
  mode) is calculated as follows;
              P(standby) = 24 (V) × 0.0035 (A) = 0.084 (W)
Refer to the above equations, evaluate the heat design of the board by the actual board enough, and
  configure the appropriate margin.

IC Usage Considerations
    Notes on handling of ICs
          (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
                even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
                breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
          (2)
               Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
                case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
                exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
                pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
                breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the
                case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit
                location, are required.
          (3)    If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
                design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
                current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
                IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
                protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing
                IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
          (4)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
                terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
                Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
                exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
                injury by explosion or combustion.
                In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
                applied even just once.
           (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
               components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
               If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback capacitor, the IC
               output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
               withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
               smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
               (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
 Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
 circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
 immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
 depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after
 operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
 Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
 operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 thermal shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
 When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
 appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time or under any
 condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
 decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
 into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
 When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
 supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s
 motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To
 avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
