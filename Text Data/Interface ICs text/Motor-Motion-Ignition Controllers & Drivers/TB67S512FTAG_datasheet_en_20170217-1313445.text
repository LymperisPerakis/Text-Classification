Note:
  All the grounding wires of the TB67S512FTAG should run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally
   terminated at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
  Utmost care is necessary in the design of the output, VM, and GND lines since the IC may be destroyed by
   short-circuiting between outputs, or by short-circuiting to the power supply or ground. Especially, if power supply
   pins (VM, RS, OUT, and GND), through which a particularly large current may run, are wired incorrectly, an
   operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
  Also, if logic input pins are wired incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
  In this case, the IC may be destroyed because over rating current flows. Pay enough attention in designing
   patterns and mounting the IC.

Function description (Stepping motor modes)
1. CLK Function
Each electrical angle is shifted every CLK signal. Each CLK signal is reflected at the up-edge.
          CLK Input                                                      Function
              ↑                                Electrical angle is shifted to the next step at the up-edge
              ↓                                     (State of the electrical angle does not change.)
2. ENABLE function
The ENABLE pin controls ON and OFF of the driving current during the stepping motor operation. The OFF mode
(High impedance) and the ON mode can be switched by controlling this pin. Please set the ENABLE pin to ‘L’ during
VM power-on and power-off sequence.
       ENABLE Input                                                      Function
              H                                        Output transistor = ON (Normal operation)
              L                                        Output transistor = OFF (High impedance)
3. CW/CCW function and the output pin function (Output logic in starting charge)
The CW/CCW pin controls the rotation direction of the stepping motor. When set to ‘Clockwise’, the current of channel
A is outputted first, with a phase difference of 90°. When set to ‘Counter clockwise”, the current of channel B is
outputted first with a phase difference of 90°.

Calculation of setting current
This IC drives a motor by controlling the PWM constant current with the base of the OSCM oscillating frequency.
The peak output current (Setting current) can be determined by the current-sensing resistor (RS) and the reference
voltage (Vref) as follows;
                                        Vref (V)
       IOUT (max) = Vref (gain) x
                                        RRS (Ω)
            Vref (gain): Vref decay rate = 1/ 5.0 (typ.)

        When Vref = 3.0 V, Torque = 100%, and RS = 0.51 Ω, the constant output current (peak current) of the motor is
        calculated as follows;
        Iout = 3.0 V / 5.0 / 0.51 Ω = 1.18 A
Calculation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (chopper reference frequency)
An approximation of the OSCM oscillation frequency (fOSCM) and chopping frequency (fchop) can be calculated by
the following formula.
       fOSCM = 1/ [0.56 × {Cx (R1+500)}]
       *C and R1: External constant number for OSCM (When C = 270 pF and R1 = 3.6 kΩ, fOSCM = 1.6 MHz (typ.))
       fchop = fOSCM / 16
       *When fOSCM = 1.6 MHz, fchop is approximately 100 kHz.
If chopping frequency is raised, the ripple of the current decreases and the waveform reproducibility is improved.
However, the gate loss inside IC becomes large and the heat generation increases.
By lowering chopping frequency, reduction of heat generation is expectable. However, the ripple of the current may
increase. Generally, a frequency of about 70 kHz is set as a reference value. A setup in the range of 50 to 100 kHz is
recommended.

 Note 1: The maximum current value in the normal operation should be set 70% or less of the absolute maximum
          ratings after thermal calculation. The maximum output current may be further limited in view of thermal
          considerations, depending on the ambient temperature and the board conditions.
 Note 2: Device alone (Ta = 25°C)
          When Ta exceeds 25°C, please correct the values by derating (10.4 mW/°C).
      Ta: Ambient temperature
      Topr: Ambient temperature while the IC is active
      Tj: Junction temperature while the IC is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the thermal
          shutdown (TSD) circuitry. It is recommended to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that the
          maximum junction temperature (Tj (max)) will not exceed 120°C.
Caution) Absolute maximum ratings
        The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even
        for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
        Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
        explosion or combustion.
        The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
        circumstances. The TB67S512FTAG does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is
        damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
        All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations
        described later should also be referred to.

              threshold (Note2)
Note 1: Thermal shutdown circuit (TSD)
When the junction temperature of the device reaches the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit is triggered; the internal
reset circuit then turns off the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection. Once
the TSD circuit is triggered, the device will be set to standby mode, and can be cleared by reasserting the VM power
source, or setting the DMODE pins to standby mode. The TSD circuit is a backup function to detect a thermal error,
therefore is not recommended to be used aggressively.
Note 2: Over current detection (ISD)
When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit is triggered; the internal reset circuit then turns off
the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is built-in to avoid misdetection occurred by switching. Once the
ISD circuit is triggered, the device keeps the output off until power-on reset (POR), is reasserted or the device is set to
standby mode by DMODE pins. For fail-safe, please insert a fuse to avoid secondary trouble.
Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor
current recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise
above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
characteristics.
Cautions on Overcurrent detection (ISD) and Thermal shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an
output short-circuits; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device
may be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a condition
persists for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed
immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
        (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded,
               even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device
               breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
        (2)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
               terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
               Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and exceeding
               the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by
               explosion or combustion.
               In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
               applied even just once.
        (3)  Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
               case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
               exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse
               noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can
               lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the case of breakdown,
               appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are required.
        (4)     If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
               design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
               current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
               IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
               protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing IC
               breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
         (5)   Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
                components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
                If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback capacitor, the IC
                output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
                withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
                smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
                (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
 Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
 circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
 immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
 depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after operation,
 the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
 Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
 operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the thermal
 shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
 When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
 appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time or under any
 condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
 decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
 into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
 When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
 supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor
 power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this
 problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
