Functional Descriptions
  1. Excitation Mode Settings
       The excitation mode can be selected from the following four modes using the M1 and M2 inputs. (The
       2-phase excitation mode is selected by default since both M1 and M2 have internal pull-down resistors.)

  2. Function Table (Relationship Between Inputs and Output Modes)
       When the ENABLE pin is Low, outputs are off. When the RESET pin is Low, the outputs are put in the
       Initial mode as shown in the table below. In this mode, the states of the CLK and CW/CCW pins are
       don’t-cares.

  3. Initial Mode
       When RESET is asserted, phase currents in each excitation mode are as follows. At this time, the MO pin
       goes Low (open-drain connection).
   Excitation Mode    A-Phase Current  B-Phase Current
      2-phase              100 %           −100 %

    2W1-2-phase            100 %             0%
    4W1-2-phase            100 %             0%
  4. Decay Mode Settings
       It takes approximately four OSC cycles for discharging a current in PWM mode. The 25 % decay mode is
       created by inducing decay during the last cycle in Fast Decay mode; the 50 % Decay mode is created by
       inducing decay during the last two cycles in Fast Decay mode; and the 100 % Decay mode is created by
       inducing decay during all four cycles in Fast Decay mode.
       Since the DCY1 and DCY2 pins have internal pull-down resistors, the Normal mode is selected when DCY1
       and DCY2 are undriven.

5. Torque Settings (Current Value)
    The ratio of the current necessary for actual operations to the predefined current adjusted by an external
    resistor can be selected as follows. The Weak Excitation mode should be selected to set a torque extremely
    low like when the motor is at a fixed position.
    Since the TQ2 and TQ1 pins have pull-down resistors, the 100 % torque setting is selected when TQ2 and
    TQ1 are undriven.
      TQ2                 TQ1                  Current Ratio

6. Calculation of the Predefined Output Current
    To perform a constant current drive, the reference current should be adjusted by an external resistor.
    Charging stops when the NFA (NFB) voltage reaches 0.5 V (when the torque setting is 100 %) so that a
    current does not exceed the predefined level.
    IOUT (A) = 0.5 (V) / RNF (Ω)
         Example: To set the peak current to 1 A, the value of an external resistor should be 0.5 Ω.
7. Protect and MO Output Pins
    These are open-drain outputs. An external pull-up resistor should be added to these pins when in use.
    If the TSD circuit is activated, Protect is driven Low. When the IC enters the Initial state, MO is driven
    Low.

8. Adjusting the External Capacitor Value (COSC) and Minimum Clock Pulse Width
    (tW(CLK))
    A triangular-wave is generated internally by CR oscillation. The capacitor is externally connected to the
    OSC pin. The recommended capacitor value is between 100 pF and 1000 pF.
    Approximate equation: fOSC = 1/{ COSC × 1.5 × (10/ COSC + 1)/66} × 1000 kHz
    (Since this is an approximation formula, the calculation result may not be exactly equal to the actual
    value.)
    The approximate values are shown below.
    The minimum clock pulse width (tW(CLK)) corresponds to the external capacitor (COSC ) as follows:
   Capacitor           Oscillating Frequency       Minimum Clock Pulse Width tW(CLK) (Note 1)
    1000 pF                    44 kHz                               90 μs (Note 2)
     330 pF                   130 kHz                                    30 μs
     100 pF                   400 kHz                               10 μs (Note 2)
Note 1: When the frequency of an input clock signal is high, the COSC value should be small so that the duty cycle
          of an input clock pulse does not become extremely high (should be around 50 % or lower).
Note 2: Not tested in production.

    Setting the ENABLE signal Low disables only the output signals, while internal circuitry other than the
 output block continues to operate in accordance with the CLK input. Therefore, when the ENABLE signal goes
 High again, the output current generation is restarted as if phases proceeded with the CLK signal.

    Setting the RESET signal Low causes the outputs to be put in the Initial state and the MO output to be
 driven Low (Initial state: A-channel output current is at its peak (100 %)).
    When the RESET signal goes High again, the output current generation is restarted at the next rising edge
 of CLK with the state following the Initial state.

  It is recommended that the state of the M1 and M2 pins be changed after setting the RESET signal Low
during the Initial state (MO = Low). Even when the MO signal is Low, changing the M1 and M2 signals without
setting the RESET signal Low may cause a discontinuity in the current waveform.

9. Current Waveforms and Mixed Decay Mode Settings
     The current decay rate of the Decay mode operation can be determined by the DCY1 and DCY2 inputs for
     constant-current control.
     The “NF” refers to the point at which the output current reaches its predefined current level, and the
     “RNF” refers to the monitoring timing of the predefined current.
     The smaller the MDT value, the smaller the current ripple amplitude. However, the current decay rate
     decreases.

          During Mixed Decay and Fast Decay modes, if the predefined current level is less than the output
        current at the RNF (current monitoring point), the Charge mode in the next chopping cycle will
        disappear (though the current control mode is briefly switched to Charge mode in actual operations for
        current sensing) and the current is controlled in Slow and Fast Decay modes (mode switching from Slow
        Decay mode to Fast Decay mode at the MDT point).
Note: The above figures are rough illustration of the output current. In actual current waveforms, transient response
        curves can be observed.

                                    The CR counter is reset here.
    When the CLK signal is asserted, the Chopping Counter (OSC Counter) is forced to reset at the next rising
    edge of the OSC signal.
    As a result, the response to input data is faster compared to methods in which the counter is not reset.
    The delay time that is theoretically determined by the logic circuit is one OSC cycle = 10 μs at a 100-kHz
    chopping rate.
    After the OSC Counter is reset by the CLK signal input, the current control mode is invariably switched to
    Charge mode briefly for current sensing.
    Note: Even in Fast Decay mode, the current control mode is invariably switched to Charge mode briefly for
           current sensing.

   As shown in the figure above, output transistors have parasitic diodes.
   Normally, when the energy of the coil is discharged, each transistor is turned on allowing the current to flow in
the reverse direction to that in normal operation; as a result, the parasitic diodes are not used. However, when all
the output transistors are forced off, the coil energy is discharged via the parasitic diodes.

OSC-Charge DELAY:
    The OSC waveform is converted into the internal OSC waveform by checking the level of a chopping wave.
  The internal OSC signal is designed to be logic High when the OSC voltage is at 2 V or above, and to be logic
  Low when the OSC voltage is at 0.5 V or below. However, there is a response delay and that there occurs a
  peak-to-peak voltage variation.

1. Power-on Sequence with Control Input Signals
   Turn on VDD. Then, when the VDD voltage has stabilized, turn on VMA/B.
   Hold the control input pins Low while turning on VDD and VMA/B.
   (All the control input pins are internally pulled down.)
   After VDD and VMA/B completely stabilizes at the rated voltages, the RESET and ENABLE pins can be
   set High. If this sequence is not properly followed, the IC may not operate correctly, or the IC and the
   peripheral parts may be damaged.
   When RESET is released High, the CLK signal is applied and excitation is started. Only after ENABLE
   is also set High, outputs are enabled. When only RESET is set High, outputs are disabled and only the
   internal counter advances. Likewise, when only ENABLE is set High, the excitation will not be performed
   even if the CLK signal is applied and the outputs will remain in the initial state.
   An example of a control input sequence is shown below.
   A power-off sequence should be the reverse of this sequence.

2. Power Dissipation
   The power dissipation of the IC can be calculated by the following equation:
   P = VDD × IDD + IOUT × IOUT × Ron × 2 phases
   The higher the ambient temperature, the smaller the power dissipation.
   Examine the PD-Ta characteristic curve to determine if there is a sufficient margin in the thermal design.
3. Treatment of Heat-Radiating Fin
   The heat-radiating fin pins of the TB6560AFTG (backside) are electrically connected to the backside of the
   die. Thus, if a current flows to the fin, the IC may malfunction. If there is any possibility of a voltage being
   generated between grounds and the fin, the fin pins should either be connected to ground or insulated.
4. Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
   When the die temperature reaches 170°C (typ.), the thermal shutdown circuit is tripped, switching the
   outputs to off. There is a variation of about ±20°C in the temperature at which the thermal shutdown
   circuit is tripped.

   Note: Capacitors for the power supply lines should be connected as close to the IC as possible.
Usage Considerations
          • A large current might abruptly flow through the IC in case of a short-circuit across its outputs, a short-circuit
              to power supply or a short-circuit to ground, leading to a damage of the IC. Also, the IC or peripheral parts
              may be permanently damaged or emit smoke or fire resulting in injury especially if a power supply pin
              (VDD, VMA, VMB) or an output pin (OUT_AP, OUT_AM, OUT_BP, OUT_BM) is short-circuited to adjacent
              or any other pins. These possibilities should be fully considered in the design of the output, VDD, VM, and
              ground lines.
          • A fuse should be connected to the power supply line. The rated maximum current of the TB6560AFTG is
              2.5 A/phase. Considering those maximum ratings, an appropriate fuse must be selected depending on
              operating conditions of a motor to be used. Toshiba recommends that a fast-blow fuse be used.
          • The power-on sequence described on page 28 must be properly followed.
          • If a voltage outside the operating range specified on page 6 (4.5 ≤ VDD ≤ 5.5, 4.5 ≤ VMA/B ≤ 34,
              VDD ≤ VMA/B) is applied, the IC may not operate properly or the IC and peripheral parts may be
              permanently damaged. Ensure that the voltage range does not exceed the upper and lower limits of the
              specified range.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on Handling of ICs
      (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
           exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
           Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
           injury by explosion or combustion.
      (2)  Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in
           case of over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
           exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
           pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
           breakdown can lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case of
           breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are
           required.
      (3)  If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
           design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
           current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
           IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
           Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable,
           the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury,
           smoke or ignition.
      (4)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
           Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
           Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
           exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
           injury by explosion or combustion.
           In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation
           or incorrectly even just one time.
                                                        31                                           2011-05-23


                                                                                             TB6560AFTG
Points to Remember on Handling of ICs
   (1)  Thermal Shutdown Circuit
        Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal
        shutdown circuits operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status
        immediately.
        Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings
        can cause the thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
   (2)  Heat Radiation Design
        In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the
        device so that heat is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at
        any time and condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat
        radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In
        addition, please design the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation with
        peripheral components.
   (3)  Back-EMF
        When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to
        the motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power
        supply is small, the device’s motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions
        beyond maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in
        system design.
   (4)  Short-Circuits
        The IC may be permanently damaged in case of a short-circuit across its outputs, a short-circuit to
        power supply or a short-circuit to ground. These possibilities should be fully considered in the design
        of the output, VDD, VM and ground lines.
