         Functional blocks/circuits/constants in the block chart etc. may be omitted or simplified for explanatory purposes.
Note: All the grounding wires of the TB67S508FTG should run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated
       at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
       Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across output
       pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently damaged.
       Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power
       supply pins (VM, OUT_A+, OUT_A-, OUT_B+, OUT_B-, GND, and MGND) through which a particularly large
       current may run. If these pins are wired incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
       The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running
       through the IC that is larger than the specified current.
       Careful attention should be paid to design patterns and mountings.

                 ↓                                            - (State of the electrical angle does not change.)
ENABLE function
The ENABLE pin controls the ON and OFF of the corresponding output stage. Normal constant current control starts by turning
on the motor operation. MOSFET is turned off and the output state becomes high impedance by turning off the motor operation.
            ENABLE                                                                 Function

                 L                                    Output MOSFET: OFF (Operation OFF, High impedance)
CW/CCW function
The CW/CCW pin controls the rotation direction of the motor.
            CW/CCW                                                                 Function

Function of DMODE1 and DMODE2
The DMODE pins switch the step resolution. The operation moves to the standby mode by setting DMODE1 and DMODE2
pins ”L”. The operation can resume from the forced off mode, which is configured by the thermal shutdown detection (TSD) and
the over current detection (ISD), by setting standby mode once and then setting the normal operation mode again.

CC pin (Internal regulator monitor pin)
  CC pin is a connect pin of the coupling capacitor for the internal regulator. Please connect the capacitor of 0.1μF
  or more as close to the CC pin as possible.
  CC pin can be applied as a power supply for the connection, where the pull-up resistor of MO pin is connected. In
  case of applying CC pin as a 5 V-power supply, the usage current (external load current) is recommended to be
  5.0 mA or less. And the current limiter is built in to limit the current when the motor drive output is short to the
  ground.

Thermal shutdown detection (Latch type: Operation state before detection is maintained.)
This function turns off the IC operation temporarily when the over heat of the device is detected. It has a dead band time to avoid
error detection occurred by the external noise. All DMOS are turned off after the energy of the motor coil is discharged.
Therefore, outputs are turned off after the current is regenerated by the synchronous rectification control. When over heat is
detected, all channels are turned off.

Over current detection (Latch type: Operation state before detection is maintained.)
This function turns off the IC operation temporarily when the short-circuiting between outputs and the short-circuiting to the
power supply or ground occur. It has a dead band time to avoid error detection occurred by the spike current which generates in
switching and the external noise. All DMOS are turned off after the energy of the motor coil is discharged. Therefore, outputs are
turned off after the current is regenerated by the synchronous rectification control. When over current is detected, not only the
corresponding channels but both channels are turned off.

Note1: The maximum current value in normal operation should be kept 2.8 A or less per phase after calculating heat generation.
          The maximum output current may be further limited in view of the thermal considerations, depending on the ambient
          temperature and board conditions.
Note2: Based on JEDEC standard 4-layer PCB (Ta = 25°C)
          When Ta exceeds 25°C, derating with 34.4mW/°C is necessary.
      Ta        : Ambient temperature of the IC
      Topr      : Ambient temperature while the IC is active.
      Tj        : Junction temperature while the IC is active. The maximum junction temperature is limited by the thermal
                  shutdown circuit (TSD).
         It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a certain level so that the maximum junction temperature, Tj (MAX),
         will not exceed 120°C.
       Absolute maximum ratings
       The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
       moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
       Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or
       combustion. The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any
       circumstances. The TB67S508FTG does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is damaged if a
       voltage exceeding its rated maximum is applied.
       All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and considerations described
       later should also be referred to.

  Note1: Slew rate in the range of 0 V to 10 V: 1 ms or more is recommended.
  Note2: The actual maximum current may be limited by the operating environment (operating conditions such as exciting
              mode and operating time, or by the surrounding temperature or board heat dissipation). Determine a realistic
              maximum current by calculating the heat generated under the operating environment.

Back-EMF
While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor current
recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above the
rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must be fully
verified that there is no risk that the TB67S508FTG or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an output
short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device may be
damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a condition persists for a
long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be removed immediately by external
hardware.
IC Mounting
Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or deterioration of
the device.

 Constant PWM Control
 ADMD (Advanced Dynamic Mixed Decay) Control
 ADMD control adjusts the regeneration amount of the power supply by monitoring the charge current, which flows from the
 power supply to the motor, and the regeneration current, which flows from the motor to the power supply. Then, the motor is
 controlled efficiently.
 Sequence of ADMD control is shown in the below timing chart.
 Sequence: Charge mode → NF detection → Fast mode → ADMDth detection → Slow mode → fCHOP1 cycle → Charge mode

 Each filter is attached in order to avoid current-detection error caused by the external noise, etc. (Shown in below figure.)
 L value of the motor to be used is small, and when the current value reaches ADMDth (ADMD current value) within the
 ADMDtblank period, it changes to Slow operation after progress during the ADMDtblank. In this case, the ADMD current value
 (ADMDth) becomes smaller than ‘’setting current value (NFth) x 0.95 (typ.)’’.

   When the motor current value does not reach the threshold (NFth) during 1 cycle of the chopping frequency (fCHOP), the Charge

Setting Current Value (IOUT)
The setting current value in the PWM constant-current control mode is determined by the reference voltage (VREF) as follows;
The current value to be set can be calculated by the following formula.
IOUT = VREF × 0.833
Ex.) When VREF = 2.0 V, IOUT = 1.67 A
Chopping Frequency (fCHOP)
Chopping frequency of the constant current control can be configured by the resistor (ROSC) connected to OSCM pin. The IC
can operate by the fixed chopping frequency without attaching the external part to OSCM pin.
                                                    OSCM pin
                                                                              ROSC
       The equivalent circuit diagrams may be simplified or some parts of them may be omitted for explanatory purposes.
Chopping frequency (fCHOP) is calculated from below formula.
Generally, a standard frequency is approximately 70 kHz. A setup in the range of 40 to 100 kHz is recommended.
fCHOP = fOSCM / 16
                   -12
fOSCM =1 / (90.9x10 x ROSC)
Ex.): When ROSC=10 kΩ, fOSCM=1.1 MHz (typ.), fCHOP=68.8 kHz (typ.)
Under the condition that OSCM pin is open or connected to the GND, the IC operates by the frequency generated automatically
(fOSCM2=1.080 MHz (typ.), fCHOP=67.5 kHz (typ.)).

Power consumption of the IC
  Power of the IC is consumed by the transistor of the output block and that of the logic block mainly.
1. Power consumption of the power transistor
  Power of the output block is consumed by the upper and lower MOSFET of the H-Bridge.
  Power consumption of the upper or lower transistor of the H-Bridge is calculated from below formula.
                                                 2
      P (out) = Iout (A) × VDS (V) = Iout (A) × Ron (Ω) ................................................................................. (1)
  When the current waveform of the motor output corresponds to the ideal square waveform in the full-step resolution, average
power of output block can be provided as follows
      When Ron = 0.45 Ω, Iout (peak: Max) = 1.0 A, and VM = 24 V,
                                2
      P (out) = 2 (Tr) × 1.0 (A) × 0.45(Ω) .......................................................................................................(2)
               = 0.9(W)
2. Power consumption of logic and IM systems
   Power consumptions of logic and IM systems are calculated by separating the states (operating and stopping).
      I (IM3) = 7 mA (typ.)               : Operating/axis
      I (IM2) = 4 mA (typ.)               : Stopping/axis
      I (IM1) = 2 mA (typ.)              : Standby/axis
  Output system is connected to VM (24V). (Output system: Current consumed by the circuit connected to VM + Current
consumed by switching output steps)
  Power consumption is calculated as follows;
      P (IM3) = 24 (V) × 0.007 (A) .................................................................................................................. (3)
               = 0.17 (W)
3. Power consumption
  Total power consumption P (total) is calculated from the results of ‘1’ and ’2’ above.
      P = P (out) + P (IM3) = 1.07(W)
  Power consumption of 1 axle in standby mode is as follows;
      P (Standby mode) = 24 (V) × 0.002 (A) = 0.048 (W)

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
[1] The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a moment.
     Do not exceed any of these ratings.
      Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result injury by explosion or
      combustion.
[2] Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
      Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
      Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and exceeding the rating(s) may
      cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result injury by explosion or combustion.
      In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation or incorrectly even just
      one time.
[3] Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in case of over current and/or
     IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the
     wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to
     continuously flow and the breakdown can lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in
     case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are required.
[4] If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the design to prevent
     device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush current at power ON or the negative
     current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
      Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function
      may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
[5] Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load components (such as
     speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
     If there is a large amount of leakage current such as input or negative feedback condenser, the IC output DC voltage will
     increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure can
     cause smoke or ignition. (The over current can cause smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention
     when using a Bridge Tied Load (BTL) connection type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.
                                                                 31                                                  2017-03-01


                                                                                                                TB67S508FTG
Points to remember on handling of ICs
(1) Over current Protection Circuit
      Over current protection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances.
      If the over current protection circuits operate against the over current, clear the over current status immediately.
      Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can cause the over
      current protection circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation. In addition, depending on the method of
      use and usage conditions, if over current continues to flow for a long time after operation, the IC may generate heat
      resulting in breakdown.
(2) Thermal Shutdown Circuit
      Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits operate
      against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
      Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can cause the
      thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
(3) Heat Radiation Design
     In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device so that heat is
     appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time and condition. These ICs generate
     heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC
     characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, please design the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation
     with peripheral components.
(4) Back-EMF
      When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the motor’s power supply
      due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor power supply
      and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of
      back-EMF into consideration in system design.
                                                                    32                                                  2017-03-01
