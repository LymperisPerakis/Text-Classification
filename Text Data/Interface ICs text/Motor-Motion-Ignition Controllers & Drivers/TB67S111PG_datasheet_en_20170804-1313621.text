IC considerations
All the grounding wires of the device must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally terminated at only
one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VM and GND traces, to avoid short circuits across
output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short circuit occurs, the device may be permanently damaged.
Also, the utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the device since it has power
supply pins (VM, OUT, GND, etc.) through which a particularly large current may run. If these pins are wired
incorrectly, an operation error may occur or the device may be destroyed.
The logic input pins must also be wired correctly. Otherwise, the device may be damaged owing to a current running
through the IC that is larger than the specified current. Careful attention should be paid for IC pattern design and
mounting method.

Note 1: Standalone. When Ta exceeds 25°C, derating with 11.8 mW/°C is necessary.
Note 2: On PCB (size: 50 mm × 50 mm × 1.6 mm, Cu area: 50 %, single-side glass epoxy). When Ta exceeds 25°C,
        derating with 21.6 mW/°C is necessary.
Absolute maximum ratings
The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating (s) may cause device breakdown, damage or
deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion, including peripheral circuits and parts. The
value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any circumstances. The
device does not have overvoltage detection circuit. Therefore, the device is damaged if a voltage exceeding its rated
maximum is applied. All voltage ratings, including supply voltages, must always be followed. The other notes and
considerations described later should also be referred to.

Note 1: Thermal shutdown (TSD)
        When the junction temperature of the IC reaches the TSD threshold, the TSD circuit operates and turns off
        the output transistors. Noise rejection blanking time is provided to avoid misdetection by switching. The IC
        operation recovers automatically after specified recovery time passes. The TSD circuit is a backup function to
        detect a thermal error, therefore it is not recommended to be used aggressively.
Note 2: Over-current detection (ISD)
        When the output current reaches the threshold, the ISD circuit operates and turns off the output transistors.
        Noise rejection blanking time is provided to avoid misdetection by switching. The IC operation recovers
        automatically after specified recovery time passes.

  Cautions on over current detection (ISD) and thermal shutdown detection (TSD)
  The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an
  output short-circuits; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety. If the device is used beyond the
  specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device may be damaged due to an
  output short-circuit. The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output
  short-circuit. If such condition persists for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent
  conditions must be removed immediately by external hardware.
  Back-EMF
  While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the motor
  current recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF. If the power supply does not
  have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might rise above the rated voltages. The
  magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor characteristics. It must be fully verified
  that there is no risk that the device or other components will be damaged or fail due to the motor back-EMF.
  IC mounting
  Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
  deterioration of the device.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
        (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
             exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating(s) may cause
             device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
        (2)  Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the
             case of overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
             exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
             pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
             breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in the
             case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit
             location, are required.
        (3)  If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
             design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
             current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
             IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in
             protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing
             IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
        (4)  Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative
             terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
             Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
             exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result in
             injury by explosion or combustion.
             In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly to which current is
             applied even just once.
        (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load
             components (such as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator.
             If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input or negative feedback condenser, the IC
             output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
             withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may cause
             smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
             (BTL) connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.

Points to remember on handling of ICs
Overcurrent detection Circuit
 Overcurrent detection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under all
 circumstances. If the overcurrent detection circuits operate against the overcurrent, clear the overcurrent status
 immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 overcurrent detection circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown may occur before operation. In addition,
 depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if overcurrent continues to flow for a long time after
 operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
Thermal Shutdown Circuit
 Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown circuits
 operate against the over-temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
 Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, exceeding absolute maximum ratings may cause the
 thermal shutdown circuit to operate improperly or IC breakdown to occur before operation.
Heat Radiation Design
 When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
 appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at any time or under any
 condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to
 decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take
 into consideration the effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
Back-EMF
 When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power
 supply owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s
 motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To
 avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
