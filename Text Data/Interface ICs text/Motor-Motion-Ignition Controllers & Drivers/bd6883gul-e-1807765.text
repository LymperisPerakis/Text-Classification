             When the L voltage is applied the PS pin, the IC’s inside circuit stop, and when 0V applied, the circuit current became
             0μA(Typ.), especially.
             When the IC drive, serial input while the PS pin applied H voltage. (See the electrical characteristics; P.3, 4, 5/16)
    2) Control Input Pin
      （Ⅰ）IN pin (BD6883GUL, BH6453GUL)
             The IN pin is used to program and control the motor drive modes.
             (See the electrical characteristics; P3, 4/16, and the I/O Truth Table; P12/16)
      （Ⅱ）INA, INB, SEL pins (BD6886GUL, BD6369GUL)
             The INA and INB are used to program and control the motor drive modes.
             When the L voltage is applied to the SEL pin, the I/O logic can be set to EN (Enable)/IN mode, and when the H voltage is applied
             to the one, the I/O logic can be set to IN/IN mode. (See the electrical characteristics; P5/16, and the I/O Truth Table; P12/16)
    3) H-bridge and Half-bridge on the output stage (ALL series)
             Specify maximum current applied to the H-bridge and Half-bridge within the operating range, in consideration of power dissipation.

BD6883GUL,BH6453GUL,BD6886GUL,BD6369GUL                                                                       Technical Note
●Operation Notes
1)       Absolute maximum ratings
        Use of the IC in excess of absolute maximum ratings, such as the applied voltage (VCC, VM) or operating temperature
        range (Topr), may result in IC damage. Assumptions should not be made regarding the state of the IC (short mode or
        open mode) when such damage is suffered. A physical safety measure, such as a fuse, should be implemented when
        using the IC at times where the absolute maximum ratings may be exceeded.
2)       Storage temperature range (Tstg)
          As long as the IC is kept within this range, there should be no problems in the IC’s performance. Conversely, extreme
          temperature changes may result in poor IC performance, even if the changes are within the above range.
3)       Power supply and wiring
          Be sure to connect the power terminals outside the IC. Do not leave them open. Because a return current is
          generated by a counter electromotive force of the motor, take necessary measures such as putting a Capacitor
          between the power source and the ground as a passageway for the regenerative current. Be sure to connect a
          Capacitor of proper capacitance (0.1μF to 10μF) between the power source and the ground at the foot of the IC, and
          ensure that there is no problem in properties of electrolytic Capacitors such as decrease in capacitance at low
          temperatures. When the connected power source does not have enough current absorbing capability, there is a
          possibility that the voltage of the power source line increases by the regenerative current an exceeds the absolute
          maximum rating of this product and the peripheral circuits.
          Therefore, be sure to take physical safety measures such as putting a zener diode for a voltage clamp between the
          power source an the ground.
4)       Ground terminal and wiring
          The potential at GND terminals should be made the lowest under any operating conditions. Ensure that there are no
          terminals where the potentials are below the potential at GND terminals, including the transient phenomena. The
          motor ground terminals PGND, and the small signal ground terminal GND are not interconnected with one another
          inside the IC. It is recommended that you should isolate the large-current RNF pattern and PGND pattern from the
          small-signal GND pattern, and should establish a one-point grounding at a reference point of the set, to avoid
          fluctuation of small-signal GND voltages caused by voltage changes due to pattern wire resistances and large
          currents. Also prevent the voltage variation of the ground wiring patterns of external components. Use short and thick
          power source and ground wirings to ensure low impedance.
5)       Thermal design
          Use a proper thermal design that allows for a sufficient margin of the power dissipation (Pd) at actual operating
          conditions.
6)       Pin short and wrong direction assembly of the device.
          Use caution when positioning the IC for mounting on printed circuit boards. The IC may be damaged if there is any
          connection error or if positive and ground power supply terminals are reversed. The IC may also be damaged if pins
          are shorted together or are shorted to other circuit’s power lines.
7)       Avoiding strong magnetic field
          Malfunction may occur if the IC is used around a strong magnetic field.
8)       ASO
          Ensure that the output transistors of the motor driver are not driven under excess conditions of the absolute maximum
          ratings and ASO.
9)       TSD (Thermal Shut Down) circuit
          If the junction temperature (Tjmax) reaches 175°C (but the BH6453GUL is 150°C), the TSD circuit will operate, and
          the coil output circuit of the motor will open. There is a temperature hysterics of approximately 25°C (but the
          BH6453GUL is 20°C). The TSD circuit is designed only to shut off the IC in order to prevent runaway thermal
          operation. It is not designed to protect the IC or guarantee its operation. The performance of the IC’s characteristics is
          not guaranteed and it is recommended that the device is replaced after the TSD is activated.

10)      Testing an application board
          When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a Capacitor to a pin with low impedance subjects the IC to
          stress. Always discharge Capacitors after each process or step. Always turn the IC's power supply off before
          connecting it to, or removing it from a jig or fixture, during the inspection process. Ground the IC during assembly
          steps as an antistatic measure. Use similar precaution when transporting and storing the IC.
11)      Regarding the input pin of the IC
          This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements to keep them isolated. P-N
          junctions are formed at the intersection of these P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a parasitic
          diode or transistor. For example, the relation between each potential is as follows:
                     When GND > Pin A, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
                     When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode and transistor.
          Parasitic elements can occur inevitably in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic elements can result in
          mutual interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Accordingly, methods by which parasitic
          elements operate, such as applying a voltage that is lower than the GND (P substrate) voltage to an input pin, should
          not be used.

                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
