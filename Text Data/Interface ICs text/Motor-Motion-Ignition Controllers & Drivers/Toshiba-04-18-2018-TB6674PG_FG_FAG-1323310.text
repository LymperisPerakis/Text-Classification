Undervoltage Lockout Circuit（UVLO）
 The TB6674 incorporates an under voltage lockout circuit.
 Outputs are turned off (Hi-Z) under the conditions as follows;
 VCC 4.0 V (Design target) or
 VS1A 6.0 V (Design target) and VS1B 6.0 V (Design target) or
 VS2A 2.2 V (Design target)
 The UVLO circuit has a hysteresis and the function recovers under the conditions as follows;
 VCC = 4.1 V (Design target), VS1A/ VS1B = 6.5 V (Design target), VS2A = 2.3 V (Design target)

    Over Current Protection (ISD) Circuit
          The IC incorporates the over current protection circuit that monitors the current flowing through each
          output power transistor. If a current, which is out of the detecting current, is sensed at any one of these
          transistors, all output transistors are turned off (Hi-Z). (However, ISD is not incorporated in upper
          PchDMOS when PS is high level (Vs2A is 5 V usage) because ON resistance is large.
          Masking time is 20 μs. The operation does not recover automatically (latch method). There are two
          recovery methods written below.
          (1) Power monitor turns on when any of the power supply decreases and reaches the specified voltage.
          (2) Vs2B is set low level for 20 μs or more and then set high. The operation recovers in 10 μs.
          Reference design target of detecting current is as follows;
          PS = L, VS1A (12 V) :PchDMOS = 1.1 A
          PS = H/PS = L in common :Lower NchDMOS = 1.4 A
          Please reduce the external noise to prevent malfunction for ISD.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
[1] The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
    exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
    Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
    injury by explosion or combustion.
[2] Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in
    case of over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that
    exceed its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal
    pulse noise occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the
    breakdown can lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case
    of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location,
    are required.
[3] If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into
    the design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the
    inrush current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at
    power OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
    Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is
    unstable, the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause
    injury, smoke or ignition.
[4] Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly.
    Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
    Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
    exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
    injury by explosion or combustion.
    In addition, do not use any device that is applied the current with inserting in the wrong orientation
    or incorrectly even just one time.
                                                     19                                      2010-08-25

Points to remember on handling of ICs
(1) Heat Radiation Design
    In using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, please design the
    device so that heat is appropriately radiated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (Tj) at
    any time and condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat
    radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown.
    In addition, please design the device taking into considerate the effect of IC heat radiation with
    peripheral components.
(2) Back-EMF
    When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to
    the motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power
    supply is small, the device’s motor power supply and output terminals might be exposed to
    conditions beyond absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF
    into consideration in system design.
