Note: All the grounding wires of the TB62214AFNG must run on the solder mask on the PCB and be externally
       terminated at only one point. Also, a grounding method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
  Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD (VM) and GND traces, to avoid short-circuits
across output pins or to the power supply or ground. If such a short-circuit occurs, the TB62214AFNG may be
permanently damaged.
  Also, utmost care should be taken for pattern designing and implementation of the TB62214AFNG since it has the
power supply pins (VM, RS_A, RS_B, OUT_A, OUT_A , OUT_B, OUT_B , GND) particularly a large current can run
through. If these pins are wired incorrectly, an operation error or even worse a destruction of the TB62214AFNG
may occur.
  The logic input pins must be correctly wired, too; otherwise, the TB62214AFNG may be damaged due to a current
larger than the specified current running through the IC.
  Please note the above when designing and implementing IC patterns.

CLK Function
  The electrical angle leads one by one in the manner of the clocks. The clock signal is reflected to the electrical
angle on the rising edge.
      CLK Input                                   Function
         Rise        The electrical angle leads by one on the rising edge.
         Fall        Remains at the same position.
ENABLE Function
The ENABLE pin controls whether or not to let the current flow through a given phase for a stepper motor drive.
This pin serves to select if the motor is stopped in Off mode or activated. The pin must be fixed to Low on the
power-on or power-down of the TB62214AFNG. During power on, once the VM voltage has reached the voltage
required to operate the motor, set this to High.
    ENABLE Input                                  Function
          H          Output transistors are enabled (normal operation mode).
          L          Output transistors are disabled (high impedance state).
CW/CCW Function
  The CW/CCW pin switches rotation direction of stepper motors.
  The CW pin outputs the A-phase current 90° behind than the B-phase current.
  The CCW pin outputs the A-phase current 90° ahead of the B-phase current.

RESET Function
  The RESET function resets the electrical angle. Always set this to H during power on. Once the VM voltage has
reached the voltage required to operate the motor, release RESET.
     RESET Input                                  Function
          L          Normal operation mode

Detection Features
 (1) Thermal shutdown (TSD)
     The thermal shutdown circuit turns off all the outputs when the junction temperature (Tj) exceeds 150°C
     (typ.). The outputs retain the current states.
     The TB62214AFNG exits TSD mode and resume normal operation when the TB62214AFNG is rebooted or
     both the D_MODE_1 and D_MODE_2 pins are switched to Low.
 (2) Power-ON-resets (PORs) for VMR and VCCR (VM and VCC voltage monitor)
     The outputs are forced off until VM and VCC reach the rated voltages.
 (3) Overcurrent shutdown (ISD)
     Each phase has an overcurrent shutdown circuit, which turns off the corresponding outputs when the
     output current exceeds the shutdown trip threshold (above the maximum current rating: 2.0 A minimum).
     The TB62214AFNG exits ISD mode and resumes normal operation when the TB62214AFNG is rebooted or
     both the D_MODE_1 and D_MODE_2 pins are switched to Low.
     This circuit provides protection against a short-circuit by temporarily disabling the device. Important notes
     on this feature will be provided later.

  Note 1: As a guide, the maximum output current should be kept below 1.4 A per phase. The maximum output current
             may be further limited by thermal considerations, depending on ambient temperature and board conditions.
  Note 2: Stand-alone (Ta = 25°C)
             If Ta is over 25°C, derating is required at 9.2 mW/°C.
             Ta: Ambient temperature
             Topr: Ambient temperature while the TB62214AFNG is active
             Tj: Junction temperature while the TB62214AFNG is active. The maximum junction temperature is
                     limited by the thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry. It is advisable to keep the maximum current below a
                     certain level so that the maximum junction temperature, Tj (MAX), will not exceed 120°C.
  Note: The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even
  for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
  Exceeding the rating (s) may cause breakdown, damage or deterioration of the device, and may result in injury by
  explosion or combustion.
  The value of even one parameter of the absolute maximum ratings should not be exceeded under any circumstances.
  The TB62214AFNG does not have overvoltage protection. Therefore, the device is damaged if a voltage exceeding its
  rated maximum is applied.
  All voltage ratings including supply voltages must always be followed. The other notes and considerations described
  later should also be referred to.

    Note 1: Thermal shutdown (TSD) circuitry
              When the junction temperature of the device has reached the threshold, the TSD circuitry is tripped, causing
              the internal reset circuitry to turn off the output transistors.
              The TSD circuitry is tripped at a temperature between 140°C (min) and 170°C (max). Once tripped, the TSD
              circuitry keeps the output transistors off until both the D_MODE_1 and D_MODE_2 pins are switched to Low
              or the TB62214AFNG is rebooted.
              The thermal shutdown circuit is provided to turn off all the outputs when the IC is overheated. For this
              reason, please avoid using TSD for other purposes.
    Note 2: Overcurrent shutdown (ISD) circuitry
              When the output current has reached the threshold, the ISD circuitry is tripped, causing the internal reset
              circuitry to turn off the output transistors.
              To prevent the ISD circuitry from being tripped due to switching noise, it has a masking time of four CR
              oscillator cycles. Once tripped, it takes a maximum of four cycles to exit ISD mode and resume normal
              operation.
              The ISD circuitry remains active until both the D_MODE_1 and D_MODE_2 pins are switched to Low or the
              TB62214AFNG is rebooted.
              The TB62214AFNG remains in Standby mode while in ISD mode.
    Note 3: If the supply voltage for internal circuitry (VCC) is split with an external resistor and used as VREF input
              supply voltage, the accuracy of the output current setting will be at ±8% when the VCC output voltage
              accuracy and the VREF damping ratio accuracy are combined.
    Note 4: The circuit design has been designed so that electromotive force or leak current from signal input does not
              occur when VM voltage is not supplied, even if the logic input signal is input. Even so, regulate logic input
              signals before resupply of VM voltage so that the motor does not operate when voltage is reapplied.
Back-EMF
   While a motor is rotating, there is a timing at which power is fed back to the power supply. At that timing, the
motor current recirculates back to the power supply due to the effect of the motor back-EMF.
   If the power supply does not have enough sink capability, the power supply and output pins of the device might
rise above the rated voltages. The magnitude of the motor back-EMF varies with usage conditions and motor
characteristics. It must be fully verified that there is no risk that the TB62214AFNG or other components will be
damaged or fail due to the motor back-EMF.
Cautions on Overcurrent Shutdown (ISD) and Thermal Shutdown (TSD)
The ISD and TSD circuits are only intended to provide temporary protection against irregular conditions such as an
    output short-circuit; they do not necessarily guarantee the complete IC safety.
If the device is used beyond the specified operating ranges, these circuits may not operate properly: then the device
    may be damaged due to an output short-circuit.
The ISD circuit is only intended to provide a temporary protection against an output short-circuit. If such a
    condition persists for a long time, the device may be damaged due to overstress. Overcurrent conditions must be
    removed immediately by external hardware.
IC Mounting
   Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation. Otherwise, it may cause breakdown, damage and/or
deterioration of the device.

    The Charge period starts as the internal oscillator clock starts counting. When the output current reaches the
  predefined current level, the internal RS comparator detects the predefined current level (NF); as a result, the IC
  enters Slow-Decay mode.
    The TB62214AFNG transits from Slow-Decay mode to Fast-Decay mode at the point 37.5% of a PWM
  frequency (one chopping frequency) remains in a whole PWM frequency period (on the rising edge of the 11th
  clock of the OSCM clock).
    When the OSCM pin clock counter clocks 16 times, the Fast-Decay mode ends; and at the same time, the
  counter is reset, which brings the TB62214AFNG into Charge mode again.
  Note: These figures are intended for illustrative purposes only. If designed more realistically, they would show
          transient response curves.

      The TB62214AFNG switches among Charge, Slow-Decay and Fast-Decay modes automatically for
   constant-current control.
      The equivalent circuit diagrams may be simplified or some parts of them may be omitted for explanatory
   purposes.
Calculation of the Predefined Output Current
  For PWM constant-current control, the TB62214AFNG uses a clock generated by the CR oscillator. The peak
output current can be set via the current-sensing resistor (RRS) and the reference voltage (VREF), as follows:
     IOUT = VREF/5 ÷ RS (Ω)
  where, 1/5 is the VREF decay rate, VREF (GAIN). For the value of VREF (GAIN), see the Electrical Characteristics
table.
  For example, when VREF = 3 V, to generate an output current (IOUT) of 0.8 A, RRS is calculated as:
             RRS = (VREF /5) ÷ IOUT = (3/5) ÷ 0.8 = 0.75Ω (≥ 0.5 W)
                                                                  13                                               2012-04-17


                                                                                                                       TB62214AFNG
IC Power Consumption
  The power consumed by the TB62214AFNG is approximately the sum of the following two: 1) the power consumed
by the output transistors, and 2) the power consumed by the digital logic and pre-drivers.
  The power consumed by the output transistors is calculated, using the RON (D-S) value of 1.0Ω.
  Whether in Charge, Fast Decay or Slow Decay mode, two of the four transistors comprising each H-bridge
     contribute to its power consumption at a given time.
                 Thus the power consumed by each H-bridge is given by:
                    P (out) = IOUT (A) × VDS (V) = 2 × IOUT2 × RON ......................................... (1)
                 In two-phase excitation mode (in which two phases have a phase difference of 90°), the average
               power consumption in the output transistors is calculated as follows:
                    RON = 1.0 Ω (@2.0 A), the sum of the high-side DMOS and low-side DMOS
                    IOUT (Peak) = 1.0 A
                    VM = 24 V
                    P (out) = 2Hsw × 1.02 (A) × 1.0 (Ω) = 2.0 (W)................................................ (2)
                 The power consumption in the IM domain is calculated separately for normal operation and
               standby modes:
                    Normal operation mode: I (IM3) = 5.0 mA (typ.)
                    Standby mode: I (IM1) = 2.0 mA (typ.)
                 The current consumed in the digital logic portion of the TB62214AFNG is indicated as IMx. The
               digital logic operates off a voltage regulator that is internally connected to the VM power supply. It
               consists of the digital logic connected to VM (24 V) and the network affected by the switching of the
               output transistors. The total power consumed by IMx can be estimated as:
                    P (IM) = 24 (V) × 0.005 (A) = 0.12 (W)........................................................... (3)
                 Hence, the total power consumption of the TB62214AFNG is:
                    P = P (out) + P (IM) = 2.12 (W)
                      The standby power consumption is given by:
                    P (Standby) + P (out) = 24 (V) × 0.002 (A) = 0.048 (W)
                 Board design should be fully verified, taking thermal dissipation into consideration.

z OSC-Charge Delay
  Timing charts may be simplified for explanatory purposes.
  Since the rising level of the OSC waveform is referenced to convert it into the internal CR CLK waveform,
about up to1 us (when CR = 1600 kHz) of a delay occurs between the OSC waveform and internal CR CLK
waveform.

     An overcurrent starts flowing into the output transistors
     The overcurrent shutdown (ISD) circuitry has a masking time to prevent current spikes during Irr and
   switching from erroneously tripping the ISD circuitry. The masking time is a function of the chopper
   frequency obtained by CR:
            masking_time = 4 × CR_frequency
     The minimum and maximum times taken to turn off the output transistors since an overcurrent flows into
   them are:
            Min: 4 × CR_frequency
            Max: 8 × CR_frequency
     It should be noted that these values assume a case in which an overcurrent condition is detected in an ideal
   manner. The ISD circuitry might not work, depending on the control timing of the output transistors.
     Therefore, a protection fuse must always be added to the VM power supply as a safety precaution. The
   optimal fuse capacitance varies with usage conditions, and one that does not adversely affect the motor
   operation or exceed the power dissipation rating of the TB62214AFNG should be selected.
Calculating OSCM Oscillating Frequency
 The OSCM oscillating frequency can be approximated using the following equation:
                      1
 f OSCM =
            0.56 × C × (R 1 + 500 )
 Where:
 C = Capacitor capacity
 R1= Resistance
                            −12
 Assigning C = 270 × 10 [F], R1= 3600 [Ω] to get:
 fOSCM = 1.61 × 106 ⇒ 1.6 MHz

  Note: Bypass capacitors should be added as necessary.
    It is recommended to use a single ground plane for the entire board whenever possible, and a grounding
  method should be considered for efficient heat dissipation.
    In cases where mode setting pins are controlled via switches, either pull-down or pull-up resistors should be
  added to them to avoid floating states.
    For a description of the input values, see the function tables.
    The above application circuit example is presented only as a guide and should be fully evaluated prior to
  production. Also, no intellectual property right is ceded in any way whatsoever in regard to its use.
    The external components in the above diagram are used to test the electrical characteristics of the device: it is
  not guaranteed that no system malfunction or failure will occur.
Careful attention should be paid to the layout of the output, VDD (VM) and GND traces to avoid short-circuits across output pins or to
the power supply or ground. If such a short-circuit occurs, the TB62214AFNG may be permanently damaged. Also, if the device is
installed in a wrong orientation, a high voltage might be applied to components with lower voltage ratings, causing them to be
damaged. The TB62214AFNG does not have an overvoltage protection circuit. Thus, if a voltage exceeding the rated maximum
voltage is applied, the TB62214AFNG will be damaged; it should be ensured that it is used within the specified operating conditions.

IC Usage Considerations
   Notes on handling of ICs
       (1)  The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be
            exceeded, even for a moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings.
            Exceeding the rating(s) may cause the device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
            injury by explosion or combustion.
       (2)  Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in case
            of over current and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed
            its absolute maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise
            occurs from the wiring or load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can
            lead smoke or ignition. To minimize the effects of the flow of a large current in case of breakdown,
            appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time and insertion circuit location, are required.
       (3)  If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the
            design to prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush
            current at power ON or the negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF.
            IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
            Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable,
            the protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury,
            smoke or ignition.
       (4)  Do not insert devices incorrectly or in the wrong orientation.
            Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of power supplies are connected properly.
            Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute maximum rating, and
            exceeding the rating(s) may cause breakdown, damage or deterioration of the device, and may result
            in injury by explosion or combustion.
            In addition, do not use any device that has had current applied to it while inserted incorrectly or in the
            wrong orientation even once.
      (5)  Carefully select power amp, regulator, or other external components (such as inputs and negative
           feedback capacitors) and load components (such as speakers).
           If there is a large amount of leakage current such as input or negative feedback capacitors, the IC
           output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a speaker with low input
           withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure can cause smoke or ignition. (The over current can cause
           smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load
           (BTL) connection type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.
                                                        20                                             2012-04-17


                                                                                              TB62214AFNG
Points to remember on handling of ICs
      Over current Protection Circuit
      Over current protection circuits (referred to as current limiter circuits) do not necessarily protect ICs under
      all circumstances. If the Over current protection circuits operate against the over current, clear the over
      current status immediately.
      Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can
      cause the over current protection circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation. In
      addition, depending on the method of use and usage conditions, if over current continues to flow for a long
      time after operation, the IC may generate heat resulting in breakdown.
      Thermal Shutdown Circuit
      Thermal shutdown circuits do not necessarily protect ICs under all circumstances. If the thermal shutdown
      circuits operate against the over temperature, clear the heat generation status immediately.
      Depending on the method of use and usage conditions, such as exceeding absolute maximum ratings can
      cause the thermal shutdown circuit to not operate properly or IC breakdown before operation.
      Heat Dissipation Design
      In using an IC with large current flow such as a power amp, regulator or driver, please design the device so
      that heat is appropriately dissipated, not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time or
      under any condition. These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat dissipation
      design can lead to decrease in IC life, deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition,
      please design the device taking into consideration the effect of IC heat dissipation on peripheral
      components.
      Back-EMF
      When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows down abruptly, a current flow back to the
      motor’s power supply due to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is
      small, the device’s motor power supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond absolute
      maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take the effect of back-EMF into consideration in your system
      design.
