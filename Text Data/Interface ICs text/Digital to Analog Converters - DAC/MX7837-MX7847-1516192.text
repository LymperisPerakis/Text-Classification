The MX7837/MX7847 are dual, 12-bit, multiplying, volt-          ♦ Two 12-Bit Multiplying DACs with Buffered
age-output digital-to-analog converters (DACs). Each              Voltage Output
DAC has an output amplifier and a feedback resistor.
The output amplifier is capable of developing ±10V              ♦ Specified with ±12V or ±15V Supplies
across a 2kΩ load. The amplifier feedback resistor is           ♦ No External Adjustments Required
internally connected to VOUT on the MX7847. No exter-
nal trims are required to achieve full 12-bit performance       ♦ Fast Timing Specifications
over the entire operating temperature range.                    ♦ 24-Pin DIP and SO Packages
The MX7847 has a 12-bit parallel data input, whereas
the MX7837 operates with a double-buffered 8-bit-bus            ♦ 12-Bit Parallel Interface (MX7847)
interface that loads data in two write operations. All            8-Bit + 4-Bit Interface (MX7837)
logic signals are level triggered and are TTL and CMOS
compatible. Fast timing specifications make these                ______________Ordering Information

                Note 1: If VSS is open-circuited with VDD and either AGND applied, the VSS pin will float positive exceeding the Absolute Maximum Ratings.
                        If this possibility exists, a Schottky diode connected between VSS and GND ensures the maximum ratings will be observed.
                Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 2: The analog outputs can swing to within 2.5V of the supply rails. Hence, for good linearity towards full-scale, |VREFA| and |VREFB| must
        be at least 2.5V lower than VDD and |VSS|. Tests done with supply voltages below ±12.5V are done with VREFA = VREFB = ±8.9V.
Note 3: Static performance tested at VDD = +15V, VSS = -15V. Performance over supplies guaranteed by PSRR test.
Note 4: Guaranteed by design.
