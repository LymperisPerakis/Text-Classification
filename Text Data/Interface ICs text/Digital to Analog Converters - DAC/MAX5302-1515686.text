                                                  with Serial Interface
__________________General Description                                                                        Features
                                                                                                                         MAX5302
The MAX5302 combines a low-power, voltage-output,               ♦ 12-Bit DAC with Configurable Output Amplifier
12-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and a precision        ♦ +5V Single-Supply Operation
output amplifier in an 8-pin µMAX package. It operates
from a single +5V supply, drawing less than 280µA of            ♦ Low Supply Current: 0.28mA Normal Operation
supply current.                                                                       2µA Shutdown Mode
The output amplifier’s inverting input is available to the      ♦ Available in 8-Pin µMAX
user, allowing specific gain configurations, remote sens-       ♦ Power-On Reset Clears DAC Output to Zero
ing, and high output current capability. This makes the
MAX5302 ideal for a wide range of applications, includ-         ♦ SPI/QSPI/MICROWIRE Compatible
ing industrial process control. Other features include a        ♦ Schmitt-Trigger Digital Inputs for Direct
software shutdown and power-on reset.                             Optocoupler Interface
The serial interface is SPI™/QSPI™/MICROWIRE™ com-
patible. The DAC has a double-buffered input, organized
as an input register followed by a DAC register. A 16-bit
serial word loads data into the input register. The DAC
register can be updated independently or simultaneously
with the input register. All logic inputs are TTL/CMOS-
logic compatible and buffered with Schmitt triggers to
allow direct interfacing to optocouplers.                                               Ordering Information

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: Guaranteed from code 11 to code 4095 in unity-gain configuration.
Note 2: Accuracy is better than 1LSB for VOUT = 8mV to (VDD - 100mV), guaranteed by a power-supply rejection test at the end
        points.
Note 3: RL = ∞, digital inputs at GND or VDD.

                 Grounding and Layout Considerations                  Note: ( ) are for sub-bit.
          Digital or AC transient signals on GND can create noise
          at the analog output. Connect GND to the highest-quality
          ground available.
          Good PC board ground layout minimizes crosstalk
          between the DAC output, reference input, and digital
          input. Reduce crosstalk by keeping analog lines away
          from digital lines. Wire-wrapped boards are not recom-
          mended.
