age. The MAX5352 operates from a single +5V supply,
and the MAX5353 operates from a single +3.3V supply.               ♦ Low Supply Current: 0.28mA Normal Operation
Both devices draw less than 280µA of supply current.                                     2µA Shutdown Mode

ter. The DAC register can be updated independently or
simultaneously with the input register. All logic inputs            _________________Ordering Information

                  On power-up, the input and DAC registers are cleared
                  (set to zero code).
                  For rated MAX5352/MAX5353 performance, REF must
                  be at least 1.4V below VDD. Bypass VDD with a 4.7µF
                  capacitor in parallel with a 0.1µF capacitor to GND.
                  Use short lead lengths and place the bypass capaci-
                  tors as close to the supply pins as possible.
