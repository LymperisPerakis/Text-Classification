The MAX5380/MAX5381/MAX5382 are low-cost, 8-bit                  ♦ 8-Bit Accuracy in a Miniature 5-Pin SOT23
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) in miniature 5-pin

that allows communication with multiple devices. The             ♦ Low 230µA max Supply Current
MAX5380 has an internal +2V reference and operates
from a +2.7V to +3.6V supply. The MAX5381 has an                 ♦ 1µA Shutdown Mode

                          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

immediate STOP condition is necessary to update the
DAC. The 8th bit of the address byte, typically used to
indicate a read or write protocol, is used in the MAX5380/

When MAX5380/MAX5381/MAX5382 are addressed in
I2C read mode, they enter shutdown mode.
