         Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress rat-
         ings only, and functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of
         the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: PSRR is tested by changing the respective supply voltage by ±5%.
Note 2: For best performance, REF_ should be greater than AGND_ + 2V and less than VDD - 0.6V. The device operates with
        reference inputs outside this range, but performance may degrade. For further information on the reference, see the
        Reference and Analog-Ground Inputs section in the Detailed Description.
Note 3: Reference input resistance is code dependent. See Reference and Analog-Ground Inputs section in the Detailed
        Description.
Note 4: Typical settling time with 1000pF capacitive load is 10µs.
Note 5: Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
Note 6: Guaranteed by supply-rejection test.

(REF_) and one analog-ground input (AGND_) for each
pair of DACs. The four REF_ inputs allow different full-                         2R   2R         2R       2R       2R

The DAC ladder outputs are buffered with op amps that                  REF–
operate with a gain of two. The inverting node of the                 AGND–
amplifier is connected to the respective reference
input, resulting in bipolar output voltages from -REF_ to
4095/4096 REF_. Figure 1 shows the simplified DAC
circuit.                                                             Figure 1. DAC Simplified Circuit Diagram
