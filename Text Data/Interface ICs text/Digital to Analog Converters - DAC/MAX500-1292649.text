The MAX500 is a quad, 8-bit, voltage-output digital-to-           ♦ Buffered Voltage Outputs
analog converter (DAC) with a cascadable serial inter-
face. The IC includes four output buffer amplifiers and           ♦ Double-Buffered Digital Inputs

         Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
         operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
         absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

         Note 3:   TA = +25°C, VREF = 10kHz, 10V peak-to-peak sine wave.
         Note 4:   LOAD has a weak internal pull-up resistor to VDD.
         Note 5:   DAC switched from all 1s to all 0s, and all 0s to all 1s code.
         Note 6:   Sample tested at +25°C to ensure compliance.
         Note 7:   Slow rise and fall times are allowed on the digital inputs to facilitate the use of opto-couplers. Only timing for SCL is given
                   because the other digital inputs should be stable when SCL transitions.
