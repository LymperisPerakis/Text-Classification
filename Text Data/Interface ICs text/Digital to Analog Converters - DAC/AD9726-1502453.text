  SWRESET also resets itself. SMEM contents are unaffected by SWRESET; however, CALMEM reports an uncalibrated state.
2
  EXTREF is optional because the internal reference circuit is designed to be overdriven by an external source.
3
  The self-calibration clock is also used for the memory transfer cycle; therefore, the CALCLK value affects the MEMXFER process time.
4
  Register Bits 3:0 must all be 0 to assert SELFCAL. The time required for the self-calibration cycle is ~100 ms at 100 MHz with CALCLK = 0.
5
  Register Bits 3:0 must all be 0 to assert MEMXFER. The time required for the memory transfer cycle is ~15 ms at 100 MHz with CALCLK = 0.
6
  The UNCAL bit remains asserted after the cycle completes (SMEM contents held at default values) until the bit is cleared by the user.

rates and high performance. LVDS technology uses differential                                         25Ω
