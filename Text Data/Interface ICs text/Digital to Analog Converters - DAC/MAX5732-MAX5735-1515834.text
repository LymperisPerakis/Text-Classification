                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: AVCC should be at least 0.25V higher than the maximum output voltage required from the DAC. Full-scale output is 5V for
        the MAX5732.
Note 2: Linearity guaranteed from code 2047 to full scale and from (VSS + 0.3V) to (AVCC - 0.3V).
Note 3: DNL guaranteed over all codes for (VSS + 0.3V) to (AVCC - 0.3V).
Note 4: Zero-scale error is measured at code 0. Full-scale error is measured at code FFFFhex.
Note 5: DC crosstalk is the change in the output level of one DAC at zero or full scale in response to the full-scale output change of all
        other DACs.
Note 6: Digital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into the analog outputs from the digital control inputs when the
        device is not being written to. It is measured with a worst-case change on the digital inputs.
Note 7: Digital crosstalk is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC at midscale while a full-scale code change is written
        into another DAC.
Note 8: DAC-to-DAC crosstalk is the glitch impulse that appears at the output of one converter due to both the digital change and
        subsequent analog output change at another converter.

                                                      device to operate in stand-alone mode or in parallel; only the 16 data bits are output to DOUT. A
                         D14           SING           logic-low sets the device to operate in a daisy chain of devices. In this case, the entire 32-bit
                                                      command word is output to DOUT.
                                                      Default is logic-low (daisy-chain mode); SING is read/write.
                                                      Glitch-suppression enable; the MAX5732–MAX5735 feature glitch-suppression circuitry on the
                                                      analog outputs that minimizes the output glitch during a major carry transition. A logic-low disables
                         D13           GLT            the internal glitch-suppression circuitry, which improves settling time. A logic-high enables glitch-
                                                      suppression, suppressing up to 120nV-s glitch impulse on the DAC outputs.

                                                      Shutdown; a logic-high shuts down all 32 DACs. The logic interface remains active, and the data is
                                                      retained in the input and DAC registers. Read/write operations can be performed while the device
                         D11           SHDN           is disabled; however, no changes can occur at the device outputs. A logic-low powers up all 32
                                                      DACs if the device was previously in shutdown. Upon waking up, the DAC outputs return to the last
