device. The user must connect the VSS pin to a ground
plane through a low impedance connection. If an
analog ground path is available in the application PCB
(printed circuit board), it is highly recommended that
the VSS pin be tied to the analog ground path or isolated
within an analog ground plane of the circuit board.
3.3        Serial Data Pin (SDA)
SDA is the serial data pin of the I2C interface. The SDA
pin is used to write or read the DAC register and
EEPROM data. The SDA pin is an open-drain N-chan
nel driver. Therefore, it needs a pull-up resistor from the
VDD line to the SDA pin. Except for start and stop
conditions, the data on the SDA pin must be stable
during the high period of the clock. The high or low
state of the SDA pin can only change when the clock
signal on the SCL pin is low. Refer to Section 7.0 “I2C
Serial Interface Communication” for more details of
I2C Serial Interface communication.

calculated after nullifying the offset error, or full scale Gain error drift is the variation in gain error due to a
error minus the offset error.                               change in ambient temperature. The gain error drift is
                                                            typically expressed in ppm/oC.
The gain error indicates how well the slope of the actual
transfer function matches the slope of the ideal transfer
function. The gain error is usually expressed as percent
of full-scale range (% of FSR) or in LSB.

4.9       Offset Error Drift
Offset error drift is the variation in offset error due to a
change in ambient temperature. The offset error drift is
typically expressed in ppm/oC.
4.10      Settling Time
The Settling time is the time delay required for the DAC
output to settle to its new output value from the start of
code transition, within specified accuracy. In the
MCP4725, the settling time is a measure of the time
delay until the DAC output reaches its final value
(within 0.5 LSB) when the DAC code changes from
400h to C00h.
4.11      Major-Code Transition Glitch
Major-code transition glitch is the impulse energy
injected into the DAC analog output when the code in
the DAC register changes state. It is normally specified
as the area of the glitch in nV-Sec. and is measured
when the digital code is changed by 1 LSB at the major
carry transition (Example: 011...111 to 100... 000, or
100... 000 to 011 ... 111).
4.12      Digital Feedthrough
Digital feedthrough is the glitch that appears at the
analog output caused by coupling from the digital input
pins of the device. It is specified in nV-Sec. and is
measured with a full scale change on the digital input
pins (Example: 000... 000 to 111... 111, or 111... 111 to
000... 000). The digital feedthrough is measured when
the DAC is not being written to the register.

internal circuits. During the power-down mode, all
internal circuits except the I2C interface are disabled
and there is no data conversion event, and no VOUT is
available. The device also switches the output stage    FIGURE 5-1:          Output Stage for

load. The value of the resistive load is determined by
the state of the power-down bits (PD1 and PD0).
Table 5-2 shows the outcome of the power-down bit
and the resistive load.
During the power-down mode, the device draws about
60 nA (typical). Although most of internal circuits are
shutdown, the serial interface remains active in order
to receive the I2C command.
The device exits the power-down mode immediately
when (a) it receives a new write command for normal
mode or (b) it receives an I2C General Call Wake-Up
Command.
When the DAC operation mode is changed from
power-down to normal mode, the output settling time
takes less than 10 µs, but greater than the standard
Active mode settling time (6 µs, typical).

7.4       High-Speed (HS) Mode
       2
The I C specification requires that a high-speed mode
device must be ‘activated’ to operate in high-speed
(3.4 Mbit/s) mode. This is done by sending a special
address byte of 00001XXX following the START bit.
The XXX bits are unique to the high-speed (HS) mode
Master. This byte is referred to as the high-speed (HS)
Master Mode Code (HSMMC). The MCP4725 device
does not acknowledge this byte. However, upon
receiving this command, the device switches to HS
mode and can communicate at up to 3.4 Mbit/s on SDA
and SCL lines. The device will switch out of the HS
mode on the next STOP condition.
For more information on the HS mode, or other I2C
modes, please refer to the Phillips I2C specification.

              Clock Low time (TLOW) can be affected.
              For Data Output: This parameter is characterized, and tested indirectly by testing TAA parameter.

              parameter is too long, Clock Low time (TLOW) can be affected.
         4:   For Data Input: This parameter must be longer than tSP. If this parameter is too long, the Data Input Setup (TSU:DAT) or
              Clock Low time (TLOW) can be affected.
              For Data Output: This parameter is characterized, and tested indirectly by testing TAA parameter.
         5:   All timing parameters in high-speed modes are tested at VDD = 5V.

8.5.3         BUILDING A “WINDOW” DAC
Some sensor applications require very high resolution
around the set point or threshold voltage.
Example 8-2 shows an example of creating a “window”
around the threshold using a voltage divider network
with a pull-up and pull-down resistor. In the circuit, the
output voltage range is scaled down, but its step reso-
lution is increased greatly.

8.5.4.1               Design a Bipolar DAC using
                      Example 8-3
Some applications desires an output step magnitude of
1 mV with an output range of ±2.05V. The following
steps explain the design solution:
1.   Calculate the range: +2.05V – (-2.05V) = 4.1V.
2.   Calculate the resolution needed:
     4.1V/1 mV = 4100
     Since 212 = 4096 for 12-bit resolution.
3.   The amplifier gain (R2/R1), multiplied by VDD,
     must be equal to the desired minimum output to
     achieve bipolar operation. Since any gain can
     be realized by choosing resistor values (R1+R2),
     the VDD value must be selected first. If a VDD of
     4.1V is used, solve for the amplifier’s gain by
     setting the DAC to 0, knowing that the output
     needs to be -2.05V. The equation can be
     simplified to:
                  – R 2 – 2.05                  – 2.05                 R
                  --------- = ------------- = ------------- → -----2- = 1---
                    R1           V DD               4.1                R1 2
 If R1 = 20 kΩ and R2 = 10 kΩ, the gain will be 0.5.
4.   Next, solve for R3 and R4 by setting the DAC to
     4096, knowing that the output needs to be
     +2.05V.
                   R4                   2.05V + ( 0.5 ⋅ V DD )
          ----------------------                                                 - = 2---
                               - = -----------------------------------------------

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
