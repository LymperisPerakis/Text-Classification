Note 2: Specifications are 100% production tested at TA ≥ +25NC. Specifications for TA < +25NC are guaranteed by design and
         characterization.
Note 3: Configuration register write operation required following power-up for output offset adjustment. See the DAC Outputs sec-
         tion in the Detailed Description. All gain and offset errors include the effect of the internal reference and are guaranteed
         over temperature. Gain error = (measured gain - IGAIN)/IGAIN. Measured gain = (code 16383 DAC output - code 500
         DAC output)/15883. Offset error = code 500 DAC output - (500 x measured gain). The device is trimmed such that offset
         error is negative, ensuring linear operation down to zero current output.
Note 4: Guaranteed by design and characterization. Not production tested. All gain and offset temperature coefficients include
         the effect of the internal reference. Temperature coefficients are calculated by the “box” method. For additional informa-
         tion, refer to Maxim Application Note 4300: Calculating the error budget in precision digital-to-analog converter (DAC)
         applications.
Note 5: Timing characteristics are tested and guaranteed with digital input conditions VIH = VDDI and VIL = 0V.
Note 6: Minimum pulse width required to realize functionally useful DAC transitions. Not production tested. See Shutter Mode
         Settling Time Down and Shutter Mode Settling Time Up graphs in the Typical Operating Characteristics section.

                                    Ground Switch Control

      15              GSW
                                    1: Output is connected to ground when DAC code = 0000h. For DACs 1 and 2, this setting
                                    applies to the active mux output.

                                    00 (Ignore): The DAC is not affected by the CLR pin (default)
                                    01 (Shutter): DAC output polarity is held negative (current level determined by 1Bh) as long
                                    as the CLR pin is asserted (level sensitive, applies to DAC 6 only; otherwise, implements the
    14:13        CLR_CFG[1:0]       ignore function)
                                    10 (Gate): DAC output is held at zero scale (with ground switches engaged if enabled) as
                                    long as the CLR pin is asserted (level sensitive)
                                    11 (Reset): DAC output is set to zero scale (with ground switches engaged if enabled) when
                                    CLR is asserted and remains valid after CLR is removed (edge sensitive)
                                    Track and Hold Enable
      12            T/H_EN          0: Track and Hold disabled

                                    0: DAC full-scale output level is set to high range.
      11              RNG           1: DAC full-scale output level is set to low range.
                                    Note: For all DACs not supporting RNG settings, this bit is reserved and should be set to 1
                                    (default).

     10:7          MUX[3:0]         01XX: All outputs high impedance (open)
                                    1000: Output A active, all others shunted to GND

                                    1011: Output D active, all others shunted to GND
                                    11XX: All outputs shunted to GND (default)

Note: Any change to individual DAC configuration settings resets the affected DAC code to 0000h.
