Note 2: Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25°C and TA = +105°C. Specifications over the entire operating
         temperature range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25°C and are not
         guaranteed.
Note 3: Static accuracy tested without load.
Note 4: Linearity is tested within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 5: Gain and offset is tested within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 6: Subject to offset and gain error limits and VREF settings.
Note 7: Specification is guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 8: Unconnected conditions on the ADDR_ inputs are sensed through a resistive pullup and pulldown operation; for proper
         operation, the ADDR_ inputs must be connected to VDD, GND, or left unconnected with minimal capacitance.
