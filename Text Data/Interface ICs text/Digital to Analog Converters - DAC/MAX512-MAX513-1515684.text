                                                                                                                                                                      MAX512/MAX513
The MAX512/MAX513 contain three 8-bit, voltage-output              ♦ Operate from a Single +5V (MAX512) or
digital-to-analog converters (DAC A, DAC B, and DAC C).              +3V (MAX513) Supply, or from Bipolar Supplies
Output buffer amplifiers for DACs A and B provide voltage
outputs while reducing external component count. The               ♦ Low Power Consumption
output buffer for DAC A can source or sink 5mA to within                   1mA Operating Current
0.5V of VDD or VSS. The buffer for DAC B can source or                     <1µA Shutdown Current
sink 0.5mA to within 0.5V of V DD or V SS . DAC C is               ♦ Unipolar or Bipolar Outputs
unbuffered, providing a third voltage output with increased
accuracy. The MAX512 operates with a single                        ♦ 5MHz, 3-Wire Serial Interface
+5V ±10% supply, and the MAX513 operates with a                    ♦ SPI, QSPI, and Microwire Compatible
+2.7V to +3.6V supply. Both devices can also operate               ♦ Two Buffered, Bipolar-Output DACs (DACs A/B)
with split supplies.
The 3-wire serial interface has a maximum operating fre-           ♦ Independently Programmable Shutdown Mode
quency of 5MHz and is compatible with SPI™, QSPI™,                 ♦ Space-Saving 14-Pin SO/DIP Packages
and Microwire™. The serial input shift register is 16 bits         ♦ Pin and Software Reset
long and consists of 8 bits of DAC input data and 8 bits
for DAC selection and shutdown. DAC registers can be
loaded                                                              ______________Ordering Information

Any of the three DACs can be independently shut down.              * Contact factory for dice specifications.
In shutdown mode, the DAC's R-2R ladder network is
disconnected from the reference input, minimizing sys-             ________________Functional Diagram

                Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional

Note 2: Digital code from 24 through 232 are due to swing limitations of output amplifiers on DAC A and DAC B. See Typical
        Operating Characteristics.
Note 3: Reference input resistance is code dependent. The lowest input resistance occurs at code 55hex. Refer to the reference
        input section in the Detailed Description.
Note 4: Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
Note 5: Input capacitance is code dependent. The highest capacitance occurs at code 00hex.
Note 6: For single-supply mode, tie VSS to GND.
