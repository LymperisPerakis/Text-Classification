   0x1E        0      PGEN_EN Pattern Generator Enable. Set PGEN_EN = 1 to use the internal 64 sample pattern generator to provide data to the DAC.
                                 Set DATA_SP = 0, DCKO_DIV = 0, and DATA_EN = 1 when PGEN_EN = 1.
   0x1F      [7:0] PGEN_D Pattern Generator Data. Write 128 bytes of data to this address to fill the pattern generator with 64 samples.
                                 Data is written MSB first. Reading this location causes the pattern generator data to be shifted out through SDO.
                                 Ensure PGEN_EN = 0 when reading or writing to address 0x1F. Read or write an even number of bytes to address
                                 0x1F prior to setting PGEN_EN = 1 to avoid corrupting the data inside the pattern generator.
Note: Registers 0x1E and 0x1F reset to 0x00 (default).

The following is an example of a common start-up
sequence.                                                               5. Apply zeroes to ports A and B (DAP/N, DBP/N) for

3. Apply a clock to CKP/N at the desired fDAC frequency.                      Set address 0x03 to 0x05 if they are in quadrature.
