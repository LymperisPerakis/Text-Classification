Note 2:   Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25NC. Specifications over the entire operating temperature range
          are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25NC.
Note 3: DC Performance is tested without load.
Note 4: Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 5: Offset and gain calculated from measurements made with VREF = VDD at code 30 and 4065 for MAX5702, code 8 and
          1016 for MAX5701, and code 2 and 254 for MAX5700.
Note 6: Subject to zero and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 7: Measured with all other DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 8: On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time
          will be ignored.
Note 9: Guaranteed by design.
Note 10: All channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO.
Note 11: All timing tested with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO.
