Note 3: Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over the entire operating temperature range
            are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25°C.
Note 4: DC performance is tested without load, VREF = VDD.
Note 5: Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 6: Gain and offset calculated from measurements made with VREF = VDD at codes 30 and 4065 for MAX5725, codes 8 and
            1016 for MAX5724, and codes 2 and 254 for MAX5723.
Note 7: Subject to zero- and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 8: Measured with all other DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 9: On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time will
            be ignored.
Note 10: Guaranteed by design.
Note 11: All channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO for all inputs.
