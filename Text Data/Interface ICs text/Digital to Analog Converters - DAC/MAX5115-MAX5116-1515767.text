                  Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. All temperature limits are guaranteed by design.
                  Note 2: Guaranteed monotonic.

                                                                256 × (VF0,Meas − ZCE − VF0,Ideal )

                           where VF0,Meas is the DAC voltage with input code F0 hex and VF0,Ideal is the ideal DAC voltage with input code F0 hex or
                           (VREFH - VREFL) x (240 / 256) + VREFL.
                  Note 4: The device draws higher supply current when the digital inputs are driven with voltages between (VDD - 0.5V) and (GND +
                           0.5V). See Supply Current vs. Digital Input Voltage in the Typical Operating Characteristics.
                  Note 5: Output settling time is measured from the 50% point of the rising edge of the last SCL of the data byte to 0.5 LSB of OUT_’s
                           final value for a code transition from 10 hex to F0 hex.
                  Note 6: Crosstalk is defined as the coupling from a DAC switching from code 00 hex to code FF hex to any other DAC that is in a
                           steady state at code 00 hex.
                  Note 7: Reference feedthrough is defined as the coupling from one driven reference with input code = FF hex to any other DAC
                           output with the reference of the DAC at a constant value and input code = 00 hex.
                  Note 8: SCL clock period includes rise and fall times tR and tF. All digital input signals are specified with tR = tF = 2ns and timed
                           from a voltage level of (VIL + VIH) / 2.
                  Note 9: An appropriate bus pullup resistance must be selected depending on board capacitance. Refer to the document linked to

                  Note 10: The busy time begins from the initiation of the stop pulse.

reference for all four DACs (REFH and REFL). REFH_             0000 0001                               + VREFL _
sets the full-scale voltage, while REFL_ sets the zero                                   256
code output. The MAX5115 has a 460kΩ typical input             0000 0000                           VREFL_
impedance that is independent of the code. The
MAX5116 has a 115kΩ typical input impedance that is
independent of the code.
                                Power Sequencing
The voltage applied to REFH_ and REFL_ should not
exceed VDD at any time. If proper power sequencing is
not possible, connect an external Schottky diode                        OUTPUT
between REFH_, REFL_, and VDD to ensure compliance                     VOLTAGE
with the absolute maximum ratings. Do not apply signals
to the digital inputs before the device is fully powered.

Digital or AC transient signals on GND can create noise               OFFSET
at the analog output. Return GND to the highest-quality
ground available. Bypass VDD with a 0.1µF capacitor,
located as close to the device as possible. Bypass          Figure 10. Effect of Negative Offset (Single Supply)
REFH_ and REFL_ to GND with 0.1µF capacitors.
Careful PC board ground layout minimizes crosstalk
between the DAC outputs and digital inputs.
