 Note 1:     As a transmitter, the device must provide this internal minimum delay time to bridge the undefined region
             (minimum 300 ns) of the falling edge of SCL to avoid unintended generation of START or STOP conditions.
       2:    A fast-mode (400 kHz) I2C-bus device can be used in a standard-mode (100 kHz) I2C-bus system, but the
             requirement tSU;DAT ≥ 250 ns must then be met. This will automatically be the case if the device does not
             stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal,
             it must output the next data bit to the SDA line.
             TR max.+tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the standard-mode I2C bus specification) before
             the SCL line is released.
       3:    The MCP47X6 device must provide a data hold time to bridge the undefined part between VIH and VIL of
             the falling edge of the SCL signal. This specification is not a part of the I2C specification, but must be tested
             in order to ensure that the output data will meet the setup and hold specifications for the receiving device.
       4:    Use Cb in pF for the calculations.
       5:    Not Tested. This parameter ensured by characterization.
       6:    A Master Transmitter must provide a delay to ensure that difference between SDA and SCL fall times do
             not unintentionally create a Start or Stop condition.
             If this parameter is too short, it can create an unintentional Start or Stop condition to other devices on the
             I2C bus line. If this parameter is too long, the Data Input Setup (TSU:DAT) or Clock Low time (TLOW) can be
             affected.
                        Data Input: This parameter must be longer than tSP.
                        Data Output: This parameter is characterized, and tested indirectly by testing TAA parameter.
       7:    Ensured by the TAA 3.4 MHz specification test.
       8:    The specification is not part of the I2C specification. TAA = THD:DAT + TFSDA (or TRSDA).

 Note 1:    As a transmitter, the device must provide this internal minimum delay time to bridge the undefined region
            (minimum 300 ns) of the falling edge of SCL to avoid unintended generation of START or STOP conditions.
       2:   A fast-mode (400 kHz) I2C-bus device can be used in a standard-mode (100 kHz) I2C-bus system, but the
            requirement tSU;DAT ≥ 250 ns must then be met. This will automatically be the case if the device does not
            stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal,
            it must output the next data bit to the SDA line.
            TR max.+tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the standard-mode I2C bus specification) before
            the SCL line is released.
       3:   The MCP47X6 device must provide a data hold time to bridge the undefined part between VIH and VIL of
            the falling edge of the SCL signal. This specification is not a part of the I2C specification, but must be tested
            in order to ensure that the output data will meet the setup and hold specifications for the receiving device.
       4:   Use Cb in pF for the calculations.
       5:   Not Tested. This parameter ensured by characterization.
       6:   A Master Transmitter must provide a delay to ensure that difference between SDA and SCL fall times do
            not unintentionally create a Start or Stop condition.
            If this parameter is too short, it can create an unintentional Start or Stop condition to other devices on the
            I2C bus line. If this parameter is too long, the Data Input Setup (TSU:DAT) or Clock Low time (TLOW) can be
            affected.
                       Data Input: This parameter must be longer than tSP.
                       Data Output: This parameter is characterized, and tested indirectly by testing TAA parameter.
       7:   Ensured by the TAA 3.4 MHz specification test.
       8:   The specification is not part of the I2C specification. TAA = THD:DAT + TFSDA (or TRSDA).

 Note 1:   VRL is the resistor ladder’s reference voltage. It is independent of VREF1:VREF0 selection.
       2:  Gain selection of 2x requires voltage reference source to come from VREF pin and
           requires VREF pin voltage ≤ VDD / 2.
       3:  Requires G = ‘1’, VREF1:VREF0 = ‘10’ or ‘11’, and VRL ≤ VDD / 2.
       4:  These theoretical calculations do not take into account the offset and gain errors.

The lower resistor value, on the other hand, consumes
higher power, but allows higher operating speed. If the
bus line has higher capacitance due to long metal
traces or multiple device connections to the bus line, a
smaller pull-up resistor is needed to compensate the
long RC time constant. The pull-up resistor is typically
chosen between 1 kΩ and 10 kΩ ranges for standard
and fast modes, and less than 1 kΩ for high speed

9.0      DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT
Development support can be classified into two groups.
These are:
• Development Tools
• Technical Documentation
9.1      Development Tools
Several development tools are available to assist in
your design and evaluation of the MCP47X6 devices.
The currently available tools are shown in Table 9-1.
These boards may be purchased directly from the
Microchip web site at www.microchip.com.

Technology Inc. This board works with Microchip’s               Daughter Board with PIC Explorer 16
PICkit™ Serial Analyzer and           PIC Explorer 16           Development Board.
Development Board. The firmware example is also
available for the Explore 16 Development Board with                 MCP47X6 PICtail Plus Daughter Board
PIC24FJ128.
Figure 9-1 shows the MCP47X6 PICtail Plus Daughter
Board being used with a PIC Explorer 16 Development
Board (order #: ADM00317), while Figure 9-2 shows
the MCP47X6 PICtail Plus Daughter Board being used
with a PICkit™ Serial Analyzer. The PICkit™ Serial
Analyzer allows the user to quickly evaluate the DAC
operation. Refer to the MCP47X6 PICtail Plus
Daughter Board User’s Guide for detailed descriptions
on operating the daughter board.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
