Note 3:		Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over the entire operating temperature range
          are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25°C.
Note 4:		DC performance is tested without load, VREF = VDD.
Note 5:		Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 6:		Offset and gain calculated from measurements made with VREF = VDD at code 30 and 4065 for MAX5825, code 8 and
          1016 for MAX5824, and code 2 and 254 for MAX5823.
Note 7:		Subject to zero- and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 8:		Measured with all other DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 9:		On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time will
          be ignored.
Note 10:		Guaranteed by design.
Note 11:		All channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO for all inputs .
Note 12:		Unconnected conditions on the ADDR_ inputs are sensed through a resistive pullup and pulldown operation; for proper
          operation, ADDR_ inputs must be connected to VDDIO, GND, or left unconnected with minimal capacitance.
