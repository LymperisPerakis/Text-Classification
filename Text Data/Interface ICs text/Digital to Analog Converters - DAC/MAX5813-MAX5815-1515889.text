(VDD = 2.7V to 5.5V, VDDIO = 1.8V to 5.5V, VGND = 0V, CL = 200pF, RL = 2kI, TA = -40NC to +125NC, unless otherwise noted. Typical
values are at TA = +25NC.) (Note 3)
Note 3:  Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over the entire operating temperature range
         are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25°C.
Note 4: DC Performance is tested without load.
Note 5: Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 6: Offset and gain errors are calculated from measurements made with VREF = VDD at code 30 and 4065 for MAX5815,
         code 8 and 1016 for MAX5814, and code 2 and 254 for MAX5813.
Note 7: Subject to zero and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 8: Measured with all other DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 9: On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time will
         be ignored.
Note 10: Guaranteed by design.
Note 11: All channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO.
Note 12: An unconnected condition on the ADDR_ pins is sensed via a resistive pullup and pulldown operation; for proper
          operation, ADDR_ pins should be tied to VDDIO, GND, or left unconnected with minimal capacitance.
