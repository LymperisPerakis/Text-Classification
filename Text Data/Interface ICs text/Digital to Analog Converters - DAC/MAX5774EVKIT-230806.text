                                                                 o -2.5V to +7.5V Output Range
output digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The DAC inte-
grates an SPI™/DSP-compatible serial interface to                o Demonstrates Glitch-Free Power-Up
control each channel output. Each DAC channel has its            o SPI Interface
own programmable input, gain, and offset register, and
its output voltage can be set in the -2.5V to +7.5V range.       o Easy-to-Use Menu-Driven Software
The MAX5774 EV kit circuit includes USB-to-SPI com-              o On-Board SPI Communication Interface Circuitry
munication circuitry that generates the proper SPI sig-            and USB Interface
