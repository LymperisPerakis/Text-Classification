Note 2: Specifications are 100% production tested at TA ≥ +25NC. Specifications for TA < +25NC are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: Configuration register write operation required following power-up for output offset adjustment. See the DAC Outputs sec-
        tion in the Detailed Description. All gain and offset errors include the effect of the internal reference and are guaranteed
        over temperature. Gain error = (measured gain - IGAIN)/IGAIN. Measured gain = (code 16383 DAC output - code 500
        DAC output)/15883. Offset error = code 500 DAC output - (500 x measured gain).
Note 4: Guaranteed by design and characterization. Not production tested. All gain and offset temperature coefficients include
        the effect of the internal reference. Temperature coefficients are calculated by the “box” method. Refer to Application Note
        4300: Calculating the Error Budget in Precision Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) Applications for additional information.
Note 5: Timing characteristics are tested and guaranteed with digital input conditions at VIH = VDDI and VIL = 0V. For VDDI >
        2.2V, I2C fast-mode specifications are met. Reduced SCL clock rate for VDDI < 2.2V.
Note 6: Minimum pulse width required to realize functionally useful DAC transitions. Not production tested. See the Shutter Mode
