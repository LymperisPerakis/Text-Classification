Note 2:    Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25NC. Specifications over the entire operating temperature range
           are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25NC.
Note 3: DC Performance is tested without load.
Note 4: Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 5: Gain and offset calculated from measurements made with VREF = VDD at codes 30 and 4065 for MAX5802, codes 8 and
           1016 for MAX5801, and codes 2 and 254 for MAX5800.
Note 6: Subject to zero and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 7: Measured with the DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 8: On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time will
           be ignored.
Note 9: Guaranteed by design.
Note 10: Both channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO.
Note 11: An unconnected condition on the ADDR pin is sensed via a resistive pullup and pulldown operation; for proper
           operation, the ADDR pin should be tied to VDDIO, GND, or left unconnected with minimal capacitance.

The MAX5800/MAX5801/MAX5802 are fully compatible
with existing I2C systems. SCL and SDA are high-imped-      Figure 8. Typical I2C Application Circuit

line low to transmit data or ACK pulses. Figure 8 shows a
typical I2C application.

Issuing this command with DAC_ADDRESS = ALL is
equivalent to the CODE_ALL_LOAD_ALL command. The
CODEn_LOAD_ALL command by definition will modify at
least one CODE register. To avoid this, use the LOADn
command with DAC SELECTION = ALL DACs or use the
LOAD_ALL command. See Table 4 and Table 5.
