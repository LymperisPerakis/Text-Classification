The MAX525 combines four low-power, voltage-output,                                ♦ Four 12-Bit DACs with Configurable
12-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and four pre-                             Output Amplifiers
cision output amplifiers in a space-saving, 20-pin pack-
                                                                                   ♦ +5V Single-Supply Operation
age. In addition to the four voltage outputs, each
amplifier’s negative input is also available to the user.                          ♦ Low Supply Current: 0.85mA Normal Operation
This facilitates specific gain configurations, remote                                                    10µA Shutdown Mode
sensing, and high output drive capacity, making the                                ♦ Available in 20-Pin SSOP
MAX525 ideal for industrial-process-control applica-
tions. Other features include software shutdown, hard-                             ♦ Power-On Reset Clears all Registers and

Each DAC has a double-buffered input organized as an
input register followed by a DAC register. A 16-bit serial                         ♦ Simultaneous or Independent Control of DACs
word loads data into each input/DAC register. The serial                             through 3-Wire Serial Interface
interface is compatible with SPI™/QSPI™ and                                        ♦ User-Programmable Digital Output

simultaneously updated through the 3-wire serial inter-                                                                                    INL

         Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
         operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
         absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                      Power-Supply Considerations
On power-up, all input and DAC registers are cleared                                    DIP/SSOP
(set to zero code) and DOUT is in Mode 0 (serial data
is shifted out of DOUT on the clock’s falling edge).
For rated MAX525 performance, limit REFAB/REFCD to
less than 1.4V below VDD. Bypass VDD with a 4.7µF
capacitor in parallel with a 0.1µF capacitor to AGND.
Use short lead lengths and place the bypass capaci-
tors as close to the supply pins as possible.
       Grounding and Layout Considerations
Digital or AC transient signals between AGND and
DGND can create noise at the analog outputs. Tie
AGND and DGND together at the DAC, then tie this
point to the highest-quality ground available.
Good printed circuit board ground layout minimizes
crosstalk between DAC outputs, reference inputs, and
digital inputs. Reduce crosstalk by keeping analog
lines away from digital lines. Wire-wrapped boards are
not recommended.
