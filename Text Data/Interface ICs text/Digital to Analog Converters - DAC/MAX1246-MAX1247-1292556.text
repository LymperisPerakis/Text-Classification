The MAX1246/MAX1247 12-bit data-acquisition systems             ♦ 4-Channel Single-Ended or 2-Channel
combine a 4-channel multiplexer, high-bandwidth                   Differential Inputs
track/hold, and serial interface with high conversion
speed and low power consumption. The MAX1246 oper-              ♦ Single-Supply Operation:
ates from a single +2.7V to +3.6V supply; the MAX1247                +2.7V to +3.6V (MAX1246)
operates from a single +2.7V to +5.25V supply. Both                  +2.7V to +5.25V (MAX1247)
devices’ analog inputs are software configurable for            ♦ Internal 2.5V Reference (MAX1246)
unipolar/bipolar and single-ended/differential operation.
                                                                ♦ Low Power: 1.2mA (133ksps, 3V supply)
The 4-wire serial interface connects directly to SPI™/
                                                                                 54µA (1ksps, 3V supply)

The MAX1246 has an internal 2.5V reference, while the
MAX1247 requires an external reference. Both parts have
a reference-buffer amplifier with a ±1.5% voltage-
adjustment range. These devices provide a hard-wired
SHDN pin and a software-selectable power-down, and                                        Ordering Information

                  Note 1: Tested at VDD = 2.7V; COM = 0V; unipolar single-ended input mode.
                  Note 2: Relative accuracy is the deviation of the analog value at any code from its theoretical value after the full-scale range has
                           been calibrated.
                  Note 3: MAX1246—internal reference, offset nulled; MAX1247—external reference (VREF = +2.500V), offset nulled.
                  Note 4: Ground “on” channel; sine wave applied to all “off” channels.
                  Note 5: Conversion time defined as the number of clock cycles multiplied by the clock period; clock has 50% duty cycle.
                  Note 6: The common-mode range for the analog inputs is from AGND to VDD.
                  Note 7: Guaranteed by design. Not subject to production testing.
                  Note 8: External load should not change during conversion for specified accuracy.
                  Note 9: ADC performance is limited by the converter’s noise floor, typically 300µVp-p.
                  Note 10: Measured as |VFS(2.7V) - VFS(VDD.MAX)|.

    2–5           CH0–CH3               Sampling Analog Inputs
                                        Ground reference for analog inputs. COM sets zero-code voltage in single-ended mode. Must be

                                        stable to ±0.5LSB.
                                        Three-Level Shutdown Input. Pulling SHDN low shuts the MAX1246/MAX1247 down; otherwise, they
     7               SHDN               are fully operational. Pulling SHDN high puts the reference-buffer amplifier in internal compensation
                                        mode. Letting SHDN float puts the reference-buffer amplifier in external compensation mode.
                                        Reference-Buffer Output/ADC Reference Input. Reference voltage for analog-to-digital conversion.
                                        In internal reference mode (MAX1246 only), the reference buffer provides a 2.500V nominal output,

                                        externally adjustable at REFADJ. In external reference mode, disable the internal buffer by pulling
                                        REFADJ to VDD.
     9             REFADJ               Input to the Reference-Buffer Amplifier. To disable the reference-buffer amplifier, tie REFADJ to VDD.

    12               DOUT               Serial Data Output. Data is clocked out at SCLK’s falling edge. High impedance when CS is high.
                                        Serial Strobe Output. In internal clock mode, SSTRB goes low when the MAX1246/MAX1247 begin the
                                        A/D conversion, and goes high when the conversion is finished. In external clock mode, SSTRB pulses
    13              SSTRB
                                        high for one clock period before the MSB decision. High impedance when CS is high (external clock
                                        mode).
    14                DIN               Serial Data Input. Data is clocked in at SCLK’s rising edge.
                                        Active-Low Chip Select. Data will not be clocked into DIN unless CS is low. When CS is high, DOUT is
    15                 CS
                                        high impedance.
                                        Serial Clock Input. Clocks data in and out of serial interface. In external clock mode, SCLK also sets
    16               SCLK
                                        the conversion speed. (Duty cycle must be 40% to 60%.)
