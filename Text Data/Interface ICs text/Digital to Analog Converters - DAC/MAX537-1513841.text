                                                                                                                                                 MAX536/MAX537
The MAX536/MAX537 combine four 12-bit, voltage-output                          ♦ Four 12-Bit DACs with Output Buffers
digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and four precision                         ♦ Simultaneous or Independent Control of Four
output amplifiers in a space-saving 16-pin package.                              DACs via a 3-Wire Serial Interface
Offset, gain, and linearity are factory calibrated to provide                  ♦ Power-On Reset
the MAX536’s ±1 LSB total unadjusted error. The                                ♦ SPI/QSPI and MICROWIRE Compatible
MAX537 operates with ±5V supplies, while the MAX536
uses -5V and +10.8V to +13.2V supplies.                                        ♦ ±1 LSB Total Unadjusted Error (MAX536)

Each DAC has a double-buffered input, organized as
an input register followed by a DAC register. A 16-bit                         ♦ ±5V Supply Operation (MAX537)

                Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                Note 3: Crosstalk is defined as the glitch energy at any DAC output in response to a full-scale step change on any other DAC.
                Note 4: Digital inputs at 2.4V; with digital inputs at CMOS levels, IDD decreases slightly.
                Note 5: All input signals are specified with tR = tF ≤ 5ns. Logic input swing is 0 to 5V.
                Note 6: Serial data clocked out of SDO on SCK’s falling edge. (SDO is an open-drain output for the MAX536. The MAX537’s SDO
                        pin has an internal active pullup.)
                Note 7: Serial data clocked out of SDO on SCK’s rising edge.
                Note 8: SDO changes from High-Z state to 90% of final value.
                Note 9: SDO rises 10% toward High-Z state.

Note 2: Guaranteed by design.
Note 3: Crosstalk is defined as the glitch energy at any DAC output in response to a full-scale step change on any other DAC.
Note 4: Digital inputs at 2.4V; with digital inputs at CMOS levels, IDD decreases slightly.
Note 5: All input signals are specified with tR = tF ≤ 5ns. Logic input swing is 0 to 5V.
Note 6: Serial data clocked out of SDO on SCK’s falling edge. (SDO is an open-drain output for the MAX536. The MAX537’s SDO
        pin has an internal active pullup.)
Note 7: Serial data clocked out of SDO on SCK’s rising edge.
Note 10: When disabled, SDO is internally pulled high.

                The MAX536/MAX537 contain four 12-bit voltage-output
                DACs that are easily addressed using a simple 3-wire                                    R              R         R
                                                                                                                                               VOUT
                serial interface. They include a 16-bit data-in/data-out
                shift register, and each DAC has a double-buffered
                input composed of an input register and a DAC register                          2R      2R        2R       2R        2R
                (see the Functional Diagram on the front page).
                                                                                                       D0         D9       D10        D11
                The DACs are “inverted” R-2R ladder networks that
                convert 12-bit digital inputs into equivalent analog out-
                put voltages in proportion to the applied reference-volt-
                age inputs. DAC A and DAC B share the REFAB refer-                      REF
                ence input, while DAC C and DAC D share the REFCD
                                                                                       AGND
                reference input. The two reference inputs allow different
                full-scale output voltage ranges for each pair of DACs.
