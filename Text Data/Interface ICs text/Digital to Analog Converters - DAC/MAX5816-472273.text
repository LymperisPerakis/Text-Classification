Note 2: Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C and/or TA = +125°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and
          relevant supply voltage range are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical values are at TA = +25°C and are
          not guaranteed.
Note 3: DC Performance is tested without load.
Note 4: Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 5: Gain and offset tested at code 4065 and 30, respectively with VREF = VDD.
Note 6: Subject to zero and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 7: Measured with all other DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 8: On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time will
          be ignored.
Note 9: All channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDD.
Note 10:Guaranteed by design.
Note 11:An unconnected condition on the ADDR pin is sensed via a resistive pullup and pulldown operation; for proper operation,
          the ADDR pin should be tied to VDD, GND, or left unconnected with minimal capacitance.

It is not necessary for the write and read mode transfers
to occur immediately in sequence. I2C transfers involving                           µC
other devices do not impact the MAX5816 readback mode.                          SDA     SCL
Toggling between readback modes is based on the length
of the preceding write mode transfer. Combined format I2C                                               MAX5816

only the last command executed is read back. For each

command written, the readback sequence can only be
completed one time; partial and/or multiple attempts to
readback executed in succession will not yield usable data.

The CODEn command updates the CODE register contents for the selected DAC(s). Changes to the CODE register
content based on this command will not affect DAC outputs directly unless the latch has been configured to be trans-
parent (see the CONFIG command). In order to update CODE register content of all DACs, use the CODEn command
with DAC selection = 1XX = all DACs. The CODEn command supports the multibyte protocol. See Table 3 and Table 5.

The LOADn command (B[23:20] = 0001) updates the DAC register content for the selected DAC(s) by uploading the
current contents of the CODE register. The LOADn command can be used with DAC SELECTION = 1XX = ALL DACs
to issue a software load for all DACs, which does not alter the existing content of any CODE register (unlike CODEn_
LOAD_ALL command). See Table 3 and Table 6. The LOADn command supports the multibyte protocol.

Ultra-Small, Quad-Channel, 12-Bit Buffered Output DAC

The CODEn_LOAD_ALL command updates the CODE register contents for the selected DAC(s) as well as the DAC
register content of all DACs. Channels for which the CODE register content has not been modified since the last load
to DAC register will not be updated to reduce digital crosstalk. The CODEn_LOAD_ALL command by definition will
modify at least one CODE register. To avoid this, use the LOADn command with DAC SELECTION = ALL DACs. The
CODEn_LOAD_ALL command supports the multibyte protocol. See Table 3 and Table 7.

The CONFIG command allows independent configurations of the DAC. In normal mode (0), the DAC latch is operational
and responds to LOAD commands. In transparent mode (1), the DAC latch is transparent and CODE register contents
are supplied directly to the DAC outputs. See Table 11.

The REF command updates the global reference setting used for all DAC channels. Set B[1:0] = 00 to use an external
reference for the DACs or set B[1:0] to 01, 10, or 11 to select either the 2.500V, 2.048V, or 4.096V internal reference,
respectively.
If RF2 (B2 = 0) is set to zero (default) in the REF command, the reference will be powered down any time all DAC chan-
nels are powered down (in STANDBY mode). If RF2 is set to one, the reference will remain powered even if all DAC
channels are powered down, allowing continued operation of external circuitry. In this mode the 1µA shutdown state is
not available. See Table 12.
