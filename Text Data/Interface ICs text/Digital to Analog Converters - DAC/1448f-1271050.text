■   12-Bit Resolution                                                    digital-to-analog converter (DAC). It includes rail-to-rail
■   Buffered True Rail-to-Rail Voltage Output                            output buffer amplifiers and an easy-to-use 3-wire serial
■   External Reference Input Can Be Tied to VCC                          interface. It is available in 8-pin SO and PDIP packages and
■   Output Swings from 0V to VREF                                        provides the smallest footprint of any dual 12-bit DAC.
■   3V and 5V Supply Operation                                           The LTC1448 has an external reference input pin (REF)
■   Schmitt Trigger on Clock Input Allows Direct                         and its outputs swing from 0V to REF. The REF input can
    Optocoupler Interface                                                be tied to VCC providing rail-to-rail operation from supplies
■   Power-On Reset Clears DACs to 0V
                                                                         of 2.7V to 5.5V. (For devices with internal reference see the
■   3-Wire Serial Interface                                              LTC1446 data sheet.) The LTC1448 dissipates 2.5mW
