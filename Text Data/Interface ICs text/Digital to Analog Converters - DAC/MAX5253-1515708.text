The MAX5253 combines four low-power, voltage-output,                                ♦ Four 12-Bit DACs with Configurable
12-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and four pre-                              Output Amplifiers

age. In addition to the four voltage outputs, each
amplifier’s negative input is also available to the user.                           ♦ Low Supply Current: 0.82mA Normal Operation
This facilitates specific gain configurations, remote                                                      3µA Shutdown Mode

ware shutdown lockout, an active-low reset which clears                             ♦ Power-On Reset Clears all Registers and
all registers and DACs to zero, a user-programmable                                   DACs to Zero

Each DAC has a double-buffered input organized as an                                ♦ Simultaneous or Independent Control of DACs
input register followed by a DAC register. A 16-bit serial                            Through 3-Wire Serial Interface

interface is compatible with SPI™/QSPI™ and

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                   Power-Supply Considerations
On power-up, all input and DAC registers are cleared                                    DIP/SSOP
(set to zero code) and DOUT is in Mode 0 (serial data
is shifted out of DOUT on the clock’s falling edge).
For rated MAX5253 performance, limit REFAB/REFCD
to less than 1.4V below VDD. Bypass VDD with a 4.7µF
capacitor in parallel with a 0.1µF capacitor to AGND.
Use short lead lengths and place the bypass capaci-
tors as close to the supply pins as possible.
       Grounding and Layout Considerations
Digital or AC transient signals between AGND and
DGND can create noise at the analog outputs. Tie
AGND and DGND together at the DAC, then tie this
point to the highest-quality ground available.
Good printed circuit board ground layout minimizes
crosstalk between DAC outputs, reference inputs, and
digital inputs. Reduce crosstalk by keeping analog
lines away from digital lines. Wire-wrapped boards are
not recommended.
