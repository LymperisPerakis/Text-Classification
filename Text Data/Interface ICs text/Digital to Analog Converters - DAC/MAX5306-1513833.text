The MAX5306/MAX5307 are 12-bit, eight channel, low-            ♦ Eight Highly Integrated 12-Bit DACs in
power, voltage-output, digital-to-analog converters              16-Pin TSSOP (6.4mm x 5mm) Package
(DACs) in a space-saving 16-pin TSSOP package. The
wide +2.7V to +5.5V supply voltage range and less              ♦ Ultra-Low Glitch Energy < 2nV/s
than 215µA (max) supply current per DAC are excellent          ♦ Low Total Supply Current:
for low-power and low-voltage applications. The low

2nV/s glitch energy of the MAX5306/MAX5307 makes
them ideal for digital control of fast-response, closed-       ♦ +2.7V to +5.5V Wide Single-Supply Range
loop systems.                                                  ♦ Fast 5µs Settling Time
The MAX5306 has a digital output (DOUT) that can be
used for daisy-chaining multiple devices. The MAX5307          ♦ Software-Selectable Shutdown Mode < 1µA
has a hardware reset input (CLR) which clears all regis-       ♦ 15MHz 3-Wire SPI, QSPI, and MICROWIRE-
ters and DACs to zero. The MAX5306/MAX5307 have a                Compatible Serial Interface
software shutdown feature that reduces the supply cur-
rent to 1µA. The MAX5306/MAX5307 feature a load                ♦ Power-Up Reset to Zero Scale
DAC (LDAC) function that updates the output of all
eight DACs simultaneously.
The 3-wire SPI™, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™ and DSP-
compatible serial interface allows the input and DAC
registers to be updated independently or simultaneous-
ly with a single software command. These devices use                                     Ordering Information
