  Power Supply and Layout Considerations
Careful PC board layout is important for optimal system
performance. To reduce noise injection and digital feed-
through and keep analog and digital signals separate.
Ensure that that the return path from GND to the supply
ground is short and low impedance. Use a ground
plane. Bypass VDD to GND with a 0.1µF capacitor as
close as possible to VDD.
