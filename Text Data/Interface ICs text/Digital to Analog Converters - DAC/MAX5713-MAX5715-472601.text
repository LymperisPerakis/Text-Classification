Note 3:      Electrical specifications are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over the entire operating temperature range
             are guaranteed by design and characterization. Typical specifications are at TA = +25°C.
Note 4:      DC Performance is tested without load.
Note 5:      Linearity is tested with unloaded outputs to within 20mV of GND and VDD.
Note 6:      Offset and gain errors are calculated from measurements made with VREF = VDD at code 30 and 4065 for MAX5715,
             code 8 and 1016 for MAX5714, and code 2 and 254 for MAX5713.
Note 7:      Subject to zero and full-scale error limits and VREF settings.
Note 8:      Measured with all other DAC outputs at midscale with one channel transitioning 0 to full scale.
Note 9:      On power-up, the device initiates an internal 200µs (typ) calibration sequence. All commands issued during this time will
             be ignored.
Note  10:    Guaranteed by design.
Note  11:    All channels active at VFS, unloaded. Static logic inputs with VIL = VGND and VIH = VDDIO.
Note  12:    Daisy-chain speed is relaxed to accommodate (tCRF + tCSS0) with margin (derived specification, not production tested).
Note  13:   This specification and its propagation through the chain limits how quickly an aborted daisy-chain command can be fol-
             lowed by another daisy-chain command, to be applied on a per-device basis.

Offset error indicates how well the actual transfer function
matches the ideal transfer function. The offset error is
calculated from two measurements near zero code and
near maximum code.
