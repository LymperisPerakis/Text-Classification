The ISL32490E, ISL32492E, ISL32493E, ISL32495E,
ISL32496E, and ISL32498E are fault protected, 5V powered,

The transmitters (Tx) deliver an exceptional 2.5V (typical)
differential output voltage into the RS-485 specified 54Ω load.       • Hot plug circuitry; Tx and Rx outputs remain three-state

NOTES:
  1. See TB347 for details about reel specifications.
  2. These Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte tin plate
      plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Pb-free products are
      MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.
  3. For Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL), see the ISL32490E, ISL32492E, ISL32493E, ISL32495E, ISL32496E, and ISL32498E device information pages.
      For more information about MSL, see TB363.

   RO      1      1        2     Receiver output. If A-B ≥ -10mV, RO is high; if A-B ≤ -200mV, RO is low; if A and B are unconnected (floating), shorted
                                 together, or connected to an undriven, terminated bus, RO is high.
   RE      2      2        3     Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high. Internally pulled low.
   DE      3      3        4     Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high impedance when DE is
                                 low. Internally pulled high.
   DI      4      4        5     Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. A high on DI forces output Y high and output Z low.
  GND      5      5       6, 7   Ground connection.
  A/Y      6       -        -    ±60V fault and ±16.5kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, non-inverting receiver input and non-inverting driver
                                 output. Pin is an input if DE = 0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
  B/Z      7       -        -    ±60V fault and ±16.5kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, inverting receiver input and inverting driver output.
                                 Pin is an input if DE = 0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
    A      -      9       12     ±60V fault and ±15kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, non-inverting receiver input.

 NOTES:
   4. θJA is measured with the component mounted on a high-effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See TB379 for details.
   5. For θJC, the “case temp” location is taken at the package top center.
Electrical Specifications VCC = 4.5V to 5.5V; unless otherwise specified. Typical values are at VCC = 5V, TA = +25°C (Note 6). Boldface
limits apply across the operating temperature range, -40°C to +85°C.

NOTES:
  6. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
  7. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
  8. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 11 for more information.
  9. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
10. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
11. Transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for fewer than 60ns, the parts are ensured not to
     enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are ensured to enter shutdown. See “Low Power Shutdown Mode” on
     page 16.
12. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
13. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
14. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization, and/or design.
15. Tested according to TIA/EIA-485-A, Section 4.2.6 (±80V for 15µs at a 1% duty cycle).
16. See “Caution” statement following “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on page 5.
17. This parameter is not production tested.
