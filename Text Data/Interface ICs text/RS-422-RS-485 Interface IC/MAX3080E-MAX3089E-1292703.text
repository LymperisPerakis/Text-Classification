Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
        ground unless otherwise noted.
Note 2: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 3: The SRL pin is internally biased to VCC / 2 by a 100kΩ/100kΩ resistor-divider. It is guaranteed to be VCC / 2 if left
        unconnected.
Note 4: Maximum current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; minimum current level applies during
        current limiting.

                    The standard RS-485 receiver input impedance is 12kΩ            expresses this relationship conservatively:
                    (one-unit load), and the standard driver can drive up to                      Length = tRISE / (10 x 1.5ns/ft)
                    32 unit loads. The MAX3080E family of transceivers
                    have a 1/8-unit-load receiver input impedance (96kΩ),           where tRISE is the transmitter’s rise time.
