exceed the hysteresis levels on the logic and data input
pins causing an unintended state change. This can be
avoided by maintaining normal logic levels on the pins
and by slewing inputs through their thresholds by faster
than 1V/µs when transitioning. Good supply decoupling
and proper driver termination also reduce glitches caused
by driver transitions.
