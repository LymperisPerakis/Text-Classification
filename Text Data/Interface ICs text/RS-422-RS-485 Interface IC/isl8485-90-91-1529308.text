The ISL8485, ISL8490, and ISL8491 RS-485/RS-422                Features
devices are BiCMOS 5V powered, single transceivers that
meet both the RS-485 and RS-422 standards for balanced         • Specified for 10% tolerance supplies

specified for 10% tolerance supplies (4.5V to 5.5V).
                                                               • High data rates: up to 5Mbps

All devices present a single unit load to the RS-485 bus,
which allows up to 32 transceivers on the network.             • -7V to +12V common-mode input voltage range

NOTE:
   1. Refer to TB347 for details about reel specifications.
   2. Pb-free plus anneal products employ special Pb-free material sets; molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte tin plate
      termination finish, which are RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations. Pb-free products are MSL
      classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.
   3. For Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL), refer to the ISL8485, ISL8490, and ISL8491 product information pages. For more information about MSL,
      refer to TB363.
   4. Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through hole wave solder processing only. They are not intended for use in Reflow solder processing applications

    RO      Receiver output: RO is high if A > B by at least 0.2V; RO is low if A < B by 0.2V or more; RO = high if A and B are unconnected (floating).
    RE      Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high.
    DE      Driver output enable. The driver outputs Y and Z are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high impedance when DE is low.
    DI      Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. Similarly, a high on DI forces output Y high and output Z low.
   GND      Ground connection.
    A/Y     Noninverting receiver input and noninverting driver output. Pin is an input (A) if DE = 0; pin is an output (Y) if DE = 1.
    B/Z     Inverting receiver input and inverting driver output. Pin is an input (B) if DE = 0; pin is an output (Z) if DE = 1.
     A      Noninverting receiver input.
     B      Inverting receiver input.
     Y      Noninverting driver output.
     Z      Inverting driver output.
   VCC      System power supply input (4.5V to 5.5V).
    NC      No connection.

NOTES:
 7. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless
     otherwise specified.
 8. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
 9. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” on page 10 for more information.
10. Devices meeting these limits are denoted as “single unit load (1 UL)” transceivers. The RS-485 standard allows up to 32 unit loads on the bus.
11. Ensured by characterization, but not tested.

Driver Features
The RS-485/RS-422 driver is a differential output device that
delivers at least 1.5V across a 54Ω load (RS-485), and at least
2V across a 100Ω load (RS-422). The drivers feature low
propagation delay skew to maximize bit width and to minimize
EMI.
The ISL8485 and ISL8491 drivers are three-statable using the
active high DE input.
The ISL8485 and ISL8491 driver outputs are not limited, so
faster output transition times allow data rates of at least
5Mbps.

 1.   Descriptions of circuits, software and other related information in this document are provided only to illustrate the operation of semiconductor products and application examples. You are fully responsible for
      the incorporation or any other use of the circuits, software, and information in the design of your product or system. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any losses and damages incurred by
      you or third parties arising from the use of these circuits, software, or information.
 2.   Renesas Electronics hereby expressly disclaims any warranties against and liability for infringement or any other claims involving patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights of third parties, by or
      arising from the use of Renesas Electronics products or technical information described in this document, including but not limited to, the product data, drawings, charts, programs, algorithms, and application
      examples.
 3.   No license, express, implied or otherwise, is granted hereby under any patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Renesas Electronics or others.
 4.   You shall not alter, modify, copy, or reverse engineer any Renesas Electronics product, whether in whole or in part. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any losses or damages incurred by
      you or third parties arising from such alteration, modification, copying or reverse engineering.
 5.   Renesas Electronics products are classified according to the following two quality grades: “Standard” and “High Quality”. The intended applications for each Renesas Electronics product depends on the
      product’s quality grade, as indicated below.
      "Standard":       Computers; office equipment; communications equipment; test and measurement equipment; audio and visual equipment; home electronic appliances; machine tools; personal electronic
                         equipment; industrial robots; etc.
      "High Quality": Transportation equipment (automobiles, trains, ships, etc.); traffic control (traffic lights); large-scale communication equipment; key financial terminal systems; safety control equipment; etc.
      Unless expressly designated as a high reliability product or a product for harsh environments in a Renesas Electronics data sheet or other Renesas Electronics document, Renesas Electronics products are
      not intended or authorized for use in products or systems that may pose a direct threat to human life or bodily injury (artificial life support devices or systems; surgical implantations; etc.), or may cause
      serious property damage (space system; undersea repeaters; nuclear power control systems; aircraft control systems; key plant systems; military equipment; etc.). Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all
      liability for any damages or losses incurred by you or any third parties arising from the use of any Renesas Electronics product that is inconsistent with any Renesas Electronics data sheet, user’s manual or
      other Renesas Electronics document.
 6.   When using Renesas Electronics products, refer to the latest product information (data sheets, user’s manuals, application notes, “General Notes for Handling and Using Semiconductor Devices” in the
      reliability handbook, etc.), and ensure that usage conditions are within the ranges specified by Renesas Electronics with respect to maximum ratings, operating power supply voltage range, heat dissipation
      characteristics, installation, etc. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any malfunctions, failure or accident arising out of the use of Renesas Electronics products outside of such specified
        CONFIDENTIAL
      ranges.
 7.   Although Renesas Electronics endeavors to improve the quality and reliability of Renesas Electronics products, semiconductor products have specific characteristics, such as the occurrence of failure at a
      certain rate and malfunctions under certain use conditions. Unless designated as a high reliability product or a product for harsh environments in a Renesas Electronics data sheet or other Renesas
      Electronics document, Renesas Electronics products are not subject to radiation resistance design. You are responsible for implementing safety measures to guard against the possibility of bodily injury, injury
      or damage caused by fire, and/or danger to the public in the event of a failure or malfunction of Renesas Electronics products, such as safety design for hardware and software, including but not limited to
      redundancy, fire control and malfunction prevention, appropriate treatment for aging degradation or any other appropriate measures. Because the evaluation of microcomputer software alone is very difficult
      and impractical, you are responsible for evaluating the safety of the final products or systems manufactured by you.

      laws and regulations.
