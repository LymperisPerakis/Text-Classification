Note 1: Voltages exceeding VCC or GND on any signal terminal are clamped by internal diodes. Limit forward-diode current to
               maximum current rating.
Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

Note                  2:
        Thin QFN packages are production tested at TA = +85°C. Limits over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note                  3:
        The algebraic convention used in this data sheet is where the most negative value is the minimum column.
Note                  4:
        ∆RON = RON(MAX) - RON(MIN).
Note                  5:
        Flatness is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value of on-resistance as measured over the
        specified analog signal ranges.
Note 6: Leakage parameters are 100% tested at the maximum-rated hot operating temperature and guaranteed by design at
        TA = +25°C.
Note 7: Guaranteed by design, not production tested.
