Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications for all temperature limits are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
        ground, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: ΔV­OD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 4: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
Note 5: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 6: Shutdown is enabled by driving RE high and DE low. The device is guaranteed to have entered shutdown after tSHDN has
        elapsed.
Note 7: The timing parameter refers to the driver or receiver enable delay, when the device has exited the initial hot-swap protect
        state and is in normal operating mode.
