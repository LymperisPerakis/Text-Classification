Description
The SP3490 and SP3491 are two members in the family                   Receivers
of 3.3V low power full-duplex transceivers that meet the              The receivers of the SP3490 and SP3491 have differential
electrical specifications of the RS-485 and RS-422 serial             inputs with an input sensitivity of ±200mV. Input impedance

MaxLinear SP490 and SP491 devices as well as popular                  common mode range of -7V to 12V allows for large ground
industry standards. The SP3490 and SP3491 feature                     potential differences between systems. The receivers for
MaxLinear’s BiCMOS process allowing low power operation               both the SP3490 and SP3491 are equipped with a fail-
without sacrificing performance.                                      safe feature that guarantees the receiver output will be in a
                                                                      HIGH state when the input is left unconnected.
The RS-485 standard is ideal for multi-drop applications and
for long-distance interfaces. RS-485 allows up to 32 drivers          The receiver of the SP3491 has a enable control line which

it an ideal choice for multi-drop applications. Since the             will enable the differential receiver. A logic HIGH on REB
cabling can be as long as 4,000 feet, RS-485 transceivers             (pin 3) of the SP3491 will tri-state the receiver.
are equipped with a wide (-7V to 12V) common mode range
to accommodate ground potential differences. Because
RS-485 is a differential interface, data is virtually immune to
noise in the transmission line.
Drivers
The drivers for both the SP3490 and SP3491 have
differential outputs. The typical voltage output swing with
no load will be 0 volts to Vcc. With worst case loading of
54Ω across the differential outputs, the drivers can maintain
greater than 1.5V voltage levels.
The driver of the SP3491 has a driver enable control line
which is active HIGH. A logic HIGH on DE (pin 4) of the
SP3491 will enable the differential driver outputs. A logic
LOW on the DE (pin 4) will tri-state the driver outputs. The
SP3490 does not have a driver enable.
