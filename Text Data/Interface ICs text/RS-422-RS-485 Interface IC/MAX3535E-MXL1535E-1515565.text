 Note 1:    Receiver inputs are 96kΩ minimum resistance, which is 1/8 unit load.
 Note 2:    60s test result is guaranteed by correlation from 1s result.
 Note 3:    VISO is the voltage difference between GND1 and GND2.
 Note 4:    The maximum data rate is specified using the maximum jitter value according to the formula: data rate = 1 / (4tJ). See the
            Skew section for more information.
 Note 5: Initial startup time is the time for communication to recover after a fault condition. Internal communication timeout fault time
            is the time before a fault is indicated on RE, after internal communication has stopped.
 Note 6: Bd = 2 bits.
