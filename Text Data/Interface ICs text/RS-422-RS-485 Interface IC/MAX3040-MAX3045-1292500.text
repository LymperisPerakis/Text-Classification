                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                  Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
                          ground unless otherwise noted.
                  Note 2: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the transmitter input changes state.
                  Note 3: This input current level is for the hot-swap enable (EN_, EN, EN) inputs and is present until the first transition only. After the
                          first transition the input reverts to a standard high-impedance CMOS input with input current IIN. For the first 20µs the input
                          current may be as high as 1mA. During this period the input is disabled.
                  Note 4: Maximum current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting. Minimum current level applies during
                          current limiting.

When circuit boards are plugged into a “hot” back-                                               PULSE
plane, there can be disturbances to the differential sig-
nal levels that could be detected by receivers
connected to the transmission line. This erroneous data
could cause data errors to an RS-485/RS-422 system.
To avoid this, the MAX3040–MAX3045 have hot-swap
capable inputs.                                                                 REPETITION PERIOD (DEPENDS ON THE TEST VOLTAGE LEVER,
