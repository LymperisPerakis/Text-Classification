                    Note 1: All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to logic-
                            side ground (GND_), unless otherwise specified.
                    Note 2: For DE´ and DI´ pin descriptions, see Detailed Block Diagram and Typical Application Circuit (Figure 1 for MAX1480EA/
                            MAX1480EC, Figure 2 for MAX1490EA/MAX1490EB).
                    Note 3: Shutdown supply current is the current at VCC1 and VCC2 when shutdown is enabled.
                    Note 4: Limit guaranteed by applying 1520VRMS for 1s. Test voltage is applied between all pins on one side of the package to all
                            pins on the other side of the package, e.g., between pins 1–14 and pins 15–28 on the 28-pin package.
                    Note 5: Applies to peak current (see Typical Operating Characteristics). Although the MAX1480EA/MAX1480EC and
                            MAX1490EA/MAX1490EB provide electrical isolation between logic ground and signal paths, they do not provide isolation
                            between external shields and the signal paths (see Isolated Common Connection section).

This device is constructed using a unique set of packaging
techniques that impose a limit on the thermal profile the device
can be exposed to during board-level solder attach and
rework. Maxim recommends the use of the solder profiles rec-
ommended in the industry-standard specification, JEDEC
020A, paragraph 7.6, Table 3 for IR/VPR and Convection
Reflow processes. Preheating, per this standard, is required.
Hand or wave soldering is not recommended.
Maxim cannot assume responsibility for use of any circuitry other than circuitry entirely embodied in a Maxim product. No circuit patent licenses are
implied. Maxim reserves the right to change the circuitry and specifications without notice at any time.
