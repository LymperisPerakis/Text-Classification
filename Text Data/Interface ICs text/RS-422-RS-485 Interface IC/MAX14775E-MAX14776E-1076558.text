Switching Electrical Characteristics (MAX14776E) (continued)
(VCC = 3.0V to 5.5V, TA = TMIN to TMAX, unless otherwise noted. Typical values are at VCC = 3.3V and TA = +25°C.) (Note 2)
Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 4: The short-circuit current is 200mA (max) for a short period (35μs, typ). If the short circuit persists, the outputs are then set
          to high impedance for 300ms (typ).
Note 5: Shutdown is enabled when RE is high and DE is low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device is
          guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are held in this state for at least 800ns, the device is guaranteed to
          have entered shutdown.
Note 6: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
Note 7: Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
