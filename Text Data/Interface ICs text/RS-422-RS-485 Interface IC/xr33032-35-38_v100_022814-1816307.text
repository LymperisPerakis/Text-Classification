GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                        FEATURES
The XR33032/35/38 family of high performance half           +2.8V to +5.5V Operating Range
duplex RS-485 transceivers are optimized to operate
                                                            ±18V Fault Tolerance on Analog Bus pins
over a wide range of supply voltage, from +2.8V to
+5.5V. The analog bus pins can withstand direct shorts      Robust ESD (ElectroStatic Discharge) Protection:
up to ±18V, and are protected against ESD events up             ■ ±15kV IEC 61000-4-2 Air Gap Discharge
to ±15kV.                                                       ■ ± 8kV IEC 61000-4-2 Contact Discharge
                                                                ■ ±15kV Human Body Model
In an isolated application it may be more efficient to
use a remote power supply rather than generating an             ■ ± 4kV Human Body Model on non-bus pins
isolated supply at every node. The XR33032/35/38            300µA Idle Current, 40nA Shutdown Current
transceivers can operate with more than 2V IR drop in       Enhanced Receiver Fail-Safe Protection for Open,
the cable when utilizing a remote 5V power supply.            Shorted, or Terminated but Idle Data Lines
The transceivers draw less than 600µA, and typically
only 300µA when idling with the receivers active.           Hot-Swap Glitch Protection on DE and RE Pins
                                                            Driver Short Circuit Current Limit and Thermal
The receivers include full fail-safe circuitry, guarantee-    Shutdown for Overload Protection
ing a logic-high receiver output when the receiver
                                                            1/8th Unit Load Allows up to 256 Devices on Bus
inputs are open, shorted, or undriven. The receiver
input impedance is 96k (1/8 unit load), allowing up to     Industry Standard 8 NSOIC Half Duplex Package
256 devices on the bus while preserving the full signal
margin.
The drivers are protected by short circuit detection as    TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
well as thermal shutdown, and maintain high imped-
ance in shutdown or when powered off. The XR33032           Isolated Multipoint RS-485 Data Buses
and XR33035 drivers are slew limited for reduced EMI        Remote Nodes Powered by the Host
and error-free communication over long or untermi-
nated data cables.                                          Building Automation and HVAC
                                                            Industrial Process Control Networks
The DE and RE pins include hot swap circuitry to pre-

NOTE:
    1. Change in Magnitude of Differential Output Voltage and Change in Magnitude of Common Mode Output Voltage
       are the changes in output voltage when DI input changes state.
    2. The hot swap feature disables the DE and RE inputs for the first 10µs after power is applied. Following this time
       period these inputs are weakly pulled to their disabled state (low for DE, high for RE) until the first transition, after
       which they become high impedance inputs.
    3. The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE High and DE Low simultaneously for at least 600ns. If the
       control inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device is guaranteed to not enter shutdown. If the enable
       inputs are held in this state for at least 600ns the device is assured to be in shutdown. Note that the receiver and
       driver enable times increase significantly when coming out of shutdown.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The XR33032/35/38 RS-485/422 devices are part of Exar’s high performance serial interface product line. The
analog bus pins can survive direct shorts up to ±18V, and are protected against ESD events up to ±15kV.
ENHANCED FAILSAFE
Standard RS-485 differential receivers will be in an indeterminate state whenever the analog bus pins are not
being driven. The enhanced failsafe feature of the XR33032/35/38 family guarantees a logic-high receiver
output when the receiver inputs are open, shorted, or when they are connected to a terminated transmission
line with all drivers disabled. In a terminated bus with all transmitters disabled, the receivers’ differential input
voltage is pulled to 0V by the termination. The XR33032/35/38 family interprets 0V differential as a logic high
with a minimum 50mV noise margin while maintaining compliance with the EIA/TIA-485 standard of ±200mV.
Although the XR33032/35/38 family does not need failsafe biasing resistors, it can operate without issue if
biasing is used.
RECEIVER INPUT FILTERING
XR33032 and XR33035 receivers incorporate internal filtering in addition to input hysteresis. This filtering
enhances noise immunity by ignoring signals that do not meet a minimum pulse width of 30ns. Receiver
propagation delay increases slightly due to this filtering. The high speed XR33038 device does not have this
input filtering.
HOT-SWAP CAPABILITY
When VCC is first applied the driver enable and receiver enable (DE and RE) are held inactive for
approximately 10 microseconds. During power ramp-up other system ICs may drive unpredictable values, or
tristated lines may be influenced by stray capacitance. The hot-swap feature prevents these devices from
driving any output signal until power has stabilized. After the initial 10µs, the driver and receiver enable pins are
weakly pulled to their disabled states (low for DE, high for RE) until the first transition. After the first transition,
the DE and RE pins operate as high impedance inputs.
If circuit boards are inserted into an energized backplane (commonly called "live insertion" or "hot-swap")
power may suddenly be applied to all circuits. Without the hot-swap capability, this situation could improperly
enable the transceiver’s driver or receiver, driving invalid data onto shared busses and possibly causing driver
contention or device damage.
DRIVER OUTPUT PROTECTION
Two mechanisms prevent excessive output current and power dissipation caused by faults or by bus
contention. First, a driver current limit on the output stage provides immediate protection against short circuits
over the whole common-mode voltage range. Second, a thermal-shutdown circuit forces the driver outputs into
a high-impedance state if junction temperature becomes excessive.
LINE LENGTH and TERMINATIONS
The RS-485/RS-422 standard covers line lengths up to 4000ft. Maximum achievable line length is a function of
the data rate, cable characteristics and environmental noise. Termination prevents signal reflections by
eliminating the impedance mismatches on a transmission line. Line termination is generally used if rise and fall
times are shorter than the round-trip signal propagation time. Higher supply voltage will allow longer cables to
be used.

±15kV ESD PROTECTION
ESD protection structures are incorporated on all pins to protect against electrostatic discharges encountered
during handling, assembly and operation. The driver outputs and receiver inputs of the XR33032/35/38 have
extra protection against static electricity. Exar uses state of the art structures to protect these pins against ESD
of ±15kV without damage. The ESD structures withstand high ESD in all states: normal operation, shutdown
and powered down. After an ESD event, the XR33032/35/38 keep operating without latch-up or damage.
ESD protection can be tested in various ways. The transmitter outputs and receiver inputs of the XR33032/35/
38 are characterized for protection to the following limits:
     ■ ±15kV using the Human Body Model
     ■ ± 8kV Contact Discharge Model
     ■ ±15kV Air-gap Discharge Model
IEC 61000-4-2
The IEC 61000-4-2 standard covers ESD testing and performance of finished equipment. However, it does not
specifically refer to integrated circuits. The XR33032/35/38 family helps you design equipment to meet
IEC 61000-4-2, without sacrificing board-space and cost for external ESD-protection components.
The major differences between tests done using the Human body model and IEC 61000-4-2 is a higher peak
current in IEC 61000-4-2. Series resistance is lower in the IEC 61000-4-2 model. Hence, the ESD withstand
voltage measured to IEC 61000-4-2 is generally lower than that of human body model.
The air-gap test involves approaching the device with a charged probe. The contact discharge method
connects the probe to the device before the probe is energized.
256 TRANSCEIVERS ON THE BUS
The standard RS-485 receiver input impedance is 12k Ohms (1 unit load). A standard driver can drive up to 32
unit loads. The XR33032/35/38 transceivers have a 1/8th unit load receiver input impedance of 96k, allowing
up to 256 transceivers to be connected in parallel on a communication line. Any combination of these devices
and other RS-485 transceivers up to a total of 32 unit loads may be connected to the line.
LOW POWER SHUTDOWN MODE
Low-power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing both RE high and DE low simultaneously. While in shutdown
devices draw less than 1µA of supply current. DE and RE may be tied together and driven by a single control
signal. Devices are guaranteed not to enter shutdown if RE is high and DE is low for less than 50ns. If the
inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts will enter shutdown.
Enable times tZH and tZL apply when the part is not in low-power shutdown state. Enable times tZH(SHDN) and
tZL(SHDN) apply when the parts are shutdown. The drivers and receivers take longer to become enabled from
low-power shutdown tZH(SHDN) and tZL(SHDN) than from driver / receiver disable mode (tZH and tZL).
