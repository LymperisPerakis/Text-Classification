                                                                                                   DESCRIPTION
The SP483 and SP485 are a family of half-duplex transceivers that meet the specifications
of RS-485 and RS-422. Their BiCMOS design allows low power operation without sacrificing
performance. The SP485 meets the requirements of RS-485 and RS-422 up to 5Mbps. Ad-
ditionally, the SP483 is equipped with a low power Shutdown mode. The SP483 is internally
slew rate limited to reduce EMI and can meet the requirements of RS-485 and RS-422 up
to 250kbps.
