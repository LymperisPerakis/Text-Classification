switching and low skew make the MAX3362 ideal for                       • Half-Duplex Operation
multidrop clock/data distribution applications.                         • Interoperable with +5V Logic
The output level is guaranteed at +1.5V with a standard             ●● Low Power Consumption Minimizes
54Ω load, compliant with RS-485 specifications. The                     Thermal Dissipation
transceiver draws 1.7mA supply current when unloaded                    • Operates from a Single +3.3V Supply
or fully loaded with the drivers disabled. Additionally, the            • 1.7mA Operating Supply Current
MAX3362 has a low-power shutdown mode, reducing the                     • 1μA Low-Power Shutdown Mode
supply current to 1μA.
                                                                    ●● Space-Saving 8-Pin SOT Package
The MAX3362 has a 1/8-unit-load receiver input
impedance, allowing up to 256 transceivers on the bus.              ●● Protection Features and Wide Temperature Range
The MAX3362 is designed for half-duplex communication.                  Increase System Reliability in Harsh Environments
The device has a hot-swap feature that eliminates false                 • Current Limiting and Thermal Shutdown
transitions on the data cable during circuit initialization.            • Automotive Temperature Range Variants
The drivers are short-circuit current limited, and a
thermal shutdown circuit protects against excessive                 Ordering Information
power dissipation.

Note 1: Devices production tested at +25°C. Over-temperature limits are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
         ground, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 4: The short-circuit output current applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; the short-circuit foldback output
         current applies during current limiting to allow a recovery from bus contention.
Note 5: Shutdown is enabled by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device is
         guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the device is guaranteed to have
         entered shutdown.
Note 6: Transition time from shutdown mode to normal operation.

                                  (RE is low). RO is low if the receiver input differential (A-B) ≤ -200mV and the receiver is enabled.
                                  Receiver Output Enable. Driving RE low enables RO. RO is high impedance when RE is high. Drive RE
