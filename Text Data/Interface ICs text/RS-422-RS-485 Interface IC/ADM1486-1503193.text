ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on
the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.

Table 4. Pin Function Descriptions
Pin No.    Mnemonic      Description
1          RO            Receiver Output. When enabled, if A > B by 200 mV, RO = high. If A < B by 200 mV, RO = low.
2          RE            Receiver Output Enable. A low level enables the receiver output, RO. A high level places it in a high impedance
                         state.
3          DE            Driver Output Enable. A high level enables the driver differential outputs, A and B. A low level places it in a high
                         impedance state.
4          DI            Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high, while a logic high on DI forces
                         A high and B low.
5          GND           Ground Connection, 0 V.
