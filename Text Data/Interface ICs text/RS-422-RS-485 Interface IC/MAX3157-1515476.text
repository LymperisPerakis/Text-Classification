          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

          Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
                  ground unless otherwise noted.
          Note 2: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
          Note 3: Current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting.
          Note 4: The device is put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns,
                  the device is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 700ns, the device is guaran-
                  teed to have entered shutdown.
