Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
           respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: VLDO max indicates voltage capability of the circuit. Power dissipation requirements may limit VLDO max to a lower value.
Note 5: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 6: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the TXD input changes state.
Note 7: The short-circuit output current applies to the peak current just prior to current limiting.
Note 8: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output states. CMTI
           applies to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between
           GNDA and GNDB.

                                 unconnected or connected to GNDB), VDDB is the positive supply input for the cable-side
