  Notes:
   1. Refer to TB347 for details about reel specifications.
   2. These Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100%
       matte tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering
       operations). Pb-free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free
       requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.
   3. For Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL), see the product information pages for the ISL3150E, ISL3152E, ISL3153E, ISL3155E,
       ISL3156E, and ISL3158E. For more information about MSL, see TB363.

  Notes:
   8. All currents in to device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground
      unless otherwise specified.
   9. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
  10. Applies to peak current. See “Performance Curves” beginning on page 14 for more information.
  11. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
  12. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
  13. Transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts are
      guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered
      shutdown. See “Low Current Shutdown Mode” on page 20.
  14. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
  15. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
  16. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by
      characterization and are not production tested.
  17. See Figure 11 on page 14 for more information and for performance over temperature.
  18. Limits established by characterization and are not production tested.

 5.      Device Description
   5.1        Overview
       The ISL3150E, ISL3153E, and ISL3156E are full-duplex RS-485 transceivers, and the ISL3152E, ISL3155E, and
       ISL3158E are half-duplex RS-485 transceivers. All transceivers feature a large output signal swing that is 60%
       higher than standard compliant transceivers. The devices are available in three speed grades suitable for data
       transmission up to 115kbps, 1Mbps, and 20Mbps.
       Each transceiver has an active-high driver enable and an active-low receiver enable function. A shutdown current
       as low as 70nA can be accomplished by disabling both the driver and receiver for more than 600ns.

   5.3        Operating Modes
    5.3.1         Driver Operation
           A logic high at the driver enable pin, DE, activates the driver and causes the differential driver outputs, Y and Z,
           to follow the logic states at the data input, DI.
           A logic high at DI causes Y to turn high and Z to turn low. In this case, the differential output voltage, defined
           as VOD = VY – VZ, is positive. A logic low at DI reverses the output states reverse, turning Y low and Z high,
           thus making VOD negative.
           A logic low at DE disables the driver, making Y and Z high-impedance. In this condition the logic state at DI is
           irrelevant. To ensure the driver remains disabled after device power-up, it is recommended to connect DE
           through a 1kΩ to 10kΩ pull-down resistor to ground.

                    5.3.2                           Receiver Operation
                                            A logic low at the receiver enable pin, RE, activates the receiver and causes its output, RO, to follow the bus
                                            voltage at the differential receiver inputs, A and B. Here, the bus voltage is defined as VAB = VA - VB.
                                            For VAB ≥ -0.05V, RO turns high, and for VAB ≤ -0.2V, RO turns low. For input voltages between -50mV and
                                            -200mV, the state of RO is undetermined, and thus could be high or low.
                                            A logic high at RE disables the receiver, making RO high-impedance. In this condition the polarity and
                                            magnitude of the input voltage is irrelevant. To ensure the receiver output remains high when the receiver is
                                            disabled, it is recommended to connect RO, using a 1kΩ to 10kΩ pull-up resistor to VCC.
                                            To enable the receiver to immediately monitor the bus traffic after device power-up, connect RE through a 1kΩ
                                            to 10kΩ pull-down resistor to ground.

                    5.4.1                           Large Output Signal Swing
                                            The ISL315xE family has a 60% larger differential output voltage swing than standard RS-485 transceivers. It
                                            delivers a minimum VOD of 2.4V across a 54Ω differential load, or 1.65V across a 15Ω differential load.
                                            Figure 30 shows that the VOD at 54Ω is more than 50% higher than that of a standard transceiver.

ISL3150E, ISL3152E, ISL3153E, ISL3155E, ISL3156E, ISL3158E                                             5. Device Description
         Figure 31 compares the maximum number of unit loads and bus transceivers when choosing an ISL315xE over
         a standard transceiver. The RS-485 standard specifies a minimum total common-mode load resistance of
         RCM = 375Ω between each signal conductor and ground. Because one unit load (1UL) is equivalent to 12kΩ,
         the total common-mode resistance of 375Ω yields 12kΩ/375Ω = 32 ULs.
         For an ISL315xE transceiver however, RCM can be as small as 188Ω, resulting in a total common-mode load of
         12kΩ/188Ω = 64 ULs. This means the driver of an ISL315xE transceiver can drive up to 64 x 1UL transceivers
         or 512 x 1/8UL transceivers.
         The advantages of such superior drive capability are:
         • Up to 900mV higher noise immunity (2.4V vs 1.5V VOD)
         • Up to twice the maximum cable length of standard transceivers (~8000ft vs 4000ft)
         • The design of star configurations or other multi-terminated nonstandard network topologies
    5.4.2       Driver Overload Protection
         The RS-485 specification requires drivers to survive worst case bus contentions undamaged. The ISL315xE
         transceivers meet this requirement through driver output short circuit current limits and on-chip thermal
         shutdown circuitry.
         The driver output stages incorporate short-circuit current limiters that ensure that the output current never
         exceeds the RS-485 specification, even at the common-mode voltage range extremes.
         In the event of a major short-circuit conditions, the devices also include a thermal shutdown feature that
         disables the drivers whenever the temperature becomes excessive. This eliminates the power dissipation,
         allowing the die to cool. The drivers automatically re-enable after the die temperature drops about 15°C. If the
         contention persists, the thermal shutdown/re-enable cycle repeats until the fault is cleared. The receivers stay
         operational during thermal shutdown.
    5.4.3       Full-Failsafe Receiver
         The differential receivers of the ISL315xE family are full-failsafe, meaning their outputs turn logic high when:
         • The receiver inputs are open (floating) due to a faulty bus node connector
         • The receiver inputs are shorted due to an insulation break of the bus cable
         • The receiver input voltage is close to 0V due to a terminated bus not being actively driven
         Full-failsafe switching is accomplished by offsetting the maximum receiver input threshold to -50mV.
         Figure 32 shows that, in addition to the threshold offset, the receiver also has an input hysteresis, ΔVTH, of
         20mV. The combination of offset and hysteresis allows the receiver to maintain its output high, even in the
         presence of 140mVP-P differential noise, without the need for external failsafe biasing resistors.

ISL3150E, ISL3152E, ISL3153E, ISL3155E, ISL3156E, ISL3158E                                                5. Device Description
    5.4.4       Low Current Shutdown Mode
         The ISL315xE transceivers use a fraction of the power required by their bipolar counterparts, but also include a
         shutdown feature that reduces the already low quiescent ICC to a 70nA trickle. These devices enter shutdown
         whenever the receiver and the driver are simultaneously disabled (RE = VCC and DE = GND) for a period of at
         least 600ns. Disabling both the driver and the receiver for less than 60ns guarantees that the transceiver will not
         enter shutdown.
         Note that driver and receiver enable times increase when the transceiver enables from shutdown. Refer to
         Notes 10 to 14 at the end of “Electrical Specifications” on page 10.
    5.4.5       Hot Plug Function
         When the equipment powers up, there is a period of time where the controller driving the RS-485 enable lines is
         unable to ensure that the driver and receiver outputs are kept disabled. If the equipment is connected to the bus,
         a driver activating prematurely during power-up may crash the bus. To avoid this scenario, the ISL315xE
         devices incorporate a Hot Plug function. During power-up and power-down, the Hot Plug function disables the
         driver and receiver outputs regardless of the states of DE and RE. When VCC reaches ~3.4V, the enable pins are
         released. This gives the controller the chance to stabilize and drive the RS-485 enable lines to the proper states.
    5.4.6       High ESD Protection
         The bus pins of the ISL315xE transceivers have on-chip ESD protection against ±16.5kV HBM, and ±9kV
         contact and ±16.5kV air-discharge according to IEC61000-4-2. The difference between the HBM and IEC ESD
         ratings lies in the test severity, as both standards aim for different application environments.
         HBM ESD ratings are component level ratings, used in semiconductor manufacturing in which component
         handling can cause ESD damage to a single device. Because component handling is performed in a controlled
         ESD environment, the ESD stress upon a component is drastically reduced. These factors make the HBM test
         the less severe ESD test.
         IEC ESD ratings are system level ratings. These are required in the uncontrolled field environment, where for
         example, a charged end user can subject handheld equipment to ESD levels of more than 40kV by touching
         connector pins when plugging or unplugging cables.
         The main differences between the HBM and the IEC 61000-4-2 standards are the number of strikes applied
         during testing and the generator models (Figure 33), which create differences in the waveforms’ rise times and
         peak currents (Figure 34).

         The IEC model has 50% higher charge capacitance (CS) and 78% lower discharge resistance (RD) than the

         ISL315xE transceivers exceed test level 4 of the IEC61000-4-2 standard, which significantly increases
         equipment robustness.

     6.1       Network Design
        Designing a reliable RS-485 network requires the consideration of a variety of factors that ultimately determine the
        network performance. These include network topology, cable type, data rate and/or cable length, stub length,
        distance between network nodes, and line termination.
        The main difference between network designs is dictated by their modes of data exchange between bus nodes,
        which can be half-duplex or full-duplex (Figures 35 and 36).

        Half-duplex networks use only a single signal-pair of cables between one master node and multiple slave nodes,
        which allows the nodes to either transmit or receive data, but never both at the same time. Its reduced cabling effort
        makes these networks well suited for covering long distances of up to several thousands of feet. To maintain high
        signal integrity, the applied data rates range from as low as 9.6kbps up to 115kbps. This requires transceivers with
        long driver output transition times, typically in the range of microseconds, to ensure low EMI in the presence of
        large cable inductances.
        To prevent signal reflections of the bus lines, each cable end must be terminated with a resistor, RT, whose value
        should match the characteristic cable impedance, Z0.
        Full-duplex networks, on the other hand, aim for high data throughput. These networks use two signal-pairs to
        support the simultaneous transmitting and receiving of data. The signal pair denoted as the transmit path connects
        the driver output of the master node to the receiver inputs of multiple slave nodes. The other pair connects the
        driver outputs of the slave nodes with the receiver input of the master node.
        Because the data flow in the transmit path is unidirectional, the transmit path requires only one termination at the
        remote cable end, opposite the master node. Data flow in the receive path, however, is bidirectional, thus requiring
        line termination at both cable ends. Commonly, high data throughput also calls for higher data rates in the 1Mbps to
        10Mbps range. As cable losses increase with frequency, most full-duplex networks are limited to shorter bus cable
        lengths of a few hundred feet to maintain signal integrity.
        The following sections discuss the aforementioned parameters that impact network performance. This discussion
        applies to both half-and full-duplex network designs.
      6.1.1        Cable Type
            RS-485 networks use differential signaling over Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) cable. The conductors of a
            twisted pair are equally exposed to external noise. They pick up noise and other electromagnetically induced
            voltages as common-mode signals, which are effectively rejected by the differential receivers.
            For best performance use industrial RS-485 cables, which are of the sheathed, shielded, twisted pair type,
            (STP), with a characteristic impedance of 120Ω and conductor sizes of 22 to 24 AWG (equivalent to diameters
            of 0.65mm and 0.51mm, respectively). They are available in single, two, and four signal-pair versions to

   6.1.2      Cable Length vs Data Rate
        RS-485 and RS-422 are intended for network lengths up to 4000ft, but the maximum system data rate decreases
        as the transmission length increases. Devices operating at 20Mbps are limited to lengths less than 100ft, while
        the 115kbps versions can operate at full data rates with lengths of several 1000ft. Note that ISL315xE
        transceivers can cover almost twice the distance of standard compliant RS-485 transceivers.

        RS-485 recommends its nodes to be networked in daisy-chain or backbone topology. In these topologies the
        participating drivers, receivers, and transceivers connect to a main cable trunk through “short” stubs. A stub
        being the actual electrical link between transceiver and cable trunk.

                      Figure 39. Stub Lengths in Daisy Chain (left) and Backbone (right) Topologies
          Because daisy chaining brings the cable trunk much closer to the transceiver bus terminals than a backbone
          design, the stub lengths between the two topologies can differ significantly. To prevent the bus from being
          overloaded by line terminations, stubs are never terminated. A stub therefore, represents a piece of
          unterminated transmission line. To eliminate signal reflections on the stub line, a rule of thumb is to keep its
          propagation delay below 1/5 of the driver output rise time, which leads to the maximum stub length of:

          where
          • c is the speed of light (m/s)
          • v is the signal velocity in the cable, expressed as a factor of c
          • tr is the rise time of the driver output (ns)
          Applying Equation 1 to the ISL315xE transceivers assuming a velocity of 78%, results in the maximum stub
          lengths associated with the corresponding transceivers, as shown in Table 4.

          Table 4 proves that transceivers with long driver rise times are well suited for applications requiring long stub
          lengths and low radiated emission in the presence of increased stub inductance.
     6.1.4         Minimum Distance between Nodes
          The electrical characteristics of the RS-485 bus are primarily defined by the distributed inductance and
          capacitance along the bus cable and printed circuit board traces. Adding capacitance to the bus in the form of
          transceivers and connectors lowers the line impedance and causes impedance mismatches at the loaded bus
          section.
          Input signals arriving at these mismatches are partially reflected back to the signal source, distorting the driver
          output signal. Ensuring a valid receiver input voltage during the first signal transition from a driver output
          anywhere on the bus, requires the bus impedance at the mismatches to be Z load  0.4Z nom or
          0.4 x 120Ω = 48Ω. This can be achieved by maintaining a minimum distance between bus nodes of:

        where
        • CL is the lumped load capacitance
        • CC is the distributed cable or PCB trace capacitance per unit length.
        Figure 40 shows the relationship for the minimum node spacing as a function of CC and CL graphically. Load
        capacitance includes contributions from the line circuit bus pins, connector contacts, printed circuit board
        traces, protection devices, and any other physical connections to the trunk line as long as the distance from the
        bus to the transceiver, known as the stub, is electrically short.
        Putting some values to the individual capacitance contributions: 5V transceivers typically possess a capacitance
        of 7pF, while 3V transceivers have about twice that capacitance at 16pF. Board traces add about 1.3 to 2pF/in
        depending upon their construction.
        Connector and suppression device capacitance can vary widely. Media distributed capacitance ranges from
        11pF/ft for low capacitance, unshielded, twisted-pair cable up to 22pF/ft for backplanes.

   6.1.5          Failsafe Biasing Termination
        As mentioned in “Full-Failsafe Receiver” on page 19, the ISL315xE transceivers are full-failsafe and capable of
        tolerating up to 140mVP-P of differential noise on a passive bus without needing external failsafe biasing.
        However, in harsh industrial environments, such as the factor floors in industrial automation, the differential
        noise can reach levels of more than 1VP-P. In this case external failsafe biasing at the network’s line
        terminations is strongly recommended. Here the termination resistors RT connect through the biasing resistors
        RB to the supply rails VCC and GND.
        Short data links (<100m) only require a single failsafe termination at one cable end, while the other end is
        terminated with the cable characteristic impedance Z0 (Figure 41, left circuit).

   6.2       Transient Protection
      Although the ISL315xE transceivers have on-chip transient protection circuitry against Electrostatic Discharge
      (ESD), they are vulnerable to bursts of Electrical Fast Transients (EFT) and surge transients. Surge transients can
      be caused by lightning strikes or the switching of power systems including load changes and short circuits. Their
      energy content is up to 8 million times higher than that of ESD transients and thus, requires the addition of external
      transient protection.
      Because standard RS-485 transceivers have asymmetric stand-off voltages of -9V and +14V, external protection
      requires a bidirectional Transient Voltage Suppressor (TVS) with asymmetric breakdown voltages. The only device
      satisfying this requirement is the 400W TVS, SM712.
      The SM712 operates across the asymmetrical common-mode voltage range from -7V to +12V. The device protects
      transceivers against ESD, EFT, and surge transients up to the following levels:
      • IEC61000-4-2 (ESD) +15kV (air), +8kV (contact)
      • IEC61000-4-4 (EFT) 40A (5/50ns)
      • IEC61000-4-5 (Lightning) 12A (8/20μs)
      Because the transceiver’s ESD cells and the SM712 have a similar switching characteristics, series resistors (RS)
      are used to prevent the two protection schemes from interacting with one another.
      These resistors can be carbon composite or pulse-proof thick-film resistors which should be inserted between the
      TVS and the transceiver bus terminals to limit the bus currents into the transceiver during a surge event. Their value
      should be less than 20Ω to minimize the attenuation of the bus voltage during normal operation. Figure 43 shows
      the schematic of a 1kV surge protection example for the ISL3152E and its bill of materials.

   6.3       Layout Guidelines
      Because ESD and EFT transients have a wide frequency bandwidth from approximately 3MHz to 3GHz,
      high-frequency layout techniques must be applied during PCB design.
      • For your PCB design to be successful, start with the design of the protection circuit in mind.
      • Place the protection circuitry close to the bus connector to prevent noise transients from penetrating your board.
      • Use VCC and ground planes to provide low-inductance. Note that high-frequency currents follow the path of least
        inductance and not the path of least impedance.
      • Design the protection components into the direction of the signal path. Do not force the transient currents to divert
        from the signal path to reach the protection device.

      • Apply 100nF to 220nF bypass capacitors as close as possible to the VCC pins of the transceiver, UART, and
        controller ICs on the board.
      • Use at least two vias for VCC and ground connections of bypass capacitors and protection devices to minimize the
        effective via-inductance.
      • Use 1kΩ to 10kΩ pull-up/down resistors for the transceiver enable lines to limit noise currents into these lines
        during transient events.
      • Insert pulse-proof resistors into the A and B bus lines if the TVS clamping voltage is higher than the specified
        maximum voltage of the transceiver bus terminals. These resistors limit the residual clamping current into the
        transceiver and prevent it from latching up.
