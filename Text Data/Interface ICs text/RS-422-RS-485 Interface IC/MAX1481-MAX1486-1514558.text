                                  Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
                                          ground unless otherwise noted.
                                  Note 2: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
                                  Note 3: Maximum current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; minimum current level applies during
                                          current limiting.
                                  Note 4: Shutdown is enabled by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the MAX1481
                                          is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the MAX1481 is guaranteed to
                                          have entered shutdown.

*(MAX1485/MAX1486 only) In half-duplex mode, the driver outputs serve as receiver inputs. The full-duplex receiver inputs (A and B)
will still have a 1/8-unit load, but are not connected to the receiver.
