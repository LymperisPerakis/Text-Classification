Note 2: All devices 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to ground,
         unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 5: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
Note 6: Guaranteed by design; not production tested.
Note 7: The timing parameter refers to the driver or receiver enable delay, when the device has exited the initial hot-swap protect
         state and is in normal operating mode.
Note 8: Shutdown is enabled by driving RE high and DE low. The device is guaranteed to have entered shutdown after tSHDN has
         elapsed.

                                                outputs are high impedance when DE is low. Drive RE high and DE low to
                                                enter low-power shutdown mode. DE has a weak pullup to VCC.
                                                Driver Input. A low on DI forces the noninverting output (Y or A) low
                                                and the inverting output (Z or B) high. Similarly, a high on DI forces the
