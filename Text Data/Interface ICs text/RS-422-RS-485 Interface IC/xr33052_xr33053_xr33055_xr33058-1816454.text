NOTES:
1. Change in magnitude of differential output voltage and change in magnitude of common mode output voltage are the changes in output voltage when DI input
   changes state.
2. The hot swap feature disables the DE and RE inputs for the first 10μs after power is applied. Following this time period, these inputs are weakly pulled to their disabled
   state (low for DE, high for RE) until the first transition, after which they become high impedance inputs.

NOTES:
1. The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low simultaneously for at least 600ns. If the control inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device
   is guaranteed to not enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are held in this state for at least 600ns, the device is ensured to be in shutdown. Note that the receiver and driver
   enable times increase significantly when coming out of shutdown.
2. This spec is guaranteed by design and bench characterization.

NOTES:
1. The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low simultaneously for at least 600ns. If the control inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device
   is guaranteed to not enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are held in this state for at least 600ns, the device is ensured to be in shutdown. Note that the receiver and driver
   enable times increase significantly when coming out of shutdown.
2. This spec is guaranteed by design and bench characterization.

                                                Driver output enable (hot swap). When DE is high, outputs are enabled.
       3               4          DE      Input When DE is low, outputs are high impedance, DE should be low and RE

The RS-485/RS-422 standard covers line lengths up to
4000ft. Maximum achievable line length is a function of
signal attenuation and noise. Termination prevents signal
reflections by eliminating the impedance mismatches on
