                    The MAX3093E/MAX3094E exhibit propagation delays                                                VCC

                                           128 Receivers on the Bus
                    The standard RS-485 input impedance is 12kΩ (one-                                1kΩ
                    unit load). The standard RS-485 transmitter can drive
                    32 unit loads. The MAX3093E/MAX3094E present a 1/4-
                    unit-load input impedance (48kΩ), which allows up to
                    128 receivers on a bus. Any combination of these RS-        Figure 6. External Fail-Safe Implementation
                    485 receivers with a total of 32-unit loads can be con-
                    nected to the same bus.
                                           Fail-Safe Implementation
                    The MAX3093E/MAX3094E receiver inputs guarantee a
                    logic high output when the inputs are open circuit (no                                      Chip Information
                    termination resistor used). This occurs when the trans-     TRANSISTOR COUNT: 676
                    mitter is removed from the bus or when all transmitter
                    outputs are high impedance. However, when the line is
                    terminated and the transmitters are disabled, the differ-
                    ential voltage between the _+ and _- inputs falls below
                    the ±200mV RS-485 sensitivity threshold. Consequent-
                    ly, the outputs become undefined. To maintain a fail-
                    safe receiver output while using a terminating resistor,
                    input _+ must be biased at least 200mV above input B.
                    The resistor-divider network shown in Figure 6 is rec-
                    ommended.
