The SP486 and SP487 are low-power quad differential line drivers meeting RS-485 and RS-
422 standards. The SP486 features a common driver enable control; the SP487 provides
independent driver enable controls for each pair of drivers. Both feature tri-state outputs
and a wide common-mode output range. SP486 and SP487 are available in a 16-pin SOIC
package.
                         SP487 is available, SP486 is obsolete
                                                                          SP486_487_101_013020

                                                 DESCRIPTION
The SP486 and SP487 are low power quad
differential line drivers meeting RS-485 and
RS-422 standards. The SP486 features
active high and active low common driver
enable controls; the SP487 provides inde-
pendent, active high driver enable controls
for each pair of drivers. The driver outputs
are short-circuit limited to 200mA. Data rates
up to 10Mbps are supported. The SP486
and SP487 are available in a 16-pin SOIC
package.
