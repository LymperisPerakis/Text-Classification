Note 1: Overtemperature limits are guaranteed by design and are not production tested. Devices are tested at TA = +25°C.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
          ground, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 4: This input current level is for the hot-swap enable (DE, RE) inputs and is present until the first transition only. After the first
          transition, the input reverts to a standard high-impedance CMOS input with input current IIN1. For the first 10μs, the input
          current can be as high as 1mA. During this period the input is disabled.
Note 5: Maximum current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; minimum current level applies during
          current limiting.
Note 6: The device is put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the
          device is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the device is guaranteed
          to have entered shutdown.

Figure 18’s high-frequency harmonic components are
much lower in amplitude, compared with Figure 17’s,
and the potential for EMI is significantly reduced. Figure
19 shows the same signal displayed for a MAX3060E
transmitting under the same conditions. Figure 19’s high-
frequency harmonic components are even lower.
In general, a transmitter’s rise time relates directly to the                                                 20dB/div
length of an unterminated stub, which can be driven with
only minor waveform reflections. The following equation
expresses this relationship conservatively:
               Length = tRISE / (10 x 1.5ns/ft)
where tRISE is the transmitter’s rise time.                                  0            125kHz/div     1.25MHz
For example, the MAX3060E’s rise time is typically
1850ns, which results in excellent waveforms with a stub          Figure 17. Driver Output Waveform and FFT Plot of MAX3062E
length up to 123ft. A system can work well with longer            Transmitting a 25kHz Signal
unterminated stubs, even with severe reflections, if the
waveform settles out before the UART samples them.
Low-Power Shutdown Mode
Low-power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing both
RE high and DE low. In shutdown, the devices typically
draw only 1nA of supply current.
RE and DE can be driven simultaneously. The parts are                                                         20dB/div
guaranteed not to enter shutdown if RE is high and DE is
low for less than 50ns. If the inputs are in this state for at
least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to enter shutdown.
Enable times t_ZH and t_ZL in the Switching Characteristics
tables assume the part was not in a lowpower shutdown
state. Enable times t_ZH(SHDN) and t_ZL(SHDN) assume                         0            125kHz/div     1.25MHz
the parts were shut down. It takes drivers and receiv-
ers longer to become enabled from low-power shutdown              Figure 18. Driver Output Waveform and FFT Plot of MAX3061E
mode (t_ZH(SHDN), t_ZL(SHDN)) than from driver/receiv-            Transmitting a 25kHz Signal
er-disable mode (t_ZH, t_ZL).
Driver Output Protection
Two mechanisms prevent excessive output current and
power dissipation caused by faults or by bus contention.
The first, a foldback current limit on the output stage, pro-
vides protection after a 20μs delay against short circuits
over the whole common-mode voltage range (see Typical                                                         20dB/div
Operating Characteristics). The second, a thermal shut-
down circuit, forces the driver outputs into a high-imped-
ance state if the die temperature becomes excessive.
