The ISL32483E and ISL32485E (ISL3248xE) are fault protected,
5V powered differential transceivers that exceed the RS-485 and
                                                                     Features

the most robust on the market.                                       • Full fail-safe (open, short, terminated) RS-485 receivers

This yields better noise immunity than standard RS-485 ICs or
allows up to six 120Ω terminations in star network topologies.       • Hot plug circuitry: Tx and Rx outputs remain three-state

   RO         2              1       Receiver output.
                                     If INV or RINV is low, then: If A - B  -10mV, RO is high; if A - B  -200mV, RO is low.
                                     If INV or RINV is high, then: If B - A  -10mV, RO is high; if B - A  -200mV, RO is low.
                                     In all cases, RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted together or connected to an undriven,
                                     terminated bus (Rx is always fail safe open, shorted and idle even if polarity is inverted).
    RE        3              -       Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high. Internally
                                     pulled low.
    DE        4              3       Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high and they are high
                                     impedance when DE is low. Internally pulled high to VCC.
    DI        5              4       Driver input. If INV or DINV is low, a low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high, while a high on DI forces
                                     output Y high and output Z low. The output states relative to DI invert if INV or DINV is high.
  GND        6, 7            5       Ground connection.
   A/Y         -             6       ±60V fault and ±16.5kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level I/O pin. If INV is low than, A/Y is the
                                     noninverting receiver input and noninverting driver output. If INV is high, than A/Y is the inverting receiver
                                     input and the inverting driver output. Pin is an input if DE = 0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
   B/Z         -             7       ±60V fault and ±16.5kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level I/O pin. If INV is low, than B/Z is the
                                     inverting receiver input and inverting driver output. If INV is high, than B/Z is the noninverting receiver input
                                     and the noninverting driver output. Pin is an input if DE = 0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
    A        12              -       ±60V fault and ±15kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level input. If RINV is low, then A is the
                                     noninverting receiver input. If RINV is high, then A is the inverting receiver input.
    B        11              -       ±60V fault and ±15kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level input. If RINV is low, then B is the inverting
                                     receiver input. If RINV is high, then B is the noninverting receiver input.
    Y         9              -       ±60V fault and ±15kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level output. If DINV is low, then Y is the
                                     noninverting driver output. If DINV is high, then Y is the inverting driver output
    Z        10              -       ±60V fault and ±15kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level. If DINV is low, then Z is the inverting driver
                                     output. If DINV is high, then Z is the noninverting driver output.
   VCC     13, 14            8       System power supply input (4.5V to 5.5V).
   INV         -             2       Receiver and driver polarity selection input. When driven high, this pin swaps the polarity of the driver output
                                     and receiver input pins. If unconnected (floating) or connected low, normal RS-485 polarity conventions
                                     apply. Internally pulled low.
  RINV        1              -       Receiver polarity selection input. When driven high, this pin swaps the polarity of the receiver input pins. If
                                     unconnected (floating) or connected low, normal RS-485 polarity conventions apply. Internally pulled low.
  DINV        8              -       Driver polarity selection input. When driven high, this pin swaps the polarity of the driver output pins. If
                                     unconnected (floating) or connected low, normal RS-485 polarity conventions apply. Internally pulled low.

 Shutdown to Output Low                            (Notes 11, 13, 16)
NOTES:
  6. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
  7. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
  8. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 10 for more information.
  9. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
10. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
11. Transceivers (except on the ISL32485E) are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the
     parts are ensured not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are ensured to enter shutdown. See “Low Power
     Shutdown Mode” on page 14.
12. Keep RE = VCC and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
13. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
14. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization, and/or design.
15. Tested according to TIA/EIA-485-A, Section 4.2.6 (±80V for 15ms at a 1% duty cycle).
16. Does not apply to the ISL32485E. The ISL32485E has no Rx enable function and thus no shutdown function.
17. See “Caution” statement in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on page 5.
18. This parameter is not production tested.
