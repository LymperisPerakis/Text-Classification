The ISL3332, ISL3333 are two port interface ICs where each            Features
port can be independently configured as a single

transceiver. With both ports set to the same mode, two
RS-485/RS-422 transceivers, or four RS-232 transceivers               • Operates From a Single 3.3V Supply
are available.                                                        • Two Independent Ports, Each User Selectable for RS-232
If either port is in RS-232 mode, the onboard charge pump                (2 Transceivers) or RS-485/RS-422 (1 Transceiver)
generates RS-232 compliant 5V Tx output levels from a                • True Flow-Through Pinouts Simplify Board Layouts

In RS-485 mode, the transceivers support both the RS-485

    PIN    MODE                                                                FUNCTION
   GND    BOTH   Ground connection.
     LB   BOTH   Enables loopback mode when low. Internally pulled-high.
    NC    BOTH   No Connection.
  ON/OFF  BOTH   If either port is in RS-232 mode, a low on ON/OFF disables the charge pumps. In either mode, a low disables all the outputs,
                 and places the device in low power shutdown. Internally pulled-high. ON = 1 for normal operation.
   RXEN   BOTH   Active low receiver output enable. The corresponding port’s Rx is enabled when RXEN is low; Rx is high impedance when
                 RXEN is high. Internally pulled low. (QFN only)
    SEL   BOTH   Interface Mode Select input. High puts corresponding port in RS-485 Mode, while a low puts it in RS-232 Mode.
    VCC   BOTH   System power supply input (3.3V).
     VL   BOTH   Logic-Level Supply. All TTL/CMOS inputs and outputs are powered by this supply. QFN logic input pins that are externally
                 tied high in an application, should use the VL supply for the high voltage level. (QFN only)
   DEN    RS-232 Active high driver output enable. The corresponding port’s 232 mode drivers are enabled when DEN is high; drivers are
                 disabled when DEN is low. Internally pulled high. (QFN only).
      A   RS-232 Receiver input with 15kV ESD protection. A low on A forces RA high; A high on A forces RA low.
          RS-485 Inverting receiver input with 15kV ESD protection.
      B   RS-232 Receiver input with 15kV ESD protection. A low on B forces RB high; A high on B forces RB low.
          RS-485 Noninverting receiver input with 15kV ESD protection.
    DY    RS-232 Driver input. A low on DY forces output Y high. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Y low.
          RS-485 Driver input. A low on DY forces output Y high and output Z low. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Y low and output Z high.
  DZ / DE RS-232 Driver input. A low on DZ forces output Z high. Similarly, a high on DZ forces output Z low.
          RS-485 Driver output enable (DE). The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high impedance when
                 DE is low. Internally pulled high when port selected for RS-485 mode.
    RA    RS-232 Receiver output.
          RS-485 Receiver output: If B > A by at least -40mV, RA is high; If B < A by -200mV or more, RA is low; RA = High if A and B are
                 unconnected (floating) or shorted together (i.e., full fail-safe).
    RB    RS-232 Receiver output.
          RS-485 Not used. Internally pulled-high, and unaffected by RXEN.
      Y   RS-232 Driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
          RS-485 Inverting driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
      Z   RS-232 Driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
          RS-485 Noninverting driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
    SP    RS-485 Speed control. Internally pulled-high. (QFN only)
    C1+   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead. Not needed if both ports in RS-485 Mode.
    C1-   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead. Not needed if both ports in RS-485 Mode.
    C2+   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead. Not needed if both ports in RS-485 Mode.
    C2-   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead. Not needed if both ports in RS-485 Mode.
     V+   RS-232 Internally generated positive RS-232 transmitter supply (+5.5V). C3 not needed if both ports in RS-485 Mode.
     V-   RS-232 Internally generated negative RS-232 transmitter supply (-5.5V). C4 not needed if both ports in RS-485 Mode.

NOTES:
 7. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless
     otherwise specified.
 8. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V (RS-485 mode) or DEN = 0V (RS-232 mode).
 9. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” for more information.
10. RIN defaults to RS-485 mode (>15k) when the device is unpowered (VCC = 0V), or in SHDN, regardless of the state of the SEL inputs.
11. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by
     characterization and are not production tested.
