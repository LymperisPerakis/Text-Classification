Description
The ST485 is al low power transceiver for RS-485
and RS-422 communication. Each part contains
one driver and one receiver.
This transceiver draw 300 µA (typ.) of supply
current when unloaded or fully loaded with
disabled drivers.
It operates from a single 5 V supply.
Driver is short-circuit current limited and is
protected against excessive power dissipation by
thermal shutdown circuitry that placed the driver
outputs into a high-impedance state.
The ST485 is designed for bi-directional data
communications on multipoint bus transmission
line (half-duplex applications).
