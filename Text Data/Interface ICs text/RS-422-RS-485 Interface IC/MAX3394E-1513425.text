Note 1: All units are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Limits over the operating temperature range are guaranteed by design
         and not production tested.
Note 2: During a low-to-high transition, the threshold at which the I/O changes state is the lower of VILL and VILC since the two
         sides are internally connected by an internal switch while the device is in the logic-low state.
