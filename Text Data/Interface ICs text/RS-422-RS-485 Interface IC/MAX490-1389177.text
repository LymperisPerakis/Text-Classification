                           General Description                   __Next Generation Device Features
The MAX481, MAX483, MAX485, MAX487–MAX491, and                  o For Fault-Tolerant Applications
MAX1487 are low-power transceivers for RS-485 and RS-                MAX3430: ±80V Fault-Protected, Fail-Safe, 1/4
422 communication. Each part contains one driver and one
                                                                     Unit Load, +3.3V, RS-485 Transceiver
receiver. The MAX483, MAX487, MAX488, and MAX489
feature reduced slew-rate drivers that minimize EMI and              MAX3440E–MAX3444E: ±15kV ESD-Protected,
reduce reflections caused by improperly terminated cables,           ±60V Fault-Protected, 10Mbps, Fail-Safe,
thus allowing error-free data transmission up to 250kbps.            RS-485/J1708 Transceivers
The driver slew rates of the MAX481, MAX485, MAX490,            o For Space-Constrained Applications
MAX491, and MAX1487 are not limited, allowing them to
transmit up to 2.5Mbps.                                              MAX3460–MAX3464: +5V, Fail-Safe, 20Mbps,
                                                                     Profibus RS-485/RS-422 Transceivers
These transceivers draw between 120µA and 500µA of
supply current when unloaded or fully loaded with disabled           MAX3362: +3.3V, High-Speed, RS-485/RS-422
drivers. Additionally, the MAX481, MAX483, and MAX487                Transceiver in a SOT23 Package
have a low-current shutdown mode in which they consume               MAX3280E–MAX3284E: ±15kV ESD-Protected,
only 0.1µA. All parts operate from a single 5V supply.               52Mbps, +3V to +5.5V, SOT23, RS-485/RS-422,
Drivers are short-circuit current limited and are protected          True Fail-Safe Receivers
against excessive power dissipation by thermal shutdown              MAX3293/MAX3294/MAX3295: 20Mbps, +3.3V,
circuitry that places the driver outputs into a high-imped-          SOT23, RS-485/RS-422 Transmitters
ance state. The receiver input has a fail-safe feature that
guarantees a logic-high output if the input is open circuit.    o For Multiple Transceiver Applications
                                                                     MAX3030E–MAX3033E: ±15kV ESD-Protected,
The MAX487 and MAX1487 feature quarter-unit-load
receiver input impedance, allowing up to 128 MAX487/                 +3.3V, Quad RS-422 Transmitters

Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
        ground unless otherwise specified.
Note 2: All typical specifications are given for VCC = 5V and TA = +25°C.
Note 3: Supply current specification is valid for loaded transmitters when DE = 0V.
Note 4: Applies to peak current. See Typical Operating Characteristics.
Note 5: The MAX481/MAX483/MAX487 are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less
        than 50ns, the parts are guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are
        guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See Low-Power Shutdown Mode (MAX481/MAX483/MAX487) section.

The RS-485/RS-422 standard covers line lengths up to              circuits. These parts can also be used as line
4000 feet. For line lengths greater than 4000 feet, see           repeaters, with cable lengths longer than 4000 feet, as
Figure 23.                                                        shown in Figure 23.
Figures 19 and 20 show the system differential voltage            To minimize reflections, the line should be terminated at
for the parts driving 4000 feet of 26AWG twisted-pair             both ends in its characteristic impedance, and stub
wire at 110kHz into 120Ω loads.                                   lengths off the main line should be kept as short as possi-
