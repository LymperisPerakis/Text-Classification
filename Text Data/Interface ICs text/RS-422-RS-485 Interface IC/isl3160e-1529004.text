 The ISL3160E is a ±10kV IEC61000 ESD protected, 5V          Features
 powered, full-duplex transceiver that meets both the         • High ESD protection on RS-485 I/O pins: ±10kV
 RS-485 and RS-422 standards for balanced
 communication. It also features a large differential output  • Class 3 HBM ESD level on all other pins: >3kV

                                                                (maximum) skew
 This transceiver requires a 5V ±10% tolerance supply,
                                                              • 1/5 unit load allows up to 160 devices on the bus
 and delivers at least a 2.1V differential output voltage
 over this supply range. This translates into better noise    • Full fail-safe (open, shorted, terminated/undriven)
 immunity (data integrity), longer reach, or the ability to     receiver

 SCSI applications benefit from the ISL3160E’s low              during power-up
 receiver and transmitter part-to-part skews. The
 ISL3160E is perfect for high speed parallel applications     • Low quiescent supply current: 4mA
 requiring simultaneous capture of large numbers of bits.     • Low current shutdown mode: 1µA
 The low bit-to-bit skew eases the timing constraints on

        2           RO    Receiver output.
                          If A - B ≥ -50mV, RO is high.
                          If A - B ≤ -200mV, RO is low.
                          If A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted, or connected to a terminated bus that is undriven, RO is
                          high.
        3           RE    Receiver output enable.
                          RO is enabled when RE is low.
                          RO is high impedance when RE is high.
                          If the Rx enable function isn’t required, connect RE directly to GND.
        4           DE    Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high
                          impedance when DE is low. If the Tx enable function isn’t required, connect DE to VCC through a 1kΩ or
                          greater resistor.
        5            DI   Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. Similarly, a high on DI forces output Y
                          high and output Z low.

     Notes:
      7. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground
          unless otherwise specified.
      8. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
      9. Because of the shutdown feature, keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
     10. Because of the shutdown feature, the RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from
          entering shutdown.
     11. These ICs are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts will
          not enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 700ns, the parts will enter shutdown. See “Low Power Shutdown
          Mode” on page 17.
     12. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >700ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
     13. Set the RE signal high time >700ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
     14. This is the part-to-part skew between any two units tested with identical test conditions (temperature, VCC, etc.).
     15. VCC = 5V ±5%.
     16. Parts are 100% tested at +25°C. Over-temperature limits established by characterization and are not production tested.

ISL3160E                                                                                              5. Application Information
 5.      Application Information
   RS-485 and RS-422 are differential (balanced) data transmission standards for use in long haul or noisy environments.
   RS-422 is a subset of RS-485, so RS-485 transceivers are also RS-422 compliant. RS-422 is a point-to-multipoint
   (multidrop) standard, which allows only one driver and up to 10 receivers on each bus, assuming one unit load devices.
   RS-485 is a true multipoint standard, which allows up to 32 one unit load devices (any mix of drivers and receivers) on
   each bus. To allow for multipoint operation, the RS-485 specification requires that drivers must handle bus contention
   without sustaining any damage.
   Another important advantage of RS-485 is the extended Common-Mode Range (CMR), which specifies that the driver
   outputs and receiver inputs withstand signals that range from +12V to -7V. RS-422 and RS-485 are intended for cable
   lengths as long as 4000ft (~1200m), so the wide CMR is necessary to handle ground potential differences, as well as
   voltages induced in the cable by external fields.
   5.1        Receiver (Rx) Features
       This transceiver uses a differential input receiver for maximum noise immunity and common-mode rejection. Input
       sensitivity is ±200mV, as required by the RS-422 and RS-485 specifications. Receiver inputs function with
       common-mode voltages as great as 7V outside the power supplies (that is, +12V and -7V), making them ideal for
       long networks, or industrial environments, where induced voltages are a realistic concern.
       The receiver input resistance of 50kΩ surpasses the RS-422 specification of 4kΩ, and is five times the RS-485
       “Unit Load” (UL) requirement of 12kΩ minimum. Thus, the ISL3160E is known as a “one-fifth UL” transceiver,
       and there can be up to 160 devices on the RS-485 bus while still complying with the RS-485 loading specification.
       The receiver is a “full fail-safe” version that assures a high level receiver output if the receiver inputs are
       unconnected (floating), shorted together, or connected to a terminated bus with all the transmitters disabled
       (terminated/undriven).
       Rx outputs deliver large low state currents (typically >30mA) at VOL = 1V (to ease the design of optically coupled
       isolated networks).
       Receivers easily meet the 40Mbps data rate supported by the driver, and the receiver output is tri-statable using the
       active low RE input.
   5.2        Driver (Tx) Features
       The RS-485/RS-422 driver is a differential output device that delivers at least 2.1V across a 54Ω load (RS-485),
       and at least 2.6V across a 100Ω load (RS-422) even with VCC = 4.5V. The drivers feature low propagation delay
       skew to maximize bit width and to minimize EMI.
       Driver outputs are not slew rate limited, so faster output transition times allow data rates of at least 40Mbps. Driver
       outputs are tri-statable using the active high DE input.
       For parallel applications, bit-to-bit skews between any two ISL3160E transmitter and receiver pairs are assured to
       be no worse than 8ns (4ns max for any two Tx, 4ns max for any two Rx).
     5.2.1        High VOD Improves Noise Immunity and Flexibility
           The ISL3160E driver design delivers larger differential output voltages (VOD) than the RS-485 standard
           requires, or than most RS-485 transmitters can deliver. The minimum ±2.1V VOD assures at least ±600mV
           more noise immunity than networks built using standard 1.5V VOD transmitters.
           Another advantage of the large VOD is the ability to drive more than two bus terminations, which allows use of
           the ISL3160E in “star” and other multiterminated, nonstandard network topologies. Figure 14 on page 12
           details the transmitter’s VOD vs IOUT characteristic, and includes load lines for four (30Ω) and six (20Ω) 120Ω
           terminations. Figure 14 shows that the driver typically delivers 1.9/1.5V into 4/6 terminations, even at +85°C.
           The RS-485 standard requires a minimum 1.5V VOD into two terminations, but the ISL3160E typically delivers
           RS-485 voltage levels with 2 to 3 times the number of terminations.

  5.3      ESD Protection
     All pins on the ISL3160E include Class 3 (>3kV) Human Body Model (HBM) ESD protection structures, but the
     RS-485 pins (driver outputs and receiver inputs) incorporate advanced structures allowing them to survive ESD
     events in excess of ±10kV HBM and ±5kV IEC61000-4-2. The RS-485 pins are particularly vulnerable to ESD
     strikes because they typically connect to an exposed port on the exterior of the finished product. Simply touching
     the port pins, or connecting a cable, can cause an ESD event that can destroy unprotected ICs. These new ESD
     structures protect the device whether or not it is powered up and without degrading the RS-485 common-mode
     range of -7V to +12V. This built-in ESD protection eliminates the need for board level protection structures (for
     example, transient suppression diodes) and the associated undesirable capacitive load they present.
  5.4      Hot Plug Function
     When a piece of equipment powers up, a period of time occurs in which the processor or ASIC driving the RS-485
     control lines (DE, RE) is unable to ensure that the RS-485 Tx and Rx outputs are kept disabled. If the equipment is
     connected to the bus, a driver activating prematurely during power-up may crash the bus. To avoid this scenario,
     the ISL3160E incorporates a “hot plug” function. Circuitry monitoring VCC ensures that the Tx and Rx outputs remain
     disabled during power-up and power-down, regardless of the state of DE and RE, if VCC is less than ~3.2V. This gives
     the processor or ASIC a chance to stabilize and drive the RS-485 control lines to the proper states.
                                                                                        DE, DI = VCC

  5.5      Data Rate, Cables, and Terminations
     Twisted pair is the cable of choice for RS-485, RS-422, and PROFIBUS networks. Twisted pair cables tend to pick
     up noise and other electromagnetically induced voltages as common-mode signals, which are effectively rejected
     by the differential receivers in these ICs.
     According to guidelines in the RS-422 and RS-485 specifications, networks operating at data rates in excess of
     3Mbps should be limited to cable lengths of 100m (328ft) or less. The ISL3160E’s large differential output swing,
     fast transition times, and high drive-current output stages allow operation even at 40Mbps over standard “CAT5”
     cables in excess of 100m (328ft). Figure 23 on page 14 details the ISL3160E performance at this condition, with a
     120Ω termination resistor at both the driver and the receiver ends. Note that the differential signal delivered to the
     receiver at the end of the cable (A-B) still exceeds 1V, so even longer cables could be driven if lower noise margins
     are acceptable. Of course, jitter or some other criteria may limit the network to shorter cable lengths than those
     discussed here. If more noise margin is desired, shorter cables produce a larger receiver input signal as illustrated in
     Figure 22 on page 14. Performance should be even better if using the “Type A” cable.
     The ISL3160E may also be used at slower data rates over longer cables, but some limitations apply. The Rx is
     optimized for high speed operation, so its output may glitch if the Rx input differential transition times are too slow.

ISL3160E                                                                                             5. Application Information
      Keeping the transition times below 500ns, (which equates to the Tx driving a 1000ft (305m) CAT 5 cable) yields
      excellent performance across the full operating temperature range.
      To minimize reflections, proper termination is imperative when using this high data rate transceiver. In
      point-to-point, or point-to-multipoint (single driver on bus) networks, the main cable should be terminated in its
      characteristic impedance (typically 120Ω for “Cat 5” and 220Ω for “Type A”) at the end farthest from the driver. In
      multireceiver applications, stubs connecting receivers to the main cable should be kept as short as possible.
      Multipoint (multidriver) systems require that the main cable be terminated in its characteristic impedance at both
      ends. Stubs connecting a transceiver to the main cable should be kept as short as possible.
   5.6       Built-In Driver Overload Protection
      As stated previously, the RS-485 specification requires that drivers survive worst case bus contentions undamaged.
      These transmitters meet this requirement using driver output short-circuit current limits, and on-chip thermal shutdown
      circuitry.
      The driver output stages incorporate short-circuit current limiting circuitry, which ensures that the output current
      never exceeds the RS-485 specification, even at the common-mode voltage range extremes. In the event of a major
      short-circuit condition, the device also includes a thermal shutdown feature that disables the drivers whenever the
      die temperature becomes excessive. This eliminates the power dissipation, allowing the die to cool. The drivers
      automatically reenable after the die temperature drops about 15°C. If the contention persists, the thermal
      shutdown/reenable cycle repeats until the fault is cleared. Receivers stay operational during thermal shutdown.
   5.7       Low Power Shutdown Mode
      This BiCMOS transceiver uses a fraction of the power required by its bipolar counterparts, and it includes a
      shutdown feature that reduces the already low quiescent ICC to a 50nA trickle. It enters shutdown whenever the
      receiver and driver are simultaneously disabled (RE = VCC and DE = GND) for a period of at least 600ns.
      Disabling both the driver and the receiver for less than 60ns assures that the transceiver will not enter shutdown.
      Note that receiver and driver enable times increase when the transceiver enables from shutdown. Refer to Notes 9,
      10, 11, 12, and 13 on page 8 for more information.
