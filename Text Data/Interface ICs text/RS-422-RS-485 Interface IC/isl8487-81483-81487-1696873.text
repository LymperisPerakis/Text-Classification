    RO     Receiver output: If A > B by at least 0.2V, RO is high; If A < B by 0.2V or more, RO is low; RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating).
    RE     Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high.
    DE     Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high impedance when DE is low.
    DI     Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. Similarly, a high on DI forces output Y high and output Z low.
   GND     Ground connection.
   A/Y     RS-485/422 level, noninverting receiver input and noninverting driver output. Pin is an input (A) if DE = 0; pin is an output (Y) if DE = 1.
   B/Z     RS-485/422 level, inverting receiver input and inverting driver output. Pin is an input (B) if DE = 0; pin is an output (Z) if DE = 1.
   VCC     System power supply input (4.5V to 5.5V).

NOTES:
 2. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless
     otherwise specified.
 3. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
 4. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” for more information.
 5. When testing the ISL8487 and ISL81483, keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
 6. When testing the ISL8487 and ISL81483, the RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <200ns) to prevent the device from entering
     SHDN.
 7. The ISL8487 and ISL81483 are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the parts are
     guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See
     “Low-Power Shutdown Mode” section.
 8. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
 9. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
10. Devices meeting these limits are denoted as “1/8 unit load (1/8 UL)” transceivers. The RS-485 standard allows up to 32 Unit Loads on the bus,
     so there can be 256 1/8 UL devices on a bus.
11. Devices meeting these limits are denoted as “1/4 unit load (1/4 UL)” transceivers. The RS-485 standard allows up to 32 Unit Loads on the bus,
     so there can be 128 1/4 UL devices on a bus.
