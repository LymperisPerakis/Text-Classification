Note 1: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages referred to device ground,
        unless otherwise noted.
Note 2: This is a differential voltage from A to B that the driving device must see on the bus to disable its driver.
Note 3: The short-circuit output current applied to peak current just prior to foldback current limiting. The short-circuit foldback out-
        put current applies during current limiting to allow a recovery from bus contention.
