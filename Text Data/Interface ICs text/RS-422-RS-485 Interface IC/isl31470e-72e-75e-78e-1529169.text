NOTES:
  1. See TB347 for details about reel specifications.
  2. Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through-hole wave solder processing only. They are not intended for use in Reflow solder processing applications.
  3. These Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte tin plate
     plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Pb-free products are
     MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.
  4. For Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL), see the ISL31470E, ISL31472E, ISL31475E, and ISL31478E device pages. For more information about MSL, see
     TB363.

NOTES:
 8. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
    specified.
 9. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
10. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 11 for more information.
11. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
12. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
13. Transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts are ensured not to enter
    shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are ensured to have entered shutdown. For more information, see “Low Power
    Shutdown Mode” on page 16
14. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
15. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
16. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization and
    are not production tested.
17. Tested according to TIA/EIA-485-A, Section 4.2.6 (±80V for 15µs at a 1% duty cycle).
18. See “Caution” statement below the “Recommended Operating Conditions” on page 5.

multi-receiver applications, keep stubs connecting receivers to
the main cable as short as possible. Multipoint (multi-driver)
systems require that the main cable is terminated in its
characteristic impedance at both ends. Keep stubs connecting a
transceiver to the main cable as short as possible.
