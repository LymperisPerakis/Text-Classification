GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADM485 is a differential line transceiver suitable for high                                             The receiver contains a fail-safe feature that results in a logic

transmission lines. It is designed for balanced data transmission                                           The ADM485 is fabricated on BiCMOS, an advanced mixed
and complies with EIA standards RS-485 and RS-422. The part                                                 technology process combining low power CMOS with fast
contains a differential line driver and a differential line receiver.                                       switching bipolar technology. All inputs and outputs contain
Both the driver and the receiver can be enabled independently.                                              protection against ESD; all driver outputs feature high source
When disabled, the outputs are three-stated.                                                                and sink current capability. An epitaxial layer is used to guard
The ADM485 operates from a single 5 V power supply.                                                         against latch-up.
Excessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or by                                                  The ADM485 features extremely fast switching speeds. Minimal
output shorting is prevented by a thermal shutdown circuit. If                                              driver propagation delays permit transmission at data rates up
during fault conditions, a significant temperature increase is                                              to 5 Mbps while low skew minimizes EMI interference.
detected in the internal driver circuitry, this feature forces the
driver output into a high impedance state.                                                                  The part is fully specified over the commercial and industrial

bus, but only one driver should be enabled at any time. It is
important, therefore, that the remaining disabled drivers do not
load the bus. To ensure this, the ADM485 driver features high
output impedance when disabled and when powered down,
which minimizes the loading effect when the transceiver is not
being used. The high impedance driver output is maintained
over the common-mode voltage range of −7 V to +12 V.

Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings
may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress
rating only; functional operation of the device at these or any
other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute
maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

1         RO           Receiver Output. When enabled, if A is greater than B by 200 mV, RO is high. If A is less than B by 200 mV, RO is low.
2         RE           Receiver Output Enable. A low level enables the receiver output, RO. A high level places it in a high impedance state.
3         DE           Driver Output Enable. A high level enables the driver differential outputs, A and B. A low level places it in a high
                       impedance state.
4         DI           Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high, while a logic high on DI forces
                       A high and B low.

Differential data transmission is used to reliably transmit data at
high rates over long distances and through noisy environments.
Differential transmission nullifies the effects of ground shifts                         D                                                         D
