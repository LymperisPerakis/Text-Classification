General Description                                                        Features
The MAX3097E/MAX3098E feature three high-speed                             ●● Detects the Following RS-485 Faults:
RS-485/RS-422 receivers with fault-detection circuitry                        • Open-Circuit Condition
and fault-status outputs. The receivers’ inputs have fault                    • Short-Circuit Condition
thresholds that detect when the part is not in a valid state.                 • Low Differential Voltage Signal
The MAX3097E/MAX3098E indicate when a receiver                                • Common-Mode Range Violation
input is in an open-circuit condition, short-circuit condition,            ●● ESD Protection
or outside the common-mode range. They also generate                          • ±15kV—Human Body Model
a fault indication when the differential input voltage goes                   • ±15kV—IEC 1000-4-2, Air-Gap Discharge Method
below a preset threshold. See Ordering Information or the                     • ±8kV—IEC 1000-4-2, Contact Discharge Method
Electrical Characteristics for threshold values.                           ●● Single +3V to +5.5V Operation
The fault circuitry includes a capacitor-programmable                      ●● -10V to +13.2V Extended Common-Mode Range
delay to ensure that there are no erroneous fault conditions
                                                                           ●● Capacitor-Programmable Delay of Fault Indication
even at slow edge rates. Each receiver is capable of

Detecting Short Circuits
In Figure 8, if wires A and A are shorted together, then A
and A will be at the same potential, so the difference in
the voltage between the two will be approximately 0. This                         A
causes fault A to trigger since the difference between A - A                      A
is less than the differential fault threshold.

Detecting Open-Circuit Conditions
Detecting an open-circuit condition is similar to detecting a
short-circuit condition and relies on the terminating resistor                    B
being across A and A. For example, if the wire drops out                          Z
of the A terminal, A pulls A through the terminating resistor to
look like the same signal. In this condition, VID is approximately                Z
