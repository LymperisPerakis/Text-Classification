                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                  Note 4: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
                  Note 5: Shutdown is enabled by bringing RE high and DE low or by bringing SHDN high. If the enable inputs are in this state for less
                          than 50ns, the device is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 800ns, the device
                          is guaranteed to have entered shutdown.
