The MAX3471 half-duplex transceiver is intended for                                    ♦ 1.6µA Supply Current with Receiver Enabled
lithium battery-powered RS-485/RS-422 applications. It
draws only 1.6µA (typical) supply current from a 3.6V                                  ♦ +2.5V to +5.5V Single-Supply Operation

abled. Its wide 2.5V to 5.5V supply voltage guarantees
operation over the lifetime of a lithium battery.                                      ♦ Available in µMAX Package
This device features true fail-safe operation that guar-                               ♦ 1/8-Unit-Load Receiver Input

inputs are open or shorted. This means that the receiv-
er output will be a logic high if all transmitters on a ter-
minated bus are disabled (high impedance). The
MAX3471 has a 1/8-unit load input resistance. When

Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
        ground unless otherwise noted.
Note 2: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in magnitude of VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 3: Maximum and minimum current levels apply to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting.
