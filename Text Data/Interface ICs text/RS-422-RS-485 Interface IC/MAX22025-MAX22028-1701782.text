Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +85°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
           respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: This is the differential voltage from A to B that the driving device must see on the bus to disable its driver.
Note 4: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 5: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output states. CMTI
           applies to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between
           GNDA and GNDB. VCM = 1kV
