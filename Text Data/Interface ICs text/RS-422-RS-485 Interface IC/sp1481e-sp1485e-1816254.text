description
The SP1481E and the SP1485E are a family of half-duplex transceivers that meet the
specifications of RS-485 and RS-422 serial protocols with enhanced ESD performance. The
ESD tolerance has been improved on these devices to over +15KV for both Human Body
Model and IEC61000-4-2 Air Discharge Method. These devices are pin-to-pin compatible
with Exar's SP481 and SP485 devices as well as popular industry standards. As with the
original versions, the SP1481E and the SP1485E feature Exar's BiCMOS design allowing
low power operation without sacrificing performance. The SP1481E and SP1485E meet the
requirements of the RS-485 and RS-422 protocols up to 20Mbps under load. The SP1481E
is equipped with a low power Shutdown mode.

Drivers
The driver outputs of the SP1481E and
SP1485E are differential outputs meeting the
RS-485 and RS-422 standards.  The typical
voltage output swing with no load will be 0
Volts to +5 Volts.  With worst case loading
of 54Ω across the differential outputs, the
drivers can maintain greater than 1.5V volt-
age levels.  The drivers of the SP1481E, and
SP1485E have an enable control line which
is active HIGH.  A logic HIGH on DE (pin 3)
will enable the differential driver outputs.  A
logic LOW on DE (pin 3) will tri-state the
driver outputs.
The transmitters of the SP1481E and
SP1485E will operate up to at least
20Mbps.
Receivers
The SP1481E and SP1485E receivers have
differential inputs with an input sensitivity
as low as ±200mV.  Input impedance of the
receivers is typically 15kΩ (12kΩ minimum).  
A wide common mode range of -7V to +12V
allows for large ground potential differences
between systems.   The receivers of the
SP1481E and SP1485E have a tri-state
enable control pin.
