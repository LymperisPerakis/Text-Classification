NOTES:
  1. Add “-T*” suffix for tape and reel. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
  2. These Intersil Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte
     tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Intersil Pb-
     free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

  NAME  ISL31483E ISL31485E                                                               DESCRIPTION
   RO        2          1       Receiver output. If INV or RINV is low, then: If A - B  -10mV, RO is high; if A - B  -200mV, RO is low. If INV or RINV is high,
                                then: If B - A  -10mV, RO is high; if B - A  -200mV, RO is low. In all cases, RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating),
                                or shorted together, or connected to an undriven, terminated bus (i.e., Rx is always failsafe open, shorted and idle, even
                                if polarity is inverted).
    RE       3          -       Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high. Internally pulled low.
   DE        4          3       Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high and they are high impedance
                                when DE is low. Internally pulled high to VCC.
    DI       5          4       Driver input. If INV or DINV is low, a low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high, while a high on DI forces output
                                Y high and output Z low. The output states relative to DI invert if INV or DINV is high.
  GND       6, 7        5       Ground connection.
   A/Y        -         6       ±60V Fault Protected RS-485/RS-422 level I/O pin. If INV is low, A/Y is the non-inverting receiver input and
                                non-inverting driver output. If INV is high, A/Y is the inverting receiver input and the inverting driver output. Pin is an
                                input if DE = 0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
   B/Z        -         7       ±60V Fault Protected RS-485/RS-422 level I/O pin. If INV is low, B/Z is the inverting receiver input and inverting
                                driver output. If INV is high, B/Z is the non-inverting receiver input and the non-inverting driver output. Pin is an input
                                if DE = 0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
    A       12          -       ±60V Fault Protected RS-485/RS-422 level input. If RINV is low, then A is the non-inverting receiver input. If RINV is
                                high, then A is the inverting receiver input.
    B       11          -       ±60V Fault Protected RS-485/RS-422 level input. If RINV is low, then B is the inverting receiver input. If RINV is high,
                                then B is the non-inverting receiver input.
    Y        9          -       ±60V Fault Protected RS-485/RS-422 level output. If DINV is low, then Y is the non-inverting driver output. If DINV
                                is high, then Y is the inverting driver output.
    Z       10          -       ±60V Fault Protected RS-485/RS-422 level. If DINV is low, then Z is the inverting driver output. If DINV is high, then
                                Z is the non-inverting driver output.
   VCC    13, 14        8       System power supply input (4.5V to 5.5V).
   INV        -         2       Receiver and driver polarity selection input. When driven high this pin swaps the polarity of the driver output and receiver
                                input pins. If unconnected (floating) or connected low, normal RS-485 polarity conventions apply. Internally pulled low.
  RINV       1          -       Receiver polarity selection input. When driven high this pin swaps the polarity of the receiver input pins. If unconnected
                                (floating) or connected low, normal RS-485 polarity conventions apply. Internally pulled low.
  DINV       8          -       Driver polarity selection input. When driven high this pin swaps the polarity of the driver output pins. If unconnected
                                (floating) or connected low, normal RS-485 polarity conventions apply. Internally pulled low.

NOTES:
  4. JA is measured with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See Tech Brief TB379 for details.
  5. For JC, the “case temp” location is taken at the package top center.
Electrical Specifications Test Conditions: VCC = 4.5V to 5.5V; Unless Otherwise Specified. Typicals are at VCC = 5V, TA = +25°C (Note 6).
Boldface limits apply across the operating temperature range, -40°C to +85°C.

NOTES:
  6. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
  7. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
  8. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 14 for more information
  9. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
10. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
11. Transceivers (except on the ISL31485E) are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the
     parts are guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See
     “Low Power Shutdown Mode” on page 13.
12. Keep RE = VCC and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
13. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
14. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
     and are not production tested.
15. Tested according to TIA/EIA-485-A, Section 4.2.6 (±80V for 15ms at a 1% duty cycle).
16. Does not apply to the ISL31485E. The ISL31485E has no Rx enable function and thus no SHDN function.
17. See “Caution” statement under the “Recommended Operating Conditions” section on page 6.
18. This parameter is not production tested.

In the event of a major short-circuit condition, devices also include
a thermal shutdown feature that disables the drivers whenever the
die temperature becomes excessive. This eliminates the power
dissipation, allowing the die to cool. The drivers automatically
reenable after the die temperature drops about 15°C. If the
contention persists, the thermal shutdown/re-enable cycle repeats
until the fault is cleared. Receivers stay operational during thermal
shutdown.
Low Power Shutdown Mode
These CMOS transceivers all use a fraction of the power required
by competitive devices, but they also include a shutdown feature
(except the ISL31485E) that reduces the already low quiescent
ICC to a 10µA trickle. These devices enter shutdown whenever
the receiver and driver are simultaneously disabled (RE = VCC
and DE = GND) for a period of at least 600ns. Disabling both the
driver and the receiver for less than 60ns guarantees that the
transceiver will not enter shutdown.
Note that receiver and driver enable times increase when the
transceiver enables from shutdown. Refer to Notes 9, 10, 11, 12
and 13, at the end of the “Electrical Specification” table on
page 8, for more information.
