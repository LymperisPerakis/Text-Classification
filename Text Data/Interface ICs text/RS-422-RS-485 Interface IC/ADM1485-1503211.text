CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily
accumulate on the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although the
ADM1485 features proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices
subjected to high energy electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended
to avoid performance degradation or loss of functionality.

on multipoint transmission lines. A typical application showing
a multipoint transmission network is illustrated in Figure 5.

on the bus. Only one driver can transmit at a particular time,
but multiple receivers may be enabled simultaneously.
