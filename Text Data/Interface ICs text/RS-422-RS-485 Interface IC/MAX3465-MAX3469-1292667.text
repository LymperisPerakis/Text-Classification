The MAX3465–MAX3469 are high-speed differential                ♦ Recommended for Profibus Applications
bus transceivers for RS-485 and RS-422 communica-
tions. They are designed to meet TIA/EIA-422-B,                ♦ Up to 40Mbps Data Rate
TIA/EIA-485-A, V.11, and X.27 standards. The trans-            ♦ 15ns Transmitter Propagation Delay
ceiver complies with the Profibus specification provid-        ♦ 20ns Receiver Propagation Delay
ing +2.1V minimum output level with a 54Ω load,
40Mbps data rate, and output skew less than 2ns. Each          ♦ 2ns Transmitter and Receiver Skew
part contains one three-state differential line driver and     ♦ High Differential Driver Output Level (2.1V on 54Ω)
one differential input line receiver. The devices operate
from a +5V supply and feature true fail-safe circuitry,        ♦ Hot-Swap Versions
which guarantees a logic-high receiver output when the         ♦ 1µA Shutdown Supply Current
receiver inputs are open or shorted. This enables all
receiver outputs on a terminated bus to output logic           ♦ Low Supply Current Requirements (2.5mA, typ)
highs when all transmitters are disabled.                      ♦ Allow Up to 128 Transceivers on the Bus
All devices feature a 1/4-standard-unit load receiver          ♦ True Fail-Safe Receiver while Maintaining EIA/TIA-
input impedance that allows 128 transceivers on the              485 Compatibility
bus. Driver and receiver propagation delays are guar-
anteed under 20ns for multidrop, clock distribution            ♦ Designed for Multipoint Transmissions on Long
applications. Drivers are short-circuit current limited          or Noisy Bus Lines
and are protected against excessive power dissipation          ♦ Full-Duplex and Half-Duplex Versions Available
by thermal-shutdown circuitry. The driver and receiver
feature active-high and active-low enables, respective-        ♦ Phase Controls to Correct for Twisted-Pair

                  Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
                          ground, unless otherwise noted.
                  Note 2: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
                  Note 3: The short-circuit output current applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; the short-circuit foldback output
                          current applies during current limiting to allow a recovery from bus contention.
                  Note 4: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
                  Note 5: Shutdown is enabled by bringing RE high and DE low or by bringing SHDN high. If the enable inputs are in this state for less
                          than 50ns, the device is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 800ns, the device
                          is guaranteed to have entered shutdown.
