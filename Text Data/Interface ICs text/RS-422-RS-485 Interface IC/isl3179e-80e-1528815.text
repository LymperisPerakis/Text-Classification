Pin Descriptions
   PIN                                                                       FUNCTION
   RO     Receiver output: If A-B ≥ -50mV, RO is high; If A-B ≤ -200mV, RO is low; If A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted, or connected to a
          terminated bus that is undriven, RO is high.
   RE     Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high. If the Rx enable function isn’t required, connect
          RE directly to GND.
   DE     Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high, and they are high impedance when DE is low. If the Tx
          enable function is not required, connect DE to VCC through a 1kΩ or greater resistor.
    DI    Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. Similarly, a high on DI forces output Y high and output Z low.
  GND     Ground connection. This is also the potential of the DFN’s exposed metal pad.
   A/Y    ±16.5kV IEC61000 ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, noninverting receiver input and noninverting driver output. Pin is an input (A) if
          DE = 0; pin is an output (Y) if DE = 1. ISL3179E only.
   B/Z    ±16.5kV IEC61000 ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, inverting receiver input and inverting driver output. Pin is an input (B) if DE = 0;
          pin is an output (Z) if DE = 1. ISL3179E only.
    A     ±12kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, noninverting receiver input. ISL3180E only.
    B     ±12kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, inverting receiver input. ISL3180E only.
    Y     ±12kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, noninverting driver output. ISL3180E only.
    Z     ±12kV HBM ESD protected RS-485/RS-422 level, inverting driver output. ISL3180E only.
   VCC    System power supply input (3.0V to 3.6V).
   NC     No internal connection.
   EP     The exposed metal pad on the bottom of the DFN; connect to GND.

NOTES:
  6. JA is measured with the component mounted on a high-effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. Refer to TB379 for details.
  7. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.
  8. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high-effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. Refer to
      TB379 for details.

NOTES:
  9. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
10. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
11. Applies to peak current. Refer to “Typical Performance Curves” on page 9 for more information.
12. Because of the shutdown feature, keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
13. Because of the shutdown feature, the RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
14. These ICs are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts are guaranteed not to enter
     shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 700ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered shutdown. Refer to “Low Power Shutdown Mode”
     on page 13.
15. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >700ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
16. Set the RE signal high time >700ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
17. This is the part-to-part skew between any two units tested with identical test conditions (Temperature, VCC, etc.).
18. VCC = 3.3V ±5%.
19. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization, and/or design.

Twisted pair is the cable of choice for RS-485/RS-422 networks.                                          more information.
Twisted pair cables tend to pick up noise and other
electromagnetically induced voltages as common-mode signals,
which are effectively rejected by the differential receiver in this IC.
Proper termination is imperative to minimize reflections. In point-
to-point, or point-to-multipoint (single driver on bus) networks,
the main cable should be terminated in its characteristic
impedance (typically 120Ω) at the end farthest from the driver. In
multireceiver applications, stubs connecting receivers to the
main cable should be kept as short as possible. Multipoint
(multidriver) systems require that the main cable be terminated
in its characteristic impedance at both ends. Stubs connecting a
transceiver to the main cable should be kept as short as possible.
The ISL3179E and ISL3180E may also be used at slower data
rates over longer cables, but some limitations apply. The Rx is
optimized for high speed operation, so its output may glitch if the
Rx input differential transition times are too slow. Keeping the
transition times below 500ns, which equates to the Tx driving a
1000ft (305m) CAT 5 cable, yields excellent performance over
the full operating temperature range.
