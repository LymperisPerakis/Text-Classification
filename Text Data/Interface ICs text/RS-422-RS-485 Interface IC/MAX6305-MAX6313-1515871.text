Note 2: The MAX6305/MAX6308/MAX6311 switch from undervoltage reset to normal operation between 1.5V < VCC < 2.5V.
Note 3: The MAX6306/MAX6307/MAX6309/MAX6310/MAX6312/MAX6313 monitor VCC through an internal factory-trimmed voltage
        divider, which programs the nominal reset threshold. Factory-trimmed reset thresholds are available in approximately
        100mV increments from 2.5V to 5V (Table 1).

† The MAX6306/MAX6307/MAX6309/MAX6310/MAX6312/
MAX6313 are available with factory-set VCC reset thresholds from
2.5V to 5V, in 0.1V increments. Insert the desired nominal reset
threshold (from Table 1) into the blanks following the letters UK.
All parts also offer factory-programmed reset timeout periods.
Insert the number corresponding to the desired nominal timeout
period index following the “D” in the part number (D1 = 1ms min,
D2 = 20ms min, D3 = 140ms min, and D4 = 1120ms min). There
are 10 standard versions with a required order increment of 2,500
pieces. Sample stock is generally held on the standard versions
only (see Standard Versions table). Required order increment is
10,000 pieces for non-standard versions. Contact factory for avail-
ability of non-standard versions. All devices available in tape-and-
reel only.
Devices are available in both leaded and lead-free packaging.
Specify lead-free by replacing “-T” with “+T” when ordering.
