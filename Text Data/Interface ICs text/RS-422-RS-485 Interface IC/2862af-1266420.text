Pin Functions
PIN NAME        PIN NUMBER                                                     DESCRIPTION
RO                   1          Receiver Output. If the receiver output is enabled (RE low) and A–B > 200mV, then RO will be high.
                                If A–B < –200mV, then RO will be low. If the receiver inputs are open, shorted, or terminated without a
                                signal, RO will be high. Integrated 250kΩ pull-up to VCC.
RE                   2          Receiver Enable. A low input enables the receiver. A high input forces the receiver output into a high
                                impedance state. If RE is high with DE low, the part will enter a low power shutdown state.
DE                   3          Driver Enable. A high input on DE enables the driver. A low input will force the driver outputs into a high
                                impedance state. If DE is low with RE high, the part will enter a low power shutdown state.
DI                   4          Driver Input. If the driver outputs are enabled (DE high), then a low on DI forces the driver noninverting
                                output A low and inverting output B high. A high on DI, with the driver outputs enabled, forces the
                                driver noninverting output A high and inverting output B low.
GND                  5          Ground.
Exposed Pad          9          Connect the exposed pad on the DFN packages to GND.
B                    7          Inverting Receiver Input and Inverting Driver Output.
                                Impedance is ~112kΩ in receive mode or unpowered.
A                    6          Noninverting Receiver Input and Noninverting Driver Output.
                                Impedance is ~112kΩ in receive mode or unpowered.
VCC                  8          Power Supply. 3V < VCC < 5.5V. Bypass with 1µF ceramic capacitor to GND for best ESD performance.
