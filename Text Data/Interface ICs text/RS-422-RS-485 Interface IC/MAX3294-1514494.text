 Delay Matching                                  difference between devices = +30°C (Note 5)
Note 1: Devices production tested at +25°C. Limits over the operating temperature range are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
          ground, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 4: The maximum current applies to peak current just prior to foldback current limiting.
Note 5: Guaranteed by design; not production tested.

(DI) and translates it to a differential RS-485/RS-422
level output (Y and Z). Driving DE high enables the
driver, while pulling DE low places the driver outputs
(Y and Z) into a high-impedance state (see Table 1).
