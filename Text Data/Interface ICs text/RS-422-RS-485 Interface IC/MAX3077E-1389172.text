Note 1: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
         ground, unless otherwise noted.
Note 2: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 3: The short-circuit output current applies to peak current just prior to foldback current limiting. The short-circuit foldback output
         current applies during current limiting to allow a recovery from bus contention.
