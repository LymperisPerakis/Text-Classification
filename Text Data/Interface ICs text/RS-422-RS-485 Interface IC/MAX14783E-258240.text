Note 2: All devices 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to ground,
         unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 5: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
Note 6: Guaranteed by design; not production tested.
Note 7: The timing parameter refers to the driver or receiver enable delay, when the device has exited the initial hot-swap protect
         state and is in normal operating mode.
Note 8: Shutdown is enabled by driving RE high and DE low. The device is guaranteed to have entered shutdown after tSHDN has
         elapsed.

Low-Power Shutdown Mode
Low-power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing RE
high and DE low. In shutdown, the devices draw less than
10µA of supply current.
