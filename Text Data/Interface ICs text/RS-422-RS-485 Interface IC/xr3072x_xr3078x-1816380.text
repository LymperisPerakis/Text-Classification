1. Change in magnitude of differential output voltage and change in magnitude of common mode output voltage are the changes in output voltage when
DI input changes state.
2. The hot swap feature disables the DE and RE inputs for the first 10µs after power is applied. Following this time period these inputs are weakly pulled
to their disabled state (low for DE, high for RE) until the first transition, after which they become high impedance inputs.
3. The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low simultaneously for at least 600ns. If the control inputs are in this state for less
than 50ns, the device is guaranteed to not enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are held in this state for at least 600ns, the device is assured to be in
shutdown. Note that the receiver and driver enable times increase significantly when coming out of shutdown.
4. This spec is guaranteed by design and bench characterization.

The XR3072X receiver incorporates internal filtering in
addition to input hysteresis. This filtering enhances noise
immunity by ignoring signals that do not meet a minimum
pulse width of 30ns. Receiver propagation delay increases
slightly due to this filtering. The high speed XR3078X does
not have this input filtering.
Hot-Swap Capability
When VCC is first applied, the XR3072X and XR3078X hold
the driver enable and receiver enable inactive for
approximately 10 microseconds. During power ramp-up,
other system ICs may drive unpredictable values, or
tri-stated lines may be influenced by stray capacitance. The
hot-swap feature prevents these devices from driving any
output signal until power has stabilized. After the initial
10µs, the driver and receiver enable pins are weakly pulled
to their disabled states (low for DE, high for RE) until the
first transition. After the first transition, the DE and RE pins
operate as high impedance inputs.

IEC 61000-4-2
The IEC 61000-4-2 standard covers ESD testing and
performance of finished equipment. However, it does not
specifically refer to integrated circuits. The XR3072X and
XR3078X help you design equipment to meet IEC 61000-
4-2, without sacrificing board space and cost for external
ESD-protection components.
The major difference between tests done using the Human
Body Model and IEC 61000-4-2 is higher peak current in
IEC 61000-4-2. Series resistance is lower in the
IEC 61000-4-2 model. Hence, the ESD withstand voltage
measured to IEC 61000-4-2 is generally lower than that of
the Human Body Model.
The air-gap test involves approaching the device with a
charged probe. The contact discharge method connects
the probe to the device before the probe is energized.
