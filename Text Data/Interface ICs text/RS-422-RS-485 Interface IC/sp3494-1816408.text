General Description                                             Features
The SP3494 device is a 3.3V low power half-duplex               ■  Operates from a single 3.3V supply
transceiver that meets the specifications of the RS-485
and RS-422 serial protocols. This device is pin-to-pin          ■  Interoperable with 5.0V logic
compatible with the MaxLinear SP481E device and other           ■  ±200mV receiver input sensitivity
popular industry standard devices. The SP3494 features
the MaxLinear BiCMOS process, allowing low power                ■  -7V to +12V common-mode input voltage range
operation without sacrificing performance. The partially        ■  Allows up to 32 transceivers on the serial bus
slew-rate limited drivers minimize EMI and reduce
reflections caused by improperly terminated cables              ■  Driver / receiver enable lines
allowing error-free data transmission. The SP3494 is a          ■  10μA low-power shutdown mode
half-duplex partially slew-rate limited transceiver that will
deliver a data transmission rate up to 2.5Mbps. The             ■  Compatibility with the MAX3486 and 75176 industry
SP3494 is equipped with a low-power shutdown mode                  standard pinout
and driver / receiver high-Z enable lines.
