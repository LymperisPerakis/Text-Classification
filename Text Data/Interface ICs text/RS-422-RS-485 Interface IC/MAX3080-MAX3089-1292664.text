                             General Description                              Next Generation Device Features
 The MAX3080–MAX3089 high-speed transceivers for                         ♦ For Fault-Tolerant Applications:
 RS-485/RS-422 communication contain one driver and                         MAX3430: ±80V Fault-Protected, Fail-Safe, 1/4-
 one receiver. These devices feature fail-safe circuitry,
                                                                            Unit Load, +3.3V RS-485 Transceiver
 which guarantees a logic-high receiver output when the
 receiver inputs are open or shorted. This means that                    ♦ For Low-Voltage Applications:
 the receiver output will be a logic high if all transmitters               MAX3362: +3.3V, High-Speed, RS-485/RS-422
 on a terminated bus are disabled (high impedance).                         Transceiver in a SOT23 Package

 slew rates are not limited, making transmit speeds up                                                         Applications

Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
          ground unless otherwise noted.
Note 2: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
Note 3: The SRL pin is internally biased to VCC / 2 by a 100kΩ/100kΩ resistor divider. It is guaranteed to be VCC / 2 if left
          unconnected.
Note 4: Maximum current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; minimum current level applies during
          current limiting.

Note 5: The device is put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the
           device is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the device is guaranteed
           to have entered shutdown.
