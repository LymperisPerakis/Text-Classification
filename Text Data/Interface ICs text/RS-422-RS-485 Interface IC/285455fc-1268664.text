LTC2855 are very low —typically under 500µA for all modes                                           The logic inputs of the LTC2854/LTC2855 have 150mV of
of operation. In applications with resistively terminated                                           hysteresis to provide noise immunity. Fast edges on the
cables, the supply current is dominated by the driver load.                                         outputs can cause glitches in the ground and power supplies
For example, when using two 120Ω terminators with a                                                 which are exacerbated by capacitive loading. If a logic input

This is true whether the terminators are external or internal                                       on the logic and data input pins causing an unintended
