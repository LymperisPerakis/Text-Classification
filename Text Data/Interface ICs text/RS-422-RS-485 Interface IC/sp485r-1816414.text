                      1/10th Unit Load RS-485 Transceiver
FEATURES
• Allows Over 400 Transceivers On A
  Transmission Line (1/10th Unit Load)
• High Impedance on Receiver Inputs
  (RIN = 150kΩ typical)
• Half-Duplex Configuration Consistent
  With Industry Standard Pinout
• -7V to +12V Common Mode Input
  Voltage Range
• Low Power Consumption (250mW)
• Separate Driver and Receiver Enable
                                                                         DESCRIPTION
The SP485R is a pin-to-pin equivalent to our existing SP485 product and offers a high
receiver input impedance. The higher receiver input impedance allows for connecting over
400 transceivers on a single transmission line without degrading the RS-485 driver signal.
The device is packaged in a 8-pin plastic DIP or 8-pin narrow SOIC.

standard by allowing up to 400 receivers to
share the bus
DRIVERS
The driver output complies with the RS-
485 electrical characteristics as specified
by the standard. The output swings from
0V to Vcc and maintains greater than +1.5V
with a 54Ω load attached between the two
outputs. In adhering to the RS-485 specifi-
cation, the driver outputs inherently comply
with the RS-422 standard. With a load of
100Ω between the two outputs, the driver
can sustain at least +2.0V.
The driver contains an enable pin (DE) which
tri-states the output when DE is logic LOW.
The outputs during the tri-state condition are
at high impedance (>100kΩ). A logic HIGH
enables the driver for normal operation. The
driver can operate to at least 5Mbps.
RECEIVERS
The SP485R receiver has differential in-
puts with an input sensitivity of lower than
±200mV. As mentioned above, the RS-485
specification allows up to 32 transceivers on
the same bus. The SP485R allows over 400
transceivers on the same bus due to its high
impedance of at least 120kΩ. This higher
capacity allows more components to be at-
tached to the same bus without degrading
the signal quality. The drivers are still able to
drive an equivalent 54Ω from the 320
