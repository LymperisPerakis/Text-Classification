  VSC is the short-circuit voltage at the RS-485 A or B bus pin.
2
  Common-mode transient immunity is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM
  is the common-mode potential difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The
  common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.
