NOTES:
 1. Add “-T*” suffix for tape and reel. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
 2. These Intersil Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte
    tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Intersil Pb-
    free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

Pin Descriptions
    PIN    MODE                                                                  FUNCTION
  485/232 BOTH   Interface mode select input. High for RS-485 Mode and low for RS-232 Mode.
    DEN   BOTH   Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DEN high. They are high impedance when DEN is low.
    GND   BOTH   Ground connection. This is also the potential of the QFN's thermal exposed pad (EP).
     NC   BOTH   No Connection.
     ON   BOTH   In RS-232 mode only, ON high enables the charge pumps. ON low, with DEN and RXEN low (and RXEN high if QFN), turns off the
                 charge pumps (in RS-232 mode), and in either mode places the device in low power shutdown. In both modes, when ON is low,
                 and DEN is high, and RXEN is high or RXEN is low, loopback is enabled.
   RXEN   BOTH   Receiver output enable. Rx is enabled when RXEN is high; Rx is high impedance when RXEN is low and, if using the QFN package,
                 RXEN is high. When using the QFN and the active high Rx enable function, RXEN should be high or floating.
   RXEN   BOTH   Active low receiver output enable. Rx is enabled when RXEN is low; Rx is high impedance when RXEN is high and RXEN is low.
                 (i.e., to use active low Rx enable function, tie RXEN to GND). For single signal Tx/Rx direction control, connect RXEN to DEN.
                 Internally pulled high. (QFN only)
    VCC   BOTH   System power supply input (5V).
     VL   BOTH   Logic-Level Supply. All TTL/CMOS inputs and outputs are powered by this supply. (QFN only)
      A   RS-232 Receiver input with 15kV ESD protection. A low on A forces RA high; a high on A forces RA low.
          RS-485 Inverting receiver input with 15kV ESD protection.
      B   RS-232 Receiver input with 15kV ESD protection. A low on B forces RB high; a high on B forces RB low.
          RS-485 Noninverting receiver input with 15kV ESD protection.
     DY   RS-232 Driver input. A low on DY forces output Y high. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Y low.
          RS-485 Driver input. A low on DY forces output Y high and output Z low. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Y low and output Z high.
     DZ   RS-232 Driver input. A low on DZ forces output Z high. Similarly, a high on DZ forces output Z low.
   SLEW   RS-485 Slew rate control. With the SLEW pin high, the drivers run at the maximum slew rate (20Mbps). With the SLEW pin low, the drivers
                 run at a reduced slew rate (460kbps). On the QFN version, works in conjunction with SPB to select one of three RS-485 data
                 rates. Internally pulled high in RS-485 mode.
    SPB   RS-485 Speed control. Works in conjunction with the SLEW pin to select the 20Mbps, 460kbps or 115kbps RS-485 data rate. Internally
                 pulled high. (QFN only)
     RA   RS-232 Receiver output.
          RS-485 Receiver output: If B > A by at least -40mV, RA is high; If B < A by -200mV or more, RA is low; RA = High if A and B are unconnected
                 (floating) or shorted together (i.e., full fail-safe).
     RB   RS-232 Receiver output.
          RS-485 Not used. Output is high impedance, and unaffected by RXEN and RXEN.
      Y   RS-232 Driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
          RS-485 Inverting driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
      Z   RS-232 Driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
          RS-485 Noninverting driver output with 15kV ESD protection.
    C1+   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
    C1-   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
    C2+   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
    C2-   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
     V+   RS-232 Internally generated positive RS-232 transmitter supply (+5.5V). C3 not needed in RS-485 Mode.
     V-   RS-232 Internally generated negative RS-232 transmitter supply (-5.5V). C4 not needed in RS-485 Mode.

NOTES:
10. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
11. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DEN = 0V.
12. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 18 for more information.
13. RIN defaults to RS-485 mode (>15k) when the device is unpowered (VCC = 0V), or in SHDN, regardless of the state of the 485/232 pin.
14. VCC  5.25V.
15. The Slew pin has a pull-up resistor that enables only when in RS-485 mode (485/232 = VCC).
16. ON, RXEN, and DEN all simultaneously switched Low-to-High.
17. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
     and are not production tested.

Low Power Shutdown (SHDN) Mode
The ISL81387, ISL41387 enter the SHDN mode when ON = 0, and
the Tx and Rx are disabled (DEN = 0, RXEN = 0, and RXEN = 1), and
the already low supply current drops to as low as 5µA. SHDN
disables the Tx and Rx outputs, and disables the charge pumps if
the port is in RS-232 mode, so V+ collapses to VCC, and V- collapses
to GND.
All but 5µA of SHDN ICC current is due to control input (SPB,
SLEW) pull-up resistors (~20µA/resistor), so SHDN ICC varies
depending on the ISL81387, ISL41387 configuration. The
specification tables indicate the worst case values, but careful
selection of the configuration yields lower currents. For example,
in RS-232 mode the SPB pin isn’t used, so floating it or tying it
high minimizes SHDN ICC
