The SP481E and SP485E are a family of half-duplex transceivers that meet the specifica-
tions of RS-485 and RS-422 serial protocols with enhanced ESD performance. The ESD
tolerance has been improved on these devices to over +15kV for both Human Body Model
and IEC1000-4-2 Air Discharge Method. These devices are pin-to-pin compatible with Exar's
SP481 and SP485 devices as well as popular industry standards. As with the original ver-
sions, the SP481E and SP485E feature Exar's BiCMOS design allowing low power opera-
tion without sacrificing performance. The SP481E and SP485E meet the requirements of
the RS-485 and RS-422 protocols up to 10Mbps under load. The SP481E is equipped with
a low power shutdown mode.
