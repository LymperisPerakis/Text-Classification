NOTES:
 4. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless
     otherwise specified.
 5. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
 6. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” on page 9 for more information.
 7. Devices meeting these limits are denoted as “single unit load (1 UL)” transceivers. The RS-485 standard allows up to 32 Unit Loads on the bus.
 8. Not applicable to the ISL8488E, ISL8490E.
 9. Parts are 100% tested at +25°C. Over-temperature limits established by characterization and are not production tested.
