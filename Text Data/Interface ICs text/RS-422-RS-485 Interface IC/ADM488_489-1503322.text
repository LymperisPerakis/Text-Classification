line receiver, making them suitable for full-duplex data transfer.                                          The ADM488/ADM489 are fully specified over the industrial
The ADM489 contains an additional receiver and driver enable                                                temperature range and are available in PDIP, SOIC, and TSSOP

The input impedance is 12 kΩ, allowing 32 transceivers to be
connected on the bus.
The ADM488/ADM489 operate from a single 5 V ± 10% power
supply. Excessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or
output shorting is prevented by a thermal shutdown circuit.
This feature forces the driver output into a high impedance state
if, during fault conditions, a significant temperature increase is
detected in the internal driver circuitry.

ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on
the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.
