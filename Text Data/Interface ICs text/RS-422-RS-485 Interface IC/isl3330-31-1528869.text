Pin Descriptions
    PIN    MODE                                                                FUNCTION
  485/232 BOTH   Interface Mode Select input. High for RS-485 Mode and low for RS-232 Mode.
   DEN    BOTH   Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DEN high. They are high impedance when DEN
                 is low.
   GND    BOTH   Ground connection.
    NC    BOTH   No Connection.
    ON    BOTH   In RS-232 mode only, ON high enables the charge pumps. ON low, with DEN and RXEN low (and RXEN high if QFN), turns
                 off the charge pumps (in RS-232 mode), and in either mode places the device in low power shutdown. In both modes, when
                 ON is low, and DEN is high, and RXEN is high or RXEN is low, loopback is enabled.
   RXEN   BOTH   Receiver output enable. Rx is enabled when RXEN is high; Rx is high impedance when RXEN is low and, if using the QFN
                 package, RXEN is high. When using the QFN and the active high Rx enable function, RXEN should be high or floating.
   RXEN   BOTH   Active low receiver output enable. Rx is enabled when RXEN is low; Rx is high impedance when RXEN is high and RXEN
                 is low. (i.e., to use active low Rx enable function, tie RXEN to GND). For single signal Tx/Rx direction control, connect RXEN
                 to DEN. Internally pulled high. (QFN only)
    VCC   BOTH   System power supply input (3.3V).
     VL   BOTH   Logic-Level Supply. All TTL/CMOS inputs and outputs are powered by this supply. QFN logic input pins that are externally
                 tied high in an application, should use the VL supply for the high voltage level. (QFN only)
     A    RS-232 Receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection. A low on A forces RA high; A high on A forces RA low.
          RS-485 Inverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
     B    RS-232 Receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection. A low on B forces RB high; A high on B forces RB low.
          RS-485 Noninverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
     DY   RS-232 Driver input. A low on DY forces output Y high. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Y low.
          RS-485 Driver input. A low on DY forces output Y high and output Z low. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Y low and output Z high.
 DZ/SLEW RS-232 Driver input. A low on DZ forces output Z high. Similarly, a high on DZ forces output Z low.
          RS-485 Slew rate control. With the SLEW pin high, the drivers run at the maximum slew rate (20Mbps). With the SLEW pin low, the
                 drivers run at a reduced slew rate (460kbps). The QFN version works in conjunction with SPB to select one of three RS-485
                 data rates. Internally pulled high in RS-485 mode.
    SPB   RS-485 Speed control. Works in conjunction with the SLEW pin to select the 20Mbps, 460kbps or 115kbps RS-485 data rate.
                 Internally pulled high. (QFN only)
     RA   RS-232 Receiver output.
          RS-485 Receiver output: If B > A by at least -40mV, RA is high; If B < A by -200mV or more, RA is low; RA = High if A and B are
                 unconnected (floating) or shorted together (i.e., full fail-safe).
     RB   RS-232 Receiver output.
          RS-485 Not used. Output is high impedance, and unaffected by RXEN and RXEN.
     Y    RS-232 Driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
          RS-485 Inverting driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
     Z    RS-232 Driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
          RS-485 Noninverting driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
    C1+   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
    C1-   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage doubler) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
    C2+   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
    C2-   RS-232 External capacitor (voltage inverter) is connected to this lead. Not needed in RS-485 Mode.
     V+   RS-232 Internally generated positive RS-232 transmitter supply (+5.5V). C3 not needed in RS-485 Mode.
     V-   RS-232 Internally generated negative RS-232 transmitter supply (-5.5V). C4 not needed in RS-485 Mode.

NOTES:
  5. One output at a time, IOUT  100mA for  10 minutes.
  6. JA is measured with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See Tech Brief TB379 for details.
  7. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See
     Tech Brief TB379.
  8. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.

NOTES:
 9. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
    specified.
10. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DEN = 0V.
11. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 19 for more information.
12. RIN defaults to RS-485 mode (>15k) when the device is unpowered (VCC = 0V), or in SHDN, regardless of the state of the 485/232 pin.
13. The Slew pin has a pull-up resistor that enables only when in RS-485 mode (485/232 = VCC).
14. ON, RXEN, and DEN all simultaneously switched Low-to-High.
15. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
    and are not production tested.
