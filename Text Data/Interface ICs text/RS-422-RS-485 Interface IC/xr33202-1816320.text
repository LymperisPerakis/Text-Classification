Applications Information (Continued)
Low Power Shutdown Mode
The XR33202 has a low-power shutdown mode that is initiated by bringing both RE high and DE low simultaneously. While
in shutdown the XR33202 draws less than 1μA of supply current. DE and RE may be tied together and driven by a single
control signal. Devices are guaranteed not to enter shutdown if RE is high and DE is low for less than 50ns. If the inputs are
in this state for at least 600ns, the parts will enter shutdown.
XR33202 enable times, tDZH, tDZL, tRZH and tRZL apply when the part is not in low power shutdown state. Enable times,
tDZH(SHDN), tDZL(SHDN), tRZH(SHDN) and tRZL(SHDN)apply when the part is shutdown. The driver and receiver take longer to
become enabled from low power shutdown than from driver or receiver disable mode.
