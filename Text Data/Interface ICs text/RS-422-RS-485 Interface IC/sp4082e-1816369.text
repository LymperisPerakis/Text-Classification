The SP4082E is designed for reliable, bidirectional communication on multipoint bus transmission
lines. The device contains one differential driver and one differential receiver. It is a half-duplex de-
vice. The device complys with TIA/EIA-485 and TIA/EIA-422 standards. Lead-free and RoHS compli-
ant packages are available.
This device is ruggedized for use in harsh operating conditions over the entire common-mode volt-
age range from -7V to +12V. Receivers are specially designed to fail-safe to a logic high output state
if the inputs are un-driven or shorted. All RS-485 bus-pins are protected against severe ESD events
up to ±15kV (Human Body Model). Drivers are protected from excess current flow caused by bus
contention or output short-circuits by both an internal current limit and a thermal-overload shutdown.
Devices are rated for industrial (-40 to +85ºC) operating temperatures. Receivers have exceptionally
high input impedance, which places only 1/8th the standard load on a shared bus. Up to 256 trans-
ceivers may coexist while preserving full signal margin.
The device operates from a single 5.0V power supply and draws negligible quiescent power. The
device has an independent enable and disable for the driver and receiver and will enter a low power
shutdown mode if both driver and receiver are disabled. All outputs maintain high impedance during
shutdown or when powered-off.

Notes:
1. Change in Magnitude of Differential Output Voltage and Change in Magnitude of Common Mode Output Voltage are the changes in output voltage when DI input changes state.
2. The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 50ns the device does not enter shutdown. If the enable inputs
are held in this state for at least 600ns the device is assured to be in shutdown. In this low power mode most circuitry is disabled and supply current is typically 1nA.
3.Characterized, not 100% tested.

mon-mode voltage range. Second, a thermal-
shutdown circuit forces the driver outputs into

becomes excessive.
LINE LENGTH, EMI, AND REFLECTIONS
It features controlled slew-rate drivers that mini-
mize EMI and reduce reflections caused by im-
properly terminated cables.
Driver rise and fall times are limited to no faster
than 667ns, allowing error-free data transmis-
sion up to 115kbps.
The RS-485/RS-422 standard covers line
lengths up to 4,000ft. Maximum achievable
line length is a function of signal attenuation
and noise. Use of slew-controlled drivers may
help to reduce crosstalk interference and permit
communication over longer transmission lines.
Termination prevents reflections by eliminating
the impedance mismatches on a transmission
line. Line termination is typically used if rise and
fall times are shorter than the round-trip signal
propagation time. Slew-limited drivers may re-
duce or eliminate the need for cable termination
in many applications.
