Pin Descriptions
 PIN NAME                                                                      FUNCTION
     RO     Receiver output: If A - B  -50mV, RO is high; If A - B  -200mV, RO is low; RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted.
   RE, RE   Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE/RE is high / low; RO is high impedance when RE/RE is low/high. If the Rx enable function
            is not used, connect RE directly to GND, or connect RE through a 1kΩ, or greater, resistor to VCC. RE/RE are internally pulled low/high.
    GND     Ground connection. This is also the potential of the TDFN thermal pad.
      A     ±16.5kV IEC61000 ESD protected RS-485, RS-422 level, noninverting receiver input.
      B     ±16.5kV IEC61000 ESD protected RS-485, RS-422 level, inverting receiver input.
    VCC     System power supply input (3.0V to 5.5V). On devices with a VL pin powered from a separate supply, power-up VCC first.
     VL     Logic-level supply, which sets the VIL / VIH levels for the RE (ISL3282E only) and RE (ISL3285E only) pins and sets the VOH level of the RO
            output (ISL3282E, ISL3284E, ISL3285E only). If VL and VCC are different supplies, power-up this supply after VCC and keep VL ≤ VCC.
     NC     No Connection.

     specified.
  9. Does not apply to the ISL3280E or ISL3284E.
10. If the Rx enable function isn’t needed, connect the enable pin to the appropriate supply, as described in the “Pin Descriptions” table on page 4
11. Parts are 100% tested at +25°C. Over-temperature limits established by characterization and are not production tested.
12. Typical values are at 3.3V, 5V. Parameters with a single entry in the “TYP” column apply to 3.3V and 5V.
