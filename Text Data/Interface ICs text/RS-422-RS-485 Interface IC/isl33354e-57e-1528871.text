The ISL33354E, ISL33357E are two port interface ICs where
port 1 is configured as a dual (2 Tx, 2 Rx) RS-232 transceiver,
                                                                         Features
and port 2 is a single RS-485/422 transceiver.                           • ±15kV (HBM) ESD protected bus pins (RS-232 or RS-485)

     NC      -   12, 20, 32,     BOTH    No Internal Connection.
                 33, 39, 40
    DNC      -        21         BOTH    Do not make any external connections to this pin.
   SHDN    21         25         BOTH    A low on SHDN disables the charge pumps, disables all the outputs and places the device in low power
                                         shutdown. Internally pulled-high. SHDN = 1 for normal operation.
     VCC   26      31, 34        BOTH    System power supply input (4.5V to 5.5V). Both pins 31 and 34 must connect to the VCC supply.
    GND    15      15, 16        BOTH    Ground connection. QFN pins 15 and 16 must both connect to GND. This is also the potential of the
                                         QFN’s exposed metal pad (EP).
    *VCC    9     7, 14, 26      BOTH    For proper operation, connect this lead to the VCC supply. This is not a power supply lead, so no decoupling
                                         is required.
   *GND     8       6, 17        BOTH    For proper operation, connect this lead to GND. This is not a power supply lead.
    RxIN   4, 5      2, 3     1 / RS-232 RS-232 receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection. A low on RxIN forces RxOUT high; a high on RxIN
                                         forces RxOUT low.
   RxOUT  24, 25   29, 30     1 / RS-232 RS-232 receiver output.
    TxIN  22, 23   27, 28     1 / RS-232 RS-232 transmitter input. A low on TxIN drives the corresponding TxOUT high, while a high on TxIN drives
                                         the corresponding TxOUT low.
   TxOUT   6, 7      4, 5     1 / RS-232 RS-232 transmitter output with ±15kV ESD protection.
    C1+     1         37      1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.
     C1-    2         38      1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.
    C2+    28        36       1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.
     C2-   27         35      1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.
     V+     3          1      1 / RS-232 Internally generated positive RS-232 transmitter supply (+6V).
      V-    17        19      1 / RS-232 Internally generated negative RS-232 transmitter supply (-7V).
      A    12         10      2 / RS-485 RS-485 noninverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
      B    13        11       2 / RS-485 RS-485 inverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
      Y    10          8      2/ RS-485  RS-485 noninverting driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
      Z    11          9      2/ RS-485  RS-485 inverting driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
      DI   20         24      2 / RS-485 RS-485 driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high.
     RO    18         22      2 / RS-485 RS-485 receiver output: If A > B by at least -40mV, RO is high; If A < B by -200mV or more, RO is low;
                                         RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted together (i.e., full fail-safe).
 SLOW48    14         13      2 / RS-485 RS-485 data rate control. A low on SLOW485 selects the 115kbps RS-485 data rate (slew rate limited
      5                                  output transitions); a high selects the 20Mbps data rate (full speed transitions). Internally pulled-high.
  RE485    16        18       2/ RS-485  RS-485 active low receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE485 is low; RO is high impedance
                                         when RE485 is high. Internally pulled low.
  DE485    19        23       2/ RS-485  RS-485 driver output enable (DE). The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by driving DE485 high. They
                                         are high impedance when DE485 is low. Internally pulled high.
     EP      -        EP         BOTH    QFN exposed thermal pad (EPAD). Connect to GND.

NOTES:
  5. One output at a time, IOUT ≤ 100mA for ≤10 mins.
  6. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See Tech
      Brief TB379.
  7. JA is measured with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See Tech Brief TB379 for details.
  8. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.
  9. For JC, the “case temp” location is taken at the package top center.

NOTES:
10. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
11. Supply current specification is valid for loaded RS-485 (port 2) drivers when DE485 = 0V.
12. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” on page 12 for more information.
13. A, B, RxIN defaults to RS-485 mode (>15kΩ) when the device is unpowered (VCC = 0V), or in SHDN.
14. VCC ≤ 5.25V.
15. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design.
