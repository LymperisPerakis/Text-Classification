ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on
the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.

1              RO                    Receiver Output. When enabled, if A > B by 200 mV, then RO = high.
                                     If A < B by 200 mV, then RO = low.
2              RE                    Receiver Output Enable. A low level enables the receiver output, RO.
                                     A high level places it in a high impedance state.
3              DE                    Driver Output Enable. A high level enables the driver differential inputs A and B.
                                     A low level places it in a high impedance state.
4              DI                    Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high,
                                     while a logic high on DI forces A high and B low.
5              GND                   Ground.
6              A                     Noninverting Receiver Input A/Driver Output A.
