Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

Detecting Faults
Signal integrity is essential for reliable system operation.
Degraded signals could cause problems ranging from
simple errors to loss of data. The MAX14891E detects
common RS-4845/RS-422 faults. These faults include
low differential input signals, open-wire, short-circuits,            A
and input voltages that are outside normal operating
voltage ranges (below -18V and above +18V). See the                   A
Truth Tables for more information.
                                                                              NORMAL OPERATION     SHORT CIRCUIT A TO A
Detecting Small Differential Signals
Each receiver on the MAX14891E is capable of detecting
small DC and AC signals. Small DC signals can occur due
to open wires or shorts, both of which are explained in the     Figure 4. Short-Circuit Detection
Detecting Short-Circuit and Open-Circuit Faults sections.
Small differential AC signals can result from either cable
attenuation of long or inadequate cables, or due to poor
wiring. The fault comparators are high speed and will
detect low AC signal amplitudes up to 35Mbps
Detecting Short-Circuit and Open-Circuit Faults
The MAX14891E receivers detect short circuits on the
inputs. When the A and A inputs are shorted together, the
differential input voltage is 0V, generating a small-signal
input voltage fault (Figure 4).
Open-circuit detection is similar to detecting a short-circuit
condition and relies on the differential termination resistor
across the receiver inputs. When an input is open, the
termination resistor pulls the non-inverting and inverting
inputs to the same voltage, generating a fault condition.
The _FAULT output asserts when either a short-circuit or
open-circuit condition is detected.
