Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

Applications Information
Propagation-Delay Matching
The MAX3095/MAX3096 exhibit propagation delays that                                               VCC
are closely matched from one device to another, even
between devices from different production lots. This feature                          1k               MAX3095
allows multiple data lines to receive data and clock                                                   MAX3096
                                                                                                  A
signals with minimal skewing with respect to each other.
The MAX3095 receiver propagation delays are trimmed to
a predetermined value ±8ns, while the MAX3096 delays                               150Ω
are trimmed to a predetermined value ±10ns.
128 Receivers on the Bus                                                                          B
The standard RS-485 input impedance is 12kΩ (one-unit
                                                                                      1k
load). The standard RS-485 transmitter can drive 32 unit
loads. The MAX3095/MAX3096 present a 1/4-unit-load
input impedance (48kΩ), which allows up to 128 receivers
on a bus. Any combination of these RS-485 receivers with     Figure 6. External Fail-Safe Implementation
a total of 32 unit loads can be connected to the same bus.
Fail-Safe Implementation
The MAX3095/MAX3096 receiver inputs guarantee a
logic high output when the inputs are open circuit (no
termination resistor used). This occurs when the transmitter
is removed from the bus or when all transmitter outputs
are high impedance. However, when the line is terminated
and the transmitters are disabled, the differential voltage
between the A and B inputs falls below the ±200mV
RS-485 sensitivity threshold. Consequently, the outputs
become undefined. To maintain a fail-safe receiver out-
put while using a terminating resistor, input A must be
biased at least 200mV above input B. The resistor-divider
network shown in Figure 6 is recommended.
