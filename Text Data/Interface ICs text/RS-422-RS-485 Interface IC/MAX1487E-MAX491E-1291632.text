 Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
 operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
 absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

NOTES FOR ELECTRICAL/SWITCHING CHARACTERISTICS
Note 1: All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
        ground unless otherwise specified.
Note 2: All typical specifications are given for VCC = 5V and TA = +25°C.
Note 3: Supply current specification is valid for loaded transmitters when DE = 0V.
Note 4: Applies to peak current. See Typical Operating Characteristics.
                                                                                  –—–
Note 5: The MAX481E/MAX483E/MAX487E are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for
        less than 50ns, the parts are guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are
        guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See Low-Power Shutdown Mode section.
