  The transceivers are put into shutdown mode by bringing the RE high and the DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 80 ns, the parts are guaranteed not to
  enter shutdown. If the parts are in this state for 300 ns or more, the parts are guaranteed to enter shutdown.

Mnemonic     Number      Description
RO           1           Receiver Output. When enabled, if A > B by 200 mV, then RO = high. If A < B by 200 mV, then RO = low.
RE           2           Receiver Output Enable. With RE low, the receiver output (RO) is enabled. With RE high, the output goes into a
                         high impedance state. If RE is high and DE is low, the ADM3485E enters a shutdown state.
DE           3           Driver Output Enable. A high level enables the driver differential outputs A and B. A low level places it in a high
                         impedance state.
DI           4           Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high, while a logic high on DI
                         forces A high and B low.

                                                                                Receiver Input Resistance              4 kΩ min        12 kΩ min
CABLE AND DATA RATE                                                             Receiver Input Sensitivity             ±200 mV         ±200 mV
The transmission line of choice for RS-485 communications is a                  Receiver Input Voltage Range           −7 V to +7 V    −7 V to +12 V
twisted pair. Twisted-pair cable tends to cancel common-mode
noise and also causes cancellation of the magnetic fields
generated by the current flowing through each wire, thereby
reducing the effective inductance of the pair.
