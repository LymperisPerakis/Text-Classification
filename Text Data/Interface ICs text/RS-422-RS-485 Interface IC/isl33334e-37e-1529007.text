The ISL33334E, ISL33337E are two port interface ICs where
port 1 is configured as a dual (2 Tx, 2 Rx) RS-232 transceiver
                                                                          Features
and port 2 is a single RS-485/RS-422 transceiver.                         • ±15kV (HBM) ESD protected bus pins (RS-232 or RS-485)
The on-board charge pump generates RS-232 compliant ±5V                   • Operates from a single 3.3V supply

    DNC       -          21     BOTH       Do not make any external connections to this pin.
   SHDN      21         25      BOTH       A low on SHDN disables the charge pumps, disables all the outputs and places the device in low power
                                           shutdown. Internally pulled-high. SHDN = 1 for normal operation.
     VCC     26       31, 34    BOTH       System power supply input (3.15V to 3.45V). Both pins 31 and 34 must connect to the VCC supply.
    GND      15       15, 16    BOTH       Ground connection. QFN pins 15 and 16 must both connect to GND. This is also the potential of the QFN’s
                                           exposed metal pad (EP).
    *VCC      9     12, 20, 7, BOTH        For proper operation, connect this lead to the VCC supply. This is not a power supply lead, so no decoupling
                      14, 26               is required.
   *GND       8        6, 17    BOTH       For proper operation, connect this lead to GND. This is not a power supply lead.
    RxIN    4, 5        2, 3    1 / RS-232 RS-232 receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection. A low on RxIN forces RxOUT high; a high on RXIN forces
                                           RxOUT low.
   RxOUT   24, 25     29, 30    1 / RS-232 RS-232 receiver output.
    TxIN   22, 23     27, 28    1 / RS-232 RS-232 transmitter input. A low on TxIN drives the corresponding TxOUT high, while a high on TxIN drives
                                           the corresponding TxOUT low.
   TxOUT    6, 7        4, 5    1 / RS-232 RS-232 transmitter output with ±15kV ESD protection.
    C1+       1          37     1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.
     C1-      2         38      1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.
    C2+      28         36      1 / RS-232 External charge pump capacitor is connected to this lead.

     V+       3           1     1 / RS-232 Internally generated positive RS-232 transmitter supply (+5.5V).
      V-     17         19      1 / RS-232 Internally generated negative RS-232 transmitter supply (-5.5V).
      A      12         10      2 / RS-485 RS-485 noninverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
      B      13         11      2 / RS-485 RS-485 inverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.

      Z      11           9     2/ RS-485 RS-485 inverting driver output with ±15kV ESD protection.
      DI     20          24     2 / RS-485 RS-485 driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high.
     RO      18         22      2 / RS-485 RS-485 receiver output: If A > B by at least -40mV, RO is high; If A < B by -200mV or more, RO is low;
                                           RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted together (i.e., full fail-safe).
 SLOW485     14         13      2 / RS-485 RS-485 data rate control. A low on SLOW485 selects the 115kbps RS-485 data rate (slew rate limited
                                           output transitions); a high selects the 20Mbps data rate (full speed transitions). Internally pulled-high.
  RE485      16         18      2/ RS-485 RS-485 active low receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE485 is low; RO is high impedance when
                                           RE485 is high. Internally pulled low.
  DE485      19         23      2/ RS-485 RS-485 driver output enable (DE). The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by driving DE485 high. They
                                           are high impedance when DE485 is low. Internally pulled high.

NOTES:
  5. One output at a time, IOUT ≤100mA for ≤10 mins.
  6. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See Tech
      Brief TB379.
  7. JA is measured with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See Tech Brief TB379 for details.
  8. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.
  9. For JC, the “case temp” location is taken at the package top center.

NOTES:
10. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
11. Supply current specification is valid for loaded RS-485 (port 2) drivers when DE485 = 0V.
12. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves on page 12” for more information.
13. A, B, RxIN defaults to RS-485 mode (>15kΩ) when the device is unpowered (VCC = 0V), or in SHDN.
14. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design.
