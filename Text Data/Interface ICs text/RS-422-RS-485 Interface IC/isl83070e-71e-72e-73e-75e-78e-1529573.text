Pin Descriptions
   PIN                                                                    FUNCTION
    RO     Receiver output: If A - B  -50mV, RO is high; If A - B  -200mV, RO is low; RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted.
    RE     Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high. If the Rx enable function isn’t
           required, connect RE directly to GND or through a 1k to 3k resistor to GND.
    DE     Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high, and are high impedance when DE is low. If the
           Tx enable function isn’t required, connect DE to VCC through a 1k to 3k resistor.
    DI     Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. Similarly, a high on DI forces output Y high and output Z low.
   GND     Ground connection.
   A/Y     15kV HBM ESD Protected RS-485/RS-422 level, noninverting receiver input and noninverting driver output. Pin is an input if DE =
           0; pin is an output if DE = 1.
   B/Z     15kV HBM ESD Protected RS-485/RS-422 level, Inverting receiver input and inverting driver output. Pin is an input if DE = 0; pin is
           an output if DE = 1.
     A     15kV HBM ESD Protected RS-485/RS-422 level, noninverting receiver input.
     B     15kV HBM ESD Protected RS-485/RS-422 level, inverting receiver input.
     Y     15kV HBM ESD Protected RS-485/RS-422 level, noninverting driver output.
     Z     15kV HBM ESD Protected RS-485/RS-422 level, inverting driver output.
   VCC     System power supply input (3.0V to 3.6V).
    NC     No Connection.

NOTES:
 5. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
    specified.
 6. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
 7. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” for more information.
 8. When testing devices with the shutdown feature, keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
 9. When testing devices with the shutdown feature, the RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from
    entering SHDN.
10. Versions with a shutdown feature are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the parts
    are guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See
    “Low Power Shutdown Mode” on page 11.
11. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
12. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
13. Does not apply to the ISL83071E and ISL83077E.
14. tSKEW is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delays of the specified terminals of two units tested with identical test conditions (VCC,
    temperature, etc.). Only applies to the ISL83076E - 78E.
15. ISL83070E - ISL83075E only.
16. VCC 3.15V
17. Limits established by characterization and are not production tested.
18. If the Tx or Rx enable function isn’t needed, connect the enable pin to the appropriate supply (see “Pin Descriptions” table) through a 1k to 3k
    resistor.
19. Parts are 100% tested at +25°C. Full temperature limits are guaranteed by bench and tester characterization.
20. If the DE or RE input voltage exceeds the VCC voltage by more than 500mV, then current will flow into the logic pin. The current is limited by a
    340Ω resistor (so ≈13mA with VIN = 5V and VCC = 0V) so no damage will occur if VCC ≤ VIN ≤ 7V for short periods of time.
