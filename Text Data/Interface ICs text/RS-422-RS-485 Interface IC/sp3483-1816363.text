Drivers
The driver outputs of the SP3483 are differential outputs
meeting the RS-485 and RS-422 standards. The typical
voltage output swing with no load will be 0 Volts to 3.3
Volts. With worst case loading of 54Ω across the differential
                                                                             INPUTS                                OUTPUTS
outputs, the drivers can maintain greater than 1.5V voltage
levels. The drivers have an enable control line which is                 RE           DE             A-B               R

the SP3483 to withstand an infinite short circuit over the                      Table 2. Receive Function Truth Table
-7.0V to 12V common mode range without catastrophic
damage to the IC.
Receivers
The SP3483 receiver has differential inputs with an input
sensitivity as low as ±200mV. Input impedance of the
receivers is typically 15kΩ (12kΩ minimum). A wide
common mode range of -7V to 12V allows for large ground
potential differences between systems. The receiver of the
SP3483 has a tri-state enable control input RE (Pin 2). A
logic LOW on RE will enable the receiver, a logic HIGH on
RE will disable the receiver.
The receiver of the SP3483 will operate up to 250kbps. The
receiver is equipped with the fail-safe feature. Fail-safe
guarantees that the receiver output will be in a HIGH state
when the input is left unconnected (open circuit).
