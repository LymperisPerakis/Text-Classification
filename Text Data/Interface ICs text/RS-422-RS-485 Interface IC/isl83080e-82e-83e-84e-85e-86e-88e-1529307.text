NOTES:
  1. Add “-T” suffix for tape and reel. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
  2. These Intersil Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte
     tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Intersil
     Pb-free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-
     020.

           RO              Receiver output: If A - B  -50mV, RO is high; If A - B  -200mV, RO is low; RO = High if A and B are unconnected (floating)
                           or shorted.
            RE             Receiver output enable. RO is enabled when RE is low; RO is high impedance when RE is high.
            DE             Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high impedance when DE is
                           low.

NOTES:
 4. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
    and are not production tested.
 5. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless
    otherwise specified.
 6. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
 7. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 13 for more information.
 8. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
 9. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
10. Transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts are guaranteed
    not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See “Low Power
    Shutdown Mode” on page 13.
11. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
12. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
13. Does not apply to the ISL83084E.
14. Tested according to TIA/EIA-485-A, section 4.2.6 (±75V for 15µs at a 1% duty cycle).
15. Limits established by characterization and are not production tested.
