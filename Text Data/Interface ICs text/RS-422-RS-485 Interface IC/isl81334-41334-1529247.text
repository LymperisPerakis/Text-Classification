The ISL81334 and ISL41334 are two-port interface ICs in
which each port can be independently configured as a single

RS-485, RS-422 transceivers, or four RS-232 transceivers are         (2 transceivers) or RS-485, RS-422 (1 transceiver)
available.

If either port is in RS-232 mode, the onboard charge pump          • Flow-through pinouts simplify board layouts
generates RS-232 compliant ±5V Tx output levels from a
single VCC supply as low as 4.5V. Four small 0.1µF capacitors      • Pb-Free (RoHS compliant)
are required for the charge pump. The transceivers are RS-232      • Large (2.7V) differential VOUT for improved noise immunity

In RS-485 mode, the transceivers support both the RS-485           • Loopback mode facilitates board self-test functions
and RS-422 differential communication standards. The
receivers feature “full fail-safe” operation, so the Rx outputs    • User selectable RS-485 data rates (ISL41334 only)

NOTES:
  1. See TB347 for details about reel specifications.
  2. These Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte tin plate
      plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Pb-free products are
      MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020.

   GND    BOTH      Ground connection.
   LB     BOTH      Loopback mode. In the ISL81334, Loopback mode is enabled when LB is low. In the ISL41334, Loopback mode is enabled when
                    LB and RXEN are low.
   NC     BOTH      No Connection.
 ON/OFF   BOTH      If either port is in RS-232 mode, a low on ON/OFF disables the charge pumps. In either mode, a low disables all the outputs, and
                    places the device in low power shutdown. Internally pulled-high. ON = 1 for normal operation.
  RXEN1   BOTH      Active low receiver output enable. Rx is enabled when RXEN is low; Rx is high impedance when RXEN is high. Internally pulled
  RXEN2             low. (QFN only)
   SELx   BOTH      Interface mode Select input. High puts corresponding port in RS-485 mode, while a low puts it in RS-232 mode.
   VCC    BOTH      System power supply input (5V).
    VL    BOTH      Logic-Level Supply. All TTL/CMOS inputs and outputs are powered by this supply. QFN logic input pins that are externally tied high
                    in the application should use the VL supply for the high voltage level. (QFN only)
   Ax     RS-232 Receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection. A low on Ax forces RAx high; a high on Ax forces RAx low.
          RS-485 Inverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
   Bx     RS-232 Receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection. A low on Bx forces RB high; a high on Bx forces RBx low.
          RS-485 Noninverting receiver input with ±15kV ESD protection.
   DYx    RS-232 Driver input. A low on DYx forces output Yx high. Similarly, a high on DYx forces output Yx low.
          RS-485 Driver input. A low on DYx forces output Yx high and output Z low. Similarly, a high on DY forces output Yx low and output Zx high.
   DZx    RS-232 Driver input. A low on DZx forces output Zx high. Similarly, a high on DZ forces output Zx low.

    RAx    RS-232 Receiver output.
           RS-485 Receiver output: If Bx > Ax by at least -40mV, RAx is high; If Bx < Ax by -200mV or more, RAx is low; RAx = High if Ax and Bx are
                  unconnected (floating) or shorted together (i.e., full fail-safe).
    RBx    RS-232 Receiver output.

 NOTES:
 13. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
      specified.
 14. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V (RS-485 mode only).
 15. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” starting on 22 for more information.
 16. RIN defaults to RS-485 mode (>15kΩ) when the device is unpowered (VCC = 0V), or in SHDN, regardless of the state of the SELx inputs.
 17. VCC ≤ 5.25V.
 18. Parts are 100% tested at +25°C. Over-temperature limits established by characterization and are not production tested.

RS-422 is typically a point-to-point (one driver talking to one                          Protocol selection is handled through a logic pin (SELx) for

that allows only one driver and up to 10 receivers on each bus.
Because of the one driver per bus limitation, RS-422 networks                            ISL81334 and ISL41334 Advantages
use a two bus, full duplex structure for bidirectional                                   These dual protocol ICs offer many parametric improvements
communication, and the Rx inputs and Tx outputs (no tri-state                            compared to those offered on competing dual protocol
required) connect to different busses, as shown in Figure 18.                            devices. Some of the major improvements are:
Conversely, RS-485 is a true multipoint standard, which allows                           • 15kV bus pin ESD - Eases board level requirements
up to 32 devices (any combination of drivers—must be
tri-statable—and receivers) on each bus. Now bidirectional                               • 2.7V Diff VOUT - Better noise immunity and/or distance
communication takes place on a single bus, so the Rx inputs                              • Full fail-safe RS-485 Rx - Eliminates bus biasing
and Tx outputs of a port connect to the same bus lines, as
shown in Figure 17. Each port set to RS-485 /422 mode                                    • Selectable RS-485 Data Rate - Up to 20Mbps, or slew rate
includes one Rx and one Tx.                                                                limited for low EMI and fewer termination issues

RS-232 is a point-to-point, singled ended (signal voltages
referenced to GND) communication protocol targeting fairly                               • Lower Tx and Rx skews - Wider, consistent bit widths
short (<150’, 46m) and low data rate (<1Mbps) applications.
                                                                                         • Lower ICC - Maximum ICC is 2x to 4x lower than competition
Each port contains two transceivers (2 Tx and 2 Rx) in RS-232
mode.                                                                                    • Flow-through pinouts - Tx and Rx bus pins on one side/logic
