Description
The ST490A is a low power transceiver for RS-
485 and RS-422 communications. The device
contains one driver and one receiver in full duplex
configuration. The ST490A draws 5 mA (typ.) of
supply current when unloaded or fully loaded with
disabled drivers. It operates from a single 5 V
supply.
Driver is short-circuit current limited and is
protected against excessive power dissipation by
thermal shutdown circuitry that place the driver
outputs into a high-impedance state. The receiver
input has a fail-safe feature that guarantees a
logic high output if both inputs are open circuit.
