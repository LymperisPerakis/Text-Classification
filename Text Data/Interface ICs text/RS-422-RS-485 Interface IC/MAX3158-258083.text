The MAX3158 is a high CMRR RS-485/RS-422 data-com-                           ♦ ±60V Isolated Data Interface
munications interface providing ±60V isolation in a
hybrid microcircuit. A single +5V supply on the logic side                   ♦ +5V Single Supply
powers both sides of the interface, with external 100V                       ♦ Low-Cost Replacement for Opto-Isolated
capacitors transferring power from the logic side to the                       Transceivers
isolated side. Each MAX3158 contains one transmitter
and one receiver and is guaranteed to operate at data                        ♦ True Fail-Safe Receiver While Maintaining
rates up to 250kbps. Drivers are short-circuit current lim-                    EIA/TIA-485 Compliance
ited and protected against excessive power dissipation                       ♦ Pin-Selectable Full/Half-Duplex Operation
by thermal shutdown circuitry that places the driver out-
puts into a high-impedance state. The receiver input has                     ♦ Phase Controls to Correct for Twisted-Pair
a fail-safe feature that guarantees a logic-high receiver                      Reversal
output if the inputs are open, shorted, or connected to a

abled. Supply current drops to 25µA when the device is
placed in shutdown mode. The device is pin selectable                        ♦ Slew-Rate-Limited Reduced EMI
between half- and full-duplex mode and also features
an independently programmable receiver and transmit-
ter output phase through separate pins. The MAX3158                                                       Ordering Information

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

          Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referred to device
                  ground unless otherwise noted.
          Note 2: ∆VOD and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
          Note 3: Current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting.
          Note 4: The device is put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns,
                  the device is guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 700ns, the device is guaran-
                  teed to have entered shutdown.
