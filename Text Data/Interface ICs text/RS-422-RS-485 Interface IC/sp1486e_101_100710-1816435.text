SP1486E is a half duplex differential line transceiver suitable for high speed bidirectional commu-
nication on multipoint bus transmission lines. Each device contains one differential driver and one
differential receiver. Devices comply with TIA/EIA-485 and TIA/EIA-422 standards and also meet the
higher drive and tighter skew requirements of PROFIBUS applications. Lead-free and RoHS compli-
ant packages are available for all models.
PROFIBUS is in wide use in industrial control and automation applications and the SP1486E is rug-
gedized for use in harsh operating conditions. Receivers are specially designed to fail-safe to a logic
high output state if the inputs are left un-driven or shorted. All RS485 bus-pins are protected against
severe ESD events up to ±15kV (Air-Gap and Human Body Model) and up to ±8kV Contact Discharge
(IEC 1000-4-2). Drivers are protected from excess current flow caused by bus contention or output
short-circuits by both an internal current limit and a thermal-overload shutdown. Devices are rated for
Industrial (-40 to +85ºC) operating temperature. Receivers have exceptionally high input impedance,
which places only 1/8th the standard load on a shared bus. Up to 256 transceivers may coexist while
preserving full signal margin.
All devices operate from a single 5.0 V power supply and draw negligible quiescent power. Both driver
and receiver can be enabled and disabled independently and the device enters a low power shutdown
mode if both driver and receiver are disabled. The bus-pin outputs of disabled modules are in high
impedance state. The high impedance driver output is maintained over the entire common-mode volt-
age range from -7 to +12V.

Pin Name Pin Function      Pin Function
    1         RO           Receiver Output. When RE is low and if (A – B) ≥ -40mV, RO is High. If (A – B) ≤ - 200mV, RO
                           is low.
    2         RE           Receiver Output Enable. RO is enabled when RE is low. When RE is high, RO is high imped-
                           ance. Drive RE high and DE low to enter shutdown mode. RE is a hot-swap input.
    3         DE           Driver Output Enable. When DE is high, outputs are enabled. When DE is low, outputs are
                           high impedance. Drive DE low and RE high to enter shutdown mode. DE is a hot-swap input.
    4         DI           Driver Input. With DE high, a low level on DI forces non-inverting output low and inverting out-
                           put high. Similarly, a high level on DI forces non-inverting output high and inverting output low.

Notes:
1. Change in Magnitude of Differential Output Voltage and Change in Magnitude of Common Mode Output Voltage are the changes in output voltage when DI input changes state.
2. The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 50ns the device does not enter shutdown. If the enable inputs
are held in this state for at least 600ns the device is assured to be in shutdown. In this low power mode most circuitry is disabled and supply current is typically 1nA.

The standard RS485 receiver input impedance
is 12kΩ (1 unit load). A standard driver can
drive up to 32 unit loads. The SP1486E has
only a 1/8th unit load receiver input impedance
(96kΩ), thereby allowing eight times as many,
up to 256, transceivers to be connected in par-
allel on a communication line. Any combination
of these devices and other RS485 transceivers
up to a total of 32 unit loads may be connected
to the line.
