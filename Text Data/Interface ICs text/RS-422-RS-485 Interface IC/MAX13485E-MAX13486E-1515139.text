Note 1: µDFN devices production tested at +25°C. Overtemperature limits are generated by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages referred to device ground,
        unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC when the DI input changes states.
Note 4: The short-circuit output current applied to peak current just prior to foldback current limiting. The short-circuit foldback
        output current applies during current limiting to allow a recovery from bus contention.

                      transceivers for RS-485/RS-422 communication contain                    VCC
                      one driver and one receiver. These devices feature fail-
                      safe circuitry that guarantees a logic-high receiver out-                                  10μs

                      with all drivers disabled (see the Fail-Safe section). The

                      MAX13485E/MAX13486E also feature a hot-swap capa-
                      bility allowing line insertion without erroneous data
                      transfer (see the Hot-Swap Capability section). The
                      MAX13485E features reduced slew-rate drivers that
                      minimize EMI and reduce reflections caused by
                      improperly terminated cables, allowing error-free trans-

                      setting the receiver input threshold between -50mV and
