  The half-duplex device is put into shutdown mode by driving RE high and DE low. If these inputs are in this state for less than 50 ns, the device is guaranteed not to
  enter shutdown mode. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 3000 ns, the device is guaranteed to enter shutdown mode.

Pin No.   Mnemonic        Description
1         RO              Receiver Output. When RO is enabled and (A − B) ≥ −30 mV, RO is high. When RO is enabled and (A − B) ≤ −200 mV,
                          RO is low.
2         RE              Receiver Output Enable. A low level on RE enables the receiver output (RO). A high level on RE places RO into a high
                          impedance state.
3         DE              Driver Output Enable. A high level on DE enables the driver differential outputs (A and B). A low level on DE places
                          the driver differential outputs into a high impedance state.
4         DI              Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high, whereas a logic high on DI
                          forces A high and B low.
5         GND             Ground.

Pin No.   Mnemonic   Description
1         RO         Receiver Output. When RO is enabled and (A − B) ≥ −30 mV, RO is high. When RO is enabled and (A − B) ≤ −200 mV,
                     RO is low.
2         RE         Receiver Output Enable. A low level on RE enables the receiver output (RO). A high level on RE places RO into a high
                     impedance state.
3         DE         Driver Output Enable. A high level on DE enables the driver differential outputs (A and B). A low level places the
                     driver differential outputs into a high impedance state.
4         DI         Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high, whereas a logic high on DI
                     forces A high and B low.

          EPAD       Exposed Pad. The exposed paddle on the underside of the package must be soldered to the ground plane to
                     increase the reliability of the solder joints and to maximize the thermal capability of the package.
