 Note 1: V+ and V- can have maximum magnitudes of 7V, but their absolute difference cannot exceed 13V.
 Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
 operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
 absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Multiprotocol Bus Multiplexer
The Typical Application Circuit shows the MAX3161 con-
figured as a multiprotocol bus multiplexer. The MAX3161      Figure 15. Protocol Translator
separates the RS-232 and RS-485 lines, but shares the
logic pins between modes. This application allows the
µP to monitor a point-to-point RS-232 bus, and a mul-
tidrop RS-485 interface. The MAX3100 UART asynchro-
nously transfers data through the MAX3161 to the
pin-selected RS-232 or RS-485 protocol.
