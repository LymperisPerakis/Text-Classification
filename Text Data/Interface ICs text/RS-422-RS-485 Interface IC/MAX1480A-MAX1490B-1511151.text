Note 1: All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to logic-
        side ground (GND_), unless otherwise specified.
Note 2: For DE´ and DI´ pin descriptions, see Detailed Block Diagram and Typical Application Circuit (Figure 1 for MAX1480A/
        MAX1480B/MAX1480C, Figure 2 for MAX1490A/MAX1490B).
Note 3: Shutdown supply current is the current at VCC1 and VCC2 when shutdown is enabled.
Note 4: Applies to peak current (see Typical Operating Characteristics). Although the MAX1480A/B/C and MAX1490A/B provide
        electrical isolation between logic ground and signal paths, they do not provide isolation between external shields and the
        signal paths (see Isolated Common Connection section).
