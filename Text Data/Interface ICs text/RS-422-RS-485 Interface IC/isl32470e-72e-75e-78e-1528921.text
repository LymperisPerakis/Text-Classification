NOTES:
  1. See TB347 for details about reel specifications.
  2. These Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte tin plate
     plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations).Pb-free products are
     MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

NOTES:
 8. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
    specified.
 9. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
10. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” beginning on page 5 for more information.
11. Keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
12. The RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering shutdown.
13. Transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts are ensured not to enter
    shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are ensured to enter shutdown. See “Low Power Shutdown Mode” on page 17.
14. Keep RE = VCC and set the DE signal low time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
15. Set the RE signal high time >600ns to ensure that the device enters shutdown.
16. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization, and/or design.
17. Tested according to TIA/EIA-485-A, Section 4.2.6 (±80V for 15µs at a 1% duty cycle).
18. See the Caution statement in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on page 5.
