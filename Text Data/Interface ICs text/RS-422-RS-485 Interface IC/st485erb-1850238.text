                                                      Description
                                                      The ST485ERB is a low-power transceiver for
                                                      RS-485 and RS-422 communication. Each driver
                                                      output and receiver input is protected against
                                                      ±15 kV electrostatic discharge (HBM) ± 8 kV
                                                      (IEC-1000-4-2 contact discharge) shocks, without
                                                      latch-up. These parts contain one driver and one
                                                      receiver.
                                                      This transceiver draws 300 µA (typ.) of supply
                                                      current when unloaded or fully loaded with
Features                                              disabled drivers.
     Low quiescent current: 300 µA                    It operates from a single 5 V supply.
     Designed for RS-485 interface applications
     - 7 V to 12 V common mode input voltage          The driver is a short-circuit current which is
     range                                            limited and protected against excessive power
     Driver maintains high impedance in 3-state       dissipation by thermal shutdown circuitry that
     or with the power OFF                            places the driver outputs into a high-impedance
     70 mV typical input hysteresis                   state.
     30 ns propagation delay, 5 ns skew               The ST485ERB is designed for bi-directional data
     Operates from a single 5 V supply                communication on multipoint bus transmission
     Current limiting and thermal shutdown for        lines (half-duplex applications).
     driver overload protection
     ESD protection:
           ± 15 kV (HBM)
           ± 8 kV (IEC-1000-4-2 contact
           discharge)
     Allows up to 64 transceivers on the bus
