Pin Descriptions

    RO    Receiver output:
          If A - B  -50mV, RO is high.
          If A - B  -200mV, RO is low.
          If A and B are unconnected (floating) or shorted, or connected to a terminated bus that is undriven, RO is high.
    RE    Receiver output enable.
          RO is enabled when RE is low.
          RO is high impedance when RE is high.
          If the Rx enable function isn’t required, connect RE directly to GND.
    DE    Driver output enable. The driver outputs, Y and Z, are enabled by bringing DE high. They are high impedance when DE is low. If the Tx enable
          function isn’t required, connect DE to VCC through a 1k or greater resistor.
    DI    Driver input. A low on DI forces output Y low and output Z high. Similarly, a high on DI forces output Y high and output Z low.
   GND    Ground connection. This is also the potential of the DFN thermal pad.
   A/Y    ±15kV IEC61000 ESD Protected RS-485, RS-422 level, noninverting receiver input and noninverting driver output. Pin is an input (A) if DE
          = 0; pin is an output (Y) if DE = 1.
   B/Z    ±15kV IEC61000 ESD Protected RS-485, RS-422 level, inverting receiver input and inverting driver output.
          Pin is an input (B) if DE = 0.
          Pin is an output (Z) if DE = 1.
   VCC    System power supply input (4.75V to 5.25V).
    NC    No Connection.

NOTES:
 6. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
    specified.
 7. Supply current specification is valid for loaded drivers when DE = 0V.
 8. Applies to peak current. See “Typical Performance Curves” starting on page 11 for more information.
 9. Because of the shutdown feature, keep RE = 0 to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
10. Because of the shutdown feature, the RE signal high time must be short enough (typically <100ns) to prevent the device from entering SHDN.
11. These ICs are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 60ns, the parts are guaranteed not to
    enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 700ns, the parts are guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See “Low Power Shutdown
    Mode” on page 10.
12. Keep RE = VCC, and set the DE signal low time >700ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
13. Set the RE signal high time >700ns to ensure that the device enters SHDN.
14. This is the part-to-part skew between any two units tested with identical test conditions (Temperature, VCC, etc.).
15. Parts are 100% tested at +25°C. Over-temperature limits are established by characterization and are not production tested.
