GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADM485E/ADM487E/ADM1487E are 5 V, low power                                                             The driver outputs are slew rate limited to reduce EMI and data
data transceivers with ±15 kV ESD protection suitable for half-                                             errors caused by reflections from improperly terminated buses.
duplex communication on multipoint bus transmission lines.                                                  Excessive power dissipation caused by bus contention or output
They are designed for balanced data transmission and comply                                                 shorting is prevented with a thermal shutdown circuit.
with Telecommunication Industry Association/Electronics                                                     The parts are fully specified over the industrial temperature
Industries Association (TIA/EIA) standards RS-485 and RS-422.                                               ranges and are available in 8-lead SOIC packages.
The ADM487E and ADM1487E have a 1/4 unit load receiver
input impedance that allows up to 128 transceivers on a bus,
whereas the ADM485E allows up to 32 transceivers on a bus.
Because only one driver is enabled at any time, the output of a
disabled or power-down driver is three-stated to avoid overloading
the bus.

4          DI               Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces Pin A low and Pin B high; a logic high on DI

touching or plugging in an I/O cable can result in a static
discharge that can damage or completely destroy the interface

important to have high levels of ESD protection on the I/O lines.
