                  Note 1: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to device
                          ground unless otherwise noted.
                  Note 2: Guaranteed by design.
                  Note 3: DPER is defined as (VODP / VOD).
                  Note 4: ∆VODP and ∆VOC are the changes in VDD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes. This specification reflects
                          constant operating conditions. When operating conditions shift, the maximum value may be momentarily exceeded.
                  Note 5: ∆VODP and ∆VOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the DI input changes state.
                  Note 6: Maximum current level applies to peak current just prior to foldback-current limiting; minimum current level applies during
                          current limiting.
                  Note 7: Shutdown is enabled by bringing RE high and DE low. If the enable inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device is
                          guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are in this state for at least 500ns, the device is guaranteed to have
                          entered shutdown. Time to shutdown for the device (tSHDN) is measured by monitoring R0 as in Figure 4.

                  RS-485/RS-422 Transceivers with Preemphasis
                  for High-Speed, Long-Distance Communication
                                          Detailed Description
MAX3291/MAX3292
                  The MAX3291/MAX3292 high-speed RS-485/RS-422                                SIGNAL 1
                  transceivers feature driver preemphasis circuitry, which
                  extends the distance and increases the data rate of
                  reliable communication by reducing intersymbol inter-                                                           BAUD PERIOD
                  ference (ISI) caused by long cables. The MAX3291 is
                  programmable for data rates of 5Mbps to 10Mbps,                      VA - VB
                  while the MAX3292 is programmable for data rates up
                  to 10Mbps by using a single external resistor.
                  The MAX3291/MAX3292 are full-duplex devices that
                  operate from a single +5V supply and offer a low-cur-
                  rent shutdown mode that reduces supply current to
                  100nA. They feature driver output short-circuit current                                                      tISI

                  load receiver input impedance allows up to 128 trans-
                  ceivers on the bus.                                           Figure 12. Inter-Symbol Interference among Two Data
                                                                                Patterns: Signal 1 = 11111110, Signal 2 = 00000010
                  Inter-symbol interference (ISI) causes significant prob-
                  lems for UARTs if the total RS-485/RS-422 signal jitter
                  becomes 10% or more of the baud period. ISI is
                  caused by the effect of the cable’s RC time constant on
                  different bit patterns. If a series of ones is transmitted,
                  followed by a zero, the transmission-line voltage rises
                  to a high value at the end of the string of ones (signal 1
                  in Figure 12). As the signal moves towards the zero
                  state, it takes longer to reach the zero-crossing,
                  because its starting voltage is farther from the zero            VY - VZ                                                        2.5V/div
                  crossing. On the other hand, if the data pattern has a
                  string of zeros followed by a one and then another zero,
                  the one-to-zero transition starts from a voltage that is             DI                                                         5V/div
                  much closer to the zero-crossing (VA - VB = 0) and it
                  takes much less time for the signal to reach the zero-
                  crossing (signal 2 in Figure 12). In other words, the                        0    1    1    1   0    0   0          1   0   1

For example, a baud rate of 500kbps produces a baud                                     interchangeably; however, they are not exactly the
period of 2µs (2µs = 2000ns).                                                           same thing. ISI usually makes up the majority of the jit-

For data rates of 1Mbps to 10Mbps, use the following
equation to calculate RPSET:
              RPSET = 580 (tBAUD - 100)(tBAUD / 1000)
where tBAUD = one baud period in ns.
For example, a baud rate of 1Mbps produces a baud
period of 1µs (1µs = 1000ns).
    RPSET = 580 (1000 - 100)(1000 / 1000) = 522kΩ
    (closest standard value is 523kΩ)
Set the preemphasis interval by connecting the RPSET
resistor from PSET to VCC. Use a 0.1µF bypass capaci-
tor (CPSET) from PSET to VCC. If PSET is connected
directly to VCC (RPSET = 0), the preemphasis interval
reverts to the nominal 100ns value.
