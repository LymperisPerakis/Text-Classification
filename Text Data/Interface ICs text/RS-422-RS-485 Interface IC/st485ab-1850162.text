Description
The ST485A is a low power, high speed
transceiver for RS-485 and RS-422
communications. The device contains one driver
and one receiver in half duplex configuration. The
ST485A draws 3 mA (typ.) of supply current when
unloaded or fully loaded with disabled drivers. It
operates from a single 5 V supply.
Driver is short-circuit current limited and is
protected against excessive power dissipation by
thermal shutdown circuitry that place the driver
outputs into a high-impedance state. The receiver
input has a fail-safe feature that guarantees a
logic high output if both inputs are open circuit.
