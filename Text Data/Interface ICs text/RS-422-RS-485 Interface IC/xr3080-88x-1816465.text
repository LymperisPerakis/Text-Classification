NOTE:
    1.   Change in Magnitude of Differential Output Voltage and Change in Magnitude of Common Mode Output Voltage
         are the changes in output voltage when DI input changes state.
    2.   The hot swap feature disables the DE and RE inputs for the first 10µs after power is applied. Following this time
         period these inputs are weakly pulled to their disabled state (low for DE, high for RE) until the first transition, after
         which they become high impedance inputs.
    3.   The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE High and DE Low simultaneously for at least 600ns. If the
         control inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the device is guaranteed to not enter shutdown. If the enable
         inputs are held in this state for at least 600ns the device is assured to be in shutdown. Note that the receiver and
         driver enable times increase significantly when coming out of shutdown.
    4.   This spec is guaranteed by design and bench characterization.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The XR3080-88X RS-485/422 devices are part of Exar’s X Series high performance serial interface product
line. The analog bus pins can survive direct shorts up to ±18V, and are protected against ESD events up to
±15kV. The Profibus compliant differential output delivers 40% higher SNR than other RS-485/422 devices,
affording additional noise margin or extended cable lengths.
ENHANCED FAILSAFE
Ordinary RS-485 differential receivers will be in an indeterminate state whenever the data bus is not being
actively driven. The enhanced failsafe feature of the XR3080-88X family guarantees a logic-high receiver
output when the receiver inputs are open, shorted, or when they are connected to a terminated transmission
line with all drivers disabled. In a terminated bus with all transmitters disabled, the receivers’ differential input
voltage is pulled to 0V by the termination. The XR3080-88X family interprets 0V differential as a logic high with
a minimum 50mV noise margin while maintaining compliance with the EIA/TIA-485 standard of ±200mV.
Although the XR3080-88X family does not need failsafe biasing resistors, it can operate without issue if biasing
is used.
RECEIVER INPUT FILTERING
XR3080-85X receivers incorporate internal filtering in addition to input hysteresis. This filtering enhances noise
immunity by ignoring signals that do not meet a minimum pulse width of 30ns. Receiver propagation delay
increases slightly due to this filtering. The high speed XR3086X, XR3087X and XR3088X devices do not have
this input filtering.
HOT-SWAP CAPABILITY
When VCC is first applied the XR3080-88X family holds the driver enable and receiver enable inactive for
approximately 10 microseconds. During power ramp-up other system ICs may drive unpredictable values, or
tristated lines may be influenced by stray capacitance. The hot-swap feature prevents the XR3080-88X family
from driving any output signal until power has stabilized. After the initial 10µs, the driver and receiver enable
pins are weakly pulled to their disabled states (low for DE, high for RE) until the first transition. After the first
transition, the DE and RE pins operate as high impedance inputs.
If circuit boards are inserted into an energized backplane (commonly called "live insertion" or "hot-swap")
power may suddenly be applied to all circuits. Without the hot-swap capability, this situation could improperly
enable the transceiver’s driver or receiver, driving invalid data onto shared busses and possibly causing driver
contention or device damage.
DRIVER OUTPUT PROTECTION
Two mechanisms prevent excessive output current and power dissipation caused by faults or by bus
contention. First, a driver current limit on the output stage provides immediate protection against short circuits
over the whole common-mode voltage range. Second, a thermal-shutdown circuit forces the driver outputs into
a high-impedance state if junction temperature becomes excessive.
LINE LENGTH
The RS-485/RS-422 standard covers line lengths up to 4000ft. Maximum achievable line length is a function of
signal attenuation and noise. Termination prevents signal reflections by eliminating the impedance mismatches
on a transmission line. Line termination is generally used if rise and fall times are shorter than the round-trip
signal propagation time. Higher output drivers may allow longer cables to be used.

±15kV ESD PROTECTION
ESD protection structures are incorporated on all pins to protect against electrostatic discharges encountered
during handling and assembly. The driver outputs and receiver inputs of the XR3080-88X family have extra
protection against static electricity. Exar uses state of the art structures to protect these pins against ESD of
±15kV without damage. The ESD structures withstand high ESD in all states: normal operation, shutdown and
powered down. After an ESD event, the XR3080-88X keep operating without latch-up or damage.
ESD protection can be tested in various ways. The transmitter outputs and receiver inputs of the XR3080-88X
are characterized for protection to the following limits:
         ±15kV using the Human Body Model
         ± 8kV using the Contact Discharge Model
         ±15kV Air-gap Discharge Model
ESD TEST CONDITIONS
ESD performance depends on a variety of conditions. Contact Exar for a reliability report that documents test
setup, methodology and results.
IEC 61000-4-2
The IEC 61000-4-2 standard covers ESD testing and performance of finished equipment. However, it does not
specifically refer to integrated circuits. The XR3080-88X family helps you design equipment to meet
IEC 61000-4-2, without sacrificing board-space and cost for external ESD-protection components.
The major differences between tests done using the Human body model and IEC 61000-4-2 is a higher peak
current in IEC 61000-4-2. Series resistance is lower in the IEC 61000-4-2 model. Hence, the ESD withstand
voltage measured to IEC 61000-4-2 is generally lower than that of human body model.
The air-gap test involves approaching the device with a charged probe. The contact discharge method
connects the probe to the device before the probe is energized.
256 TRANSCEIVERS ON THE BUS
The standard RS-485 receiver input impedance is 12k Ohms (1 unit load). A standard driver can drive up to 32
unit loads. The XR3080-88X family of transceivers have a 1/8th unit load receiver input impedance of 96k,
allowing up to 256 transceivers to be connected in parallel on a communication line. Any combination of these
devices and other RS-485 transceivers up to a total of 32 unit loads may be connected to the line.
LOW POWER SHUTDOWN MODE
Low-power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing both RE high and DE low simultaneously. While in shutdown
devices draw less than 1µA of supply current. DE and RE may be tied together and driven by a single control
signal. Devices are guaranteed not to enter shutdown if RE is high and DE is low for less than 50ns. If the
inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts will enter shutdown.
Enable times tZH and tZL apply when the part is not in low-power shutdown state. Enable times tZH(SHDN) and
tZL(SHDN) apply when the parts are shutdown. The drivers and receivers take longer to become enabled from
low-power shutdown tZH(SHDN) and tZL(SHDN) than from driver / receiver disable mode (tZH and tZL).
