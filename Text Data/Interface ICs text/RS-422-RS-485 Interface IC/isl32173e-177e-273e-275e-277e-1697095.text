NOTES:
 1. See TB347 for details about reel specifications.
 2. These Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte tin plate
     plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Pb-free products are
     MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.
 3. For Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL), see ISL32173E, ISL32177E, ISL32273E, ISL32275E, ISL32277E device pages. For more information about MSL

                                                   the states of EN and EN. If the individual channel enable function is not
                                                   required, connect ENX to VCC (or VL) through a 1kΩ or greater resistor
                                                   (ISL32x77E only).
         -            -            9      SHDNEN   Low power Shutdown mode enable that is internally pulled high to VCC. A high
                                                   level allows the ISL32x77E to enter a low power mode when all channels are
                                                   disabled. A low level prevents the device from entering the low power mode
                                                   (ISL32x77E only).

         -            -           21         VL    Logic power supply input (1.4V to VCC) that powers all the TTL/CMOS inputs
                                                   and outputs (logic pins). VL sets the VIH and VIL levels of the enable and
                                                   SHDNEN pins and sets the VOH level of the RO pins. Connect the VL pin to the
                                                   lower voltage power supply of a logic device (such as UART or µcontroller)

                                                   power up this supply after VCC and keep VL ≤ VCC. To minimize input current
                                                   and shutdown supply current, logic pins that are strapped high externally
                                                   (preferably through a 1kΩ resistor) should connect to VCC, but they can also
                                                   connect to VL (ISL32x77E only).

NOTES:
10. All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to device ground unless otherwise
     specified.
11. Channel-to-channel skew is the magnitude of the worst case delta between any two propagation delays of any two outputs on the same IC, at the same
     test conditions.
12. tSKP-P is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delays of the specified terminals of two units tested with identical test conditions (VCC,
     temperature, etc.).
13. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
     and are not production tested.
14. EN = 0 indicates that the output(s) under test are disabled via the appropriate logic pin settings. EN = 1 indicates that the logic pins are set to enable
     the output(s) under test.
15. Keep SHDNEN low to avoid entering SHDN (ISL32177E and ISL32277E only). Ensure that at least one channel remains enabled to prevent shutdown
     (ISL32275E only).
16. Keep SHDNEN high to enter shutdown when all drivers are disabled (ISL32177E and ISL32277E only).
17. Logic pins are the enable variants and SHDNEN.
18. EN low and EN high on the ISL32x73E. SHDNEN, EN, EN1-EN4 all high and EN low on the ISL32x77E.
19. EN12 and EN34 low on ISL32275E. SHDNEN high, with EN1-EN4 low plus EN and EN high on the ISL32x77E.
20. Shutdown is entered by simultaneously disabling all four outputs for at least 600ns.
21. Does not apply to the ISL32173E nor the ISL32273E; only the EN from shutdown parameters apply to these two parts.

(IL) is typically less than 1µA for enable input voltages at ground

resistors connect to VCC, so the current due to a low enable input
adds to ICC rather than to IL.
