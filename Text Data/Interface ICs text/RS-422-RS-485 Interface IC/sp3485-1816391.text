NOTES:
1. The transceivers are put into shutdown by gringing RE high and DE low simultaneously for at least 600ns. If the control inputs are in this state for less than 50ns, the
   device is guaranteed to not enter shutdown. If the enable inputs are held in this state for at least 600ns, the device is assured to be in shutdown. Note that the receiver
   and driver times increase significantly when coming out of shutdown.
2. This spec is guaranteed by design and bench characterization.

The SP3485 receiver has differential inputs with an input
sensitivity of ±200mV. Input impedance of the receiver
is 12kΩ minimum. A wide common mode range of -7V to                                      INPUTS                          OUTPUTS
