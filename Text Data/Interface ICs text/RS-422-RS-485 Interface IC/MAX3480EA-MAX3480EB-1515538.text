                                                                                                                                          MAX3480EA/MAX3480EB
The MAX3480EA/MAX3480EB are electrically isolated                   ♦ Isolated Data Interface Guaranteed to 1260VRMS
RS-485/RS-422 data-communications interfaces. The                     (1min)
RS-485/RS-422 I/O pins are protected against ±15kV
electrostatic discharge (ESD) shocks, without latchup.              ♦ ±15kV ESD Protection for I/O Pins
Transceivers, optocouplers, and a transformer are all               ♦ Slew-Rate-Limited Data Transmission (160kbps for

                                                                      MAX3480EB)
gle +3.3V supply on the logic side powers both sides
of the interface.                                                   ♦ High-Speed, Isolated, 2.5Mbps RS-485 Interface
The MAX3480EB features reduced-slew-rate drivers                      (MAX3480EA)
that minimize EMI and reduce reflections caused by                  ♦ Single +3.3V Supply
improperly terminated cables, allowing error-free data
transmission at data rates up to 160kbps. The                       ♦ Current Limiting and Thermal Shutdown for
MAX3480EA’s driver slew rate is not limited, allowing                 Driver Overload Protection
transmission rates up to 2.5Mbps.                                   ♦ Standard 28-Pin PDIP Package
Drivers are short-circuit current limited and are protect-
                                                                    ♦ Allows Up to 128 Transceivers on the Bus
ed against excessive power dissipation by thermal
shutdown circuitry that places the driver outputs into a
high-impedance state. The receiver input has a fail-safe
feature that guarantees a logic-high output if the input
is open circuit.
The MAX3480EA/MAX3480EB are guaranteed to with-
stand 1260VRMS (1min) or 1520VRMS (1s). Their isolated                                                 Pin Configuration
inputs and outputs meet RS-485/RS-422 specifications.

                      Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                      operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                      absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

                      Note 1: All currents into device pins are positive; all currents out of device pins are negative. All voltages are referenced to
                              logic-side ground (GND1, GND2), unless otherwise specified.
                      Note 2: For DE´ and DI´ pin descriptions, see the Block Diagram and the Typical Application Circuit (Figure 1 for
                              MAX3480EA/MAX3480EB).
                      Note 3: Shutdown supply current is the current at VCC1 when shutdown is enabled.
                      Note 4: Limit guaranteed by applying 1520VRMS for 1s. Test voltage is applied between all pins on one side of the package to all
                              pins on the other side of the package. For example, between pins 1 and 14, and 15 and 28.
