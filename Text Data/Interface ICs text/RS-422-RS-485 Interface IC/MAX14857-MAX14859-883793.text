Note 2: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
           respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: VLDO max indicates voltage capability of the circuit. Power dissipation requirements may limit VLDO max to a lower value.
Note 5: ΔVOD and ΔVOC are the changes in VOD and VOC, respectively, when the TXD input changes state.
Note 6: The short-circuit output current applies to the peak current just prior to current limiting.
Note 7: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 8: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output states. CMTI
           applies to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between
           GNDA and GNDB. ΔVCM = 1kV.
Note 9: Capacitive load includes test probe and fixture capacitance.
Note 10: VIORM, VIOWM, and VISO are defined by the IEC 60747-5-5 standard.
Note 11: Product is qualified VISO for 60 seconds. 100% production tested at 120% of VISO for 1s.

                                 Driver Input. With DE high, a low on TXD forces the noninverting output (Y) low and the
     8         TXD       GNDA    inverting output (Z) high. Similarly, a high on TXD forces the noninverting output high and
                                 the inverting output low. TXD has an internal 4.5µA pullup to VDDA.

    10        VLDO       GNDB
                                 possible to the device. To disable the internal LDO, leave VLDO unconnected or connect to

                                 Cable-Side Power Input/Isolated LDO Power Output. Bypass VDDB to GNDB with both
                                 0.1μF and 1μF capacitors as close as possible to the device. VDDB is the output of the
    16        VDDB       GNDB    internal LDO when power is applied to VLDO. When the internal LDO is not used (VLDO is
                                 unconnected or connected to GNDB), VDDB is the positive supply input for the cable-side
                                 of the IC.
