The MAX1482 and MAX1483 are low-power trans-                               ♦ Low 20µA Operating Current
ceivers for RS-485 and RS-422 communication. Both
feature slew-rate-limited drivers that minimize EMI and                    ♦ Slew-Rate Limited for Reduced EMI and

Note 3: The MAX1482/MAX1483 are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less
        than 50ns, the parts are guaranteed not to enter shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 600ns, the parts are
        guaranteed to have entered shutdown. See Low-Power Shutdown Mode section.

                                            Receiver Output. With the receiver output enabled (RE low), RO is high if
    2         1            3        RO      A > B by 200mV or when A and B are not connected, and RO is low if A < B

                                            Receiver Output Enable. When RE is low, RO is enabled. When RE is high, RO
    3         2            4        RE      is high impedance. If RE is high and DE is low, the MAX1482/MAX1483 enter
                                            a low-power (0.1µA) shutdown state.

                                            are enabled by bringing DE high. When DE is low, the driver outputs are high
    4         3            5        DE      impedance, and the devices can function as line receivers if RE is low. If RE is
                                            high and DE is low, the parts will enter a low-power (0.1µA) shutdown state. If
                                            the driver outputs are enabled, the devices function as line drivers.
