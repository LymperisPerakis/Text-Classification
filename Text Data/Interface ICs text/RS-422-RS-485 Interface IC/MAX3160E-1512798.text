RS-232 Transceivers
The MAX3160E/MAX3161E/MAX3162E RS-232 trans-
mitters are inverting-level translators that convert
CMOS-logic levels to ±5V EIA/TIA-232-compliant lev-
els. The transmitters are guaranteed at a 250kbps data
rate in slew-rate limited mode (FAST = GND) with
worst-case loads of 3kΩ in parallel with 1000pF. Data
rates up to 1Mbps can be achieved by asserting FAST.
When powered down or in shutdown, the MAX3160E/
MAX3161E/MAX3162E outputs are high impedance
and can be driven to ±13.2V. The transmitter inputs do
not have pullup resistors. Connect unused inputs to
ground or VCC.
