  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common-mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

TYPICAL APPLICATIONS
The ADM2490E transceiver is designed for point-to-point transmission lines. Figure 26 shows a full-duplex point-to-point application.
To minimize reflections, terminate the line at the receiver end with a termination resistor. The value of the termination resistor should be
equal to the characteristic impedance of the cable.
