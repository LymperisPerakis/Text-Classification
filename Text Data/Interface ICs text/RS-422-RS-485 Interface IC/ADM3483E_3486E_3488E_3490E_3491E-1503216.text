ADM3490E/ADM3491E transceivers have dedicated
differential line driver outputs and receiver inputs. The
ADM3491E also features separate enable inputs for the
driver and receiver.
The devices have a 12 kΩ receiver input impedance,
which allows up to 32 transceivers on a bus. Because only
one driver should be enabled at any time, the output of a
disabled or powered-down driver is tristated to avoid
overloading the bus.

  The transceivers are put into shutdown mode by bringing the RE high and the DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 80 ns, the parts are guaranteed not to
  enter shutdown. If the parts are in this state for 300 ns or more, the parts are guaranteed to enter shutdown.

HUMAN BODY MODEL
Figure 30 shows the human body model and the current wave-
form it generates when discharged into a low impedance. This
model consists of a 100 pF capacitor charged to the ESD voltage

through a 1.5 kΩ resistor.
