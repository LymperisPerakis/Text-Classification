The SP481E and SP485E receivers have differential inputs
with an input sensitivity as low as ±200mV. Input impedance                      Table 2: Receive Function Truth Table
of the receivers is typically 15kΩ (12kΩ minimum). A wide
common mode range of -7V to +12V allows for large ground
potential differences between systems. The receivers of
the SP481E and SP485E have a tri-state enable control
pin. A logic LOW on RE (pin 2) will enable the receiver, a
logic HIGH on RE (pin 2) will disable the receiver.
The receiver for the SP481E and SP485E will operate up to
at least 10Mbps. The receiver for each of the two devices
is equipped with the fail-safe feature. Fail-safe guarantees
that the receiver output will be in a HIGH state when the
input is left unconnected.
