  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common-mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a
stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these
or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond
the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may
affect product reliability.

2         VCC           Logic Side Power Supply. It is recommended that a 0.1 µF and a 0.01 µF decoupling capacitor be fitted between
                        Pin 2 and Pin 1.
3         RxD           Receiver Output Data. This output is high when (A − B) ≥ −30 mV and low when (A − B) ≤ –200 mV. The output is
                        tristated when the receiver is disabled, that is, when RE is driven high.
4         RE            Receiver Enable Input. This is an active-low input. Driving this input low enables the receiver, while driving it high
                        disables the receiver.
5         DE            Driver Enable Input. Driving this input high enables the driver, while driving it low disables the driver.
6         TxD           Driver Input. Data to be transmitted by the driver is applied to this input.
7         VCC           Logic Side Power Supply. It is recommended that a 0.1 µF and a 10 µF decoupling capacitor be fitted between
                        Pin 7 and Pin 8.
8         GND1          Ground, Logic Side.
9         GND2          Ground, Bus Side.
10        VISOOUT       Isolated Power Supply Output. This pin must be connected externally to VISOIN. It is recommended that a reservoir
                        capacitor of 10 µF and a decoupling capacitor of 0.1 µF be fitted between Pin 10 and Pin 9.

12        Z             Driver Inverting Output
13        B             Receiver Inverting Input.

15        VISOIN        Isolated Power Supply Input. This pin must be connected externally to VISOOUT. It is recommended that a 0.1 µF
                        and a 0.01 µF decoupling capacitor be fitted between Pin 15 and Pin 16.
