  The transceivers are put into shutdown by bringing RE high and DE low. If the inputs are in this state for less than 80 ns, the parts are guaranteed not to enter
  shutdown. If the inputs are in this state for at least 300 ns, the parts are guaranteed to enter shutdown.

ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on
the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.

1                    RO                Receiver Output. When enabled, if A > B by 200 mV, then RO = high.
                                       If A < B by 200 mV, then RO = low.
2                    RE                Receiver Output Enable. A low level enables the receiver output, RO. A high level
                                       places it in a high impedance state. If RE is high and DE is low, the device enters a low
                                       power shutdown mode.
3                    DE                Driver Output Enable. A high level enables the driver differential Outputs A and B.
                                       A low level places it in a high impedance state. If RE is high and DE is low, the device
                                       enters a low power shutdown mode.
4                    DI                Driver Input. When the driver is enabled, a logic low on DI forces A low and B high
                                       while a logic high on DI forces A high and B low.

CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION
The ADM3493 is a low power transceiver for RS-485 and                                          LOW POWER SHUTDOWN MODE
RS-422 communications. The ADM3493 can transmit and                                            A low power shutdown mode is initiated by bringing both RE
receive at data rates up to 250 kbps in a half duplex                                          high and DE low. The ADM3493 does not shut down unless
configuration. Driver Enable (DE) and Receiver Enable (RE)                                     both the driver and receiver are disabled (high impedance). In
pins are included when disabled; the driver and receiver                                       shutdown, the ADM3493 typically draws only 2 nA of supply
