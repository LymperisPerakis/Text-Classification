Notes:
1
  Power rating reduced to half when using only two pairs for power as in
  802.3af/802.3at applications.                                                                       Circuit A
2
  The IEEE802.3bt standard has not been offically ratified.
3
  Can be used in -40 to +85°C for non-PoE applications.
