Notes:
A. A center-tapped winding can be created by connecting two ends of a split center winding together on the printed circuit board. In ISDN-S applications, the primary winding is the line
    side transforme winding.
B. Minimum primary inductance and maximum distributed capacitance satisfy the transmitter output and receiver input impedance requiremens of CCITT I.430 for both the TE and the NT.
   The maximum distributed capacitance allows sufficient margin for the capacitance of the IC and a protection diode network. It is consistent with the overall maximum value specified
   and the permitted length of the basic access TE cord.
C. The maximum specified unbalanced DC current capability is based on 20 mH minimum primary OCL.
