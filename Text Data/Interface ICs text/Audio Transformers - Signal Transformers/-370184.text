T3/DS3/E3/STS-1 TRANSFORMERS
Dual SMT, Extended Temperature Range
Application Notes
1. The transformers have been developed for use as                                                            4. Optional Tape & Reel packaging can be ordered by 		
    transmit and receive transformers in T3 or DS3 links, using                                                    adding a “T” suffix to the part number (i.e. T323NLT).
    bit rates of 44.736Mbps and B3ZS coding on coaxial cable.
    The characteristics allow compliance with the Pulse                                                       5. For other T3/DS3/E3/STS-1 Transformers, please see
    templates of CCITT G.703 as well as ATT.A.34. The                                                              data sheets T606, T672, T663 and T668.
    transformers are also suitable for E3 interface at 		
    34.368Mbps with HDB3 coding or STS-1 applications, at                                                     6. Transformer Selection Guide - Please contact Pulse

                                                                                                                   Sheet Menu to find the latest Transformer Selection
2. Bandwidth specifications are typical in a 75 system. 		                                                         Guide.
     Return loss meets the requirements of G.703. Materials
     used in the products are UL94-V0 recognized. Products
     meet the requirements of IEC 695-2-2 (Needle Flame
     Test).
3. For those applications requiring a 1:1 turns ratio on
     the transmit side, use only half of the secondary (2CT)
     winding.
