NOTES:
1. Receive and transmit sides meet IEEE 8023i-1993 specification, transmit side is enhanced for FCC/VDE class B system emissions requirement.
2. Specifications reflect filter sections, additional attenuation is due to pre-distortion resistors.
3. A RoHS compliant version part is available. (10B-2001NL)
