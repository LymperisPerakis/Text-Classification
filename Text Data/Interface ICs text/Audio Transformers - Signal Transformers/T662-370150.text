Notes:
1. Extended Temperature Range Models - For extended temperature range transformers (-40ãC to +85ãC operating temperature range), OCL (Open Circuit Inductance) is specified at both
   -40ãC and +25ãC. At -40ãC, OCL is 600 ȝH minimum. All other parameters are specified at +25ãC only.
2. Turns ratio is specified primary: secondary (CT = Center Tap).
3. Standard packaging for the surface mount package is anti-static tubes. Optional Tape & Reel can be ordered by adding a “T” suffix to the part number, (i.e T1176NLT).

4. Crosstalk Attenuation - In the packages which contain                                                                    Interface (PRI) applications. They are matched
     transmit and receive transformers side by side, sufficient                                                             to the majority of the line interface transceiver
     crosstalk attenuation is achieved by the inherent charact                                                              ICs currently available. Use of the proper trans
     -eristics of the toroid cores as well as by their proper pos                                                           -former allows the interface circuit to comply
     -itioning. The crosstalk attenuation is typically 65 dB or                                                             with ITU-T G.703 and other standards regarding

5. Return Loss - ITU-T G703 and the European national
     regulatory documents specify minimum return loss
     levels. The transformers will allow these limits to be
     complied within the situations where they are applicable.
