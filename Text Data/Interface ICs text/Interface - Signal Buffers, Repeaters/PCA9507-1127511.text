                 Rev. 01 — 7 February 2008                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9507 is a 2-wire serial bus extender providing 3.3 V to 5 V level shift that allows
             up to 18 meters bus extension for reliable DDC, I2C-bus or SMBus applications. While
             retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system during the level
             shifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for both
             the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) line as well as the rise time accelerator on port A
             enabling the bus to drive a load up to 1400 pF or distance of 18 m on port A, and 400 pF
             on port B. Using the PCA9507 enables the system designer to isolate bus capacitance to
             meet HDMI DDC version 1.3 distance specification. The SDA and SCL pins are
             overvoltage tolerant and are high-impedance when the PCA9507 is unpowered.
             The port B drivers with static level offset behave much like the drivers on the PCA9515
             device, while the port A drivers integrate the rise time accelerator, sink more current and
             eliminate the static offset voltage. This results in a LOW on port B translating into a nearly
             0 V LOW on port A. The static level offset design of the port B I/O drivers prevent them
             from being connected to another device that has rise time accelerator including the
             PCA9510, PCA9511, PCA9512, PCA9513, PCA9514, PCA9515, PCA9516A, PCA9517
             (B-side), or PCA9518. The port A sides of two or more PCA9507s can be connected
             together, however, to allow a star topography with port A on the common bus, and port A
             can be connected directly to any other buffer with static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple
             PCA9507s can be connected in series, port A to port B, with no build-up in offset voltage
             with only time of flight delays to consider. Rise time accelerator on port A is turned on
             when input threshold is above 0.3VCC(A).
             The PCA9507 drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) and VCC(B) are above 2.7 V. The EN
             pin can also be used to turn the drivers on and off under system control. Caution should
             be observed to only change the state of the enable pin when the bus is idle. The output
             pull-down on the port B internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.5 V, while the input
             threshold of the internal buffer is set about 70 mV lower (0.43 V). When the port B I/O is
             driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input. This prevents a
             lock-up condition from occurring.

6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9507”.
                       The PCA9507 consists of a pair of bidirectional open-drain I/Os specifically designed to
                       support up-translation/down-translation between low voltages (as low as 2.7 V) and a
                       3.3 V or 5 V I2C-bus and SMBus. The device contains a rise time accelerator on port A
                       that enables the device to drive a long cable or a heavier capacitive load for DDC, I2C-bus
                       and SMBus applications. With dual supply rails, the device translates from voltage ranges
                       2.7 V to 5.5 V down to a voltage as low as 2.7 V without degradation of system
                       performance. All I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is
                       un-powered (VCC(B) and/or VCC(A) = 0 V).
                       The PCA9507 includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until
                       VCC(A) and VCC(B) rise above 2.7 V. VCC(A) and VCC(B) can be applied in any sequence at
                       power-up.

                         Fig 4.   Port A and port B I/O levels
                       When port B falls first and goes below 0.3VCC(B) the port A driver is turned on and port A
                       pulls down to 0 V. As port A falls below 0.3VCC(A) the port B pull-down pulls port B down to
                       about 0.5 V. Port B falls below 0.4 V because it is not possible to know who is driving the
                       port A LOW, so the PCA9507 direction control assumes that port A is controlling the part
                       unless port B falls below 0.4 V. When the port B voltage is ≤ 0.4 V the port A driver of the
                       PCA9507 is on and holds port A down nearly 0 V. As the port B voltage rises because the
                       external driver turns off, the port B voltage rises up to ~0.5 V because port A is LOW;
                       once port B rises to ~0.5 V the port A pull-down driver turns off. Then port A rises with a
                       rise time determined by the RC of port A when it crosses the port A threshold ~0.3VCC(A)
                       the port B driver is turned off and the rising edge accelerator is turned on, which causes a
                       faster rising edge until it reaches the turn-off point for the rising edge accelerator
                       ~0.7VCC(A). Then it continues to rise at the slower rate determined by the RC of port A.
                       When the port B driver turns off, port B rises with the RC of port B.
                       VCC(A) powers the port A I/Os and the 0.3VCC(A) reference for port A as well as the port A
                       power good detect circuit. VCC(B) powers the rest of the chip including the port B I/Os and
                       the support functions. Figure 4 illustrates the threshold and I/O levels for port A and
                       port B.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with an internal ~100 kΩ pull-up to VCC(B) and allows the user
                       to select when the buffer is active. This can be used to isolate the line when the HDMI
                       DDC transmitter or receiver is not ready, or from a badly behaved slave on power-up until
                       after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation
                       because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus and enabling part way through
                       a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled. The enable pin should only
                       change state when the global bus and the buffer port are in an idle state to prevent system
                       failures.
                   6.2 Rise time accelerators
                       PCA9507 has rise time accelerators on port A only. During port A positive bus transitions
                       a current source is switched on to quickly slew the SDAA and SCLA lines HIGH once the
                       input level of 0.3VCC(A) is exceeded for the PCA9507 and turns off as the 0.7VCC(A)
                       voltage is approached.

                   6.3 Resistor pull-up value selection
                6.3.1 Port A (SDAA and SCLA)
                       SDAA and SCLA are open-drain I/O that have rise time accelerators and strong pull-down.
                       When the inputs transition above 0.3VCC(A), the rise time accelerator activates and boosts
                       the pull-up current during rising edge to meet the I2C-bus rise time specification when the
                       device drives a long cable or heavier capacitance load. The strong pull-down enables the
                       output to drive to nearly zero voltage for logic LOW. The selection for pull-up resistors are
                       defined in the HDMI DDC specification shown in Table 3. For HDMI transmitter
                       applications like digital video player, recorder, or set-top box, the pull-up resistor is in the
                       range of 1.5 kΩ to 2 kΩ. For HDMI receiver applications like in LCD TV or video card, the
                       pull-up resistor is 47 kΩ on the SCLA line, and there is no pull-up on the SDAA line.
                       Please refer to Table 3, Figure 7 and Figure 8 for more details. Figure 5 shows the port A
                       pull-up resistor values (in kΩ) versus capacitance load (in nF) for 5 V supply voltage
                       complied with 1 µs rise time per I2C-bus Standard-mode specification. The graph
                       contrasts a shaded and unshaded region. Any resistor value chosen within the unshaded
                       region would comply with 1 µs rise time, while any value chosen in the shaded region
                       would not.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                               PCA9507
                                                                       2-wire serial bus extender for HDMI DDC I2C-bus and SMBus
                6.3.2 Port B (SDAB and SCLB)
                      SDAB and SCLB are standard I2C-bus with static level offset that has no rise time
                      accelerator. The static level offset produces an output LOW of 0.5 V (typical) at 6 mA. As
                      with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic HIGH
                      levels. The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system requirement, and should
                      meet the current sinking capability of the device that drives the buffer, as well as that of
                      the buffer. The minimum and maximum pull-up resistors are determined and the pull-up
                      resistor’s value is chosen to be within the minimum and maximum range.
                      Using Equation 1, calculate the minimum pull-up resistor value:
                                      V CC ( B ) ( max ) – 0.4 V
                      R PU ( min ) = ------------------------------------------------
                                                                                    -                                                            (1)
                                                   I OL ( max )
                      Where:
                         RPU(min) is the minimum pull-up resistor value for the open-drain SCLB and SDAB.
                         VCC(B)(max) is the maximum supply rail of the pull-up resistor.
                         0.4 V is the maximum VOL of the device that drives the buffer on logic LOW.
                         IOL(max) at VOL = 0.4 V is the maximum sink current of the device that drives the buffer
                         on logic LOW.
                      The maximum pull-up resistor should also be sized such that the RC time constant meets
                      the standard I2C-bus rise time, which is 1 µs for Standard-mode (100 kHz) or 300 ns for
                      Fast-mode (400 kHz). DDC bus complies with the I2C-bus Standard-mode and operates
                      below 100 kHz, and maximum rise time is 1 µs using a simplified RC equation.
                      Using Equation 2, calculate the maximum pull-up resistor value:
                       R PU ( max ) × C L ( max ) = 1.2 × t r                                                                                    (2)
                      Where:
                         RPU(max) is the maximum allowable pull-up resistor on the SCLB and SDAB in order to
                         meet the I2C-bus rise time specification.
                         CL(max) is the maximum allowable capacitance load (include the capacitance of driver,
                         the line, and the buffer) in order to meet the rise time specification.
                         tr is the rise time specified as 1 µs (for bus speed 100 kHz or lower) and 300 ns (for bus
                         speed 400 kHz or lower).
                      The chosen pull-up resistor RPU is: RPU(min) ≤ RPU ≤ RPU(max).

7. Application design-in information
                               A typical application is shown in Figure 6. In this example, the system master is running
                               on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 5 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz.
                               Master devices can be placed on either bus. HDMI DDC applications for DVD/R and
                               LCD TV are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively. In these applications the HDMI
                               transmitter or receiver is 3.3 V, while the DDC line is 5 V, PCA9507 behaves like a voltage
                               level shift, a buffer and long cable bus extender to ensure signal integrity for accessing the
                               EDID on the DDC line.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                            PCA9507
                                              2-wire serial bus extender for HDMI DDC I2C-bus and SMBus
                   According to Figure 6, when port A of the PCA9507 is pulled LOW by a driver on the
                   I2C-bus, a comparator detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(A) and causes
                   the internal driver on port B to turn on, causing port B to pull down to about 0.5 V. When
                   port B of the PCA9507 falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge
                   and causes the internal driver on port A to turn on and pull the port A pin down to ground.
                   In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 11 and
                   Figure 12.
                   If the bus master in Figure 6 were to write to the slave through the PCA9507, waveforms
                   shown in Figure 11 would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus
                   transmission except that the HIGH level may be as low as 2.7 V, and the turn on and turn
                   off of the acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
                   The master drives the B bus to ground or lets it float to VCC(B) as it sends data to the slave
                   at the falling edge of the 8th clock, master releases SDAB on the B bus and slave pulls
                   SDAA on the A bus to ground, causing the PCA9507 to pull SDAB on the B bus to 0.5 V.
                   At the falling edge of the 9th clock, the master again drives the B bus and slave releases
                   the A bus.
                   Multiple PCA9507 port A sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 9),
                   allowing all nodes to communicate with each other.
                   Multiple PCA9507s can be connected in series (Figure 10) as long as port A is connected
                   to port B. I2C-bus slave devices can be connected to any of the bus segments. The
                   number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
                   delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.

[1]   Times are specified with loads of 1.35 kΩ pull-up resistance and 57 pF load capacitance on port B, and 450 Ω pull-up resistance and
      57 pF load capacitance on port A. Different load resistance and capacitance will alter the RC time constant, thereby changing the
      propagation delay and transition times.
[2]   Pull-up voltages are VCC(A) on port A and VCC(B) on port B.
[3]   Typical values were measured with VCC(A) = 3.3 V at Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise noted.
[4]   The tPLH delay data from port B to port A is measured at 0.5 V on port B to 0.3VCC(A) on port A.
[5]   The proportional delay data from port A to port B is measured at 0.3VCC(A) on port A to 0.3VCC(B) on port B.
[6]   The enable pin, EN, should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 19.
