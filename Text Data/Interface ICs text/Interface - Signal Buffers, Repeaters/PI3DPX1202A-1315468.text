Reset Implementation
When ENABLE is Low, the device is power-down mode and output are high impedance. It is critical to transi-
tion the ENABLE after the power supply VDD has reached the minimum recommended operation voltage. This
can be achieved by the control signal GPO or by an external capacitor connected to GND.
To insure properly Reset, the ENABLE pin must be de-asserted for at least 100μS before asserted, and must be
reprogrammed in I2C programming mode. When using external capacitor, the size of the cap value depends
on the power up VDD supply ramp. Larger value results in a slower ramp-up time. Consider 0.1uF capacitor as
a reasonable first estimate.

Power-up/down and Hot Plug Detect (HPD)
Following power on, state machine enter Reset State. Chip is powered down. HPD startup oscillator and Bandgap and Digital VDD
regulator is on.
After Power-On-Reset (POR) de-asserted, state machine enter "Low Power Mode 1" and then 2-ms later enter "Low Power Mode 2"
and monitor HPD_SINK.
When HPD_SINK is asserted, the state will change from "Low Power State 2" to "Active state". In Active stage, 1.2V regulator is
turned on. When 1.2V POR detects valid voltage, RX and TX section of the channel will power on.
In Active state, if HPD_SINK=0, then it will go to wait state and initiate debounce timer, if HPD_SINK is still=0 after 300ms, this
signal a HPD reset and the state machine goes to the "Low Power mode 2" state. If HPD_SINK reverts back to 1 (High) within
300ms, then the controller will return active state. All circuits blocks are active in both active and wait state.

Intelligent Power Management
The device intelligent signal detection scheme allows portions, or all of the IC, to be disabled for power savings. In DP
mode, if only one or two lanes are active, the other lanes will be automatically powered off. If there is no input video
signal the entire IC will be powered down. If there is no monitor detected, it can also automatically power down the IC.
The power-down mode can also be entered using hard pin ENABLE, or through DPCD register (AUX link training).

4.3    SMBus Registers
The AUX register can be read/write using the SMBus input. When in AUX mode, the control of the registers is passed to AUX, writ-
ing the SMBUS as the same time should be avoided.
In TMDS mode setting (CAD_DET) = 1, external source can use SMBus to set the Equalization settings. EQ table can also be set by
programming SMBus register 1.
SMBus is set to auto EQ mode 1 by default. ie. Reg0x01=00001101.

4.4    DisplayPort AUX Listener
DP AUX listener supports Native AUX CH Syntax. Mapping of SMBus onto AUX CH Syntax is not supported.
AUX listener monitor AUX communication from requester and replier for transactions and stored AUX communication ,
related to the link settings.
In AUX read/write request cycle, the AUX address compares with the following registers’ address. When the addresses
matches, data shall extract and store into the respective AUX Listener registers. Below registers will set during the link train-
ing sequence after the hot plug detection.
00100h Data Rate Register
00101h LANE_COUNT_SET
00103h - 00106h TRAINING_LANE0/1/2/3_SET
00260h Sink Test request response
00600h Power Down
The AUX listener supports Sink request Test sequence. After HPD IRQ event and DP source read 00201h AUX register and
if bit 1 is high, the DP source will enter a Sink request test mode and initiate a sequence of AUX read request cycle. During
the read cycle, data matching the following registers address are stored in the listener.
00206h     ADJUST_REQUEST_LANE0_1
00207h     ADJUST_REQUEST_LANE2_3
00218h     Test Request
00219h     Test link rate
00220h     Test Lane count
After the read request cycle, the DP source will write 1 to Bit 0 register 00260h if the DP source enters sink request mode,
or 1 to Bit 1 of register 00260h if the source declined the sink test request. The data stored in registers 002xx above will
override the value set in 00101h to 00106h registers when the sink entered the Sink Test mode.

6.2    PCB Layout Guideline
As transmission data rate increases rapidly, any flaws and/or mis-matches on PCB layout are amplified in terms of signal integrity.
Layout guideline for high-speed transmission is highlighted in this application note.
AC coupling Capacitor
Below is an example of placing AC coupling capacitors on high-speed channels.
Location
To wisely use the equalization selections offered by PI3DPX1202, it is recommended to place PI3DPX1202 at the end of the entire
path. In short, PI3DPX1202 should be located close to the output DP connector in a source application. Below is the PI3DPX1202
placement on its evaluation board.
Thermal Pad GND Via Recommendation
To wisely use the equalization selections offered by PI3DPX1202, it is recommended to place PI3DPX1202 at the end of the entire
path. In short, PI3DPX1202 should be located close to the output DP connector in a source application. Below is the PI3DPX1202
placement on its evaluation board .
Several GND vias are the “must” requirement in thermal pad. The recommended Via size is 12/24 mil.

General Power and Ground Guideline
To provide a clean power supply for Diodes high-speed device, few recommendations are listed below:
•    Power (VDD) and ground (GND) pins should be connected to corresponding power planes of the printed circuit board directly
     without passing through any resistor.
•    The thickness of the PCB dielectric layer should be minimized such that the VDD and GND planes create low inductance paths.
•    One low-ESR 0.1uF decoupling capacitor should be mounted at each VDD pin or should supply bypassing for at most two VDD
     pins. Capacitors of smaller body size, i.e. 0402 package, is more preferable as the insertion loss is lower. The capacitor should be
     placed next to the VDD pin.
•    One capacitor with capacitance in the range of 4.7uF to 10uF should be incorporated in the power supply decoupling design as
     well. It can be either tantalum or an ultra-low ESR ceramic.
•    A ferrite bead for isolating the power supply for Diodes high-speed device from the power supplies for other parts on the printed
     circuit board should be implemented.
•    Several thermal ground vias must be required on the thermal pad. 25-mil or less pad size and 14-mil or less finished hole are
     recommended.

High-speed signal Routing
Well-designed layout is essential to prevent signal reflection:
•    For 90Ω differential impedance, width-spacing-width micro-strip of 6-7-6 mils is recommended; for 100Ω differential imped-
     ance, width-spacing-width micro-strip of 5-7-5 mils is recommended.
•    Differential impedance tolerance is targeted at ±15%.

     is changed.

•    To keep the reference unchanged, stitching vias must be used when changing layers.
•    Differential pair should maintain symmetrical routing whenever possible. The intra-pair skew of micro-strip should be less than
     5 mils.

•    For minimal crosstalk, inter-pair spacing between two differential micro-strip pairs should be at least 20 mils or 4 times the
     dielectric thickness of the PCB.
•    Wider trace width of each differential pair is recommended in order to minimize the loss, especially for long routing. More con-
     sistent PCB impedance can be achieved by a PCB vendor if trace is wider.
•    Differential signals should be routed away from noise sources and other switching signals on the printed circuit board.

7.2    Part Marking Information
Our standard product mark follows our standard part number ordering information, except for those products with a speed letter
code. The speed letter code mark is placed after the package code letter, rather than after the device number as it is ordered. After
electrical test screening and speed binning has been completed, we then perform an “add mark” operation which places the speed
code letter at the end of the complete part number.

7.3    Tape & Reel Materials and Design
Carrier Tape
The Pocketed Carrier Tape is made of Conductive Polystyrene plus Carbon material (or equivalent). The surface resistivity is 106
Ohm/sq. maximum. Pocket tapes are designed so that the component remains in position for automatic handling after cover tape is
removed. Each pocket has a hole in the center for automated sensing if the pocket is occupied or not, thus facilitating device removal.
Sprocket holes along the edge of the center tape enable direct feeding into automated board assembly equipment. See Figures 3 and 4
for carrier tape dimensions.
Cover Tape
Cover tape is made of Anti-static Transparent Polyester film. The surface resistivity is 107Ohm/Sq. Minimum to 1011Ohm sq. maxi-
mum. The cover tape is heat-sealed to the edges of the carrier tape to encase the devices in the pockets. The force to peel back the
cover tape from the carrier tape shall be a MEAN value of 20 to 80gm (2N to 0.8N).
Reel
The device loading orientation is in compliance with EIA-481, current version (Figure 2). The loaded carrier tape is wound onto ei-
ther a 13-inch reel, (Figure 4) or 7-inch reel. The reel is made of Anti-static High-Impact Polystyrene. The surface resistivity 107Ohm/
sq. minimum to 1011Ohm/sq. max.

NOTES:
1. A0, B0, and K0 are determined by component size. The cavity must restrict lateral movement of component to 0.5mm maximum for 8mm and 12mm wide tape
and to 1.0mm maximum for 16,24,32, and 44mm wide carrier. The maximum component rotation within the cavity must be limited to 20o maximum for 8 and 12 mm
carrier tapes and 10o maximum for 16 through 44mm.
2. Tape and components will pass around reel with radius “R” without damage.
3. S1 does not apply to carrier width ≥32mm because carrier has sprocket holes on both sides of carrier where Do≥S1.
4. So does not exist for carrier ≤32mm because carrier does not have sprocket hole on both side of carrier.
