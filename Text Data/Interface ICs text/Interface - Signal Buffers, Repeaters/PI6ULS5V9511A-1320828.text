Note:
 [1] This speciﬁcation applies over the full operating temperature range.
  [2] The enable time can slow considerably for some parts when temperature is < −20 °C.
  [3] Delays that can occur after ENABLE and/or idle times have passed.
  [4] Guaranteed by design, not production tested.
  [5] Itrt(pu) varies with temperature and VCC voltage.
  [6] Input pull-up voltage should not exceed power supply voltage in operating mode because the rise time accelerator will
          clamp the voltage to the positive supply rail.
  [7] The connection circuitry always regulates its output to a higher voltage than its input.
  [8] Force VSDAIN = VSCLIN = 0.1 V, tie SDAOUT and SCLOUT through 10 kΩ resistor to VCC and measure the SDAOUT and
          SCLOUT output.
