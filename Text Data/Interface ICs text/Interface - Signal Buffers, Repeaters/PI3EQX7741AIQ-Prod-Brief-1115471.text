PI3EQX7741AIQ
AECQ Certified 5.0Gbps, 1-port, USB3.0 ReDriver™
Pericom Semiconductor’s PI3EQX7741AIQ is a low power, high
performance 5.0 Gbps signal ReDriver™ designed specifically
                                                                      Features
for the USB 3.0 protocol. The device provides programmable            ÎÎUSB              3.0 compatible
equalization, De-Emphasis, and input threshold controls to
                                                                      ÎÎFull        Compliancy to USB3.0 Super Speed Standard

reducing Inter-Symbol Interference. PI3EQX7741AIQ                     ÎÎTwo            5.0Gbps differential signal pairs
supports two 100Ω Differential CML data I/O’s between
                                                                      ÎÎAdjustable              Receiver Equalization

extend the signals across other distant data pathways on              ÎÎ100Ω               Differential CML I/O’s
the user’s platform. The integrated equalization circuitry            ÎÎPin     Configured Output Emphasis Control
provides flexibility with signal integrity of the signal before
the ReDriver. A low-level input signal detection and                  ÎÎInput             signal level detect and squelch for each
output squelch function is provided for each channel.                    channel
Each channel operates fully independently. When the channels

are enabled EN_x# = 0 and operating, that channels’ input
signal level (on xI+/-) determines whether the output is active.      ÎÎLow            Power : ~330mW
If the input signal level of the channel falls below the active       ÎÎAuto             “Slumber” mode for adaptive power

= 1, the device enters a low power standby mode.                      ÎÎStand-by              Mode – Power Down State

Unplug Mode if load not detected, or it will return to Low
Power Mode (Slumber Mode) due to inactivity.                        Application Diagram
