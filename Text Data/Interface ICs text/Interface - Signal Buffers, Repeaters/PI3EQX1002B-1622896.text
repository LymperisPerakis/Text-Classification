 PI3EQX1002B
 1-Port USB3.1 Gen-2 ReDriver
 Description                                                                                      Features
 The PI3EQX1002B is a low power, high performance 10.0
                                                                                                     ¼¼5 & 10Gbps serial link with linear equalizer.
 Gbps 1-Port USB 3.1 linear ReDriver™ designed specifically
 for the USB 3.1 protocol. The device provides programmable                                          ¼¼USB3.1 and USB3.0 Compatible
 equalization, linear swing and flat gain to optimize performance                                    ¼¼Full Compliancy to USB3.1 Super Speed Standard
 over a variety of physical mediums by reducing Inter-Symbol
                                                                                                     ¼¼Two 10Gbps differential signal pairs
 Interference. PI3EQX1002B supports two 100Ω Differential

                                                                                                     ¼¼Pin Adjustable Flat Gain
 The integrated equalization circuitry provides flexibility with
 signal integrity of the signal before the ReDriver. Each channel                                    ¼¼100Ω Differential CML I/O’s
 operates fully independently. The channels’ input signal level                                      ¼¼Automatic Receiver Detect
 determines whether the output is active.
                                                                                                     ¼¼Auto “Slumber” mode for adaptive power management
 The PI3EQX1002B also includes an automatic receiver detect
 function. The receiver detection loop will be active again if the                                   ¼¼Single Supply Voltage: 3.3V
 corresponding channel’s signal detector is idle for longer than                                     ¼¼Packaging:
 7.3mS. The channel will then move to Unplug Mode if load not
                                                                                                     ¼¼30-pin, TQFN 2.5x4.5 mm (ZL30)

 due to inactivity.
