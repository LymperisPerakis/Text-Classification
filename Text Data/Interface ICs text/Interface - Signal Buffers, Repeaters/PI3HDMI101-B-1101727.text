TMDS Receiver Block
Each high speed data and clock input has integrated equalization that can eliminate deterministic jitter caused by input cables.
All activity can be configured using pin strapping. The Rx block is designed to receive all relevant signals directly from the HDMI™
connector without any additional circuitry, 3 High speed TMDS data, 1 pixel clock, and DDC signals. TMDS channels have the fol-
lowing termination scheme for Rx Sense support. The switching between 50-Ohm termination vs. 250K-Ohm termination is done
automatically. The PI3HDMI101-B monitors the 50-Ohm termination in the Rx chipset behind our part, and when this 50-Ohm
termination is not present, we disable our 50-Ohm termination at our input.

TMDS output oscillation elimination
The TMDS inputs do not incorporate a squelch circuit. Therefore, we recommend the input to be externally biased to prevent output
oscillation. One pin will be pulled high to VDD with the other grounded through a 1.5K-Ohm resistor as shown.

Recommended Power Supply Decoupling Circuit
Figure 1 is the recommended power supply decoupling circuit configuration. It is recommended to put 0.1µF decoupling capacitors on
each VDD pins of our part, there are four 0.1µF decoupling capacitors are put in Figure 1 with an assumption of only four VDD pins
on our part, if there is more or less VDD pins on our Pericom parts, the number of 0.1µF decoupling capacitors should be adjusted
according to the actual number of VDD pins. On top of 0.1µF decoupling capacitors on each VDD pins, it is recommended to put a
10µF decoupling capacitor near our part’s VDD, it is for stabilizing the power supply for our part. Ferrite bead is also recommended
for isolating the power supply for our part and other power supplies in other parts of the circuit. But, it is optional and depends on the
power supply conditions of other circuits.

Requirements on the Decoupling Capacitors
There is no special requirement on the material of the capacitors. Ceramic capacitors are generally being used with typically materi-
als of X5R or X7R.
Layout and Decoupling CapacitorPlacement Consideration
i. Each 0.1µF decoupling capacitor should be placed as close as possible to each VDD pin.
ii. VDD and GND planes should be used to provide a low impedance path for power and ground.
iii. Via holes should be placed to connect to VDD and GND planes directly.
iv. Trace should be as wide as possible
v. Trace should be as short as possible.
vi. The placement of decoupling capacitor and the way of routing trace should consider the power flowing criteria.
vii. 10µF capacitor should also be placed closed to our part and should be placed in the middle location of 0.1µF capacitors.
viii. Avoid the large current circuit placed close to our part; especially when it is shared the same VDD and GND planes. Since large
        current flowing on our VDD or GND planes will generate a potential variation on the VDD or GND of our part.

 Application Information
 Supply Voltage
 All VDD pins are recommended to have a 0.01µF capacitor tied from VDD to GND to filter supply noise
 TMDS inputs
 Standard TMDS terminations have already been integrated into Pericom’s PI3HDM101-A device. Therefore, external terminations
 are not required. Any unused port must be left floating and not tied to GND.
