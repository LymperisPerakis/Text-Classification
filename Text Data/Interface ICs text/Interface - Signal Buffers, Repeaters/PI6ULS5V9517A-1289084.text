   2 channel, bidirectional buffer                                  The PI6ULS5V9517A is a CMOS integrated circuit intended
   I2C-bus and SMBus compatible                                     for I2C-bus or SMBus applications. It can provide level
   Port A operating supply voltage range of 0.8 V to 5.5 V          shifting between low voltage (down to 0.8 V) and higher
   Port B operating supply voltage range of 2.2 V to 5.5 V          voltage (2.2V to 5.5V) in mixed-mode applications. And it
   Voltage level translation from 0.8 V to 5.5 V and from 2.2       enables I2C and similar bus system to be extended, without
    V to 5.5 V                                                       degeradation of peformance even during level shifting.
   Active HIGH repeater enable input                                The PI6ULS5V9517A enables the system designer to isolate
   Open-drain input/outputs                                         two halves of a bus for both voltage and capacitance,
   Lock-up free operation                                           accommodating more I2C devices or longer trace length. It
   Supports arbitration and clock stretching across the             also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing
    repeater                                                         bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock
   Accommodates Standard-mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus                 (SCL) lines, thus allowing two buses of 400 pF to be connected

Functional Description
The PI6ULS5V9517A is a CMOS integrated circuit intended for I2C-bus or SMBus applications. It can provide level shifting
between low voltage (down to 0.8 V) and higher voltage (2.2 V to 5.5 V) in mixed-mode applications. And it enables I2C and
similar bus system to be extended, without degradation of performance even during level shifting.
The PI6ULS5V9517A enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus for both voltage and capacitance, accommodating
more I2C devices or longer trace length. It also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for both the
data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus allowing two buses of 400 pF to be connected in an I2C application.
The B-side drivers operate from 2.2 V to 5.5 V. The output low level of port B internal buffer is approximately 0.5 V, while the
input voltage must be 70mV lower (0.43V) or even more lower. The nearly 0.5V low signal is called a buffered low. When the
B-side I/O is driven low internally, the low is not recognized as a low by the input. This feature prevents a lockup condition from
occurring when the input low condition is released. This type of design on B port prevents it from being used in series with
another PI6ULS5V9517A (B side) or similar devices ,because they don’t recognize buffer low signals as a valid low .
The A-side drivers operate from 0.8 V to 5.5 V. The output low level of port A internal buffer is nearly 0V, while the input low
level is set at 0.3Vcc(A) to accommodate the need for a lower LOW level in systems where the low voltage side supply voltage is as
low as 0.8 V. Port A of two or more PI6ULS5V9517As can be connected together to allow a star topography with port A on the
common bus. And port A can be connected directly to any other buffer with static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple
PI6ULS5V9517As can be connected in series, port A to port B, with no build-up in offset voltage with only time off light delays to
consider.
The EN pin can also be used to turn the drivers on and off. This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until
after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus operation
will hang the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled. The enable pin should
only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state to prevent system failures.
After power-up and with the EN HIGH, a LOW level on port A (below 0.3Vcc(A)) turns the corresponding port B driver (either
SDA or SCL) on and drives port B down to about 0.5 V. When port A rises above 0.3Vcc(A), the port B pull-down driver is turned
off and the external pull-up resistor pulls the pin HIGH. When port B falls ﬁrst and goes below 0.3Vcc(B) the port A driver is
turned on and port A pulls down to 0 V. The port B pull-down is not enabled unless the port B voltage goes below 0.4 V. If the port
B low voltage does not go below 0.5 V, the port A driver will turn off when port B voltage is above 0.7Vcc(B). If the port B low
voltage goes below 0.4 V, the port B pull-down driver is enabled and port B will only be able to rise to 0.5 V until port A rises above
0.3Vcc(A). Then port B will continue to rise being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor. The Vcc(A) is only used to provide
the 0.3Vcc(A) reference to the port A input comparators and for the power good detect circuit. The PI6ULS5V9517A logic and all
I/Os are powered by the Vcc(B) pin.
The EN pin is active high and allows the user to select when the repeater is active.This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave
on power-up until after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling
during a bus operation will hang the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
The enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state to prevent system failures.
As with the standard I2C system, pullup resistors are required to provide the logic-high levels on the buffered bus.
The PI6ULS5V9517A has standard open-collector configuration of the I2C bus. The size of these pullup resistors depends on the
system, but each side of the repeater must have a pullup resistor. The device is designed to work with Standard mode and Fast
mode I2C devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard mode I2C devices only specify 3 mA in a generic I2C system, where
Standard mode devices and multiple masters are possible. Under certain conditions, higher termination currents can be used.

Application Information
A typical application is shown in Figure 6. In this example, the system master is running on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is
connected to a 1.2 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz.Master devices can be placed on either bus.
The PI6ULS5V9517A is 5V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate between 0.8V to 5.5V bus voltages
and 2.2V to 5.5V bus voltages.
                                                          PI6ULS5V9517A
                                                     Figure 6:Typical Application
When port A of the PI6ULS5V9517A is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator detects the falling edge when it goes
below 0.3 Vcc(A) and causes the internal driver on port B to turn on, causing port B to pull down to about 0.5 V. When port B of
the PI6ULS5V9517A falls, ﬁrst a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes the internal driver on port A to
turn on and pull the port A pin down to ground. In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 9
and Figure 10. If the bus master in Figure 6 were to write to the slave through the PI6ULS5V9517A, waveforms shown in Figure 9
would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission except that the HIGH level may be as low as
0.8V, and the turn on and turn off of the acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
On the B-side bus of the PI6ULS5V9517A, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset from ground equal to the VOL of
the PI6ULS5V9517A. After the eighth clock pulse, the data line is pulled to the VOL of the slave device, which is very close to
ground in this example. At the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the low level set by the driver in the PI6ULS5V9517A
for a short delay, while the A-bus side rises above 0.3 Vcc(A) and then it continues high.
Multiple PI6ULS5V9517A port A sides can be connected in a star conﬁguration (Figure 7), allowing all nodes to communicate
with each other.
Multiple PI6ULS5V9517As can be connected in series (Figure 8) as long as port A is connected to port B. I2C-bus slave devices can
be connected to any of the bus segments. The number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
delay/time-of-ﬂight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.
