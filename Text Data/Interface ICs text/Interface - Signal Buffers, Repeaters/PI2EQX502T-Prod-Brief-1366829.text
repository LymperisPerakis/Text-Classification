PI2EQX502T
1.2V, 5.0Gbps, 1-Port, USB3.0 ReDriver
Description                                                         Features
The PI2EQX502T is a low power, high performance 5.0 Gbps
                                                                      ¼¼USB 3.0 compatible
signal ReDriver designed specifically for the USB 3.0 protocol.
The device provides programmable equalization and De-                 ¼¼Full Compliancy to USB3.0 Super Speed Standard
Emphasis to optimize performance over a variety of physical           ¼¼Two 5.0Gbps differential signal pairs
mediums by reducing Inter-Symbol Interference. PI2EQX502T
                                                                      ¼¼Adjustable Receiver Equalization
supports two 100Ω Differential CML data I/O’s between the
Protocol ASIC to a switch fabric, over cable, or to extend the        ¼¼100Ω Differential CML I/O’s
signals across other distant data pathways on the user’s platform.
                                                                      ¼¼Pin Configured Output Emphasis Control
The integrated equalization circuitry provides flexibility with
signal integrity of the signal before the ReDriver. A low-level       ¼¼Input signal level detect and squelch for each channel
input signal detection and output squelch function is provided        ¼¼Automatic Receiver Detect
for each channel. Each channel operates fully independently.
                                                                      ¼¼Low Power : ~137mW
The channels’ input signal level (on xI+/-) determines whether
the output is active.                                                 ¼¼Auto “Slumber” mode for adaptive power management
The PI2EQX502T also includes an automatic receiver detect
                                                                      ¼¼Single Supply Voltage: 1.2V
function. The receiver detection loop will be active again if the
corresponding channel’s signal detector is idle for longer than       ¼¼Packaging: 16-Pin TQFN 3 x 3 mm
7.3mS. The channel will then move to Unplug Mode if load not
detected, or it will return to Low Power Mode (Slumber Mode)
due to inactivity.
