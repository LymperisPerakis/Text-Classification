1. General description
             The PCA9509A is a level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater with two voltage supplies
             that enables processor low voltage 2-wire serial bus to interface with standard I2C-bus or
             SMBus I/O. While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system
             during the level shifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional
             buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling the I2C-bus or
             SMBus maximum capacitance of 400 pF on the higher voltage side. Port A allows a
             voltage range from 0.8 V to 2.0 V and requires no external pull-up resistors due to the
             internal current source. Port B allows a voltage range from 2.3 V to 5.5 V and is
             overvoltage tolerant. Both port A and port B SDA and SCL pins are high-impedance when
             the PCA9509A is unpowered.
             The bus port B drivers are compliant with SMBus I/O levels, while port A uses an offset
             LOW which prevents bus lock-up and allows the bidirectional nature of the device. Port A
             uses a current source for pull-up and an offset pull-down driver. This results in a LOW on
             the port A accommodating smaller voltage swings. The output pull-down on the port A
             internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.2VCC(A), while the input threshold of the
             internal buffer is set about 50 mV lower than that of the output voltage LOW. When the
             port A I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input.
             This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring. The output pull-down on the port B
             drives a hard LOW and the input level is set at 30 % of SMBus or I2C-bus voltage level
             which enables port B to connect to any other I2C-bus devices or buffer.
             The PCA9509A drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) is above 0.7 V and VCC(B) is above
             1.7 V. The enable (EN) pin can also be used to turn on and turn off the drivers under
             system control. Caution should be observed to change only the state of the EN pin when
             the bus is idle.
             The PCA9509A is similar to the PCA9509 but offers lower A port voltage range to 0.8 V to
             accommodate lower voltage processors and disables the current mirrors when disabled to
             reduce standby power.

                   1.1 Selection recommendations
                       The PCA9509A is recommended for all applications except in the following cases:
                         • PCA9509P should be used if an external A-port pull-up resistor is required to adjust
                            current for noise margin considerations or to reduce operating current consumption
                            even more.
                         • The PCA9509 should be used if instant on from disable is required with A Port voltage
                            greater than 1.0 V and larger standby current is not a concern.

                       [1]  The PCA9509 current mirrors do not shut down when the device is disabled allowing instant turn-on, but at
                            the cost of the higher standby current. The PCA9509A and PCA9509P current mirrors are turned off when
                            disabled for lowest standby power consumption, but sufficient delay (10 s) after enable is needed before
                            resuming operation.
                       [2]  Operating currents do not include the current consumed by the external pull-ups on B-port or the external
                            pull-ups on the A-port of the PCA9509P.

6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9509A”.
                       The PCA9509A enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.8 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9509A contains 2 bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to support up-translation/down-translation
                       between the low voltage and 3.3 V SMBus or 5 V I2C-bus. The port A and port B I/Os are
                       overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered. Due to the current
                       source on port A the voltage on the pins should not be above VCC(A) when the device is
                       powered.
                       The PCA9509A includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until
                       VCC(B) is above 1.7 V and the VCC(A) is above 0.7 V. VCC(B) and VCC(A) can be applied in
                       any sequence at power-up. After power-up and with the EN pin HIGH, a LOW level on
                       port A (below approximately 0.15VCC(A)) turns on the corresponding port B driver (either
                       SDA or SCL) and drives port B down to about 0 V. When port A rises above approximately
                       0.15VCC(A), the port B pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor pulls
                       the pin HIGH. When port B falls first and goes below 0.3VCC(B), the port A driver is turned
                       on and port A pulls down to 0.2VCC(A) (typical). The port B pull-down is not enabled unless
                       the port A voltage goes below VIL. If the port A low voltage goes below VIL, the port B
                       pull-down driver is enabled until port A rises above approximately 0.15VCC(A) (VIL), then
                       port B, if not externally driven LOW, will continue to rise being pulled up by the external
                       pull-up resistor.
                       Remark: Ground offset between the PCA9509A ground and the ground of devices on
                       port A of the PCA9509A must be avoided.
                       The reason for this cautionary remark is that a CMOS/NMOS open-drain capable of
                       sinking 3 mA of current at 0.4 V has an output resistance of 133  or less (R = E / I). Such
                       a driver shares enough current with the port A output pull-down of the PCA9509A to be
                       seen as a LOW as long as the ground offset is zero. If the ground offset is greater than
                       0 V, then the driver resistance must be less. Since VIL can be as low as 80 mV at cold
                       temperatures and the low end of the current distribution, the maximum ground offset
                       should not exceed 40 mV.
                       Bus repeaters that use an output offset are not interoperable with the port A of the
                       PCA9509A as their output LOW levels are not recognized by the PCA9509A as a LOW. If
                       the PCA9509A is placed in an application where the VIL of port A of the PCA9509A does
                       not go below its VIL, the port B does not go LOW.
                       Port B provides normal I2C-bus voltage levels and is interoperable with all I2C-bus slaves,
                       masters and repeaters.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH and allows the user to select when the repeater is active. This
                       can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until after the system power-up
                       reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during
                       a bus operation hangs the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse
                       the I2C-bus parts being enabled. The EN also puts the PCA9509A in a standby condition
                       to reduce power consumption.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  PCA9509A
                                                                              Low power level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
                       The enable pin should only change state when the bus and the repeater port are in an idle
                       state to prevent system failures.
                       Because the enable pin (EN) can put the PCA9509A in Standby mode, and when in
                       standby the current sources and current mirrors are turned OFF to save power, the
                       recovery from the disabled/standby state is slow so that the current sources and current
                       mirrors can return to full current before the channels are enabled.
                       Remark: The system design should allow sufficient time after STOP before disabling the
                       PCA9509A so that both sides of the SDA and SCL channels are HIGH. It should also
                       allow sufficient time before the START such that the channel is disabled before the SDA
                       goes LOW. The PCA9509A should only be enabled during a bus idle state and there also
                       must be sufficient time allowed before the START such that the PCA9509A is fully active
                       before the falling edge of the SDA that defines a START.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system. Each of the port A I/Os has an
                       internal pull-up current source and does not require the external pull-up resistor. Port B is
                       designed to work with Standard-mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus devices in addition to
                       SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus devices only specify 3 mA output drive; this
                       limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic I2C-bus system where Standard-mode
                       devices and multiple masters are possible. Under certain conditions higher termination
                       currents can be used.
                   6.3 Edge rate control
                       The PCA9509A includes circuitry that slows down the falling edge of both the A side and
                       B side open-drain output pull-downs. This slowdown reduces system noise and
                       undershoot when the signal reflects off of the end of the bus. The slew rate control circuit
                       limits the maximum slew rate, and is relatively insensitive to the load capacitance, the bus
                       high voltage and to the pull-up value. The rising edge slew rate on the A side is controlled
                       by the pull-up current source and the load capacitance. The rising edge slew rate on the
                       B side is controlled by RC time constant of the bus pull-up resistor and the bus
                       capacitance, which are system level considerations and not under the control of the
                       PCA9509A. The B side pull-up resistor should be chosen based on the total B side bus
                       capacitance to result in a reasonable rising edge transition time that is less than the
                       maximum allowed rise time, and slow enough not to make system level noise problems.
                   6.4 Bus pull-up resistor selection
                       The AC test load for the B side of the PCA9509A is 1.35 k and 50 pF total capacitance.
                       This results in a rise time of approximately 60 ns. The 1.35 k resistor is chosen to
                       provide a little less than 3 mA in a 3.3 V application so it is compatible with
                       Standard-mode I2C-bus devices as well as Fast-mode devices. The B side output
                       pull-down is a strong driver and is capable of sinking Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) currents,
                       however the pull-up must be sized for the weakest part in the system, so if Standard-mode
                       I2C-bus parts are present on the B side, the pull-up must be limited to less than 3 mA. If
                       only Fm+ parts are used on the B side, the maximum pull-up current may be up to 30 mA.
                       The pull-up resistor should always be sized to provide less than the rated pull-up current
                       for the weakest part on the bus under the maximum bus voltage expected in the system.

                                                                         Low power level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
                   When the bus capacitance is high, the current should be set near the maximum current
                   drive for the weakest part. However, if the bus capacitance is low a lower current/higher
                   resistor value should be used to keep the rise time from getting so fast that it causes
                   problems. The A side does not need a pull-up resistor. If one is added, care must be taken
                   to keep the LOW-level voltage at the A side input below 0.1VCC(A).
7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the CPU is running on a 0.9 V
                   I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 3.3 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz. Master
                   devices can be placed on either bus.

                     Fig 4.   Typical application
                   When port B of the PCA9509A is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a CMOS
                   hysteresis input detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(B) and causes the
                   internal driver on port A to turn on, causing port A to pull down to about 0.2VCC(A). When
                   port A of the PCA9509A falls, a comparator detects the falling edge when it falls below
                   0.15VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on port B to turn on and pull the port B pin down
                   to ground. In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to
                   Figure 5 and Figure 6. If the bus master in Figure 4 were to write to the slave through the
                   PCA9509A, waveforms shown in Figure 5 would be observed on the B bus. This looks
                   like a normal I2C-bus transmission.
                   On the A bus side of the PCA9509A, the clock and data lines are driven by the master and
                   swing nearly to ground. After the eighth clock pulse, the slave replies with an ACK that
                   causes a LOW on the A side equal to the VOL of the PCA9509A, which the master
                   recognizes as a LOW. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events
                   require that the LOW level on the A bus side at the input of the PCA9509A (VIL) is below
                   0.1VCC(A) to be recognized by the PCA9509A and then transmitted to the B bus side.

[2]   VCC(A) must be  VCC(B)  1 V, that is, VCC(A) = 1.8 V and VCC(B) = 2.5 V is not a valid combination.
[3]   Care must be taken to minimize the resistance in series with the ground pin of the PCA9509A to the ground reference point of the VCC(A)
      supply because there is only 80 mV margin between the power good threshold and the 0.8 V minimum supply voltage at cold
      temperature (40 C). Because the B-side IOL of up to 30 mA flows through the resistance causing a voltage drop that effectively
      reduces the VCC(A) to chip ground voltage and when VCC(A) is less than the power good voltage ~0.72 V, the PCA9509A is disabled. For
      example, if the resistance is 1.4 , then 1.4   60 mA = 84 mV and 0.8 V  0.084 V = 0.716 V, which is less than the power good
      threshold, so the PCA9509A disables when both outputs drive LOW.
[4]   The port A current source has a typical value of about 270 A, but varies with both VCC(A) and VCC(B).
[5]   As long as the chip ground is common with the input ground reference the driver resistance may be as large as 120 . However, ground
      offset rapidly decreases the maximum allowed driver resistance.
[6]   Current load is a requirement for ATE testing, not part operation.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 26) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 26.
