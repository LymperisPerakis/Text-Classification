1. General description
              The PCA9509 is a level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater that enables processor low
              voltage 2-wire serial bus to interface with standard I2C-bus or SMBus I/O. While retaining
              all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system during the level shifts, it also
              permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for both the data
              (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling the I2C-bus or SMBus maximum
              capacitance of 400 pF on the higher voltage side. Port A allows a voltage range from
              1.35 V to VCC(B)  1.0 V and requires no external pull-up resistors due to the internal
              current source. Port B allows a voltage range from 3.0 V to 5.5 V and is overvoltage
              tolerant. Both port A and port B SDA and SCL pins are high-impedance when the
              PCA9509 is unpowered.
              For applications where Port A VCC(A) is less than 1.35 V or Port B VCC(B) is less than 3.0 V,
              use drop-in replacement PCA9509A.
              The bus port B drivers are compliant with SMBus I/O levels, while port A uses a current
              sensing mechanism to detect the input or output LOW signal which prevents bus lock-up.
              Port A uses a 1 mA current source for pull-up and a 200  pull-down driver. This results in
              a LOW on the port A accommodating smaller voltage swings. The output pull-down on the
              port A internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.2 V, while the input threshold of the
              internal buffer is set about 50 mV lower than that of the output voltage LOW. When the
              port A I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input.
              This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring. The output pull-down on the port B
              drives a hard LOW and the input level is set at 0.3 of SMBus or I2C-bus voltage level
              which enables port B to connect to any other I2C-bus devices or buffer.
              The PCA9509 drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) is above 0.8 V and VCC(B) is above
              2.5 V. The enable (EN) pin can also be used to turn on and turn off the drivers under
              system control. Caution should be observed to change only the state of the EN pin when
              the bus is idle.

6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9509”.
                       The PCA9509 enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 1.35 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9509 contains 2 bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to support up-translation/down-translation
                       between the low voltage and 3.3 V SMBus or 5 V I2C-bus. The port B I/Os are
                       over-voltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered.
                       The PCA9509 includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until
                       VCC(B) is above 2.5 V and the VCC(A) is above 0.8 V. VCC(B) and VCC(A) can be applied in
                       any sequence at power-up. After power-up and with the EN pin HIGH, a LOW level on
                       port A (below approximately 0.15 V) turns on the corresponding port B driver (either SDA
                       or SCL) and drives port B down to about 0 V. When port A rises above approximately
                       0.15 V, the port B pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor pulls the
                       pin HIGH. When port B falls first and goes below 0.3VCC(B), the port A driver is turned on
                       and port A pulls down to 0.2 V (typical). The port B pull-down is not enabled unless the
                       port A voltage goes below VILc. If the port A low voltage goes below VILc, the port B
                       pull-down driver is enabled until port A rises above approximately 0.15 V (VILc), then
                       port B, if not externally driven LOW, continues to rise being pulled up by the external
                       pull-up resistor.
                       Remark: Ground offset between the PCA9509 ground and the ground of devices on
                       port A of the PCA9509 must be avoided.
                       The reason for this cautionary remark is that a CMOS/NMOS open-drain capable of
                       sinking 3 mA of current at 0.4 V has an output resistance of 133  or less (R = E / I). Such
                       a driver shares enough current with the port A output pull-down of the PCA9509 to be
                       seen as a LOW as long as the ground offset is zero. If the ground offset is greater than
                       0 V, then the driver resistance must be less. Since VILc can be as low as 90 mV at cold
                       temperatures and the low end of the current distribution, the maximum ground offset
                       should not exceed 50 mV.
                       Bus repeaters that use an output offset are not interoperable with the port A of the
                       PCA9509 as their output LOW levels will not be recognized by the PCA9509 as a LOW. If
                       the PCA9509 is placed in an application where the VIL of port A of the PCA9509 does not
                       go below its VILc, it pulls port B LOW initially when port A input transitions LOW, but the
                       port B returns HIGH, so it does not reproduce the port A input on port B. Such applications
                       should be avoided.
                       Port B is interoperable with all I2C-bus slaves, masters and repeaters.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH and allows the user to select when the repeater is active. This
                       can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until after the system power-up
                       reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during
                       a bus operation hangs the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse
                       the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
                       The enable pin should only change state when the bus and the repeater port are in an idle
                       state to prevent system failures.

                                                                                                     Level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system. Each of the port A I/Os has an
                       internal pull-up current source and does not require the external pull-up resistor. Port B is
                       designed to work with Standard-mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus devices in addition to
                       SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus devices only specify 3 mA output drive; this
                       limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic I2C-bus system where Standard-mode
                       devices and multiple masters are possible. Under certain conditions higher termination
                       currents can be used.
7. Application design-in information
                       A typical application is shown in Figure 5. In this example, the CPU is running on a 1.35 V
                       I2C-bus while the master is connected to a 3.3 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz. Master
                       devices can be placed on either bus.
                                                                    1.35 V                                                 3.3 V

                                                 CPU            10 kΩ                                                                  400 kHz
                                                                                    EN
                                                                    bus A                                                bus B
                                                                                                                                        002aac128
                         Fig 5.   Typical application
                       When port B of the PCA9509 is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a CMOS
                       hysteresis detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(B) and causes the internal
                       driver on port A to turn on, causing port A to pull down to about 0.2 V. When port A of the
                       PCA9509 falls, first a comparator detects the falling edge and causes the internal driver
                       on port B to turn on and pull the port B pin down to ground. In order to illustrate what
                       would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 6 and Figure 7. If the bus master in
                       Figure 5 were to write to the slave through the PCA9509, waveforms shown in Figure 6
                       would be observed on the B bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission.
                       On the A bus side of the PCA9509, the clock and data lines are driven by the master and
                       swing nearly to ground. After the eighth clock pulse, the slave replies with an ACK that
                       causes a LOW on the A side equal to the VOL of the PCA9509, which the master
                       recognizes as a LOW. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events
                       require that the LOW level on the A bus side at the input of the PCA9509 (VIL) is below
                       VILc to be recognized by the PCA9509 and then transmitted to the B bus side.

[2]   If the PCA9509 is not being enabled or disabled, the VCC(A) minimum is 0.95 V with a corresponding decrease in the IIL, which will drop
      below the minimum specification of 450 A at cold temperature (see Figure 8 and Figure 9). This will not significantly change the rise
      and fall times of the signals on port A since the IIL value represents the current source pull-up current, so a lower current into the same
      capacitance results in a slower rise time and a longer transition time in general, however since the lower current is also associated with
      a lower voltage swing the delay is somewhat compensated. The key point of the graphs is that the current has a temperature
      dependence, and the output driver will also have the same temperature dependency so that the output offset of ~200 mV on port A is
      nearly temperature independent. Even though the IIL parameter indicates that at VCC(A) of 0.95 V the PCA9509 can only sink up to
      400 A instead of 450 A at cold temperature, the output is designed to be somewhat resistive such that under nominal conditions
      (1.1 V) the current source pull-up sources 1 mA and the output pull-down sinks the 1 mA at ~200 mV, so as the current source current
      decreases the output pull-down resistance increases in order to maintain the offset.
[3]   VIL specification is for the falling edge seen by the port A input. VILc is for the static LOW levels seen by the port A input resulting in
      port B output staying LOW.
[4]   The port A current source has a typical value of about 1 mA, but varies with both VCC(A) and VCC(B). Below VCC(A) of about 0.7 V the
      port A current source current drops to 0 mA. The current source current dropping across the internal pull-down driver resistance of
      about 200  defines the VOL.
[5]   As long as the chip ground is common with the input ground reference the driver resistance may be as large as 120 . However, ground

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 17) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 17.
