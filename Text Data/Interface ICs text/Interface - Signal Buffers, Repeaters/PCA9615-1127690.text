                buffer with hot-swap logic
                Rev. 1.1 — 10 May 2016                                               Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9615 is a Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) SMBus/I2C-bus buffer that extends the normal
             single-ended SMBus/I2C-bus through electrically noisy environments using a differential
             SMBus/I2C-bus (dI2C) physical layer, which is transparent to the SMBus/I2C-bus protocol
             layer. It consists of two single-ended to differential driver channels for the SCL (serial
             clock) and SDA (serial data).
             The use of differential transmission lines between identical dI2C bus buffers removes
             electrical noise and common-mode offsets that are present when signal lines must pass
             between different voltage domains, are bundled with hostile signals, or run adjacent to
             electrical noise sources, such as high energy power supplies and electric motors.
             The SMBus/I2C-bus was conceived as a simple slow speed digital link for short runs,
             typically on a single PCB or between adjacent PCBs with a common ground connection.
             Applications that extend the bus length or run long cables require careful design to
             preserve noise margin and reject interference.
             The dI2C-bus buffers were designed to solve these problems and are ideally suited for
             rugged high noise environments and/or longer cable applications, allow multiple slaves,
             and operate at bus speeds up to 1 MHz clock rate. Cables can be extended to at least
             3 meters (3 m), or longer cable runs at lower clock speeds. The dI2C-bus buffers are
             compatible with existing SMBus/I2C-bus devices and can drive Standard, Fast-mode, and
             Fast-mode Plus devices on the single-ended side.
             Signal direction is automatic, and requires no external control. To prevent bus latch up,
             the standard SMBus/I2C-bus side of the bus buffer, the PCA9615 employs static offset,
             care should be taken when connecting these to other SMBus/I2C-bus buffers that may not
             operate with offset.
             This device is a bridge between the normal 2-wire single-ended wired-OR SMBus/I2C-bus
             and the 4-wire dI2C-bus.
             Additional circuitry allows the PCA9615 to be used for ‘hot swap’ applications, where
             systems are always on, but require insertion or removal of modules or cards without
             disruption to existing signals.
             The PCA9615 has two supply voltages, VDD(A) and VDD(B). VDD(A), the card side supply,
             only serves as a reference and ranges from 2.3 V to 5.5 V. VDD(B), the line side supply,
             serves as the majority supply for circuitry and ranges from 3.0 V to 5.5 V.

                                                        2-channel multipoint Fm+ dI2C-bus buffer with hot-swap logic
7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 2.
                       The PCA9615 is used at each node of the dI2C-bus signal path, to provide conversion
                       from the dI2C-bus signal format to conventional I2C-bus/SMBus, allowing the connection
                       of existing I2C-bus/SMBus devices as slaves or the bus master. Because the signal
                       voltages on the I2C-bus/SMBus bus side may be different from the dI2C-bus side, there
                       are two power supply pins and a common ground. To prevent bus latch-up, the
                       I2C-bus/SMBus side employs static offset. Signal direction is determined by the
                       I2C-bus/SMBus bus protocol, and does not require a direction signal, as these bus buffers
                       automatically set signal flow direction. An enable pin (EN) is provided to disable the bus
                       buffer, and is useful for fault finding, power-up sequencing, or reconfiguration of a large
                       bus system by isolating sections not needed at all times.
                       Construction of the differential transmission line is not device-dependent. PCB traces,
                       open wiring, twisted-pair cables or a combination of these may be used. Twisted-pair
                       cables offer the best performance. A typical twisted-pair transmission line cable has a
                       characteristic impedance of ‘about 100 ’ and must be terminated at both ends in 100 
                       to prevent unwanted signal reflections. Multiple nodes (each using a dI2C-bus buffer) may
                       be connected at any point along this transmission line, however, the stub length degrades
                       the bus performance, and should therefore be minimized.
                   7.1 I2C-bus/SMBus side
                       The I2C-bus/SMBus side of the PCA9615 differential bus buffer is connected to other
                       I2C-bus/SMBus devices and requires pull-up resistors on each of the SCL and SDA
                       signals. The value of the resistor should be chosen based on the bus capacitance and
                       desired data speed, being careful not to overload the driver current rating of 3 mA for
                       Standard and Fast modes, 30 mA for Fast-mode Plus (Fm+). The I2C-bus/SMBus side of
                       the PCA9615 is powered from the VDD(A) supply pin.
                   7.2 dI2C-bus side differential pair
                       In previous I2C-bus/SMBus designs, the nodes (Master and one or more Slaves) are
                       connected by wired-OR in combination with a single pull-up resistor. This simple
                       arrangement is not suited for long distances more than 1 meter (1 m) or about 3 feet (3 ft),
                       due to ringing and reflections on the un-terminated bus. The use of a transmission line
                       with correct termination eliminates this problem, and is further improved by differential
                       signaling used in the dI2C-bus scheme. Each node acts as both a driver and a receiver to
                       allow bidirectional signal flow, but not at the same time. Switching from transmit to receive
                       is done automatically. The dI2C-bus side of the PCA9615 is powered from the VDD(B)
                       supply pin.
                       The dI2C-bus is also biased to an idle state (D+ more positive than D) to be compatible
                       with the I2C-bus/SMBus wired-OR scheme, when not transmitting traffic (data). This
                       allows every node to receive broadcast messages from the Master, and return ACK/NACK
                       and data in response. Biasing is done with additional resistors, connected to VDD(B) and
                       VSS (the local ground), as shown in Figure 5. The transmission line is terminated in the
                       characteristic impedance of the cable, typically 100 . This is the value defined by three
                       resistors, the other two resistors providing the idle condition bias to the twisted pair.

                         Fig 5.   dI2C-bus terminations
                7.2.1 Noise rejection
                       Impulse noise coupled into the I2C-bus/SMBus signals can prevent the I2C-bus/SMBus
                       bus from operating reliably. The hostile signals may appear on the SCL line, SDA line, or
                       both. Impulse noise may also enter the common ground connection, or be caused by
                       current in the ground path caused by DC power supplies, or other signals sharing the
                       common ground return path. This problem is removed by using a differential transmission
                       line, in place of the I2C-bus/SMBus signal path. The dI2C-bus receiver (at each dI2C-bus
                       node) subtracts the signals on the two differential lines (D+ and D), and eliminates any
                       common-mode noise that is coupled into the dI2C-bus. The receiver amplifies the signals
                       which are also attenuated by the bulk resistance of the transmission line cable
                       connection, and does not rely on a common ground connection at each node.
                7.2.2 Rejection of ground offset voltage
                       Hostile signals interfere with the I2C-bus/SMBus bus through the common ground
                       connection between each node. Current in this ground path causes an offset that may
                       cause false data or push the I2C-bus/SMBus signals outside of an acceptable range.
                       Unwanted ground offset can be caused by heavy DC current in the ground path, or
                       injection of ground current from AC signals, either of which may show up as false signals.
                       Because the dI2C-bus node receiver responds only to the difference between the two
                       dI2C-bus transmission lines, common-mode signals are ignored. There is no need to have
                       a ground connection between each of the nodes, which may be powered locally. Nodes
                       may also be powered by extra conductors (for VDD and ground) run with the dI2C-bus
                       signals. Voltage offsets caused by DC current in these additional wires are ignored by the
                       dI2C-bus receiver, which subtracts the two differential signals (D+ and D).
                   7.3 EN pin
                       Enable input to connect the device into the bus. When this pin is LOW, the device never
                       connects to the bus, and disconnect the SCL/SDA from differential SCL/SDA. When EN is
                       driven HIGH, and VDD(A) and VDD(B) are stable, the EN pin connects SDA/SCL to
                       differential SDA/SCL after a stop bit or bus idle has been detected on differential line bus.
                       It should never change state during an I2C-bus/SMBus operation because disabling
                       during a bus operation hangs the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could
                       confuse the I2C-bus/SMBus parts being enabled. The EN pin should only change state
                       when the global bus and the buffer port are in an idle state to prevent system failures.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                               PCA9615
                                                          2-channel multipoint Fm+ dI2C-bus buffer with hot-swap logic
                   7.4 Hot swap and power-on reset
                       During a power-on sequence, an initialization circuit holds the PCA9615 in a disconnected
                       state, meaning all outputs — SDA, SCL and the differential pins DSCLP/DSCLM and
                       DSDAP/DSDAM — are in a high-impedance state. As the power supply rises (either
                       power-up or live insertion), the initialization circuit enters a state where the internal
                       references are stabilized and an internal timer is triggered. After 1 ms, power is applied to
                       the rest of the circuitry and the PCA9615 detects the status on the differential
                       DSCLP/DSCLM and DSDAP/DSDAM lines. When the differential lines are detected as
                       connected to a bus with valid termination, that is, both DSCLM/DSDAM < 0.9  VDD(B) and
                       DSCLP/DSDAP > 0.1  VDD(B), another timer is triggered. At the end of 10 ms, hot-swap
                       logic (Figure 2) is enabled and the EN pin can detect a Stop Bit and Bus Idle condition.
                       However, there is still no connection between SDA and DSDAP/DSDAM or between SCL
                       and DSCLP/DSCLM. A successful EN pin sequence must occur for actual connection.
                       When the EN pin is set HIGH and the DSDAP and DSCLP pins have been HIGH for the
                       bus idle time or when both the SCL and SDA pins are HIGH and a STOP condition has
                       been seen on the differential bus (DSDAP/DSDAM and DSCLP/DSCLM pins), a
                       connection is established between the differential and the single-ended buses. Whenever
                       disconnected status is detected or the device is unpowered, the PCA9615 disconnects
                       the single-ended to differential buses, and the hot swap sequence repeats again before
                       the PCA9615 connects SDA to DSDAP/DSDAM and SCL to DSCLP/DSCLM.
                       Remark: Start-up process is the same for both PCA9616PW and PCA9615DP, except
                       that PIDET and READY signals are only available in 16-pin package.

                                                        2-channel multipoint Fm+ dI2C-bus buffer with hot-swap logic
8. Application design-in information
                   8.1 I2C-bus
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the single-ended buffered bus (standard open-drain configuration of the
                       I2C-bus). The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system. The device is
                       designed to work with Standard-mode, Fast-mode and Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus devices in
                       addition to SMBus devices. Standard-mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus and SMBus devices
                       only specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic
                       I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible. When
                       only Fast-mode Plus devices are used, then higher termination currents can be used due
                       to their 30 mA sink capability.
                   8.2 Differential I2C-bus application
                       See Figure 7 through Figure 9.
                       The simple application (Figure 7) shows an existing SMBus/I2C-bus being extended over
                       a section of dI2C-bus transmission line, containing a dedicated twisted pair for SCL and
                       SDA. At one end of the transmission line, a resistor network (R1-R2-R1) terminates the
                       twisted-pair cable and biases D+ positive with respect to D. An identical resistor network
                       at the other end of the transmission line terminates the twisted-pair cable. DC power for
                       each end of the transmission line and the VDD(B) of each PCA9615 bus buffer can be from
                       separate and isolated power supplies, or use the same supply and ground run in separate
                       wires along the same path as the dI2C-bus signal twisted pairs.
                       Telecom category 5 (‘CAT 5’) data cable is well suited for this task, but loose wires may
                       also be used, with a reduction in performance. Assuming VDD(B) is 5 V, and using CAT 5
                       cable, R2 is 120 , R1 is 600 . The parallel combination yields a termination of 100  at
                       each end of the twisted pairs.
                       Either side of the dI2C-bus buffer pair is connected to standard SMBus/I2C buses, which
                       require their own pull-up resistors to VDD(A) of the PCA9615 bus buffers. VDD(A) and VDD(B)
                       can be the same supply, however, making them different voltages enables the PCA9615
                       bus buffers to level translate between the SMBus/I2C-bus and dI2C-bus sections of the
                       bus, or to have different supply voltages and level translate at either end of the dI2C-bus
                       and SMBus/I2C-bus system.
                       For example, the left-hand bus master (and local slave) may operate on a 3.3 V supply
                       and SMBus/I2C-bus while the dI2C-bus transmission lines are at 5 V, and the right-hand
                       slave is operated from a different 3.3 V supply and SMBus/I2C-bus, or even a different bus
                       voltage other than 3.3 V.
                       Depending upon the timing from the system master, clock toggle rates can vary from
                       10 kHz for the SMBus (or less for SMBus/I2C-bus protocol) up to 100 kHz (Standard
                       mode), 400 kHz (Fast mode), or up to 1 MHz (Fast-mode Plus).
                       The bus path is bidirectional. Assume that the left side SMBus/I2C-bus becomes active. A
                       START condition (SDA goes LOW while SDA is HIGH) is sent. This upsets the idle
                       condition on the dI2C-bus section of the bus, because D+ was more positive than D and

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         PCA9615
                                                    2-channel multipoint Fm+ dI2C-bus buffer with hot-swap logic
                   now they are reversed. The right side bus buffer sees the differential lines change polarity
                   and in turn pulls SDA LOW on the SMBus/I2C-bus side of the bus buffer, transmitting the
                   START condition to the slave on that section of the SMBus/I2C-bus.
                   If the data clocked out by the left side master contains a valid address of the right side
                   slave, that slave responds by pulling SDA LOW on the ninth clock. This condition is
                   transmitted across the dI2C-bus section that has now changed flow direction, and
                   received by the left side bus buffer (again, D+ was more positive than D and now they
                   are reversed).
                   This sequence continues until the master sends the STOP condition (SCL HIGH while
                   SDA goes HIGH), placing the active slave (on the right side) back to idle. When idle, the
                   normal SMBus/I2C-bus (both left and right sections) are pulled up by their respective
                   pull-ups. In turn, the dI2C-bus section of the bus rests with D+ more positive than D.
                   The idle condition can be changed by any node on either SMBus/I2C-bus section or an
                   additional dI2C-bus node, if present, on the dI2C-bus section of the system. This allows
                   the existing SMBus/I2C-bus protocol to operate transparently over a mix of SMBus/I2C
                   and dI2C bus segments.
                   Due to the SMBus/I2C-bus handshake protocol (ACK/NACK on the ninth clock pulse), the
                   direction of the SMBus/I2C-bus is reversed often. The ‘time of flight’ for the signals to pass
                   through each bus buffer and for the target slave to respond defines the maximum speed of
                   the bus, regardless of how fast the clock toggles. The dI2C-bus section of the bus requires
                   two additional PCA9615 bus buffers, further delaying the SMBus/I2C-bus traffic. If the
                   dI2C-bus transmission line section is made longer, the bus operates much slower,
                   regardless of the clock toggle speed.
                   It is not necessary to have a ground connection between each end of the dI2C section of
                   the bus. The dI2C-bus receiver responds to reversal of the polarity of the D+ and D
                   signals, and ignores the common-mode voltage that may be present.
                   Ideally, the common-mode voltage is the same at each end of the twisted pairs, and no
                   current flows along the twisted pair when the bus is idle, because the D+ and D dI2C-bus
                   drivers are both high-impedance, the bus is biased by R1-R2-R1 at each end. If the
                   common-mode voltage is not 0 V, current flows along the twisted pair, returning through
                   the common ground or common power supply connection if present.
                   If both ends of the twisted pair are powered by the same VDD(B) supply and one end is
                   remote, there will be a common-mode offset between them. This is ignored by the
                   dI2C-bus receivers, which only respond to the difference between D+ and D.
                   However, a large common-mode offset voltage forces the D+ and D signals out of the
                   range of the receiver, and data are lost. The PCA9615 bus buffers use standard ESD
                   protection networks to protect the external pins, and therefore should not be biased above
                   or below the VDD(B) and VSS pins respectively. This limits the common-mode range to
                   approximately 0.5  VDD(B).
                   DC resistance of the transmission line attenuates the signals, more so over longer
                   distances. The loss of signal amplitude is made up by the gain of the dI2C-bus receiver.
                   There is a limit to how long the dI2C-bus section can be made, as it is necessary for the
                   driver to overcome the bias on the transmission line, in order to signal a polarity change
                   (D+ and D reversal) at the receiver end.

[1]   Times are specified with loads of 1.35 k pull-up resistance and 50 pF load capacitance on the A side, and 50  termination network
      resistance and 50 pF load capacitance on the B side. Different load resistance and capacitance alters the RC time constant, thereby
      changing the propagation delay and transition times.
[2]   Pull-up voltages are VDD(A) on the A side and termination network on the B side.
[3]   Typical values were measured with VDD(A) = 3.3 V at Tamb = 25 C, unless otherwise noted.
[4]   The tPLH delay data from B side to A side is measured at 0 V differential on the B side to 0.5VDD(A) on the A side.
[5]   Typical value measured with VDD(A) = 3.3 V at Tamb = 25 C.
[6]   The proportional delay data from A side to B side is measured at 0.5VDD(A) on the A side to 0 V on the B side.
[7]   The enable pin (EN) should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8
