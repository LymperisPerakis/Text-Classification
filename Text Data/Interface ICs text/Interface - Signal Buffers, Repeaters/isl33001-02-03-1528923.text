The ISL33001, ISL33002, ISL33003 are 2-Channel Bus Buffers
that provide the buffering necessary to extend the bus
                                                                        Features
capacitance beyond the 400pF maximum specified by the I2C               • 2 Channel I2C compatible bi-directional buffer
specification. In addition, the ISL33001, ISL33002, ISL33003            • +2.3VDC to +5.5VDC supply range
feature rise time accelerator circuitry to reduce power
                                                                        • >400kHz operation
consumption from passive bus pull-up resistors and improve
data-rate performance. All devices also include hot swap circuitry      • Bus capacitance buffering
to prevent corruption of the data and clock lines when I2C devices      • Rise time accelerators
are plugged into a live backplane, and the ISL33002 and
ISL33003 add level translation for mixed supply voltage                 • Hot swapping capability
applications. The ISL33001, ISL33002, ISL33003 operate at               • ±6kV Class 3 HBM ESD protection on all pins
supply voltages from +2.3V to +5.5V at a temperature range of           • ±12kV HBM ESD protection on SDA/SCL pins
-40°C to +85°C.

NOTES:
  1. Add “-T*” suffix for tape and reel. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
  2. These Intersil Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte
     tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Intersil
     Pb-free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

NOTES:
  8. The algebraic convention, whereby the most negative value is a minimum and the most positive a maximum, is used in this data sheet.
  9. Parameters with MIN and/or MAX limits are 100% tested at +25°C, unless otherwise specified. Temperature limits established by characterization
     and are not production tested.
10. Typical value determined by design simulations. Parameter not tested.
11. Buffer is in the connected state.
12. ISL33002 and ISL33003 limits established by characterization. Not production tested.
13. If the VCC1 and VCC2 voltages diverge, then the shut down ICC increases on the higher voltage supply.

Because the signals on each side of the buffer rise
independently, the propagation delay can be positive or negative.
If the input side rises slowly relative to the output (i.e., heavy
capacitive loading on the input and light load on the output) then
the propagation delay tPLH is negative. If the output side rises
slowly relative to the input, tPLH is positive.
For high-to-low transitions, there is a finite propagation delay
through the buffer from the time an external low on the input
drives the NMOS output low. This propagation delay will always
be positive because the buffer connect threshold on the falling
edge is below the measurement points of the delay. In addition
to the propagation delay of the buffer, there will be additional
delay from the different capacitive loading of the buffer.
Figures 23 and 24 show how the propagation delay from high-to-
low, tPHL, is affected by VCC and capacitive loading.
The buffer’s propagation delay times for rising and falling edge
signals must be taken into consideration for the timing
requirements of the system. SETUP and HOLD times may need to
be adjusted to take into account excessively long propagation
delay times caused by heavy bus capacitances.
Pull-Up Resistor Selection
While the ISL33001, ISL33002, ISL33003 2-Channel buffers are
designed to improve the rise time of the bus in passive pull-up
systems, proper selection of the pull-up resistor is critical for
system operation when a buffer is used. For a bus that is
operating normally without active rise time circuitry, using the
ISL33001, ISL33002, ISL33003 buffer allows larger pull-up
resistor values to reduce sink currents when the bus is driving
low. However, choose a pull-up resistor value of no larger than
20kΩ regardless of the bus capacitance seen on the SDA/SCL
lines. The Bus Idle or Stop Bit condition requires valid logic high
voltages to give a valid connection state. Pull-up resistor values
20kΩ or smaller are recommended to overcome the typical
150kΩ impedance of the pre-charge circuitry, delivering valid
high levels.

           DATE                   REVISION                                                       CHANGE
      July 11, 2014              FN7560.6        In “Features” on page 1, changed “Low quiescent Current” from “2.2mA” to “2.1mA”.
                                                 On page 4, added “Pb-Free Reflow Profile” entry to “Thermal Info” section.
                                                 In “Electrical Spec” table on page 4, changed “VCC” to “VCC1” in the “Supply Current from VCC2” row.
                                                 In “Electrical Spec” table on page 5, for parameter “Input Low Threshold”, moved the “TYP” column
                                                 entry to the “MAX” column.
                                                 On page 6, Figure 4, clarified the associated notes.
                                                 On page 7, Figure 8, changed “IACC” to ITRAN_ACC”, and noted that the V/t is for the accelerator
                                                 portion of the waveform.
   December 19, 2013             FN7560.5        Added Note 13 at the end of the "Elec Spec" table on page 5 as follows:
                                                 “13. If the Vcc1 and Vcc2 voltages diverge, then the shut-down Icc increases on the higher voltage
                                                 supply."
                                                 Added reference "(Note 13)" after "ISL33003 only" in rows for Vcc1 and Vcc2 "Shut-down Supply
                                                 current" parameters (last 2 rows of "Power Supplies" section) on page 4.
    October 12, 2012             FN7560.4        Changed “SDA_IN, SCL_IN...0.3V to +(VCC1 + 0.3)V, SDA_OUT, SCL_OUT...0.3V to +(VCC2 + 0.3)V,
                                                 ENABLE, READY, ACC...0.3V to +(VCC1 + 0.3)V” to “SDA_IN, SCL_IN, SDA_OUT, SCL_OUT, READY...0.3V
                                                 to +7V; ENABLE, ACC...0.3V to +(VCC1 + 0.3)V”, in the Absolute Maximum Ratings section at the top of
                                                 page 4.
                                                 Removed “Pb-free Reflow Profile” and link from “Thermal Information” section at the top of page 4.
                                                 Added “open drain” and “Connect to 10kΩ pull-up resistor to VCC1.”, in Pin Descriptions in the READY
                                                 section on page 3.
    October 11, 2011             FN7560.3        Converted to new datasheet template.
                                                 Changed Title of datasheet from: “2-Wire Bus Buffer With Rise Time Accelerators and Hot Swap
                                                 Capability”
                                                 to: I2C Bus Buffer with Rise Time Accelerators and Hot Swap Capability
                                                 Pg 1, added to Related Literature: AN1637, “Level Shifting Between 1.8V and 3.3V Using I2C Buffers”
                                                 Replaced POD M8.118 Rev 3 with Rev 4 due to the following changes:
                                                 Corrected lead width dimension in side view 1 from "0.25 - 0.036" to "0.25 - 0.36"

                                                 and replaced graph
  September 13, 2010             FN7560.2        Added SOIC package information to datasheet for ISL33001.
      April 30, 2010             FN7560.1        Changed typical value of “Supply Current from VCC1” on page 4 for ISL33001 only from 2.2mA to
                                                 2.1mA.
                                                 Changed typical value of “Input-Output Offset Voltage” on page 5 from 100mV to 50mV.
