PI3EQX7841
5.0Gbps, 1-port, USB3.0 ReDriver with I2C Programming Interface
Description                                                              Features
Diodes’ PI3EQX7841 is a low power, high performance 5.0                     ÎÎUSB 3.0 compatible
Gbps signal ReDriver™ designed specifically for the USB 3.0                 ÎÎTwo 5.0Gbps differential signal pairs

user’s platform. The integrated equalization circuitry provides             ÎÎIndustrial Temp Support -40°C~      +85°C
flexibility with signal integrity of the signal before the ReDriver.        ÎÎAuto "Slumber" mode for adaptive power management
A low-level input signal detection and output squelch function is           ÎÎStand-by Mode – Power Down State
provided for each channel.                                                  ÎÎSingle Supply Voltage: 3.3V±10%
When the channels are enabled, EN# = 0, and operating, that chan-           ÎÎPackaging: 20-Pin TQFN (4x4mm)

active. If the input signal level of the channel falls below the active
threshold level (Vth-) then the outputs are driven to the common          Application Diagram
mode voltage. In addition to signal conditioning, when EN# = 1, the
device enters a low power standby mode. The PI3EQX7841 also
includes a fully programmable I2C interface. When I2C control
mode is enabled, I2C_EN = 1, equalization, output swing, and
