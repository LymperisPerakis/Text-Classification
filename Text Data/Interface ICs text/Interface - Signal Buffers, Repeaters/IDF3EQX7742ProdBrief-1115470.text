PI3EQX7742
5.0 Gbps, 2-port, (4-Channel) USB 3.0 ReDriver™ with Digital Configuration
Pericom Semiconductor’s PI3EQX7742 is a low power, high
performance 5.0 Gbps signal ReDriver™ designed specifically             Features
for the USB 3.0 protocol. The device provides programmable
                                                                        • USB 3.0 compatible
equalization, De-Emphasis, and input threshold controls to
optimize performance over a variety of physical mediums by              • Four 5.0 Gbps differential signal pairs
reducing Inter-Symbol Interference. PI3EQX7742 supports four            • Adjustable Receiver Equalization

the device enters a low power standby mode.  The PI3EQX7742
also includes a fully programmable receiver detect function.         Figure1
When the RxDet pin is pulled high, automatic receiver detection
will be active.  The device will then move to power down due
to inactivity.                                                                                                             External
