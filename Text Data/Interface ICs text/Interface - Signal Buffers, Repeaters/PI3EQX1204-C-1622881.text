Description of Operation
Power Enable function:
One pin control or I2C control, when PRSNT# is set to HIGH, the IC goes into power down mode, both input and output
termination set to 200K and High impedance respectively. Individual Channel Enabling is done through the I2C register
programming.
Equalization Setting:
EQ[3:0] are the selection pins for the equalization selection for each channel.

Reset and I2CM Timing Diagram
I2C Operation
The integrated I2C interface operates as a master or slave device depending on the pin ENI2C being HIZ or HIGH respectively.
Standard mode (100Kbps) is supported with 7-bit addressing. The data byte format is 8-bit bytes, and supports the format of index-
ing to be compatible with other bus devices. In the Slave mode (ENI2C = HIGH), the device supports Read/Write. The bytes must be
accessed in sequential order from the lowest to the highest byte with the ability to stop after any complete byte has been transferred.
Address bits A3 to A0 are programmable to support multiple chips environment. The Data is loaded until a Stop sequence is issued.
In the master mode (ENI2C = HIZ), PI3EQX1204-C supports up to 16 masters connected in daisy chain through connecting I2C_
DONE pin to I2C_RESET# pin of the next part.

Transferring Data
Every byte put on the SDA line must be 8-bits long. Each byte has to be followed by an acknowledge bit. Data is transferred with the
most significant bit (MSB) first (see the I2C Data Transfer diagram). The PI3EQX1204-C will never hold the clock line SCL LOW to
force the master into a wait state.
Acknowledge
Data transfer with acknowledge is required from the master. When the master releases the SDA line (HIGH) during the acknowledge
clock pulse, the PI3EQX1204-C will pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so that it remains stable LOW
during the HIGH period of this clock pulse as indicated in the I2C Data Transfer diagram. The PI3EQX1204-C will generate an
acknowledge after each byte has been received.
Data Transfer
A data transfer cycle begins with the master issuing a start bit. After recognizing a start bit, the PI3EQX1204-C will watch the next
byte of information for a match with its address setting. When a match is found it will respond with a read or write of data on the
following clocks. Each byte must be followed by an acknowledge bit, except for the last byte of a read cycle which ends with a stop
bit. For a write cycle, the first data byte following the address byte is an index byte that is used by the PI3EQX1204-C. Data is trans-
ferred with the most significant bit (MSB) first.
I2C Data Transfer
Start & Stop Conditions
A HIGH to LOW transition on the SDA line while SCL is HIGH indicates a START condition. A LOW to HIGH transition on the
SDA line while SCL is HIGH defines a STOP condition, as shown in the figure below
