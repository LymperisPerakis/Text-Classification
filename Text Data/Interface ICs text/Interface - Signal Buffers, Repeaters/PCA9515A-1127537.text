                  I2C-bus repeater
                  Rev. 5 — 23 March 2012                                                Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9515A is a CMOS integrated circuit intended for application in I2C-bus and
              SMBus systems.
              While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system, it permits
              extension of the I2C-bus by buffering both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus
              enabling two buses of 400 pF.
              The I2C-bus capacitance limit of 400 pF restricts the number of devices and bus length.
              Using the PCA9515A enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus, thus
              more devices or longer length can be accommodated. It can also be used to run two
              buses, one at 5 V and the other at 3.3 V or a 400 kHz and 100 kHz bus, where the
              100 kHz bus is isolated when 400 kHz operation of the other is required.
              Two or more PCA9515As cannot be put in series. The PCA9515A design does not
              allow this configuration. Since there is no direction pin, slightly different ‘legal’ low voltage
              levels are used to avoid lock-up conditions between the input and the output. A ‘regular
              LOW’ applied at the input of a PCA9515A will be propagated as a ‘buffered LOW’ with a
              slightly higher value. When this ‘buffered LOW’ is applied to another PCA9515A,
              PCA9516A or PCA9518/A in series, the second PCA9515A, PCA9516A or PCA9518/A
              will not recognize it as a ‘regular LOW’ and will not propagate it as a ‘buffered LOW’ again.
              The PCA9510/A, PCA9511/A, PCA9512/A, PCA9513/A, PCA9514/A cannot be used in
              series with the PCA9515A, PCA9516A or PCA9518/A, but can be used in series with
              themselves since they use shifting instead of static offsets to avoid lock-up conditions.
              The output pull-down of each internal buffer is set for approximately 0.5 V, while the input
              threshold of each internal buffer is set about 0.07 V lower, when the output is internally
              driven LOW. This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring.

                       The PCA9515A integrated circuit contains two identical buffer circuits which enable
                       I2C-bus and similar bus systems to be extended without degradation of system
                       performance.
                       The PCA9515A contains two bidirectional, open-drain buffers specifically designed to
                       support the standard LOW-level contention arbitration of the I2C-bus. Except during
                       arbitration or clock stretching, the PCA9515A acts like a pair of non-inverting, open-drain
                       buffers, one for SDA and one for SCL.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with an internal pull-up and allows the user to select when the
                       repeater is active. This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until
                       after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation
                       because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus and enabling part way through
                       a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
                       The enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in
                       an idle state to prevent system failures.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater
                       must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard-mode and
                       Fast-mode I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus
                       devices only specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a
                       generic I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible.
                       Under certain conditions higher termination currents can be used.
                       Please see Application Note AN255, I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders for
                       additional information on sizing resistors and precautions when using more than one
                       PCA9515A/PCA9516A in a system or using the PCA9515A/PCA9516A in conjunction
                       with the P82B96.

7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 5. In this example, the system master is running
                   on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 5 V bus. Both buses run at 100 kHz
                   unless the slave bus is isolated and then the master bus can run at 400 kHz. Master
                   devices can be placed on either bus.
                                                                  3.3 V                                                 5V

                                                                                                                                   002aad739
                     Fig 5.   Typical application
                   The PCA9515A is 5 V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                   between the different bus voltages.
                   When one side of the PCA9515A is pulled LOW by a device on the I2C-bus, a CMOS
                   hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes the internal driver on the other
                   side to turn on, thus causing the other side to also go LOW. The side driven LOW by the
                   PCA9515A will typically be at VOL = 0.5 V.
                   In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 6 and
                   Figure 7. If the bus master in Figure 5 were to write to the slave through the PCA9515A,
                   we would see the waveform shown in Figure 6 on bus 0. This looks like a normal I2C-bus
                   transmission until the falling edge of the eighth clock pulse. At that point, the master
                   releases the data line (SDA) while the slave pulls it LOW through the PCA9515A.
                   Because the VOL of the PCA9515A is typically round 0.5 V, a step in the SDA will be seen.
                   After the master has transmitted the ninth clock pulse, the slave releases the data line.
                   On the bus 1 side of the PCA9515A, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset
                   from ground equal to the VOL of the PCA9515A. After the eighth clock pulse the data line
                   will be pulled to the VOL of the slave device, which is very close to ground in this example.
                   It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events on bus 1 require that
                   the VOL of the PCA9515A (see VOLVILc in Section 9 “Static characteristics”) to be
                   recognized by the PCA9515A and then transmitted to bus 0.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 13.
