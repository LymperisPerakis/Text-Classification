Termination Detect Feature:
Termination Detect is a power saving feature. The user can enable TDet_EN (set to High) for eSATA application as it would save
more power when there is no external HDD connection. But for internal SATA application, TDet_EN should be set to LOW because
internal HDD is always on and termination is always there.
When Redriver doesn’t detect Host or HDD termination, there will be about 12us detect pulse width with 50us detect period at
the output of ReDriver. Once the termination is detected, the detect period will change to about 40ms. Anyway when the signal is
detected at the input of redriver, there will not be any detect pulse at both the output side of redriver.
