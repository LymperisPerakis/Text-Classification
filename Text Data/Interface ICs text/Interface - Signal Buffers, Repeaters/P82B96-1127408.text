                 Dual bidirectional bus buffer
                 Rev. 08 — 10 November 2009                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
             The P82B96 is a bipolar IC that creates a non-latching, bidirectional, logic interface
             between the normal I2C-bus and a range of other bus configurations. It can interface
             I2C-bus logic signals to similar buses having different voltage and current levels.
             For example, it can interface to the 350 µA SMBus, to 3.3 V logic devices, and to 15 V
             levels and/or low-impedance lines to improve noise immunity on longer bus lengths.
             It achieves this interface without any restrictions on the normal I2C-bus protocols or clock
             speed. The IC adds minimal loading to the I2C-bus node, and loadings of the new bus or
             remote I2C-bus nodes are not transmitted or transformed to the local node. Restrictions
             on the number of I2C-bus devices in a system, or the physical separation between them,
             are virtually eliminated. Transmitting SDA and SCL signals via balanced transmission
             lines (twisted pairs) or with galvanic isolation (opto-coupling) is simple because separate
             directional Tx and Rx signals are provided. The Tx and Rx signals may be directly
             connected, without causing latching, to provide an alternative bidirectional signal line with
             I2C-bus properties.

7. Functional description
                   Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of P82B96”.
                   The P82B96 has two identical buffers allowing buffering of both of the I2C-bus (SDA and
                   SCL) signals. Each buffer is made up of two logic signal paths, a forward path from the
                   I2C-bus interface pin which drives the buffered bus, and a reverse signal path from the
                   buffered bus input to drive the I2C-bus interface. Thus these paths are:
                      • sense the voltage state of the I2C-bus pin Sx (or Sy) and transmit this state to the pin
                        Tx (Ty respectively), and
                      • sense the state of the pin Rx (Ry) and pull the I2C-bus pin LOW whenever Rx (Ry) is
                        LOW.
                   The rest of this discussion will address only the ‘x’ side of the buffer; the ‘y’ side is
                   identical.
                   The I2C-bus pin (Sx) is designed to interface with a normal I2C-bus.
                   The logic threshold voltage levels on the I2C-bus are independent of the IC supply VCC.
                   The maximum I2C-bus supply voltage is 15 V and the guaranteed static sink current is
                   3 mA.
                   The logic level of Rx is determined from the power supply voltage VCC of the chip. Logic
                   LOW is below 42 % of VCC, and logic HIGH is above 58 % of VCC (with a typical switching
                   threshold of half VCC).
                   Tx is an open-collector output without ESD protection diodes to VCC. It may be connected
                   via a pull-up resistor to a supply voltage in excess of VCC, as long as the 15 V rating is not
                   exceeded. It has a larger current sinking capability than a normal I2C-bus device, being
                   able to sink a static current of greater than 30 mA, and typical 100 mA dynamic pull-down
                   capability as well.
                   A logic LOW is only transmitted to Tx when the voltage at the I2C-bus pin (Sx) is below
                   0.6 V. A logic LOW at Rx will cause the I2C-bus (Sx) to be pulled to a logic LOW level in
                   accordance with I2C-bus requirements (maximum 1.5 V in 5 V applications) but not low
                   enough to be looped back to the Tx output and cause the buffer to latch LOW.
                   The minimum LOW level this chip can achieve on the I2C-bus by a LOW at Rx is typically
                   0.8 V.
                   If the supply voltage VCC fails, then neither the I2C-bus nor the Tx output will be held LOW.
                   Their open-collector configuration allows them to be pulled up to the rated maximum of
                   15 V even without VCC present. The input configuration on Sx and Rx also present no
                   loading of external signals even when VCC is not present.
                   The effective input capacitance of any signal pin, measured by its effect on bus rise times,
                   is less than 7 pF for all bus voltages and supply voltages including VCC = 0 V.
                   Remark: Two or more Sx or Sy I/Os must not be interconnected. The P82B96 design
                   does not support this configuration. Bidirectional I2C-bus signals do not allow any
                   direction control pin so, instead, slightly different logic low voltage levels are used at Sx/Sy

                   special ‘buffered LOW’ is applied to the Sx/Sy of another P82B96 that second P82B96 will
                   not recognize it as a ‘regular I2C-bus LOW’ and will not propagate it to its Tx/Ty output.
                   The Sx/Sy side of P82B96 may not be connected to similar buffers that rely on special
                   logic thresholds for their operation, for example PCA9511, PCA9515, or PCA9518. The
                   Sx/Sy side is only intended for, and compatible with, the normal I2C-bus logic voltage
                   levels of I2C-bus master and slave chips, or even Tx/Rx signals of a second P82B96 if
                   required. The Tx/Rx and Ty/Ry I/O pins use the standard I2C-bus logic voltage levels of all
                   I2C-bus parts. There are no restrictions on the interconnection of the Tx/Rx and Ty/Ry I/O
                   pins to other P82B96s, for example in a star or multipoint configuration with the Tx/Rx and
                   Ty/Ry I/O pins on the common bus and the Sx/Sy side connected to the line card slave
                   devices. For more details see Application Note AN255.

[1]    Limit data for +125 °C applies to P82B96TD/S900 version. It is guaranteed by design/characterization, but not by 100 % test.
[2]    The minimum value requirement for pull-up current, 200 µA, guarantees that the minimum value for VSx output LOW will always exceed
       the minimum VSx input HIGH level to eliminate any possibility of latching. The specified difference is guaranteed by design within any IC.
       While the tolerances on absolute levels allow a small probability the LOW from one Sx output is recognized by an Sx input of another
       P82B96, this has no consequences for normal applications. In any design the Sx pins of different ICs should never be linked because
       the resulting system would be very susceptible to induced noise and would not support all I2C-bus operating modes.
[3]    The output logic LOW depends on the sink current. For scaling, see Application Note AN255.
[4]    The input logic threshold is independent of the supply voltage.
[5]    The fall time of VTx from 5 V to 2.5 V in the test is approximately 15 ns.
       The fall time of VSx from 5 V to 2.5 V in the test is approximately 50 ns.
       The rise time of VTx from 0 V to 2.5 V in the test is approximately 20 ns.
       The rise time of VSx from 0.9 V to 2.5 V in the test is approximately 70 ns.

                                                                                                  Dual bidirectional bus buffer
                   Figure 13 shows how a master I2C-bus can be protected against short circuits or failures
                   in applications that involve plug and socket connections and long cables that may become
                   damaged. A simple circuit is added to monitor the SDA bus, and if its LOW time exceeds
                   the design value, then the master bus is disconnected. P82B96 will free all its I/Os if its
                   supply is removed, so one option is to connect its VCC to the output of a logic gate from,
                   say, the 74LVC family. The SDA and SCL lines could be timed and VCC disabled via the
                   gate if one or other lines exceeds a design value of ‘LOW’ period as in Figure 28 of
                   AN255. If the supply voltage of logic gates restricts the choice of VCC supply then the
                   low-cost discrete circuit in Figure 13 can be used. If the SDA line is held LOW, the 100 nF
                   capacitor will charge and the Ry input will be pulled towards VCC. When it exceeds 0.5VCC
                   the Ry input will set the Sy input HIGH, which in practice means simply releasing it.
                   In this example the SCL line is made unidirectional by tying the Rx pin to VCC. The state of
                   the buffered SCL line cannot affect the master clock line which is allowed when
                   clock-stretching is not required. It is simple to add an additional transistor or diode to
                   control the Rx input in the same way as Ry when necessary. The +V cable drive can be
                   any voltage up to 15 V and the bus may be run at a lower impedance by selecting pull-up
                   resistors for a static sink current up to 30 mA. VCC1 and VCC2 may be chosen to suit the
                   connected devices. Because DDC uses relatively low speeds (< 100 kHz), the cable
                   length is not restricted to 20 m by the I2C-bus signalling, but it may be limited by the video
                   signalling.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                P82B96
                                                                                  Dual bidirectional bus buffer
                   Figure 14 shows that P82B96 can achieve high clock rates over long cables. While
                   calculating with lumped wiring capacitance yields reasonable approximations to actual
                   timing, even 25 meters of cable is better treated using transmission line theory. Flat ribbon
                   cables connected as shown, with the bus signals on the outer edge, will have a
                   characteristic impedance in the range 100 Ω to 200 Ω. For simplicity they cannot be
                   terminated in their characteristic impedance but a practical compromise is to use the
                   minimum pull-up allowed for P82B96 and place half this termination at each end of the
                   cable. When each pull-up is below 330 Ω, the rising edge waveforms have their first
                   voltage ‘step’ level above the logic threshold at Rx and cable timing calculations can be
                   based on the fast rise/fall times of resistive loading plus simple one-way propagation
                   delays. When the pull-up is larger, but below 750 Ω, the threshold at Rx will be crossed
                   after one signal reflection. So at the sending end it is crossed after 2 times the one-way
                   propagation delay and at the receiving end after 3 times that propagation delay. For flat
                   cables with partial plastic dielectric insulation (by using outer cores) the one-way
                   propagation delays will be about 5 ns per meter. The 10 % to 90 % rise and fall times on
                   the cable will be between 20 ns and 50 ns, so their delay contributions are small. There
                   will be ringing on falling edges that can be damped, if required, by using Schottky diodes
                   as shown.
                   When the Master SCL HIGH and LOW periods can be programmed separately, for
                   example using control registers I2SCLH and I2SCLL of 89LPC932, the timings can allow
                   for bus delays. The LOW period should be programmed to achieve the minimum 1300 ns
                   plus the net delay in the slave's response data signal caused by bus and buffer delays.
                   The longest data delay is the sum of the delay of the falling edge of SCL from master to
                   slave and the delay of the rising edge of SDA from slave data to master. Because the
                   buffer will ‘stretch’ the programmed SCL LOW period, the actual SCL frequency will be
                   lower than calculated from the programmed clock periods. In the example for 25 meters
                   the clock is stretched 400 ns, the falling edge of SCL is delayed 490 ns and the SDA rising
                   edge is delayed 570 ns. The required additional LOW period is
                   (490 ns + 570 ns) = 1060 ns and the I2C-bus specifications already include an allowance
                   for a worst case bus rise time 0 % to 70 % of 425 ns. (The bus rise time can be 300 ns
                   30 % to 70 %, which means it can be 425 ns 0 % to 70 %. The 25 meter cable delay times
                   as quoted already include all rise and fall times.) Therefore, the microcontroller only needs
                   to be programmed with an additional (1060 ns − 400 ns − 425 ns) = 235 ns, making a
                   total programmed LOW period 1535 ns. The programmed LOW will the be stretched by
                   400 ns to yield an actual bus LOW time of 1935 ns, which, allowing the minimum HIGH
                   period of 600 ns, yields a cycle period of 2535 ns or 394 kHz.
                   Note that in both the 100 meter and 250 meter examples, the capacitive loading on the
                   I2C-buses at each end is within the maximum allowed Standard mode loading of 400 pF,
                   but exceeds the Fast mode limit. This is an example of a ‘hybrid’ mode because it relies on
                   the response delays of Fast mode parts but uses (allowable) Standard mode bus loadings
                   with rise times that contribute significantly to the system delays. The cables cause large
                   propagation delays, so these systems need to operate well below the 400 kHz limit, but
                   illustrate how they can still exceed the 100 kHz limit provided all parts are capable of
                   Fast mode operation. The fastest example illustrates how the 400 kHz limit can be
                   exceeded, provided masters and slaves have the required timings, namely smaller than
                   the maximum allowed for Fast mode. Many NXP slaves have delays shorter than 600 ns

  Fig 17. Rising edge of SDA at slave is delayed by the buffers and bus rise times
                             Figure 15, Figure 16, and Figure 17 show the P82B96 used to drive extended bus wiring,
                             with relatively large capacitance, linking two Fast mode I2C-bus nodes. It includes
                             simplified expressions for making the relevant timing calculations for 3.3 V or 5 V
                             operation. Because the buffers and the wiring introduce timing delays, it may be
                             necessary to decrease the nominal SCL frequency below 400 kHz. In most cases the
                             actual bus frequency will be lower than the nominal Master timing due to bit-wise
                             stretching of the clock periods.
                             The delay factors involved in calculation of the allowed bus speed are:
                             A — The propagation delay of the master signal through the buffers and wiring to the
                             slave. The important delay is that of the falling edge of SCL because this edge ‘requests’
                             the data or acknowledge from a slave. See Figure 15.
                             B — The effective stretching of the nominal LOW period of SCL at the master caused by
                             the buffer and bus rise times. See Figure 16.
                             C — The propagation delay of the slave's response signal through the buffers and wiring
                             back to the master. The important delay is that of a rising edge in the SDA signal. Rising
                             edges are always slower and are therefore delayed by a longer time than falling edges.
                             (The rising edges are limited by the passive pull-up while falling edges are actively driven).
                             See Figure 17.
                             The timing requirement in any I2C-bus system is that a slave's data response (which is
                             provided in response to a falling edge of SCL) must be received at the master before the
                             end of the corresponding LOW period of SCL as appears on the bus wiring at the master.
                             Since all slaves will, as a minimum, satisfy the worst case timing requirements of a
                             400 kHz part, they must provide their response within the minimum allowed clock LOW
                             period of 1300 ns. Therefore in systems that introduce additional delays it is only
                             necessary to extend that minimum clock LOW period by any ‘effective’ delay of the slave's
                             response. The effective delay of the slaves response equals the total delays in SCL falling

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                        P82B96
                                                                                                      Dual bidirectional bus buffer
                            edge from the master reaching the slave (Figure 15) minus the effective delay (stretch) of
                            the SCL rising edge (Figure 16) plus total delays in the slave's response data, carried on
                            SDA, reaching the master (Figure 17).
                            The master microcontroller should be programmed to produce a nominal SCL LOW
                            period = (1300 + A − B + C) ns, and should be programmed to produce the nominal
                            minimum SCL HIGH period of 600 ns. Then a check should be made to ensure the cycle
                            time is not shorter than the minimum 2500 ns. If found necessary, just increase either
                            clock period.
                            Due to clock stretching, the SCL cycle time will always be longer than
                            (600 + 1300 + A + C) ns.
                            Example:
                               The master bus has an RmCm product of 100 ns and VCCM = 5 V.
                               The buffered bus has a capacitance of 1 nF and a pull-up resistor of 160 Ω to 5 V giving
                               an RbCb product of 160 ns. The slave bus also has an RsCs product of 100 ns.
                               The microcontroller LOW period should be programmed to
                               ≥ (1300 + 372.5 − 482 + 472) ns, that is ≥ 1662.5 ns.
                               Its HIGH period may be programmed to the minimum 600 ns.
                               The nominal microcontroller clock period will be ≥ (1662.5 + 600) ns = 2262.5 ns,
                               equivalent to a frequency of 442 kHz.
                               The actual bus clock period, including the 482 ns clock stretch effect, will be below
                               (nominal + stretch) = (2262.5 + 482) ns or ≥ 2745 ns, equivalent to an allowable
                               frequency of 364 kHz.

                             The reason why the IC pin reverse voltage on pins Tx and Rx in Table 4 “Limiting values”
                             is specified at such a low value, −0.3 V, is not that applying larger voltages is likely to
                             cause damage but that it is expected that, in normal applications, there is no reason why
                             larger DC voltages will be applied. This ‘absolute maximum’ specification is intended to be
                             a DC or continuous ratings and the nominal DC I2C-bus voltage LOW usually does not
                             even reach 0 V. Inside P82B96 at every pin there is a large protective diode connected to
                             the GND pin and that diode will start to conduct when the pin voltage is more than about
                             −0.55 V with respect to GND at 25 °C ambient.
                             Figure 21 shows the measured characteristic for one of those diodes inside P82B96. The
                             plot was made using a curve tracer that applies 50 Hz mains voltage via a series resistor,
                             so the pulse durations are long duration (several milliseconds) and are reaching peaks of
                             over 2 A when more than −1.5 V is applied. The IC becomes very hot during this testing
                             but it was not damaged. Whenever there is current flowing in any of these diodes it is
                             possible that there can be faulty operation of any IC. For that reason we put a specification
                             on the negative voltage that is allowed to be applied. It is selected so that, at the highest
                             allowed junction temperature, there will be a big safety factor that guarantees the diode
                             will not conduct and then we do not need to make any 100 % production tests to
                             guarantee the published specification.
                             For the P82B96, in specific applications, there will always be transient overshoot and
                             ringing on the wiring that can cause these diodes to conduct. Therefore we designed the
                             IC to withstand those transients and as a part of the qualification procedure we made
                             tests, using DC currents to more than twice the normal bus sink currents, to be sure that
                             the IC was not affected by those currents. For example, the Tx/Ty and Rx/Ry pins were
                             tested to at least −80 mA which, from Figure 21, would be more than −0.8 V. The correct
                             functioning of the P82B96 is not affected even by those large currents. The Absolute
                             Maximum (DC) ratings are not intended to apply to transients but to steady state
                             conditions. This explains why you will never see any problems in practice even if, during
                             transients, more than −0.3 V is applied to the bus interface pins of P82B96.

                   Figure 21 “Diode characteristic curve” also explains how the general Absolute Maximum
                   DC specification was selected. The current at 25 °C is near zero at −0.55 V. The P82B96
                   is allowed to operate with +125 °C junction and that would cause this diode voltage to
                   decrease by 100 × 2 mV = 200 mV. So for zero current we need to specify −0.35 V and we
                   publish −0.3 V just to have some extra margin.
                   Remark: You should not be concerned about the transients generated on the wiring by a
                   P82B96 in normal applications and that is input to the Tx/Rx or Ty/Ry pins of another
                   P82B96. Because not all ICs that may be driven by P82B96 are designed to tolerate
                   negative transients, in Section 10.2.1 “Example with questions and answers” we show
                   they can be managed if required.

               10.2.1 Example with questions and answers
                        Question: On a falling edge of Tx we measure undershoot at −800 mV at the linked Tx,
                        Rx pins of the P82B96 that is generating the LOW, but the P82B96 data sheet specifies
                        minimum −0.3 V. Does this mean that we violate the data sheet absolute value?
                        Answer: For P82B96 the −0.3 V Absolute Maximum rating is not intended to apply to
                        transients, it is a DC rating. As shown in Figure 22, there is no theoretical reason for any
                        undershoot at the IC that is driving the bus LOW and no significant undershoot should
                        be observed when using reasonable care with the ground connection of the ‘scope. It is
                        more likely that undershoot observed at a driving P82B96 is caused by local stray
                        inductance and capacitance in the circuit and by the oscilloscope connections. As
                        shown, undershoot will be generated by PCB traces, wiring, or cables driven by a
                        P82B96 because the allowed value of the I2C-bus pull-up resistor generally is larger
                        than that required to correctly terminate the wiring. In this example, with no IC
                        connected at the end of the wiring, the undershoot is about 2 V.

                    Question: We have 2 meters of cable in a bus that joins the Tx/Rx sides of two P82B96
                    devices. When one Tx drives LOW the other P82B96 Tx/Rx is driven to −0.8 V for over
                    50 ns. What is the expected value and the theoretically allowed value of undershoot?
                    Answer: Because the cable joining the two P82B96s is a ‘transmission line’ that will
                    have a characteristic impedance around 100 Ω and it will be terminated by pull-up
                    resistors that are larger than that characteristic impedance there will always be negative
                    undershoot generated. The duration of the undershoot is a function of the cable length
                    and the input impedance of the connected IC. As shown in Figure 23, the transient
                    undershoot will be limited, by the diodes inside P82B96, to around −0.8 V and that will
                    not cause problems for P82B96. Those transients will not be passed inside the IC to the
                    Sx/Sy side of the IC.

                    Question: If we input 800 mV undershoot at Tx, Rx pins, what kind of problem is
                    expected?
                    Answer: When that undershoot is generated by another P82B96 and is simply the
                    result of the system wiring, then there will be no problems.
                    Question: Will we have any functional problem or reliability problem?
                    Answer: No.

                    Question: If we add 100 Ω to 200 Ω at signal line, the overshoot becomes slightly
                    smaller. Is this a good idea?
                    Answer: No, it is not necessary to add any resistance. When the logic signal generated

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 28) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 28.

13. Soldering of through-hole mount packages
                13.1 Introduction to soldering through-hole mount packages
                     This text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.
                     Wave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages
                     on a printed-circuit board.
                13.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave
                     Driven by legislation and environmental forces the worldwide use of lead-free solder
                     pastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from
                     3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 °C or 265 °C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb
                     or Pb-free respectively.
                     The total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.
                     The device may be mounted up to the seating plane, but the temperature of the plastic
                     body must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (Tstg(max)). If the
                     printed-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately
                     after soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.
                13.3 Manual soldering
                     Apply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the
                     seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If the temperature of the soldering iron bit is
                     less than 300 °C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is
                     between 300 °C and 400 °C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.
