1. General description
             The PCA9508 is a CMOS integrated circuit that supports hot-swap with zero offset and
             provides level shifting between low voltage (down to 0.9 V) and higher voltage (2.7 V to
             5.5 V) for I2C-bus or SMBus applications. While retaining all the operating modes and
             features of the I2C-bus system during the level shifts, it also permits extension of the
             I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL)
             lines, thus enabling two buses of 400 pF. Using the PCA9508 enables the system
             designer to isolate two halves of a bus for both voltage and capacitance, and perform
             hot-swap and voltage level translation. Furthermore, the dual supply pins can be powered
             up in any sequence; when any of the supply pins are unpowered, the 5 V tolerant I/O are
             high-impedance.
             The hot swap feature allows an I/O card to be inserted into a live backplane without
             corrupting the data and clock buses. Control circuitry prevents the backplane from being
             connected to the card until a stop command or bus idle occurs on the backplane without
             bus contention on the card. Zero offset output voltage allows multiple PCA9508s to be put
             in series and still maintains an excellent noise margin.
             PCA9508 has B side and A side bus drivers. The 2.7 V to 5.5 V bus B side drivers behave
             much like the drivers on the PCA9515A device, while the adjustable voltage bus A side
             drivers drive more current and incur no static offset voltage. This results in a LOW on the
             B side translating into a nearly 0 V LOW on the A side.
             The static offset design of the B side PCA9508 I/O drivers prevents them from being
             connected to another device that has a rise time accelerator including the PCA9510/A,
             PCA9511/A, PCA9512/A, PCA9513/A, or PCA9514/A or a static offset voltage including
             the PCA9507 (B side), PCA9508 (B side), PCA9509 (A side), PCA9515/A, PCA9516A,
             PCA9517/A (B side), PCA9518, PCA9519 (A side), or P82B96/PCA9600 (Sx/Sy side).
             The A side of two or more PCA9508s can be connected together, however, to allow a star
             topology with the A side on the common bus, and the A side can be connected directly to
             any other buffer with static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple PCA9508s can be
             connected in series, A side to B side, with no build-up in offset voltage with only
             time-of-flight delays to consider.
             The PCA9508 drivers are not enabled unless the bus is idle, VCC(A) is above 0.8 V and
             VCC(B) is above 2.5 V. The EN pin can also be used to turn the drivers on and off under
             system control. Caution should be observed to only change the state of the enable pin
             when the bus is idle.
             The output pull-down on the B side internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.5 V,
             while the input threshold of the internal buffer is set about 70 mV lower (0.43 V). When the
             B side I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input.

                   This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring. The output pull-down on the A side
                   drives a hard LOW and the input level is set at 0.5VCC(A) to accommodate the need for a
                   lower LOW level in systems where the low voltage side supply voltage is as low as 0.9 V.

6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9508”.
                       The PCA9508 enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.9 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9508 contains two bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to provide superior hot-swap and/or support
                       up-translation/down-translation between the low voltage (as low as 0.9 V) and a 3.3 V or
                       5 V I2C-bus or SMBus. All inputs and I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the
                       device is unpowered (VCC(B) and/or VCC(A) = 0 V). The PCA9508 includes a power-up
                       circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until VCC(B) is above 2.5 V and the VCC(A) is
                       above 0.8 V. VCC(B) and VCC(A) can be applied in any sequence at power-up. VCC(A) is only
                       used to provide the 0.5VCC(A) reference to the A side input comparators and for the power
                       good detect circuit. The PCA9508 logic and all I/Os are powered by the VCC(B) pin.
                       An undervoltage/initialization circuit holds the PCA9508 in a disconnected state which
                       presents high-impedance to all SDA and SCL pins during power-up. A LOW on the enable
                       pin (EN) also forces the parts into the disconnected state. As the power supply is brought
                       up and EN is HIGH or the part is powered and EN is taken from LOW to HIGH it enters an
                       initialization state where the internal references are stabilized. At the end of the
                       initialization state the ‘STOP bit and bus idle’ detect circuit is enabled. With the EN pin

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                  PCA9508
                                                                 Hot swappable level translating I2C-bus repeater
                       HIGH long enough to complete the initialization state (ten) and remaining HIGH when all
                       the SDA and SCL pins have been HIGH for the bus idle time or when all pins are HIGH
                       and a STOP condition is seen on the SDAA and SCLA pins, SDAA is connected to SDAB
                       and SCLA is connected to SCLB.
                   6.1 A side to B side
                       Once connected, when the PCA9508 senses a LOW level on the A side (below
                       0.5VCC(A)), it turns on the corresponding B side driver (either SDA or SCL) and drives the
                       B side down to about 0.5 V. When the external driver turns off, the A side will begin to rise
                       as it is pulled HIGH by the bus pull-up resistor. When the A side reaches 0.5VCC(A), the
                       B side driver turns off and both A and B will continue to rise. The result is two smooth
                       exponential rising edges on both buses with a propagation delay between them which is a
                       function of the RC time constant on the A side bus.
                   6.2 B side to A side
                       When a LOW level is sensed on the B side (below 0.4 V), the corresponding A side driver
                       is turned on to drive the A side to nearly 0 V. When the external driver turns off, the B side
                       will begin to rise as it is pulled HIGH by the bus pull-up resistor. When the B side reaches
                       0.5 V, the A side driver will turn off. The B side driver will remain at about 0.5 V until the
                       A side rises above 0.5VCC(A), then the B side will continue to rise. The result is a plateau
                       on the B side rising edge. See Figure 11.
                   6.3 Weak drive on B side
                       The following condition should be avoided as it causes the PCA9508 to create a glitch on
                       the bus. As long as I2C-bus devices connected to the B side can pull the bus lines lower
                       than 0.4 V, this problem will never occur. When the B side falls first and goes below
                       0.3VCC(B), the A side driver is turned on and the A side is pulled down to 0 V. The B side
                       pull-down is switched on and unless the B side is pulled below 0.4 V by an external driver,
                       the A side pull-down will switch off and the A side will be pulled up by the pull-up resistor.
                       When the A side rises above 0.5VCC(A), the B side pull-down will turn off. To prevent this
                       glitch, it is necessary to make certain that the B side LOW level driven by an external
                       driver is below 0.4 V.
                   6.4 Enable pin (EN)
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with an internal pull-up to VCC(B) and allows the user to select
                       when the repeater is active. This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on
                       power-up until after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an
                       I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus.
                       The EN pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an
                       idle state to prevent system failures.
                       If the PCA9508 is enabled while the bus is active, the PCA9508 will connect at the first
                       STOP signal or at the first gap in activity that satisfies the internal idle bus time after the
                       enable sequence is complete.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                           PCA9508
                                                                      Hot swappable level translating I2C-bus repeater
                   6.5 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater
                       must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard-mode and
                       Fast-mode I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus devices
                       only specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic
                       I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible. Under
                       certain conditions higher termination currents can be used.
                       Please see application note AN255, I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders for
                       additional information on sizing resistors and precautions when using more than one
                       PCA9508 in a system or using the PCA9508 in conjunction with other bus buffers.
7. Application design-in information
                       A typical application is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the system master is running
                       on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 1.2 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz.
                       Master devices can be placed on either bus.

                          Fig 4.  Typical application
                       The PCA9508 is 5 V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                       between 0.9 V to 5.5 V bus voltages and 2.7 V to 5.5 V bus voltages.
                       When the A side of the PCA9508 is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator
                       detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.5VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on the
                       B side to turn on, causing the B side to pull down to about 0.5 V. When the B side of the
                       PCA9508 falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes the
                       internal driver on the A side to turn on and pull the A side pin down to ground. In order to
                       illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 7 and Figure 8. If the
                       bus master in Figure 4 were to write to the slave through the PCA9508, waveforms shown
                       in Figure 7 would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission
                       except that the HIGH level may be as low as 0.9 V, and the turn on and turn off of the
                       acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                               PCA9508

                   On the B bus side of the PCA9508, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset
                   from ground equal to the VOL of the PCA9508. After the 8th clock pulse, the data line will
                   be pulled to the VOL of the slave device, which is very close to ground in this example. At
                   the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the LOW level set by the driver in the
                   PCA9508 for a short delay while the A bus side rises above 0.5VCC(A) then it continues
                   HIGH. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events require that the
                   LOW level on the B bus side at the input of the PCA9508 (VIL) be at or below 0.4 V to be
                   recognized by the PCA9508 and then transmitted to the A bus side.
                   Multiple PCA9508 A sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 5), allowing all
                   nodes to communicate with each other.
                   Multiple PCA9508s can be connected in series (Figure 6) as long as the A side is
                   connected to the B side. I2C-bus slave devices can be connected to any of the bus
                   segments. The number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
                   delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.

       and 57 pF load capacitance on the A side. Different load resistance and capacitance will alter the RC time constant, thereby changing
       the propagation delay and transition times.
[2]    Pull-up voltages are VCC(A) on the A side and VCC(B) on the B side.
[3]    Typical values were measured with VCC(A) = 3.3 V at Tamb = 25 °C, unless otherwise noted.
[4]    The tPLH delay data from B side to A side is measured at 0.5 V on the B side to 0.5VCC(A) on the A side when VCC(A) is less than 2 V, and
       1.5 V on the A side if VCC(A) is greater than 2 V.
[5]    Typical value measured with VCC(A) = 2.7 V at Tamb = 25 °C.
[6]    The proportional delay data from A side to B side is measured at 0.3VCC(A) on the A side to 1.5 V on the B side.
[7]    Defined as the time required to connect from B side to A side, after B side switches from active to idle, when A side is idle.
[8]    Defined as the time required to connect from B side to A side, when B side and A side are idle.
[9]    Defined as the time required to connect A side to B side, when B side is idle and A side is going active from idle, by a STOP condition.
[10] The enable pin, EN, should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 18) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 18.
