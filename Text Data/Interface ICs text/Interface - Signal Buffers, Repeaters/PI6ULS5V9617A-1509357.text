Features                                                         Description
    2 channel, bidirectional buffer isolates capacitance            The PI6ULS5V9617A is a CMOS integrated circuit
       and allows 540pF on either side of the device at 1        intended for Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) I2C-bus or SMBus
       MHz and up to 4000 pF at lower speeds                     applications. It can provide level shifting between low
    Voltage level translation from 0.6V to 5.5V and             voltage (down to 0.6V) and higher voltage (2.2V to 5.5V)
       from 2.2V to 5.5V                                         in mixed-mode applications.
                                                                     The PI6ULS5V9617A enables the system designer
    Footprint and functional replacement for
                                                                 to isolate two halves of a bus for both voltage and
       PI6ULS5V9617A at Fast-mode speeds
                                                                 capacitance, accommodating more I2C devices or longer
    Port A operating supply voltage range of 0.6V to
                                                                 trace length. It also permits extension of the I2C-bus by
       5.5V with normal levels(0.4VCC(A) + 0.8V ≤ VCC(B) )       providing bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA)
    Port B operating supply voltage range of 2.2V to            and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling two buses of
       5.5V with static offset level                             540 pF at 1 MHz or up to 4000 pF at lower speeds. The
    5V tolerant I2C-bus and enable pins                         SDA and SCL pins are overvoltage tolerant and are
    0 Hz to 1 MHz clock frequency (the maximum                  high-impedance when the PI6ULS5V9617A is
       system operating frequency may be less than 1MHz          unpowered.
       because of the delays added by the repeater)                  The 2.2V to 5.5V bus port B drivers have the static
    Active HIGH repeater enable input referenced to             level offset, while the adjustable voltage bus port A
                                                                 drivers eliminate the static offset voltage. This results in
       VCC(B)
                                                                 a LOW on the port B translating into a nearly 0V LOW
    Open-drain input/outputs
                                                                 on the port A which accommodates the smaller voltage
    Latching free operation
                                                                 swings of lower voltage logic. The EN pin is referenced
    Supports arbitration and clock stretching across the        to VCC(B) and can also be used to turn the drivers on and
       repeater                                                  off under system control.
    Accommodates Standard-mode, Fast-mode and
       Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus devices, SMBus (standard           Pin Configuration
       and high power mode), PMBus and multiple
       masters
    Powered-off high-impedance I2C-bus pins
    ESD protection exceeds 8000V HBM per JESD22-

Functional Description
      The PI6ULS5V9617A enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.6V without degradation of
system performance. The PI6ULS5V9617A contains two bidirectional open-drain buffers specifically designed to
support up-translation/down-translation between the low voltage (as low as 0.6V) and a 2.5V, 3.3V or 5V I2C-bus or
SMBus. All inputs and I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5V even when the device is unpowered (VCC(B) and/or VCC(A)
= 0V).
      The PI6ULS5V9617A includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until V CC(B) is above
2.2V and until after the internal reference circuits have settled at about 400μs, and the VCC(A) is above 0.6V. VCC(B) and
VCC(A) can be applied in any sequence at power-up.
      The PCA9617A includes a VCC(A) overvoltage disable that turns the channel off if 0.4VCC(A) + 0.8V > VCC(B). The
PCA9617A logic and all I/Os are powered by the VCC(B) pin.
      The B-side drivers operate from 2.2V to 5.5V. The output low level of port B internal buffer is approximately 0.55
V, while the input voltage must be 90mV lower (0.45V) or even more lower. The nearly 0.5V low signal is called a
buffered low. When the B-side I/O is driven low internally, the low is not recognized as a low by the input. This
feature prevents a lockup condition from occurring when the input low condition is released. This type of design on B
port prevents it from being used in series with another PI6ULS5V9617A (B side) or similar devices, because they
don’t recognize buffer low signals as a valid low.
      The A-side drivers operate from 0.6V to 5.5 V. The output low level of port A internal buffer is nearly 0V, while
the input low level is set at 0.35VCC(A) to accommodate the need for a lower LOW level in systems where the low
voltage side supply voltage is as low as 0.6V. Port A of two or more PI6ULS5V9617As can be connected together to
allow a star topography with port A on the common bus. And port A can be connected directly to any other buffer with
static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple PI6ULS5V9617As can be connected in series, port A to port B, with no
build-up in offset voltage with only time of ﬂight delays to consider.
      After power-up and with the EN HIGH, a LOW level on port A (below 0.3VCC(A)) turns the corresponding port B
driver (either SDA or SCL) on and drives port B down to about 0.55 V. When port A rises above 0.3VCC(A), the port B
pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor pulls the pin HIGH. When port B falls first and goes
below 0.4 V, the port A driver is turned on and port A pulls down to about 0 V. The port A pull-down is not enabled
unless the port B voltage goes below 0.4 V. If the port B low voltage goes below 0.4 V, the port B pull-down driver is
enabled and port B will only be able to rise to 0.55 V until port A rises above 0.3V CC(A), then port B will continue to
rise being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor. The VCC(A) is only used to provide the 0.35VCC(A) reference to the
port A input comparators and for the power good detect circuit. The PI6ULS5V9617A logic and all I/Os are powered
by the VCC(B) pin.
      The EN pin is active HIGH with thresholds referenced to VCC(B) and an internal pull-up to VCC(B) that maintains the
device active unless the user selects to disable the repeater to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until after the
system power-up reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus
operation will hang the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
The enable does not switch the internal reference circuits so the 400μs delay is only seen when VCC(B) comes up. The

enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state to prevent system
failures.
As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic HIGH levels on the buffered
bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus). The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system,
but each side of the repeater must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard mode, Fast-mode
and Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus devices
only specify 3mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3mA in a generic I2C-bus system where Standard-
mode devices, Fast-mode devices and multiple masters are possible. When only Fast-mode Plus devices are used with
30mA at 5 V drive strength, then lower value pull-up resistors can be used. The B-side RC should not be less than 67.5
ns because shorter RCs increase the turnaround bounce when the B-side transitions from being externally driven to
pulled down by its offset buffer.
Application Information
       A typical application is shown in Figure 9. In this example, the system master is running on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while
the slave is connected to a 1.2 V bus. Both buses run at 1MHz. Master devices can be placed on either bus.
                                                        Figure 9: Typical Application
       The PI6ULS5V9617A is 5V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate between 0.6V to
5.5V bus voltages and 2.2 V to 5.5 V bus voltages.
       When port A of the PI6ULS5V9617A is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator detects the falling
edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on port B to turn on, causing port B to pull down to
about 0.5 V. When port B of the PI6ULS5V9617A falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge
and causes the internal driver on port A to turn on and pull the port A pin down to ground. In order to illustrate what
would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 9 and Figure 10. If the bus master in Figure 9 were to write to
the slave through the PI6ULS5V9617A, waveforms shown in Figure 9 would be observed on the A bus. This looks
like a normal I2C-bus transmission except that the HIGH level may be as low as 0.6V, and the turn on and turn off of
the acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
       On the B bus side of the PI6ULS5V9617A, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset from ground
equal to the VOL of the PI6ULS5V9617A. After the eighth clock pulse, the data line will be pulled to the V OL of the
slave device which is very close to ground in this example. At the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the
LOW level set by the driver in the PI6ULS5V9617A for a short delay while the A bus side rises above 0.3V CC(A) then

it continues HIGH. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events require that the LOW level on
the B bus side at the input of the PI6ULS5V9617A (VIL) be at or below 0.4 V to be recognized by the
PI6ULS5V9617A and then transmitted to the A bus side.
       Multiple PI6ULS5V9617A port A sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 10), allowing all nodes
to communicate with each other.
       Multiple PI6ULS5V9617As can be connected in series as long as port A is connected to port B(Figure 11). I2C-
bus slave devices can be connected to any of the bus segments. The number of devices that can be connected in series
is limited by repeater delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.
