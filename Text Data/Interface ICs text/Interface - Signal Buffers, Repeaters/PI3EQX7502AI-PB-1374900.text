PI3EQX7502AI
5.0Gbps, 1-port, USB3.0 ReDriver
Description                                                             Features
Diodes Incorporated PI3EQX7502AI is a low power, high                     ¼¼USB 3.0 compatible
performance 5.0 Gbps signal ReDriver™ designed specifically
for the USB 3.0 protocol. The device provides programmable                ¼¼Full Compliancy to USB3.0 Super Speed Standard
equalization, De-Emphasis, and input threshold controls to
optimize performance over a variety of physical mediums by                ¼¼Two 5.0Gbps differential signal pairs
reducing Inter-Symbol Interference.
                                                                          ¼¼Adjustable Receiver Equalization
The PI3EQX7502AI supports two 100Ω Differential CML data
I/O’s between the Protocol ASIC to a switch fabric, over cable, or        ¼¼100Ω Differential CML I/O’s
to extend the signals across other distant data pathways on the
user’s platform. The integrated equalization circuitry provides           ¼¼Pin Configured Output Emphasis Control
flexibility with signal integrity of the signal before the ReDriver.
                                                                          ¼¼Input signal level detect and squelch for each channel
A low-level input signal detection and output squelch function is
provided for each channel.                                                ¼¼Automatic Receiver Detect with digital enable/disable
Each channel operates fully independently. When the channels
are enabled EN_x# = 0 and operating, that channels’ input                 ¼¼Low Power : ~330mW
signal level (on xI+/-) determines whether the output is active.
                                                                          ¼¼Auto “Slumber” mode for adaptive power management
If the input signal level of the channel falls below the active
threshold level (Vth-) then the outputs are driven to the                 ¼¼Stand-by Mode – Power Down State
common mode voltage. In addition to signal conditioning,
when EN_x# = 1, the device enters a low power standby mode.               ¼¼Industrial Temp Support (-40°C to 85°C)
The PI3EQX7502AI also includes a fully programmable receiver
                                                                          ¼¼Single Supply Voltage: 3.3V
detect function. When the RXD-EN pin is pulled high, automatic
receiver detection will be active. The receiver detection loop will       ¼¼Packaging: 24-Pin TQFN (4x4mm)
be active again if the corresponding channel’s signal detector is
idle for longer than 7.3mS. The channel will then move to Unplug
Mode if load not detected, or it will return to Low Power Mode          Application
(Slumber Mode) due to inactivity.
