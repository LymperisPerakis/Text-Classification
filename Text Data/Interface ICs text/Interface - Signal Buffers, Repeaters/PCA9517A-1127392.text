                 Level translating I2C-bus repeater
                 Rev. 4.1 — 24 May 2016                                                      Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9517A is a CMOS integrated circuit that provides level shifting between low
             voltage (down to 0.9 V) and higher voltage (2.7 V to 5.5 V) I2C-bus or SMBus
             applications. While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system
             during the level shifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional
             buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling two buses of
             400 pF. Using the PCA9517A enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus
             for both voltage and capacitance. The SDA and SCL pins are overvoltage tolerant and are
             high-impedance when the PCA9517A is unpowered.
             The 2.7 V to 5.5 V bus port B drivers behave much like the drivers on the PCA9515A
             device, while the adjustable voltage bus port A drivers drive more current and eliminate
             the static offset voltage. This results in a LOW on the port B translating into a nearly 0 V
             LOW on the port A which accommodates smaller voltage swings of lower voltage logic.
             The static offset design of the port B PCA9517A I/O drivers prevent them from being
             connected to another device that has rise time accelerator including the PCA9510,
             PCA9511, PCA9512, PCA9513, PCA9514, PCA9515A, PCA9516A, PCA9517A (port B),
             or PCA9518. Port A of two or more PCA9517As can be connected together, however, to
             allow a star topography with port A on the common bus, and port A can be connected
             directly to any other buffer with static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple PCA9517As can
             be connected in series, port A to port B, with no build-up in offset voltage with only time of
             flight delays to consider.
             The PCA9517A drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) is above 0.8 V and VCC(B) is above
             2.5 V. The EN pin can also be used to turn the drivers on and off under system control.
             Caution should be observed to only change the state of the enable pin when the bus is
             idle.
             The output pull-down on the port B internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.5 V,
             while the input threshold of the internal buffer is set about 70 mV lower (0.43 V). When the
             port B I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input.
             This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring. The output pull-down on port A drives a
             hard LOW and the input level is set at 0.3VCC(A) to accommodate the need for a lower
             LOW level in systems where the low voltage side supply voltage is as low as 0.9 V.

             [1]  PCA9517 will be discontinued in several years, so move to the PCA9517A for all new designs and system
                  updates.
             [2]  The PCA9517A is an improved hot swap and ESD version of the PCA9517, but otherwise operates
                  identically and should be used for all new designs and system updates.

[1]   Also known as MSOP8.
[2]   PCA9517ADP/DG is functionally the same (electrically and mechanically) as the PCA9517ADP, but was initially produced (e.g., “born”)
      with Dark Green (lead-free and halogen/antimony-free) package material and is a temporary unique orderable part number for
      customers who desire to order and only receive Dark Green package material. The standard part PCA9517ADP will transition to Dark
      Green package material in 2Q’12 and then the PCA9517ADP and PCA9517ADP/DG devices will be identical. The PCA9517ADP/DG
      part number will be EOL after several years as customers who used this temporary part number update their BOM to the normal part
      number.

                            thermal pad on the board and for proper head conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be
                            incorporated in the printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.
6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9517A”.
                       The PCA9517A enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.9 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9517A contains two bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to support up-translation/down-translation
                       between the low voltage (as low as 0.9 V) and a 3.3 V or 5 V I2C-bus or SMBus. All inputs
                       and I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered (VCC(B)
                       and/or VCC(A) = 0 V). The PCA9517A includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output
                       drivers turned off until VCC(B) is above 2.5 V and the VCC(A) is above 0.8 V. VCC(B) and
                       VCC(A) can be applied in any sequence at power-up. After power-up and with the enable
                       (EN) HIGH, a LOW level on port A (below 0.3VCC(A)) turns the corresponding port B driver
                       (either SDA or SCL) on and drives port B down to about 0.5 V. When port A rises above
                       0.3VCC(A), the port B pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor pulls
                       the pin HIGH. When port B falls first and goes below 0.4 V the port A driver is turned on
                       and port A pulls down to 0 V. The port A pull-down is not enabled unless the port B
                       voltage goes below 0.4 V. If the port B low voltage goes below 0.4 V, the port B pull-down
                       driver is enabled and port B will only be able to rise to 0.5 V until port A rises above
                       0.3VCC(A), then port B will continue to rise being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor.
                       The VCC(A) is only used to provide the 0.3VCC(A) reference to the port A input comparators
                       and for the power good detect circuit. The PCA9517A logic and all I/Os are powered by
                       the VCC(B) pin.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                      PCA9517A
                                                                                                                    Level translating I2C-bus repeater
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with an internal pull-up to VCC(B) and allows the user to select
                       when the repeater is active. This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on
                       power-up until after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an
                       I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus and
                       enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
                       The enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in
                       an idle state to prevent system failures.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater
                       must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard mode and Fast
                       mode I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard mode I2C-bus devices only
                       specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic I2C-bus
                       system where Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible. Under certain
                       conditions higher termination currents can be used.
                       Please see Application Note AN255, I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders for
                       additional information on sizing resistors and precautions when using more than one
                       PCA9517A in a system or using the PCA9517A in conjunction with other bus buffers.
7. Application design-in information
                       A typical application is shown in Figure 5. In this example, the system master is running
                       on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 1.2 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz.
                       Master devices can be placed on either bus.

                         Fig 5.  Typical application
                       The PCA9517A is 5 V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                       between 0.9 V to 5.5 V bus voltages and 2.7 V to 5.5 V bus voltages.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                             PCA9517A
                                                                                                               Level translating I2C-bus repeater
                   When port A of the PCA9517A is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator
                   detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on
                   port B to turn on, causing port B to pull down to about 0.5 V. When port B of the
                   PCA9517A falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes
                   the internal driver on port A to turn on and pull the port A pin down to ground. In order to
                   illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 9 and Figure 10. If the
                   bus master in Figure 5 were to write to the slave through the PCA9517A, waveforms
                   shown in Figure 9 would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus
                   transmission except that the HIGH level may be as low as 0.9 V, and the turn on and turn
                   off of the acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
                   On the B bus side of the PCA9517A, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset
                   from ground equal to the VOL of the PCA9517A. After the eighth clock pulse, the data line
                   will be pulled to the VOL of the slave device which is very close to ground in this example.
                   At the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the LOW level set by the driver in the
                   PCA9517A for a short delay while the A bus side rises above 0.3VCC(A) then it continues
                   HIGH. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events require that the
                   LOW level on the B bus side at the input of the PCA9517A (VIL) be at or below 0.4 V to be
                   recognized by the PCA9517A and then transmitted to the A bus side.
                   Multiple PCA9517A port A sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 6),
                   allowing all nodes to communicate with each other.
                   Multiple PCA9517As can be connected in series (Figure 7) as long as port A is connected
                   to port B. I2C-bus slave devices can be connected to any of the bus segments. The
                   number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
                   delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.

[1]   Times are specified with loads of 1.35 k pull-up resistance and 57 pF load capacitance on port B, and 167  pull-up resistance and
      57 pF load capacitance on port A. Different load resistance and capacitance will alter the RC time constant, thereby changing the
      propagation delay and transition times.
[2]   Pull-up voltages are VCC(A) on port A and VCC(B) on port B.
[3]   Typical values were measured with VCC(A) = 3.3 V at Tamb = 25 C, unless otherwise noted.
[4]   The tPLH delay data from port B to port A is measured at 0.5 V on port B to 0.5VCC(A) on port A when VCC(A) is less than 2 V, and 1.5 V
      on port A if VCC(A) is greater than 2 V.
[5]   Typical value measured with VCC(A) = 2.7 V at Tamb = 25 C.
[6]   The proportional delay data from port A to port B is measured at 0.3VCC(A) on port A to 1.5 V on port B.
[7]   The enable pin, EN, should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 18) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8
