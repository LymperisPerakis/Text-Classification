                PCA9509P
                Low power level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
                Rev. 4 — 18 May 2018                                                Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9509P is a level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater with two voltage supplies
             that enables processor low voltage 2-wire serial bus to interface with standard I2C-bus or
             SMBus I/O. While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system
             during the level shifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional
             buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling the I2C-bus or
             SMBus maximum capacitance of 400 pF on the higher voltage side. Port A allows a
             voltage range from 0.8 V to 2.0 V and is overvoltage tolerant. Port B allows a voltage
             range from 2.3 V to 5.5 V and is overvoltage tolerant. Both port A and port B SDA and
             SCL pins are high-impedance when the PCA9509P is unpowered.
             The bus port B drivers are compliant with SMBus I/O levels, while port A uses an offset
             LOW which prevents bus lock-up and allows the bidirectional nature of the device. The
             output pull-down on the port A internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.2VCC(A),
             while the input threshold of the internal buffer is set about 0.1VCC(A) lower than that of the
             output voltage LOW. When the port A I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not
             recognized as a LOW by the input. This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring. The
             output pull-down on the port B drives a hard LOW and the input level is set at 0.3 of
             SMBus or I2C-bus voltage level which enables port B to connect to any other I2C-bus
             devices or buffer.
             The PCA9509P drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) is above 0.7 V and VCC(B) is above
             1.7 V. The enable (EN) pin can also be used to turn on and turn off the drivers under
             system control. Caution should be observed to change only the state of the EN pin when
             the bus is idle.
             The PCA9509P is the same as the PCA9509A but without the port A internal current
             source to allow high value pull-up resistors to reduce current consumption in portable
             applications.

                   1.1 Selection recommendations
                       The PCA9509P should be used if an external A-port pull-up resistor is required to adjust
                       current for noise margin considerations or to reduce operating current consumption. See
                       Table 1 for comparison.

                       [1]  The PCA9509 current mirrors do not shut down when the device is disabled allowing instant turn-on, but at
                            the cost of the higher standby current. The PCA9509A and PCA9509P current mirrors are turned off when
                            disabled for lowest standby power consumption, but sufficient delay (10 s) after enable is needed before
                            resuming operation.
                       [2]  Operating currents do not include the current consumed by the external pull-ups on B-port or the external
                            pull-ups on the A-port of the PCA9509P.

                                                                              Low power level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9509P”.
                       The PCA9509P enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.8 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9509P contains 2 bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to support up-translation/down-translation
                       between the low voltage and 3.3 V SMBus or 5 V I2C-bus. The port A and port B I/Os are
                       over-voltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered.
                       The PCA9509P includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until
                       VCC(B) is above 1.7 V and the VCC(A) is above 0.7 V. VCC(B) and VCC(A) can be applied in
                       any sequence at power-up. After power-up and with the EN pin HIGH, a LOW level on
                       port A (below approximately 0.15VCC(A)) turns on the corresponding port B driver (either
                       SDA or SCL) and drives port B down to about 0 V. When port A rises above approximately
                       0.15VCC(A), the port B pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor pulls
                       the pin HIGH. When port B falls first and goes below 0.3VCC(B), the port A driver is turned
                       on and port A pulls down to 0.2VCC(A) (typical). The port B pull-down is not enabled unless
                       the port A voltage goes below VIL. If the port A low voltage goes below VIL, the port B
                       pull-down driver is enabled until port A rises above approximately 0.15VCC(A) (VIL), then
                       port B, if not externally driven LOW, rises, being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor.
                       When port B voltage rises above 50 % of VCC(B), port A continues to rise being pulled up
                       by external pull-up resistor.
                       Remark: Ground offset between the PCA9509P ground and the ground of devices on
                       port A of the PCA9509P must be avoided.
                       The reason for this cautionary remark is that a CMOS/NMOS open-drain capable of
                       sinking 3 mA of current at 0.4 V has an output resistance of 133  or less (R = E / I). Such
                       a driver shares enough current with the port A output pull-down of the PCA9509P to be
                       seen as a LOW as long as the ground offset is zero. If the ground offset is greater than
                       0 V, then the driver resistance must be less. Since VIL can be as low as 80 mV at cold
                       temperatures and the low end of the current distribution, the maximum ground offset
                       should not exceed 40 mV.
                       Bus repeaters that use an output offset are not interoperable with the port A of the
                       PCA9509P as their output LOW levels are not recognized by the PCA9509P as a LOW. If
                       the PCA9509P is placed in an application where the VIL of port A of the PCA9509P does
                       not go below its VIL, the port B does not go LOW.
                       Port B provides normal I2C-bus voltage levels and is interoperable with all I2C-bus slaves,
                       masters and repeaters.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH and allows the user to select when the repeater is active. This
                       can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until after the system power-up
                       reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during
                       a bus operation hangs the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse
                       the I2C-bus parts being enabled. The EN also puts the PCA9509P in a standby condition
                       to reduce power consumption.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                 PCA9509P
                                                                             Low power level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
                       The enable pin should only change state when the bus and the repeater port are in an idle
                       state to prevent system failures.
                       Because the enable pin (EN) can put the PCA9509P in Standby mode, and when in
                       standby the current mirrors are turned OFF to save power, the recovery from the
                       disabled/standby state is slow so that the current mirrors can return to full current before
                       the channels are enabled.
                       Remark: The system design should allow sufficient time after STOP before disabling the
                       PCA9509P so that both sides of the SDA and SCL channels are HIGH. It should also
                       allow sufficient time before the START such that the channel is disabled before the SDA
                       goes LOW. The PCA9509P should only be enabled during a bus idle state and there also
                       must be sufficient time allowed before the START such that the PCA9509P is fully active
                       before the falling edge of the SDA that defines a START.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels. The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system. Port A is
                       designed to work with pull-up resistor’s size as required to meet rise time requirements
                       but minimize current consumption. Port B is designed to work with Standard-mode and
                       Fast-mode I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus
                       devices only specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a
                       generic I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible.
                       Under certain conditions higher termination currents can be used (when all currents are
                       > 3 mA).
                   6.3 Edge rate control
                       The PCA9509P includes circuitry that slows down the falling edge of both the A side and
                       B side open-drain output pull-downs. This slowdown reduces system noise and
                       undershoot when the signal reflects off of the end of the bus. The slew rate control circuit
                       limits the maximum slew rate, and is relatively insensitive to the load capacitance, the bus
                       high voltage and to the pull-up value. The rising edge slew rate on the A side and B side is
                       controlled by RC time constant of the bus pull-up resistor and the bus capacitance, which
                       are system level considerations and not under the control of the PCA9509P. The pull-up
                       resistors should be chosen based on the total bus capacitance to result in a reasonable
                       rising edge transition time that is less than the maximum allowed rise time, and slow
                       enough not to make system level noise problems, and to make the A side low voltage less
                       than VIL.
                   6.4 Bus pull-up resistor selection
                       The AC test load for the PCA9509P is 1.35 k and 50 pF total capacitance. This results in
                       a rise time of approximately 60 ns. The 1.35 k resistor is chosen to provide a little less
                       than 3 mA in a 3.3 V application so it is compatible with Standard-mode I2C-bus devices
                       as well as Fast-mode devices. The B side output pull-down is a strong driver and is
                       capable of sinking Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) currents, however the pull-up must be sized for
                       the weakest part in the system, so if Standard-mode I2C-bus parts are present on the
                       B side, the pull-up must be limited to less than 3 mA. If only Fm+ parts are used on the
                       B side, the maximum pull-up current may be up to 30 mA. The pull-up resistor should
                       always be sized to provide less than the rated pull-up current for the weakest part on the
                       bus under the maximum bus voltage expected in the system. When the bus capacitance

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  PCA9509P
                                                                              Low power level translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater
                       is high, the current should be set near the maximum current drive for the weakest part.
                       However, if the bus capacitance is low a lower current/higher resistor value should be
                       used to keep the rise time from getting so fast that it causes problems. The A side pull-up
                       resistor must be selected to keep the LOW-level voltage at the A side input below
                       0.1VCC(A).
                6.4.1 Port A pull-up resistor sizing
                       When selecting the pull-up resistor for the A side of the PCA9509P there are several
                       considerations and limitations from both the PCA9509P and the other parts on the A-side
                       bus that must be taken into account.
               6.4.1.1 Minimum resistor size
                       The first limitation is that in order for the PCA9509P to recognize a LOW on the A side, the
                       voltage level must be below 0.1VCC(A) including ground offset. This and the drive strength
                       of the parts driving the less than 0.1VCC(A) level define the minimum resistor value that
                       can be used based on the other parts on the A-side bus. There is also a limit of 4 mA
                       maximum current that can be applied to the PCA9509P A side when it is LOW. For
                       example, if the part driving the PCA9509P A side is rated at 3 mA at 0.4 V (and it is a
                       MOS part) and assuming that VCC(A) = 0.8 V, then the part has an effective output
                       resistance of 0.4 V / 3 mA = 133 , so the maximum current is 0.08 V / 133  = ~600 A,
                       so the maximum pull-up current would be 600 A. And for VCC(A) = 0.8 V the minimum
                       resistance would be 0.72 V / 600 A = 1.2 k. If the part providing the 0.1VCC(A) has a
                       very low output resistance, then the current is limited to 4 mA by the PCA9509P, and for
                       VCC(A) = 0.8 V the minimum pull-up resistance would be 0.64 V / 4 mA = 160 . Since the
                       ground offset will never be zero, the minimum resistor value needs to be increased
                       accordingly.
               6.4.1.2 Maximum resistance sizing
                       The pull-up resistor on the A side of the PCA9509P should be chosen to provide at least
                       100 A of pull-up current. So for VCC(A) = 0.8 V the maximum resistor value looks like
                       0.64 V / 100 A = 6.4 k.
               6.4.1.3 Rise time constraints
                       In addition to the current minimum and maximum considerations, the RC time constant of
                       the A-side bus must be considered. It is recommended that the RC time constant be
                       chosen so that it is greater than 60 ns in order to control the size of the bounce that results
                       when a driver on the A side turns off that was driving a <0.1VCC(A) level and before the
                       offset output driver in the PCA9509P can turn on and hold the voltage to ~0.2VCC(A). The
                       maximum RC time constant is limited by the I2C-bus family specification for maximum
                       rise time between 0.3VCC(A) and 0.7VCC(A) (400 ns for Fast mode and 1000 ns for
                       Standard mode operation). Although the maximum current and maximum rise time limits
                       predict an allowable capacitance well above the 400 pF I2C-bus family specification, this
                       is not likely to be possible in a typical I2C-bus system since there is so little voltage margin
                       for the VIL of the PCA9509P ground offset is more likely to limit the effective capacitance
                       than current drive capability because high-capacitance buses tend to be physically large
                       and large size tends to result in larger ground offset voltages, which must be severely
                       limited to be successful at a bus voltage of 1 V and below.

7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the CPU is running on a 0.9 V
                   I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 3.3 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz. Master
                   devices can be placed on either bus.

                     Fig 4.   Typical application
                   When port B of the PCA9509P is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a CMOS
                   hysteresis input detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(B) and causes the
                   internal driver on port A to turn on, causing port A to pull down to about 0.2VCC(A). When
                   port A of the PCA9509P falls, a comparator detects the falling edge when it falls below
                   0.15VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on port B to turn on and pull the port B pin down
                   to ground. In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to
                   Figure 5 and Figure 6. If the bus master in Figure 4 were to write to the slave through the
                   PCA9509P, waveforms shown in Figure 5 would be observed on the B bus. This looks
                   like a normal I2C-bus transmission.
                   On the A bus side of the PCA9509P, the clock and data lines are driven by the master and
                   swing nearly to ground. After the eighth clock pulse, the slave replies with an ACK that
                   causes a LOW on the A side equal to the VOL of the PCA9509P, which the master
                   recognizes as a LOW. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events
                   require that the LOW level on the A bus side at the input of the PCA9509P (VIL) is below
                   0.1VCC(A) to be recognized by the PCA9509P and then transmitted to the B bus side.

[2]   Care must be taken to minimize the resistance in series with the ground pin of the PCA9509P to the ground reference point of the VCC(A)
      supply because there is only 80 mV margin between the power good threshold and the 0.8 V minimum supply voltage at cold
      temperature (40 C). Because the B-side IOL of up to 30 mA flows through the resistance causing a voltage drop that effectively
      reduces the VCC(A) to chip ground voltage and when VCC(A) is less than the power good voltage ~0.72 V, the PCA9509P is disabled. For
      example, if the resistance is 1.4 , then 1.4   60 mA = 84 mV and 0.8 V  0.084 V = 0.716 V, which is less than the power good
      threshold, so the PCA9509P disables when both outputs drive LOW.
[3]   As long as the chip ground is common with the input ground reference the driver resistance may be as large as 120 . However, ground
      offset rapidly decreases the maximum allowed driver resistance.
[4]   Guaranteed by design.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 23) than a SnPb process, thus

                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
