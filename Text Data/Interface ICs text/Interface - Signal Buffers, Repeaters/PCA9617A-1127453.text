                  Level translating Fm+ I2C-bus repeater
                  Rev. 1 — 20 March 2013                                              Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9617A is a CMOS integrated circuit that provides level shifting between low
              voltage (0.8 V to 5.5 V) and higher voltage (2.2 V to 5.5 V) Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) I2C-bus
              or SMBus applications. While retaining all the operating modes and features of the
              I2C-bus system during the level shifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing
              bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling two
              buses of 540 pF at 1 MHz or up to 4000 pF at lower speeds. Using the PCA9617A
              enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus for both voltage and
              capacitance. The SDA and SCL pins are overvoltage tolerant and are high-impedance
              when the PCA9617A is unpowered.
              The 2.2 V to 5.5 V bus port B drivers have the static level offset, while the adjustable
              voltage bus port A drivers eliminate the static offset voltage. This results in a LOW on the
              port B translating into a nearly 0 V LOW on the port A which accommodates the smaller
              voltage swings of lower voltage logic.
              The static offset design of the port B PCA9617A I/O drivers prevents them from being
              connected to the static or incremented offset of other bus buffers. Port A of two or more
              PCA9617As can be connected together, however, to allow a star topography with port A
              on the common bus, and port A can be connected directly to any other buffer with static or
              incremented offset outputs. Multiple PCA9617As can be connected in series, port A to
              port B, with no build-up in offset voltage with only time of flight delays to consider.
              The PCA9617A drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) is above 0.8 V and VCC(B) is above
              2.2 V. The EN pin is referenced to VCC(B) and can also be used to turn the drivers on and
              off under system control. Caution should be observed to only change the state of the
              enable pin when the bus is idle.
              The output pull-down on the port B internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.55 V,
              while the input threshold of the internal buffer is set about 90 mV lower (0.45 V). When the
              port B I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input.
              This prevents a latching condition from occurring. The output pull-down on port A drives a
              hard LOW and the input level is set at 0.35VCC(A) to accommodate the need for a lower
              LOW level in systems where the low voltage side supply voltage is as low as 0.8 V.

6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9617A”.
                       The PCA9617A enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.8 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9617A contains two bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to support up-translation/down-translation
                       between the low voltage (as low as 0.8 V) and a 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V I2C-bus or SMBus. All
                       inputs and I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered
                       (VCC(B) and/or VCC(A) = 0 V). The PCA9617A includes a power-up circuit that keeps the
                       output drivers turned off until VCC(B) is above 2.2 V and until after the internal reference
                       circuits have settled ~400 s, and the VCC(A) is above 0.8 V. VCC(B) and VCC(A) can be
                       applied in any sequence at power-up. After power-up and with the enable (EN) HIGH, a
                       LOW level on port A (below 0.3VCC(A)) turns the corresponding port B driver (either SDA
                       or SCL) on and drives port B down to about 0.55 V. When port A rises above 0.3VCC(A),
                       the port B pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor pulls the pin
                       HIGH. When port B falls first and goes below 0.4 V, the port A driver is turned on and
                       port A pulls down to ~0 V. The port A pull-down is not enabled unless the port B voltage
                       goes below 0.4 V. If the port B low voltage goes below 0.4 V, the port B pull-down driver is
                       enabled and port B will only be able to rise to 0.55 V until port A rises above 0.3VCC(A),
                       then port B will continue to rise being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor. The VCC(A)
                       is only used to provide the 0.35VCC(A) reference to the port A input comparators and for
                       the power good detect circuit. The PCA9617A includes a VCC(A) overvoltage disable that
                       turns the channel off if 0.4VCC(A) + 0.8 V > VCC(B). The PCA9617A logic and all I/Os are
                       powered by the VCC(B) pin.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with thresholds referenced to VCC(B) and an internal pull-up to
                       VCC(B) that maintains the device active unless the user selects to disable the repeater to
                       isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until after the system power-up reset. It should
                       never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus operation
                       will hang the bus and enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus
                       parts being enabled. The enable does not switch the internal reference circuits so the
                       ~400 s delay is only seen when VCC(B) comes up.
                       The enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in
                       an idle state to prevent system failures.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater
                       must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard mode, Fast-mode
                       and Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard mode and
                       Fast-mode I2C-bus devices only specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination
                       current to 3 mA in a generic I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices, Fast-mode
                       devices and multiple masters are possible. When only Fast-mode Plus devices are used
                       with 30 mA at 5 V drive strength, then lower value pull-up resistors can be used. The

                   B-side RC should not be less than 67.5 ns because shorter RCs increase the turnaround
                   bounce when the B-side transitions from being externally driven to pulled down by its
                   offset buffer.
                   Please see Application Note AN255, “I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders” for
                   additional information on sizing resistors and precautions when using more than one
                   PCA9617A in a system or using the PCA9617A in conjunction with other bus buffers.
7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the system master is running
                   on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 1.2 V bus. Both buses run at
                   1000 kHz. Master devices can be placed on either bus.
                                                                 3.3 V                                                  1.2 V

                                                                                                                                    002aag653
                      Fig 4.  Typical application
                   The PCA9617A is 5 V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                   between 0.8 V to 5.5 V bus voltages and 2.2 V to 5.5 V bus voltages.
                   When port A of the PCA9617A is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator
                   detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on
                   port B to turn on, causing port B to pull down to about 0.5 V. When port B of the
                   PCA9617A falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes
                   the internal driver on port A to turn on and pull the port A pin down to ground. In order to
                   illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 8 and Figure 9. If the
                   bus master in Figure 4 were to write to the slave through the PCA9617A, waveforms
                   shown in Figure 8 would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus
                   transmission except that the HIGH level may be as low as 0.8 V, and the turn on and turn
                   off of the acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
                   The internal comparator requires that 0.4  VCC(A) be less than or equal to VCC(B)  0.8 V
                   for the device to operate. Since A port is 5 V tolerant, the VCC(A) can be lowered to support
                   device spectrum while still supporting 5 V signals on the A port.
                   On the B bus side of the PCA9617A, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset
                   from ground equal to the VOL of the PCA9617A. After the eighth clock pulse, the data line
                   will be pulled to the VOL of the slave device which is very close to ground in this example.
                   At the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the LOW level set by the driver in the
                   PCA9617A for a short delay while the A bus side rises above 0.3VCC(A) then it continues

                   HIGH. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events require that the
                   LOW level on the B bus side at the input of the PCA9617A (VIL) be at or below 0.4 V to be
                   recognized by the PCA9617A and then transmitted to the A bus side.
                   Multiple PCA9617A port A sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 5),
                   allowing all nodes to communicate with each other.
                   Multiple PCA9617As can be connected in series (Figure 6) as long as port A is connected
                   to port B. I2C-bus slave devices can be connected to any of the bus segments. The
                   number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
                   delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.

      normally.
[2]   For part to function, 0.4  VCC(A) must be equal or less than VCC(B)  0.8 V. The voltage on the A port can still be up to 5.5 V without
      damage to the pins.
[3]   Pull-up should result in IOL  150 A.
[4]   Guaranteed by design and characterization.
[5]   VIL for port A with envelope noise must be below 0.3VCC(A) for stable performance.
[6]   When VCC(A) is less than 1 V, care is required to make certain that the system ground offset and noise are minimized such that there is
      reasonable difference between the VIL present at the PCA9617A A-side input and the 0.25VCC(A) input threshold.
[7]   Power supply decoupling capacitors need to be present for both VCC(A) and VCC(B) and the 0.1 F decoupling for VCC(B) needs to be
      located near the VCC(B) pin.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 20.
