PI1EQX512A
1.0V, 5.0Gbps, 1-Port, USB3.0 ReDriver
Description                                                         Features
The PI1EQX512A is an ultra-low-power, high performance 5.0            ¼¼USB 3.0 compatible
Gbps signal ReDriver designed specifically for the USB 3.0
                                                                      ¼¼Full Compliancy to USB3.0 Super Speed Standard
protocol. The device provides programmable equalization and
De-Emphasis to optimize performance over a variety of physical        ¼¼Two 5.0Gbps differential signal pairs
mediums by reducing Inter-Symbol Interference.
                                                                      ¼¼Adjustable Receiver Equalization
PI1EQX512A supports two 100Ω Differential CML data I/O’s
between the Protocol ASIC to a switch fabric, over cable, or to       ¼¼100Ω Differential CML I/O’s
extend the signals across other distant data pathways on the          ¼¼Pin Configured Output Emphasis Control
user’s platform.
                                                                      ¼¼Input signal level detect and squelch for each channel
The integrated equalization circuitry provides flexibility with
signal integrity of the signal before the ReDriver. A low-level       ¼¼Automatic Receiver Detect
input signal detection and output squelch function is provided
                                                                      ¼¼Low Power : ~70mW
for each channel. Each channel operates fully independently.
When EN = 1, the channels’ input signal level (on xI+/-)              ¼¼Auto “Slumber” mode for adaptive power management
determines whether the output is active.                              ¼¼Standby Mode - Power down state
The PI1EQX512A also includes an automatic receiver detect
                                                                      ¼¼Single Supply Voltage: 1.0V
function. The receiver detection loop will be active again if the
corresponding channel’s signal detector is idle for longer than       ¼¼Packaging: 18-Pin TQFN 2 x 2 mm
7.3mS. The channel will then move to Unplug Mode if load not
detected, or it will return to Low Power Mode (Slumber Mode)
due to inactivity.
