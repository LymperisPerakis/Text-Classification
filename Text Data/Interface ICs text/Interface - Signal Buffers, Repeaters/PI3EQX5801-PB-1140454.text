PI3EQX5801
2.5/5.0Gbps, 1-Lane, PCIe 1.0/2.0 ReDriver with I2C Programming Interface
Description                                                             Features
Diodes Incorporated PI3EQX5801 is a low power, high                       ¼¼PCIe 1.0/2.0 compatible
performance 2.5/5.0 Gbps signal ReDriver designed specifically
                                                                          ¼¼Two 2.5/5.0Gbps differential signal pairs
for the PCIe 1.0/2.0 protocol. The device provides programmable
equalization, De-Emphasis, and output swing controls to optimize          ¼¼Adjustable Receiver Equalization
performance over a variety of physical mediums by reducing                ¼¼100Ω Differential CML I/O’s

                                                                          ¼¼Automatic Receiver Detect
equalization circuitry provides flexibility with signal integrity of
the signal before the ReDriver. A low-level input signal detection        ¼¼Low Power : ~330mW (3.3V)/~150mW (1.5V)
and output squelch function is provided for each channel.                 ¼¼Industrial Temp Support -40°C~ +85°C
                                                                          ¼¼Stand-by Mode – Power Down State
When the channels are enabled, EN# = 0, and operating, that
channels’ input signal level (on xI+/-) determines whether the            ¼¼Two power options: 3.3V or 1.5V
output is active. If the input signal level of the channel falls below
                                                                          ¼¼Packaging: 20-Pin TQFN (4x4mm)
the active threshold level (Vth-) then the outputs are driven to the
common mode voltage. In addition to signal conditioning, when
EN# = 1, the device enters a low power standby mode. The                Application
PI3EQX5801 also includes a fully programmable I2C interface.
When I2C control mode is enabled, I2C_EN = 1, equalization,
output swing, and de-emphasis settings can be adjusted by
programming the related registers.
