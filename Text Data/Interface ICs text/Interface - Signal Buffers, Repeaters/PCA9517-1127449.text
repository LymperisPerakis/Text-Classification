1. General description
             The PCA9517 is a CMOS integrated circuit that provides level shifting between low
             voltage (down to 0.9 V) and higher voltage (2.7 V to 5.5 V) I2C-bus or SMBus applications.
             While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system during the
             level shifts, it also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for
             both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus enabling two buses of 400 pF. Using
             the PCA9517 enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus for both voltage
             and capacitance. The SDA and SCL pins are over voltage tolerant and are
             high-impedance when the PCA9517 is unpowered.
             The 2.7 V to 5.5 V bus B-side drivers behave much like the drivers on the PCA9515A
             device, while the adjustable voltage bus A-side drivers drive more current and eliminate
             the static offset voltage. This results in a LOW on the B-side translating into a nearly 0 V
             LOW on the A-side which accommodates smaller voltage swings of lower voltage logic.
             The static offset design of the B-side PCA9517 I/O drivers prevent them from being
             connected to another device that has rise time accelerator including the PCA9510,
             PCA9511, PCA9512, PCA9513, PCA9514, PCA9515A, PCA9516A, PCA9517 (B-side),
             or PCA9518. The A-side of two or more PCA9517s can be connected together, however,
             to allow a star topography with the A-side on the common bus, and the A-side can be
             connected directly to any other buffer with static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple
             PCA9517s can be connected in series, A-side to B-side, with no build-up in offset voltage
             with only time of flight delays to consider.
             The PCA9517 drivers are not enabled unless VCCA is above 0.8 V and VCC is above 2.5 V.
             The EN pin can also be used to turn the drivers on and off under system control. Caution
             should be observed to only change the state of the enable pin when the bus is idle.
             The output pull-down on the B-side internal buffer LOW is set for approximately 0.5 V,
             while the input threshold of the internal buffer is set about 70 mV lower (0.43 V). When the
             B-side I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input.
             This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring. The output pull-down on the A-side
             drives a hard LOW and the input level is set at 0.3VCCA to accommodate the need for a
             lower LOW level in systems where the low voltage side supply voltage is as low as 0.9 V.

6. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Functional diagram of PCA9517”.
                       The PCA9517 enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCCA as low as 0.9 V
                       without degradation of system performance. The PCA9517 contains two bidirectional
                       open-drain buffers specifically designed to support up-translation/down-translation
                       between the low voltage (as low as 0.9 V) and a 3.3 V or 5 V I2C-bus or SMBus. All inputs
                       and I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered (VCCB
                       and/or VCCA = 0 V). The PCA9517 includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output
                       drivers turned off until VCCB is above 2.5 V and the VCCA is above 0.8 V. VCCB and VCCA
                       can be applied in any sequence at power-up. After power-up and with the enable (EN)
                       HIGH, a LOW level on the A-side (below 0.3VCCA) turns the corresponding B-side driver
                       (either SDA or SCL) on and drives the B-side down to about 0.5 V. When the A-side rises
                       above 0.3VCCA the B-side pull-down driver is turned off and the external pull-up resistor
                       pulls the pin HIGH. When the B-side falls first and goes below 0.3VCCB the A-side driver is
                       turned on and the A-side pulls down to 0 V. The B-side pull-down is not enabled unless
                       the B-side voltage goes below 0.4 V. If the B-side low voltage does not go below 0.5 V, the
                       A-side driver will turn off when the B-side voltage is above 0.7VCCB. If the B-side low
                       voltage goes below 0.4 V, the B-side pull-down driver is enabled and the B-side will only

                       be able to rise to 0.5 V until the A-side rises above 0.3VCCA, then the B-side will continue
                       to rise being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor. The VCCA is only used to provide
                       the 0.3VCCA reference to the A-side input comparators and for the power good detect
                       circuit. The PCA9517 logic and all I/Os are powered by the VCCB pin.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with an internal pull-up to VCCB and allows the user to select
                       when the repeater is active. This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on
                       power-up until after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an
                       I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus and
                       enabling part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
                       The enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in
                       an idle state to prevent system failures.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus).
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater
                       must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard mode and Fast
                       mode I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard mode I2C-bus devices only
                       specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic I2C-bus
                       system where Standard mode devices and multiple masters are possible. Under certain
                       conditions higher termination currents can be used.
                       Please see Application Note AN255, I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders for
                       additional information on sizing resistors and precautions when using more than one
                       PCA9517 in a system or using the PCA9517 in conjunction with other bus buffers.

7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the system master is running
                   on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 1.2 V bus. Both buses run at 400 kHz.
                   Master devices can be placed on either bus.

                      Fig 4. Typical application
                   The PCA9517 is 5 V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                   between 0.9 V to 5.5 V bus voltages and 2.7 V to 5.5 V bus voltages.
                   When the A-side of the PCA9517 is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator
                   detects the falling edge when it goes below 0.3VCCA and causes the internal driver on the
                   B-side to turn on, causing the B-side to pull down to about 0.5 V. When the B-side of the
                   PCA9517 falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes the
                   internal driver on the A-side to turn on and pull the A-side pin down to ground. In order to
                   illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 8 and Figure 9. If the
                   bus master in Figure 4 were to write to the slave through the PCA9517, waveforms shown
                   in Figure 8 would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission
                   except that the HIGH level may be as low as 0.9 V, and the turn on and turn off of the
                   acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
                   On the B bus side of the PCA9517, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset
                   from ground equal to the VOL of the PCA9517. After the 8th clock pulse, the data line will
                   be pulled to the VOL of the slave device which is very close to ground in this example. At
                   the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the LOW level set by the driver in the
                   PCA9517 for a short delay while the A bus side rises above 0.3VCCA then it continues
                   HIGH. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events require that the
                   LOW level on the B bus side at the input of the PCA9517 (VIL) be at or below 0.4 V to be
                   recognized by the PCA9517 and then transmitted to the A bus side.
                   Multiple PCA9517 A-sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 5), allowing all
                   nodes to communicate with each other.
                   Multiple PCA9517s can be connected in series (Figure 6) as long as the A-side is
                   connected to the B-side. I2C-bus slave devices can be connected to any of the bus
                   segments. The number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
                   delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.

[4]   The tPLH delay data from B-side to A-side is measured at 0.5 V on the B-side to 0.5VCCA on the A-side when VCCA is less than 2 V, and
      1.5 V on the A-side if VCCA is greater than 2 V.
[5]   Typical value measured with VCCA = 2.7 V at Tamb = 25 °C.
[6]   The proportional delay data from A-side to B-side is measured at 0.3VCCA on the A-side to 1.5 V on the B-side.
[7]   The enable pin, EN, should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state.

13. Soldering
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus PbSn soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 16) than a PbSn process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 6 and 7

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 16.
