1. General description
             The P82B715 is a bipolar IC intended for application in I2C-bus and derivative bus
             systems. While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus it permits
             extension of the practical separation distance between components on the I2C-bus by
             buffering both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines.
             The I2C-bus capacitance limit of 400 pF restricts practical communication distances to a
             few meters. Using one P82B715 at each end of a long cable (connecting Lx/Ly to Lx/Ly)
             reduces that cable’s loading on the linked I2C-buses by a factor of 10 and allows the total
             system capacitance load (all devices, cable, connectors, and traces or wires connected to
             the I2C-bus) to be around 3000 pF while the loading on each I2C-bus on the Sx/Sy sides
             remains below 400 pF. Longer cables or low-cost, general-purpose wiring may be used to
             link I2C-bus based modules without degrading noise margins. Multiple P82B715s can be
             connected together, linking their Lx/Ly ports, in a star or multi-point architecture as long as
             the total capacitance of the system is less than about 3000 pF and each bus at an Sx/Sy
             connection is well below 400 pF. This configuration, with the master and/or slave devices
             attached to the Sx/Sy port of each P82B715, has full multi-master communication
             capability. The P82B715 alone does not support voltage level translation, but it can be
             simply implemented using low cost transistors when required. There is no restriction on
             interconnecting the Sx/Sy I/Os, and, because the device output levels are always held
             within 100 mV of input drive levels, P82B715 is compatible with bus buffers that use
             voltage level offsets, e.g., PCA9511A, PCA9517, Sx/Sy side of P82B96.
             The lower VOL level and ability to operate with any master, slave or bus buffer is the
             primary advantage of the using the P82B715 for long distance buses at the disadvantage
             of not isolating bus capacitance like the P82B96 or PCA9600 are able to do. The primary
             disadvantage of the P82B96 and PCA9600 is that the static level offset needed to isolate
             bus capacitance does not allow these devices to operate with other bus buffers with
             special offset levels or with master/slaves that require a VIL lower than 0.8 V with noise
             margin. A proven quick design-in point-to-point/multi-point circuit (Figure 9) is included in
             Section 8.2 to allow rapid use of the P82B715 along with comparison waveforms so that
             the designer can clearly see the trade-offs between the P82B715 and the
             P82B96/PCA9600 and choose the type of device that is best for their application.

7. Functional description
                       The P82B715 is a dual bidirectional logic signal device having unity voltage gain in both
                       directions, but ×10 current amplification in one direction that allows increasing the
                       allowable I2C-bus system capacitance. It contains identical circuits for each I2C-bus signal
                       and requires no external directional control. It uses unidirectional analog current
                       amplification to increase the current sink capability of I2C-bus chips by a factor of 10 and
                       to change the I2C-bus specification limit of 400 pF to a 4 nF system limit. This allows
                       I2C-bus, or similar bus systems, to be extended over long distances using conventional
                       cables and without degradation of system performance.
                       P82B715 provides current amplification from its I2C-bus to its low-impedance or buffered
                       bus. Whenever current is flowing out of Sx, into an I2C-bus chip driving the I2C-bus LOW,
                       P82B715 will sink ten times that current into Lx to drive the buffered bus LOW (see
                       Figure 4).
                       To minimize interference and ensure stability, the current rise and fall times of the Lx drive
                       amplifier are internally controlled.
                       The P82B715 does not amplify signal currents flowing in the other direction, i.e., into Sx
                       from the I2C-bus. The Sx pin is driven LOW by current flowing out of Lx to the driver of that
                       buffered side.
                       The buffered bus logic LOW voltage at Lx simply drives the I2C-bus at Sx LOW via the
                       internal 30 Ω resistor. The buffer’s offset voltage (the difference between Sx and Lx)
                       depends on the current flowing in the sense resistor so it will be very small when the bus
                       currents are small, but it is guaranteed not to exceed 100 mV in either direction with full
                       static I2C-bus loading.
                       The unity voltage gain, with signal current amplification dependent on direction, preserves
                       the multi-master, bidirectional, open-collector/open-drain, characteristic of any connected
                       I2C-bus lines and provides these characteristics to the new low-impedance bus. Bus logic
                       signal voltage levels will be clamped at (VCC + 0.7 V), but otherwise are independent of
                       the supply voltage VCC.
                                                                       ISx = ILx

                       Ly pins becomes the LDA data line or LCL clock line.
                   7.3 VCC, GND: positive and negative supply pins
                       The power supply voltages at each P82B715 used in a system are normally nominally the
                       same. If they differ by a significant amount, noise margin may be sacrificed as the bus
                       HIGH level should not exceed the lowest of those supplies.
8. Application design-in information
                       By using two (or more) P82B715 ICs, a sub-system can be built that retains the interface
                       characteristics of a normal I2C-bus device so that the sub-system may be included in, or
                       added onto, any I2C-bus or related system.
                       The sub-system shown in Figure 5 features a low-impedance or buffered bus, capable of
                       driving large wiring capacitance.
                       The P82B715 will operate with a supply voltage from 3 V to 12.5 V but the logic signal
                       levels at Sx/Lx are independent of the chip’s supply. They remain at the levels presented
                       to the chip by the attached ICs. The maximum static I2C-bus sink current, 3 mA, flowing in
                       either direction in the internal current sense resistor, causes a difference, or offset voltage,
                       less than 100 mV between the bus logic LOW levels at Sx and Lx. This makes P82B715
                       fully compatible with all logic signal drivers, including TTL. The P82B715 cannot modify
                       the bus logic signal voltage levels but it contains internal diodes connected between Lx/Sx
                       and VCC that will conduct and limit the logic signal swing if the applied logic levels would
                       have exceeded the supply voltage by more than 0.7 V. In normal applications external
                       pull-up resistors will pull the connected buses up to the desired voltage HIGH level.
                       Usually this will be the chip supply, VCC, but for very low logic voltages it is necessary to
                       use a VCC of at least 3.3 V and preferably even higher. Note that full performance over
                       temperature is only guaranteed from 4.5 V. Specification de-ratings apply when its supply
                       voltage is reduced below 4.5 V. The absolute minimum VCC is 3 V.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                               P82B715
                                                                                                   I2C-bus extender
                   8.1 I2C-bus systems
                       As in standard I2C-bus systems, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic HIGH
                       levels on the buffered bus. (The standard open-collector configuration is retained.) The
                       value and number of pull-up resistors used is flexible and depends on the system
                       requirements and designer preferences.
                       If P82B715 ICs are to be permanently connected into a system it could be configured with
                       only one pull-up resistor on the buffered bus and none on the I2C-buses, but the system
                       design will be simplified, and performance improved, by fitting separate pull-ups on each
                       section of the bus. When a sub-system using P82B715 may be optionally connected to an
                       existing I2C-bus system that already has a pull-up, then the effects of the sub-system
                       pull-ups acting in parallel with the existing I2C-bus pull-up must be considered.
                8.1.1 Pull-up resistance calculation
                       When calculating the pull-up resistance values, the gain of the buffer introduces scaling
                       factors which must be applied to the system components. In practical systems the pull-up
                       resistance value is usually calculated to achieve the rise time requirement of the system.
                       As an approximation, this requirement will be satisfied for a standard 100 kHz system if
                       the time constant of the total system (product of the net resistance and net capacitance) is
                       set to 1 microsecond or less.
                       In systems using P82B715s, the most convenient way to achieve the total system
                       rise time requirement is by considering each bus node separately. Each of the I2C-bus
                       nodes, and the buffered bus node, is designed by selecting its pull-up resistor to provide
                       the required rise time by setting its time constant (product of the pull-up resistance and
                       load capacitance) equal to the I2C-bus rise time requirement. If each node complies, then
                       the system requirement will also be met with a small safety margin.
                       This arrangement, using multiple pull-ups as in Figure 6, provides the best system
                       performance and allows stand-alone operation of individual I2C-buses if parts of the
                       extended system are disconnected or re-connected. For each bus section the pull-up
                       resistor for a Standard-mode system is calculated as shown in Equation 1:
                                                 1 µs
                        R = -----------------------------------------------------                                                 (1)
                              C device + C wiring
                       Where: C device = sum of any connected device capacitances, and C wiring = total wiring
                       and stray capacitance on the bus section.
                       Remark: The 1 µs is an approximation, with a safety factor, to the theoretical
                       time-constant necessary to meet the Standard-mode 1 µs bus rise time specification in a
                       system with variable logic thresholds where the CMOS limits of 30 % and 70 % of VCC
                       apply. The actual RC requirement can be shown to be 1.18 µs. For a Fast-mode system,
                       and the same safety margin, replace the 1 µs with its 300 ns requirement.
                       If these capacitances cannot be measured or calculated then an approximation can be
                       made by assuming that each device presents 10 pF of load capacitance and 10 pF of
                       trace capacitance and that cables range from 50 pF to 100 pF per meter.
                       If only a single pull-up must be used then it must be placed on the buffered bus (as R2 in
                       Figure 6) and the associated total system capacitance calculated by combining the
                       individual bus capacitances into an equivalent capacitive loading on the buffered bus.

                      This equivalent capacitance is the sum of the capacitance on the buffered bus plus
                      10 times the sum of the capacitances on all the connected I2C-bus nodes. The calculated
                      value should not exceed 4 nF. The single buffered bus pull-up resistor is then calculated to
                      achieve the rise time requirement and it then provides the pull-up for the buffered bus and
                      for all other connected I2C-bus nodes included in the calculation.

                8.1.2 Calculating static bus drive currents
                      Figure 6 shows three P82B715s connected to a common buffered bus. The associated
                      bus capacitances are omitted for clarity and we assume the pull-up resistors have been
                      selected to give RC products equal to the bus rise time requirement. An I2C-bus chip
                      connected at I2C-bus 1 and holding the SDA bus LOW must sink the current flowing in its
                      local pull-up R1 plus, with assistance from the P82B715, the currents in R2, R3 and R4.
                      When I2C-bus 1 is LOW, the resistors R3 and R4 act to pull the bus nodes I2C-bus 2 and
                      I2C-bus 3, and their corresponding Sx pins, to a voltage higher than the voltage at their Lx
                      pins (which are LOW) so their buffer amplifiers will be inactive. The SDA at Sx of I2C-bus 2
                      and I2C-bus 3 is pulled LOW by the LOW at Lx via the internal 30 Ω resistor that links Lx
                      to Sx. So the effective current that must be sunk by the P82B715 buffer on I2C-bus 1, at its
                      Lx pin, is the sum of the currents in R2, R3 and R4. The Sx current that must be sunk by
                      an I2C-bus chip at I2C-bus 1, due to the buffer gain action, is 1⁄10 of the Lx current. So the
                      effective pull-up, determining the current to be sunk by an I2C-bus chip at I2C-bus 1, is R1
                      in parallel with resistors 10 times the values of R2, R3 and R4. If R1 = R3 = R4 = 10 kΩ,
                      and R2 = 1 kΩ, the effective pull-up load at I2C-bus 1 is
                      10 kΩ || 10 kΩ || 100 kΩ || 100 kΩ = 4.55 kΩ. (‘||’ means ‘in parallel with’.)
                      The same calculation applies for I2C-bus 2 or I2C-bus 3.
                      To calculate the current sunk by the Lx pin of the buffer at I2C-bus 1, note that the current
                      in R1 is sunk directly by the IC at I2C-bus 1. The buffer therefore sinks only the currents
                      flowing in R2, R3, and R4 so the effective pull-up is R2 in parallel with R3 and R4.
                      In this example that is 1 kΩ || 10 kΩ || 10 kΩ = 833 Ω. For a 5.5 V supply and 0.4 V LOW,

                   The P82B715 has a static sink rating of 30 mA at Lx. The requirement is that the pull-up
                   on the buffered bus, in parallel with all other pull-ups that it is indirectly pulling LOW on Sx
                   pins of other P82B715 ICs, will not cause this 30 mA limit to be exceeded.
                   The minimum pull-up resistance in a 5 V ± 10 % system is 170 Ω.
                   The general requirement is given in Equation 2:
                   V CC ( max ) – 0.4 V
                   ------------------------------------------ < 30 mA                                                                                                       (2)

                   Where: RPU = parallel combination of all pull-up resistors driven by the Lx pin of the
                   P82B715.

                     Fig 8.      Typical arrangement and calculations for an IPMB analog radial shelf
                   Figure 8 shows P82B715 in an analog radial IPMB shelf application.
                   In this example the total system capacitance is 2800 pF, but it is distributed over 18
                   different bus sections and no section has a capacitance greater than 200 pF.
                   If every individual bus section is designed to rise at least as fast as the IPMB requirement,
                   then when any driver releases the bus, all bus sections will rise together and no amplifiers
                   in the P82B715s will be activated or, if one is activated, it can only slow the system bus
                   rise to its own rate and that has been designed to meet the requirement.
                   It is then only necessary to calculate the equivalent static bus pull-up loading and to
                   ensure that it exceeds the specification requirement. The calculated loadings meet the
                   requirements.
                   Note that in this example only one of the four IPMB lines is shown and the usual switching

                            bus
                            With many variables (cable length/capacitance, local capacitive loading on each I2C-bus,
                            bus voltages, and bus speed), optimizing a design can be complex and requires
                            significant study of the application note information. The following circuit and simplified
                            approach has been checked to provide adequate performance in the typical 100 kHz
                            application and can be easily implemented by just using the values and circuit shown for
                            either point-to-point application, up to 30 meters long, or in multiple point applications if
                            additional nodes need to be added along the way.

  Fig 9.     Quick design-in point-to-point/multi-point circuit for 5 V bus
                            Specific information on this circuit implementation:
                              • The pull-up on each I2C-bus is (VCC − 0.4 V) / 1 mA = 4.6 kΩ, using 4.7 kΩ as the
                                 nearest usual value.
                              • The net pull-up on the cable bus can be (VCC − 0.5 V) / (21 − n) mA where
                                 n = total number of P82B715 modules on the cable. When there are only two
                                 modules, one each end of the cable, the pull-up = (4.5 / 19) = 237 Ω. Make the
                                 pull-ups at each end of the cable equal. Signalling is bidirectional so there is no
                                 advantage optimizing for any one direction. The pull-up at each end will be 474 Ω,
                                 using 470 Ω as the nearest usual value.
                              • The 100 kHz rise time requirement is 1 µs. Meeting this requires the product of the
                                 bus capacitance and pull-up resistor on each bus section to be less than 1.18 µs. That
                                 provides one capacitance limit. With 4.7 kΩ pull-ups the I2C-bus limit is 250 pF each,
                                 while the 235 Ω sets a cable bus limit at 5000 pF.

                         • The 300 ns bus fall time, and the Standard-mode I2C-bus limit specification limit of
                            400 pF, must also be observed. If the 400 pF limit is observed the fall time limit will be
                            met. Allocate about 1⁄3 of this 400 pF limit, or 133 pF, to each I2C-bus leaving 2⁄3, or
                            266 pF, for the cable bus loading as it will appear at the Sx/Sy pins. The ×10 gain of
                            P82B715 allows the loading at Lx/Ly to be 10 times the load at Sx/Sy, so 2660 pF
                            maximum. The loading at Lx/Ly due to the other standard buses is 133 pF each. For
                            just one remote module the cable capacitance may then be up to
                            (2660 − 133) = 2530 pF. For typical twisted pair or flat cables, as used for telephony or
                            Ethernet (Cat5e) wiring, that capacitance is around 50 pF to 70 pF / meter so the
                            cable could, in theory, be up to 50 m long. From practical experience, 30 m has
                            proven a safe cable length to be driven in this simple way, up to 100 kHz, with the
                            values shown. Longer distances and higher speeds are possible but require more
                            careful design.
                         • If there are severe EMI/ESD tests to be passed then large clamp diodes can be fitted
                            on the cable bus at each module to VCC and to ground. They may be diodes rated for
                            this ESD application, or simply large rectifiers (1N4000). The low-impedance bus
                            easily accommodates their relatively large capacitance. The P82B715 does not
                            provide any isolation between Lx and Sx, so this clamping method provides the best
                            protection for the lower voltage I2C-bus parts. The VCC supply should be bypassed
                            using low-impedance capacitors. Zeners may be fitted to prevent the supply rising due
                            to rectification during very large interference.
                   8.3 Comparison of P82B715 versus P82B96 in the quick design-in
                       point-to-point/multi-point circuit
                       The lower VOL level and ability to operate with any master, slave or bus buffer is the
                       primary advantage of the using the P82B715 for long distance buses at the disadvantage
                       of not isolating bus capacitance like the P82B96 or PCA9600 are able to do. The primary
                       disadvantage of the P82B96 and PCA9600 is that the static level offset needed to isolate
                       bus capacitance does not allow these devices to operate with other bus buffers with
                       special offset levels or with master/slaves that require a VIL lower than 0.8 V with noise
                       margin. Waveforms using the circuit shown in Figure 9 are shown in Figure 10 using the
                       P82B715 and Figure 11 using the P82B96 so that the designer can clearly see these
                       trade-offs and choose the type of device that is best for their application.

                   Figure 10 shows the I2C-bus waveforms from the long distance line as seen by the slave
                   on the P82B715 Sx/Sy I/O. Notice that the offset is small and the static levels remain
                   under 0.4 V. Coupling of SDA to SCL is negligible when SCL is LOW but slight
                   cross-coupling of SCL to SDA is visible when SDA is HIGH and therefore higher

                     Fig 11. Clock and data signal output to a slave from Sx/Sy of a P82B96 replacing one of
                               the P82B715s
                   Figure 11 shows the waveforms on the Sx/Sy I/O as seen by the slave when a P82B96 is
                   substituted. P82B96 uses a static level offset on the slave side to isolate noise and
                   loadings on either side of this device. The nominal offset is 0.8 V and that VOL may create
                   worst-case design tolerance problems with slave devices that do not use I2C-bus
                   switching levels, for example TTL levels. It also precludes operation with other bus buffers
                   using special non-compliant I2C-bus levels.
                   The P82B96 does not actually interfere with the operation of compliant I2C-bus devices
                   down to at least 2.7 V supply or even with TTL devices (that switch around 1.4 V). It only
                   causes a theoretical worst case design tolerance problem because TTL devices have a
                   worst case 0.8 V requirement. A TTL designer must center the actual switch point
                   between the two specified limits, 0.8 V and 2.1 V, so in reality it cannot ever approach the
                   problem 0.8 V theoretical limit.
                   The PCA9600 is an improved version of the P82B96 offering 1 MHz operation and lower,
                   more closely controlled VOL on the Sx and Sy pins.

[1]    Operation with reduced performance is possible down to 3 V. Typical static sinking performance is not degraded at 3 V, but the dynamic
       sink currents while the output is being driven through 0.5VCC are reduced and can increase fall times. Timing-critical designs should
       accommodate the guaranteed minimums.
[2]    Buffer is passive in this test. The Sx/Sy sink current flows via an internal resistor to the driver connected at the Lx/Ly I/O.
[3]    A conventional input-output delay will not be observed in the Sx/Lx voltage waveforms because the input and output pins are internally
       tied with a 30 Ω resistor so they show equal logic voltage levels, to within 100 mV. When connected in an I2C-bus system, an Sx/Sy
       input pin cannot rise/fall until the buffered bus load at the output pin has been driven by the internal amplifier. This test measures the bus
       propagation delay caused to falling or rising voltages at the Lx/Ly output (as well as the Sx/Sy input) by the amplifier’s response time.
       The figure given is measured with a drive current as shown in Figure 12. Because this is a dynamic bus test in which a corresponding
       bus driving IC has an output voltage well above 0.4 V, 6 mA is used instead of the static 3 mA.
[4]    The signal path Lx to Sx and Ly to Sy is passive via the internal 30 Ω resistor. There is no amplifier involved and essentially no signal
       propagation delay.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 15) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 6 and 7

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 15.

14. Soldering of through-hole mount packages
                14.1 Introduction to soldering through-hole mount packages
                     This text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.
                     Wave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages
                     on a printed-circuit board.
                14.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave
                     Driven by legislation and environmental forces the worldwide use of lead-free solder
                     pastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from
                     3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 °C or 265 °C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb
                     or Pb-free respectively.
                     The total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.
                     The device may be mounted up to the seating plane, but the temperature of the plastic
                     body must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (Tstg(max)). If the
                     printed-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately
                     after soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.
                14.3 Manual soldering
                     Apply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the
                     seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If the temperature of the soldering iron bit is
                     less than 300 °C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is
                     between 300 °C and 400 °C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.
