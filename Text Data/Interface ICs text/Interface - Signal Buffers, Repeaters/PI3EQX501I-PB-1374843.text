PI3EQX501I
5.0Gbps, 1-Channel, USB3.0 ReDriver
Description                                                              Features
Diodes Incorporated PI3EQX501I is a low power, high                        ¼¼USB 3.0 compatible
performance 5.0 Gbps signal ReDriver designed specifically
                                                                           ¼¼Full compliancy to USB 3.0 Super Speed standard
for the USB 3.0 protocol. The device provides programmable
equalization and De-Emphasis to opmize performance over                    ¼¼One 5.0Gbps differential signal pairs

                                                                           ¼¼100Ω Differential CML I/O’s
PI3EQX501I supports one 100Ω Differential CML data I/O’s

user’s platform. The integrated equalization circuitry provides
                                                                           ¼¼Automatic Receiver Detect
flexibility with signal integrity of the signal before the ReDriver.
A low-level input signal detection and output squelch function is          ¼¼Low Power : 165mW
provided. The channels’ input signal level determines whether              ¼¼Auto “Slumber” mode for adaptive power management
the output is active.
                                                                           ¼¼Single Supply Voltage: 3.3V
The PI3EQX501I also includes a receiver detect function. The
receiver detection loop will be active again if the corresponding          ¼¼Packaging: 8-Pin TDFN 2 x 2 mm
channel’s signal detector is idle for longer than 7.3mS.
The channel will then move to Unplug Mode if load not detected,
                                                                         Application
or it will return to Low Power Mode (Slumber Mode) due to inactivity.
