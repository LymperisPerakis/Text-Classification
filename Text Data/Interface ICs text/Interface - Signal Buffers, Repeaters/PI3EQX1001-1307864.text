Power Management
Notebooks, netbooks, and other power sensitive consumer devices require judicious use of power in order to maximize battery life.
In order to minimize the power consumption of our devices, Diodes has added an additional adaptive power management feature.
When a signal detector is idle for longer than 1.3ms, the corresponding channel will move to low power mode ONLY. (It means both
channels will move to low power mode individually).
In the low power mode, the signal detector will still be monitoring the input channel. If a channel is in low power mode and the input
signal is detected, the corresponding channel will wake-up immediately. If a channel is in low power mode and the signal detector
is idle longer than 6ms, the receiver detection loop will be active again. If load is not detected, then the Channel will move to Device
Unplug Mode and monitor the load continuously. If load is detected, it will return to Low Power Mode and receiver detection will be
active again per 6ms.
