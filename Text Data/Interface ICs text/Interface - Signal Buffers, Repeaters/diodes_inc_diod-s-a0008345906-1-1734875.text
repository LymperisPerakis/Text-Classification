1. Typical values with VCC(A) = 1.1 V, VCC(B) = 5 V.
2. VIL speciﬁcation is for the falling edge seen by the port A input. VILC is for the static LOW levels seen by the port A input resulting in port B output staying
     LOW.

                                                                                                                PI6ULS5V9509
Functional Description
The PI6ULS5V9509 is a level-translating I2C-bus/SMBus repeater. It can provide bidirectional level translation between low
voltage (down to 1.1V) and high voltage (2.5V to 5.5V) in mixed-mode applications, and it enables I2C and similar bus systems to
be extended without degradation of performance even during level shifting.
The PI6ULS5V9509 enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus for both voltage and capacitance, accommodating
more I2C devices or longer trace length. It also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing bidirectional buffering for both the
data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus allowing two buses of 400pF to be connected in an I2C application.
The bus port B drivers are compliant with SMBus I/O levels, while port A uses a current-sensing mechanism to detect the input or
output LOW signal, which prevents bus lockup. Port A uses a 1mA current source for pullup and a 200Ω pulldown driver. This
result in a LOW on the port A accommodating smaller voltage swings. The output pulldown on the port A internal buffer LOW is
set for approximately 0.2V, while the input threshold of the internal buffer is set about 50mV lower than that of the output voltage
LOW. When the port A I/O is driven LOW internally, the LOW is not recognized as a LOW by the input. This prevents a lockup
condition from occurring. The output pulldown on the port B drives a hard LOW, and the input level is set at 0.3 of SMBus or I2C-
bus voltage level, which enables port B to connect to any other I2C-bus devices or buffer.
The PI6ULS5V9509 drivers are not enabled unless VCC(A) is above 0.8V and VCC(B) is above 2.5V. The enable (EN) pin can also be
used to turn the drivers on and off under system control. Caution should be observed to only change the state of the EN pin when
the bus is idle.
Application Information
A typical application is shown in Figure 6. In this example, the system master is running on a 1.1V I2C-bus while the slave is
connected to a 3.3 V bus. Both buses run at 400kHz. Master devices can be placed on either bus.
When port B of the PI6ULS5V9509 is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a CMOS hysteresis detects the falling edge when it
goes below 0.3VCC(B) and causes the internal driver on port A to turn on, causing port A to pull down to about 0.2 V. When port A
of the PI6ULS5V9509 falls, ﬁrst a comparator detects the falling edge and causes the internal driver on port B to turn on and pull
the port B pin down to ground. In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 7 and Figure 8. If
the bus master in Figure 6 writes to the slave through the PI6ULS5V9509, waveforms shown in Figure 7 are observed on the B bus.
This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission.
On the A bus side of the PI6ULS5V9509, the clock and data lines have a positive offset from ground equal to the VOL of the
PI6ULS5V9509. After the eighth clock pulse, the data line is pulled to the VOL of the master device, which is very close to ground
in this example. At the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the LOW level set by the driver in the PI6ULS5V9509 for a
short delay while the B bus side rises above 0.5 VCC(B), then it continues HIGH. It is important to note that any arbitration or clock-
stretching events require that the LOW level on the A bus side at the input of the PI6ULS5V9509 (VIL) is below VILC to be
recognized by the PI6ULS5V9509 and then transmitted to the B bus side.
