Features                                                             Description
    4 channel, bidirectional buffer isolates capacitance and
     allows 540pF on either side of the device at 1 MHz and          The PI6ULS5V9627A is a CMOS integrated circuit intended
     up to 4000 pF at lower speeds                                   for Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) I2C-bus or SMBus applications. It
    Voltage level translation from 0.6V to 5.5V and from            can provide level shifting between low voltage (down to 0.6V)
     2.2V to 5.5V                                                    and higher voltage (2.2V to 5.5V) in mixed-mode applications.
    Port A operating supply voltage range of 0.6V to 5.5V           The PI6ULS5V9627A enables the system designer to isolate
     with normal levels( 0.4VCC(A) + 0.8 V ≤ VCC(B) )                two halves of a bus for both voltage and capacitance,
    Port B operating supply voltage range of 2.2V to 5.5V           accommodating more I2C devices or longer trace length. It
     with static offset level                                        also permits extension of the I2C-bus by providing
    5V tolerant I2C-bus and enable pins                             bidirectional buffering for both the data (SDA) and the clock
    0 Hz to 1 MHz clock frequency (the maximum system               (SCL) lines, thus enabling two buses of 540 pF at 1 MHz or up
     operating frequency may be less than 1MHz because of            to 4000 pF at lower speeds. The SDA and SCL pins are
     the delays added by the repeater)                               overvoltage tolerant and are high-impedance when the
    Active HIGH repeater enable input referenced to VCC(B)          PI6ULS5V9627A is unpowered.
    Open-drain input/outputs                                        The 2.2V to 5.5V bus port B drivers have the static level offset,
    Latching free operation                                         while the adjustable voltage bus port A drivers eliminate the
    Supports arbitration and clock stretching across the            static offset voltage. This results in a LOW on the port B
     repeater                                                        translating into a nearly 0V LOW on the port A which
    Accommodates Standard-mode, Fast-mode and Fast-                 accommodates the smaller voltage swings of lower voltage
     mode Plus I2C-bus devices, SMBus (standard and high             logic. The EN pin is referenced to VCC(B) and can also be used
     power mode), PMBus and multiple masters                         to turn the drivers on and off under system control.
    Powered-off high-impedance I2C-bus pins
    ESD protection exceeds 8000V HBM per JESD22-A114

  (4)    The tPLH2 delay data from port B to port A is measured at 0.45 V on port B to 0.5VCC(A) on port A.
  (5)    The tTLH of the bus is determined by the pull-up resistance (1.35 k Ω) and the total capacitance (50 pF).
  (6)    The proportional delay data from port A to port B is measured at 0.5VCC(A) on port A to 0.5VCC(B) on port B.
  (7)    The enable pin EN, should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port are in an idle state.
  (8)    VCC(A) may be as high as 5.5 V for over-voltage tolerance but 0.4VCC(A) + 0.8 V ≤ VCC(B) for the channels to be enabled and functional normally.

Functional Description
The PI6ULS5V9627A enables I2C-bus or SMBus translation down to VCC(A) as low as 0.6 V without degradation of system
performance. The PI6ULS5V9627A contains two bidirectional open-drain buffers specifically designed to support
up-translation/down-translation between the low voltage (as low as 0.6 V) and a 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V I2C-bus or SMBus. All inputs
and I/Os are overvoltage tolerant to 5.5 V even when the device is unpowered (VCC(B) and/or VCC(A) = 0 V).
The PI6ULS5V9627A includes a power-up circuit that keeps the output drivers turned off until VCC(B) is above 2.2 V and until after
the internal reference circuits have settled at about 400 μs, and the VCC(A) is above 0.6 V. VCC(B) and VCC(A) can be applied in any
sequence at power-up.
The PCA9627A includes a VCC(A) over-voltage disable that turns the channel off if 0.4VCC(A) + 0.8 V > VCC(B).
The PCA9627A logic and all I/Os are powered by the VCC(B) pins.
The B-side drivers operate from 2.2V to 5.5V. The output low level of port B internal buffer is approximately 0.55 V, while the
input voltage must be 90mV lower (0.45V) or even more lower. The nearly 0.5V low signal is called a buffered low. When the
B-side I/O is driven low internally, the low is not recognized as a low by the input. This feature prevents a lockup condition from
occurring when the input low condition is released. This type of design on B port prevents it from being used in series with
another PI6ULS5V9627A (B side) or similar devices, because they don’t recognize buffer low signals as a valid low .
The A-side drivers operate from 0.6V to 5.5V. The output low level of port A internal buffer is nearly 0V, while the input low level
is set at 0.35VCC(A) to accommodate the need for a lower LOW level in systems where the low voltage side supply voltage is as low
as 0.6 V. Port A of two or more PI6ULS5V9627As can be connected together to allow a star topography with port A on the
common bus. And port A can be connected directly to any other buffer with static or dynamic offset voltage. Multiple
PI6ULS5V9627As can be connected in series, port A to port B, with no build-up in offset voltage with only time of ﬂight delays to
consider.
After power-up and with the EN HIGH, a LOW level on port A (below 0.3VCC(A)) turns the corresponding port B driver (either
SDA or SCL) on and drives port B down to about 0.55V. When port A rises above 0.3VCC(A), the port B pull-down driver is turned
off and the external pull-up resistor pulls the pin HIGH. When port B falls first and goes below 0.4 V, the port A driver is turned
on and port A pulls down to about 0 V. The port A pull-down is not enabled unless the port B voltage goes below 0.4V. If the port
B low voltage goes below 0.4 V, the port B pull-down driver is enabled and port B will only be able to rise to 0.55 V until port A
rises above 0.3VCC(A), then port B will continue to rise being pulled up by the external pull-up resistor. The VCC(A) is only used to
provide the 0.35VCC(A) reference to the port A input comparators and for the power good detect circuit. The PI6ULS5V9627A logic
and all I/Os are powered by the VCC(B) pin.
The EN pin is active HIGH with thresholds referenced to VCC(B) and an internal pull-up to VCC(B) that maintains the device active
unless the user selects to disable the repeater to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until after the system power-up reset. It
should never change state during an I2C-bus operation because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus and enabling
part way through a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled. The enable does not switch the internal reference
circuits so the 400μs delay is only seen when VCC(B) comes up. The enable pin should only change state when the global bus and the
repeater port are in an idle state to prevent system failures.
As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic HIGH levels on the buffered bus (standard

open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus). The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the
repeater must have a pull-up resistor. This part designed to work with Standard mode, Fast-mode and Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus
devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus devices only specify 3mA output drive; this limits the
termination current to 3mA in a generic I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices, Fast-mode devices and multiple masters
are possible. When only Fast-mode Plus devices are used with 30mA at 5V drive strength, then lower value pull-up resistors can be
used. The B-side RC should not be less than 67.5ns because shorter RCs increase the turnaround bounce when the B-side
transitions from being externally driven to pulled down by its offset buffer.
Application Information
A typical application is shown in Figure 6. In this example, the system master is running on a 3.3V I2C-bus while the slave is
connected to a 1.2V bus. Both buses run at 1MHz. Master devices can be placed on either bus.
The PI6ULS5V9627A is 5V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate between 0.6V to 5.5V bus voltages
and 2.2V to 5.5V bus voltages.
                                                    Figure 6: Typical Application
When port A of the PI6ULS5V9627A is pulled LOW by a driver on the I2C-bus, a comparator detects the falling edge when it goes
below 0.3VCC(A) and causes the internal driver on port B to turn on, causing port B to pull down to about 0.5 V. When port B of the
PI6ULS5V9627A falls, first a CMOS hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes the internal driver on port A to turn
on and pull the port A pin down to ground. In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 9 and
Figure 10. If the bus master in Figure 6 were to write to the slave through the PI6ULS5V9627A, waveforms shown in Figure 9
would be observed on the A bus. This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission except that the HIGH level may be as low as 0.6 V,
and the turn on and turn off of the acknowledge signals are slightly delayed.
On the B bus side of the PI6ULS5V9627A, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset from ground equal to the VOL of the
PI6ULS5V9627A. After the eighth clock pulse, the data line will be pulled to the VOL of the slave device which is very close to
ground in this example. At the end of the acknowledge, the level rises only to the LOW level set by the driver in the
PI6ULS5V9627A for a short delay while the A bus side rises above 0.3VCC(A) then it continues HIGH. It is important to note that
any arbitration or clock stretching events require that the LOW level on the B bus side at the input of the PI6ULS5V9627A (VIL) be
at or below 0.4 V to be recognized by the PI6ULS5V9627A and then transmitted to the A bus side.
Multiple PI6ULS5V9627A port A sides can be connected in a star configuration (Figure 7), allowing all nodes to communicate
with each other.
Multiple PI6ULS5V9627As can be connected in series as long as port A is connected to port B (Figure 8). I2C-bus slave devices can
be connected to any of the bus segments. The number of devices that can be connected in series is limited by repeater
delay/time-of-flight considerations on the maximum bus speed requirements.
