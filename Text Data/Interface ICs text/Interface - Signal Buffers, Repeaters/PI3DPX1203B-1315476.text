both input and output termination set to 200K and high impedance respectively. Individual channel enabling is done
through the I2C register programming.

5.2 I2C Operation
The integrated I2C interface operates as a slave device mode. Standard I2C mode (100 Kbps) is supported with 7-bit addressing and
data byte format 8-bit.
The device supports Read/Write. The bytes must be accessed in sequential order from the lowest to the highest byte with the ability to
stop after any complete byte has been transferred. Address bits A3 to A0 are programmable to support multiple chips environment.
The Data is loaded until a Stop sequence is issued.

Transferring Data
Every byte put on the SDA line must be 8-bit long. Each byte has to be followed by an acknowledge bit. Data is transferred with the
most significant bit (MSB) first (see the I2C Data Transfer diagram). It will never hold the clock line SCL LOW to force the master
into a wait state.
Acknowledge
Data transfer with acknowledge is required from the master. When the master releases the SDA line (HIGH) during the acknowledge
clock pulse, it will pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse so that it remains stable LOW during the HIGH period
of this clock pulse as indicated in the I2C Data Transfer diagram. It will generate an acknowledge after each byte has been received.
Data Transfer
A data transfer cycle begins with the master issuing a start bit. After recognizing a start bit, it will watch the next byte of information
for a match with its address setting. When a match is found it will respond with a read or write of data on the following clocks. Each
byte must be followed by an acknowledge bit, except for the last byte of a read cycle which ends with a stop bit. Data is transferred
with the most significant bit (MSB) first.
Start & Stop Conditions
A HIGH to LOW transition on the SDA line while SCL is HIGH indicates a START condition. A LOW to HIGH transition on the
SDA line while SCL is HIGH defines a STOP condition.

 Note:
 (1) Channel Isolation measured using a vector-network analyzer (VNA) with -15dBm power level applied to the adjacent input. The VNA detects the signal at the out-
 put of the victim channel. All other inputs and outputs are terminated with 50Ω.
 (2) Guaranteed by design and characterization.
 (3) Please refer more data in the VIN / VOUT plot. VOUT changes withe EQ and FG setting. Both the ReDriver and the Sink device system should be carefully
 designed to ensure sink-device compliance.

7. Applications
7.1 Reference Schematic
   •   Determine the loss profile between transmitter and receiver.
   •   Based upon the loss profile and signal swing, determine the optimal equalization settings.
   •   Select appropriate voltage output swing.
   •   If required, select the correct differential pair polarity.
   •   To set voltage logic levels on configuration pins, use a 5-kΩ pull-up for high level, tie pin to GND for low level,and place a
       5-kΩ pull-up and 5-kΩ pull-down for HiZ.

                     (1) The HBR3 receiver equalizer includes a CTLE cascaded with a one-tap adaptive DFE with
                     a feedback coefficient limited to < 50mV. The DFE behavior is described below.
                                        yk = xk - d1* sgn (yk-1)
                     where:
                              yk is the DFE differential output voltage
                              y*k is the decision function output voltage
                              xk is the differential input voltage after CTLE
                              d1 is the feedback coefficient
                              k is the UI sample

7.6 General Power and Ground Guideline
To provide a clean power supply for high-speed device, few recommendations are listed below:
•    Power (VDD) and ground (GND) pins should be connected to corresponding power planes of the printed circuit board directly
     without passing through any resistor.
•    The thickness of the PCB dielectric layer should be minimized such that the VDD and GND planes create low inductance paths.
•    One low-ESR 0.1uF decoupling capacitor should be mounted at each VDD pin or should supply bypassing for at most two VDD
     pins. Capacitors of smaller body size, i.e. 0402 package, is more preferable as the insertion loss is lower. The capacitor should be
     placed next to the VDD pin.
•    One capacitor with capacitance in the range of 4.7uF to 10uF should be incorporated in the power supply decoupling design as
     well. It can be either tantalum or an ultra-low ESR ceramic.
•    A ferrite bead for isolating the power supply for Pericom high-speed device from the power supplies for other parts on the
     printed circuit board should be implemented.
•    Several thermal ground vias must be required on the thermal pad. 25-mil or less pad size and 14-mil or less finished hole are
     recommended.
                                                                     V DD P la ne

7.7 High-speed signal Routing
Well-designed layout is essential to prevent signal reflection:
•    For 90Ω differential impedance, width-spacing-width micro-strip of 6-7-6 mils is recommended; for 100Ω differential imped-
     ance, width-spacing-width micro-strip of 5-7-5 mils is recommended.
•    Differential impedance tolerance is targeted at ±15%.

•    Ground referencing is highly recommended. If unavoidable, stitching capacitors of 0.1uF should be placed when reference plane
     is changed.

•    To keep the reference unchanged, stitching vias must be used when changing layers.
•    Differential pair should maintain symmetrical routing whenever possible. The intra-pair skew of micro-strip should be less than

•    For minimal crosstalk, inter-pair spacing between two differential micro-strip pairs should be at least 20 mils or 4 times the
     dielectric thickness of the PCB.
•    Wider trace width of each differential pair is recommended in order to minimize the loss, especially for long routing. More con-
     sistent PCB impedance can be achieved by a PCB vendor if trace is wider.
•    Differential signals should be routed away from noise sources and other switching signals on the printed circuit board.
•     To minimize signal loss and jitter, tight bend is not recommended. All angles α should be at least 135 degrees. The inner air gap
     A should be at least 4 times the dielectric thickness of the PCB.

8.3 Tape & Reel Materials and Design
8.3.1 Carrier Tape
The Pocketed Carrier Tape is made of Conductive Polystyrene plus Carbon material (or equivalent). The surface resistivity is 106
Ω/sq. maximum. Pocket tapes are designed so that the component remains in position for automatic handling after cover tape is
removed. Each pocket has a hole in the center for automated sensing if the pocket is occupied or not, thus facilitating device removal.
Sprocket holes along the edge of the center tape enable direct feeding into automated board assembly equipment. See Figures 3 and 4
for carrier tape dimensions.
8.3.2 Cover Tape
Cover tape is made of Anti-static Transparent Polyester film. The surface resistivity is 107 Ω /Sq. Minimum to 1011Ohm sq. maxi-
mum. The cover tape is heat-sealed to the edges of the carrier tape to encase the devices in the pockets. The force to peel back the
cover tape from the carrier tape shall be a MEAN value of 20 to 80gm (2N to 0.8N).
8.3.3 Reel
The device loading orientation is in compliance with EIA-481, current version (Figure 2). The loaded carrier tape is wound onto
either a 13-inch reel, (Figure 4) or 7-inch reel. The reel is made of Anti-static High-Impact Polystyrene. The surface resistivity 107 Ω /
sq. minimum to 1011 Ω /sq. max.

NOTES:
1. A0, B0, and K0 are determined by component size. The cavity must restrict lateral movement of component to 0.5mm maximum for 8mm and 12mm wide tape
and to 1.0mm maximum for 16,24,32, and 44mm wide carrier. The maximum component rotation within the cavity must be limited to 20o maximum for 8 and 12 mm
carrier tapes and 10o maximum for 16 through 44mm.
2. Tape and components will pass around reel with radius “R” without damage.
3. S1 does not apply to carrier width ≥32mm because carrier has sprocket holes on both sides of carrier where Do≥S1.
4. So does not exist for carrier ≤32mm because carrier does not have sprocket hole on both side of carrier.
