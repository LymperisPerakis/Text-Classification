Functional Description                                                                     With ISL88694 SMA
SMBus Overview                                                                     VTRIPH
The SMBus or I2C bus is a 2-wire multimaster bus, meaning
that more than one device connected to the bus is capable of
controlling it. Master devices communicate to other master or
slave devices using one clock and one data line. These are
both bidirectional.                                                                                 With RC
                                                                                                    Pullup
To allow multimaster operation without bus contention, it is
necessary to allow each bus to be connected to a positive                   VTRIPL
supply voltage through a current-source or pull-up resistor (see
“System Diagram” on page 3). When the bus is free, both lines               R = 15.8K
are HIGH. The output stages of devices connected to the bus                 C = 200pF
must have an open-drain or open-collector to perform the
wired-AND function.
Simple pull-up resistors on the clock and data lines work well
                                                                   FIGURE 8. ISL88694 SMBus SYSTEM BOOST PULL-UP
unless there are long signal lines or many devices connected                    COMPARED TO RESISTOR PULL-UP (VDD = 5.5V)
to the bus. Then, the combined capacitance of the bus
increases the rise time on the signal so much that the
                                                                                          With ISL88694 SMA
communication becomes unreliable or fails to meet the bus
timing specifications. Smaller resistors can sometimes
                                                                               VTRIPH
compensate for the extra capacitance, but this increases the
current consumption when the signal lines are pulled LOW.
ISL88694 Operation
                                                                                                  With RC
To improve the operation of the SMBus where larger bus                                            Pullup
capacitance exists, the ISL88694 provides active pull-up using              VTRIPL
switched current sources. When the bus is idle and both lines
are HIGH, a standby pull-up current of 100µA is used to
maintain the signal level while minimizing power consumption.
When either of the two signals is pulled LOW, an active pull-up              R = 15.8K
                                                                             C = 200pF
current of 275µA maintains a good VOL noise margin.
When the bus line is released, it is pulled high by the ISL88694
active current until the voltage exceeds the VTRIPL level for a
                                                                   FIGURE 9. ISL88694 SMBus SYSTEM BOOST PULL-UP

on the signal line. When the ISL88694 detects a valid rising
edge, a 2.2mA boost current pulls the bus line high very             VDD
quickly (see Figure 8). This boost current turns off when the
                                                                     VTRIPH
input level reaches the VTRIPH threshold and the pull-up
                                                                                                             With SMA
current returns to the active level. If both inputs are HIGH, the
pull-up current drops to the standby level of 100µA.
