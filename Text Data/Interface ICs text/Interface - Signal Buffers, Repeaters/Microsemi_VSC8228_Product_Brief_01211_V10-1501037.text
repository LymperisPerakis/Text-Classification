An analog signal detect function is integrated into both channels. In                                                                                  • Typical power: 360 mW
the retimer mode, the device monitors the incoming data for run-length
violations and K28.5- symbols. The inputs on both the transmit and
receive channels can be looped back to the outputs of the opposite
channels for diagnostic purposes. The device provides a built-in
pattern generator and checker. An optional half-rate clock for SGMII
applications is provided on the receive channel output.
A high degree of signal integrity is maintained via differential I/O, on-
chip input and output terminations, input equalization, and output de-
emphasis. The programmable input equalization circuit compensates
for the frequency limitations of long printed circuit board (PCB) traces,
backplanes, connectors, and cables. Equalization, de-emphasis,
output drive levels, data rate, and other features are conﬁgured through
industry standard serial interfaces (Two-wire or SPI).
The device may be powered from a single 1.2 V supply, single 1.8 V
supply, or both a 1.2 V and 1.8 V supply. The 1.8 V supply is required
to meet the LVPECL output swing levels. The device has current-mode
logic (CML) inputs and outputs that can be AC-coupled for LVPECL and
LVDS compatibility. The IC is packaged in a compact 10 mm x 10 mm,
64-pin TQFP package. Typical power dissipation for a 1.2 V supply is
360 mW.
