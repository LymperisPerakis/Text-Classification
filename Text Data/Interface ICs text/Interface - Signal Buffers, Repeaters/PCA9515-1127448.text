                 I2C-bus repeater
                 Rev. 09 — 23 April 2009                                                Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9515 is a BiCMOS integrated circuit intended for application in I2C-bus and
             SMBus systems.
             While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system, it permits
             extension of the I2C-bus by buffering both the data (SDAn) and the clock (SCLn) lines,
             thus enabling two buses of 400 pF.
             The I2C-bus capacitance limit of 400 pF restricts the number of devices and bus length.
             Using the PCA9515 enables the system designer to isolate two halves of a bus, thus more
             devices or longer length can be accommodated. It can also be used to run two buses, one
             at 5 V and the other at 3.3 V or a 400 kHz and 100 kHz bus, where the 100 kHz bus is
             isolated when 400 kHz operation of the other is required.
             Two or more PCA9515s cannot be put in series. The PCA9515 design does not allow
             this configuration. Since there is no direction pin, slightly different ‘legal’ low voltage levels
             are used to avoid lock-up conditions between the input and the output. A ‘regular low’
             applied at the input of a PCA9515 will be propagated as a ‘buffered low’ with a slightly
             higher value. When this ‘buffered low’ is applied to another PCA9515, PCA9516A, or
             PCA9518A in series, the second PCA9515, PCA9516A, or PCA9518A will not recognize
             it as a ‘regular low’ and will not propagate it as a ‘buffered low’ again. The
             PCA9510A/9511A/9513A/9514A and PCA9512A cannot be used in series with the
             PCA9515, PCA9516A, or PCA9518A but can be used in series with themselves since
             they use shifting instead of static offsets to avoid lock-up conditions.
             The PCA9515 SCLn/SDAn Ci is about 200 pF versus the normal < 10 pF when VCC = 0 V.
             The newer PCA9515A should be used in applications where power is secured to the
             repeater but an active bus remains on either set of SCLn/SDAn pins to prevent this
             increase in bus loading. Additionally, the PCA9515A has a wider voltage range of 2.3 V to
             3.6 V and can be used in applications with lower voltage supply constraints.

                         The output pull-down of each internal buffer is set for approximately 0.5 V, while the input
                         threshold of each internal buffer is set about 0.07 V lower, when the output is internally
                         driven LOW. This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring.

6. Functional description
                       The PCA9515 BiCMOS integrated circuit contains two identical buffer circuits which
                       enable I2C-bus and similar bus systems to be extended without degradation of system
                       performance. (Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9515”.)
                       The PCA9515 BiCMOS integrated circuit contains two bidirectional open-drain buffers
                       specifically designed to support the standard low-level-contention arbitration of the
                       I2C-bus. Except during arbitration or clock stretching, the PCA9515 acts like a pair of
                       non-inverting, open-drain buffers, one for SDA and one for SCL.
                   6.1 Enable
                       The EN pin is active HIGH with an internal pull-up and allows the user to select when the
                       repeater is active. This can be used to isolate a badly behaved slave on power-up until
                       after the system power-up reset. It should never change state during an I2C-bus operation
                       because disabling during a bus operation will hang the bus and enabling part way through
                       a bus cycle could confuse the I2C-bus parts being enabled.
                       The enable pin (EN) should only change state when the global bus and the repeater port
                       are in an idle state to prevent system failures.
                   6.2 I2C-bus systems
                       As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                       HIGH levels on the buffered bus. (Standard open-collector configuration of the I2C-bus.)
                       The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of the repeater
                       must have a pull-up resistor. This part is designed to work with Standard-mode and
                       Fast-mode I2C-bus devices in addition to SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus devices
                       only specify 3 mA output drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic
                       I2C-bus system where Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible. Under
                       certain conditions, higher termination currents can be used. Please see application note
                       AN255, “I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders” for additional information on sizing
                       resistors and precautions when using more than one PCA9515 in a system or using the
                       PCA9515 in conjunction with the P82B96.

7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 4. In this example, the system master is running
                   on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slave is connected to a 5 V bus. Both buses run at 100 kHz
                   unless the slave bus is isolated and then the master bus can run at 400 kHz. Master
                   devices can be placed on either bus.

                     Fig 4.   Typical application
                   The PCA9515 is 5 V tolerant so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                   between the different bus voltages.
                   When one side of the PCA9515 is pulled LOW by a device on the I2C-bus, a CMOS
                   hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and causes an internal driver on the other
                   side to turn on, thus causing the other side to also go LOW. The side driven LOW by the
                   PCA9515 will typically be at VOL = 0.5 V.
                   In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 5 and
                   Figure 6. If the bus master in Figure 4 were to write to the slave through the PCA9515, we
                   would see the waveform shown in Figure 5 on Bus 0. This looks like a normal I2C-bus
                   transmission until the falling edge of the 8th clock pulse. At that point, the master releases
                   the data line (SDA) while the slave pulls it LOW through the PCA9515. Because the VOL of
                   the PCA9515 is typically around 0.5 V, a step in the SDA will be seen. After the master
                   has transmitted the 9th clock pulse, the slave releases the data line.
                   On the Bus 1 side of the PCA9515, the clock and data lines would have a positive offset
                   from ground equal to the VOL of the PCA9515. After the 8th clock pulse, the data line will
                   be pulled to the VOL of the slave device that is very close to ground in our example.
                   It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events on Bus 1 require that
                   the VOL of the devices on Bus 1 be 70 mV below the VOL of the PCA9515 (see VOL−VILc in
                   Section 9 “Static characteristics”) to be recognized by the PCA9515 and then transmitted
                   to Bus 0.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
