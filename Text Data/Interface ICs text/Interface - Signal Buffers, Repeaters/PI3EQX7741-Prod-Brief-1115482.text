PI3EQX7741
5.0Gbps, 1-port, (2-Channel) USB 3.0 ReDriver™
Pericom Semiconductor’s PI3EQX7741 is a low power, high
performance 5.0 Gbps signal ReDriver™ designed specifically                Features
for the USB 3.0 protocol.  The device provides programmable                • USB 3.0 compatible
equalization, De-Emphasis, and input threshold controls to
                                                                           • Two 5.0Gbps differential signal pairs
optimize performance over a variety of physical mediums by
reducing Inter-Symbol Interference.  PI3EQX7741 supports two               • Adjustable Receiver Equalization

a switch fabric, over cable, or to extend the signals across other
distant data pathways on the user’s platform.  The integrated              • Pin Configured Output Emphasis Control
equalization circuitry provides flexibility with signal integrity of       • Input signal level detect and squelch for each channel
the signal before the ReDriver.  A low-level input signal detection        • Automatic Receiver Detect with digital enable/disable
and output squelch function is provided for each channel.
Each channel operates fully independently. When the channels               • Low Power : ~328mW
are enabled EN_x# = 0 and operating, that channels’ input                  • Auto "Slumber" mode for adaptive power management
signal level (on xI+/-) determines whether the output is active. If the
                                                                           • Stand-by Mode – Power Down State
input signal level of the channel falls below the active threshold
level (Vth-) then the outputs are driven to the common mode                • Single Supply Voltage: 3.3V
voltage.  In addition to signal conditioning, when EN_x# = 1, the          • Packaging: 20-Contact TQFN (4x4mm)
device enters a low power standby mode.  The PI3EQX7741 also
includes a fully programmable receiver detect function.
When the RxDet pin is pulled high, automatic receiver detection         Figure1
will be active.  The receiver detection loop will be active again
if the corresponding channel’s signal detector is idle for longer
than 25mS. The channel will then move to Unplug Mode if
                                                                                                                              External
