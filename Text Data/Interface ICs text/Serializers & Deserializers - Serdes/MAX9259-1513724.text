Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute

                               Transmit/Serial Clock. UART transmit or I2C serial-clock output with internal 30kI
          18          TX/SCL   pullup to IOVDD. In UART mode, TX/SCL is the Tx output of the MAX9259’s UART. In I2C
                               mode, TX/SCL is the SCL output of the MAX9260’s I2C master.
                               Power-Down. Active-low power-down input requires external pulldown or pullup

                               Error. Active-low open-drain video data error output with internal pullup to IOVDD.
                               ERR goes low when the number of decoding errors during normal operation exceed a
          20             ERR
                               programmed error threshold or when at least one PRBS error is detected during PRBS
                               test. ERR is output high when PWDN = low.
    21, 31, 50, 60    IOGND    Input/Output Ground
                               Open-Drain Lock Output with Internal Pullup to IOVDD. LOCK = high indicates PLLs
                               are locked with correct serial-word-boundary alignment. LOCK = low indicates PLLs are
          22            LOCK
                               not locked or incorrect serial-word-boundary alignment. LOCK remains low when the
                               configuration link is active. LOCK is output high when PWDN = low.

                               latched on the selected edge of PCLKOUT.
                               Data Output[0:28]. Parallel data outputs. Output data can be strobed on the selected
                               edge of PCLKOUT. Set BWS = low (24-bit mode) to use DOUT0–DOUT20 (RGB and
                      DOUT0–
   26–29, 32–40,               SYNC). DOUT21–DOUT28 are not used in 24-bit mode and are set to low. Set BWS =
                     DOUT27,
    42–49, 52–59               high (32-bit mode) to use DOUT0–DOUT28 (RGB, SYNC, and two extra outputs).
                   DOUT28/MCLK
                               DOUT28 can be used to output MCLK (see the Additional MCLK Output for Audio
                               Applications section).
                               1.8V to 3.3V Logic I/O Power Supply. Bypass IOVDD to IOGND with 0.1FF and 0.001FF

                               Spread-Spectrum Enable. Parallel output spread-spectrum enable input requires
                               external pulldown or pullup resistors. The state of SSEN latches upon power-up or when
          61            SSEN   resuming from power-down mode (PWDN = low). Set SSEN = high for Q2% spread
                               spectrum on the parallel outputs. Set SSEN = low to use the parallel outputs without
                               spread spectrum.
                               Data-Rate Select. Data-rate range-selection input requires external pulldown or pullup
                               resistors. Set DRS = high for parallel input data rates of 8.33MHz to 16.66MHz (24-bit
          62             DRS
                               mode) or 6.25MHz to 12.5MHz (32-bit mode). Set DRS = low for parallel input data rates
                               of 16.66MHz to 104MHz (24-bit mode) or 12.5MHz to 78MHz (32-bit mode).
