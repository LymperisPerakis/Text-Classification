The MAX24205 and MAX24210 are flexible, high-                ♦ Input Clocks
performance timing and clock synthesizer ICs that
                                                                  ♦   One Crystal Input
include a DPLL and two independent APLLs. When
locked to one of two input clock signals, the device              ♦   Two Differential or CMOS/TTL Inputs
performs any-to-any frequency conversion. From any                ♦   Differential to 750MHz, CMOS/TTL to 125MHz
input clock frequency 1Hz to 750MHz the device can
                                                                  ♦   Continuous Input Clock Quality Monitoring
produce frequency-locked APLL output frequencies up
to 750MHz and as many as 10 output clock signals that             ♦   Automatic or Manual Clock Selection
are integer divisors of the APLL frequencies. Input jitter        ♦   Hitless Reference Switching on Loss of Input
can be attenuated by an internal low-bandwidth DPLL.
The DPLL also provides truly hitless switching between       ♦ Low-Bandwidth DPLL
input clocks and a high-resolution holdover capability.           ♦   Programmable Bandwidth, 0.5mHz to 400Hz
Input switching can be manual or automatic. Using only
a low-cost crystal or oscillator, the device can also serve       ♦   Attenuates Input Jitter up to Several UI
as a frequency synthesizer IC. Output jitter is typically         ♦   Free-Run or Holdover on Loss of All Inputs

3. Detailed Features
3.1  Input Block Features
   • Two input clocks, differential or CMOS/TTL signal format
   • Input clocks can be any frequency from 1Hz up to 750MHz
   • Supported telecom frequencies include PDH, SDH, Synchronous Ethernet, OTU-1, OTU-2, OTU-3
   • Per-input fractional scaling (i.e. multiplying by N÷D where N is a 16-bit integer and D is a 32-bit integer and
     N<D) to undo 64B/66B and FEC scaling (e.g. 64/66, 238/255, 237/255, 236/255)
   • All inputs constantly monitored by programmable activity monitors and frequency monitors
   • Fast activity monitor can disqualify the selected reference after a few missing clock cycles
   • Frequency measurement with 1.25ppm resolution
   • Frequency monitor thresholds with 1.25ppm or 5ppb resolution
3.2  DPLL Features
   • Very high-resolution DPLL architecture
   • Sophisticated state machine automatically transitions between free-run, locked, and holdover states
   • Revertive or nonrevertive reference selection algorithm
   • Programmable bandwidth from 0.5mHz to 400Hz
   • Separately configurable acquisition bandwidth and locked bandwidth
   • Programmable damping factor to balance lock time with peaking: 1.2, 2.5, 5, 10 or 20
   • Multiple phase detectors: phase/frequency and multicycle
   • Phase/frequency locking (±360° capture) or nearest-edge phase locking (±180° capture)
   • Multicycle phase detection and locking (up to ±8191UI) improves jitter tolerance and lock time
   • Phase build-out in response to reference switching for true hitless switching
   • Less than 1 ns output clock phase transient during phase build-out
   • Output phase adjustment up to ±200ns in 6ps steps with respect to selected input reference
   • High-resolution frequency and phase measurement
   • Holdover frequency averaging over 1 second, 5.8 minute and 93.2 minute intervals
   • Fast detection of input clock failure and transition to holdover mode
   • Numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) mode allows system software to steer DPLL frequency
3.3  APLL Features
   • Two independent APLLs simultaneously product two frequency families from the same reference clock or
     different reference clocks
   • Very high-resolution fractional scaling (i.e. non-integer multiplication)
   • Output jitter is typically 0.35 to 0.5ps RMS and can be as low as 0.24ps RMS (12kHz to 20MHz)
   • Telecom output frequencies include 622.08MHz for SONET/SDH and 625MHz for Synchronous Ethernet
   • Bypass mode for each APLL supports system testing and allows device to be used in fanout applications
3.4  Output Clock Features
   • Ten low-jitter output clocks
   • Each output can be one differential output or two CMOS/TTL outputs
   • Outputs easily interface with CML, LVDS, LVPECL, HSTL, SSTL, HCSL components
   • Each output can be any integer divisor of either APLL output clock
   • Supported telecom frequencies include PDH, SDH, Synchronous Ethernet, OTN
   • Can also produce clock frequencies for microprocessors, ASICs, FPGAs and other components
   • Per-output delay adjustment, per-output enable/disable
3.5  General Features
   • SPI serial microprocessor interface
   • Optional automatic self-configuration at power-up from external EEPROM memory
   • Four general-purpose I/O pins
   • Register set can be write-protected
   • Can operate as DPLL+APLL for jitter filtering and hitless switching or as APLL only
   • Local oscillator can be nearly any frequency from 10MHz to 750MHz
   • Internal compensation for local oscillator frequency error
                                                                                                                    3
