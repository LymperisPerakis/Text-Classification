1. General description
             The PTN3700 is a 1.8 V simple mobile interface link bridge IC which can function both as
             a transmitter-serializer or a receiver-deserializer for RGB888 video data. When configured
             as transmitter (using input pin TX/RX), the PTN3700 serializes parallel CMOS video input
             data into 1, 2 or 3 subLVDS-based high-speed serial data channels. When configured as
             receiver, the PTN3700 deserializes up to 3 high-speed serial data channels into parallel
             CMOS video data signals.
             The parallel interface of the PTN3700 is based on the conventional and widely used 24-bit
             wide data bus for RGB video data, plus active LOW HS (Horizontal Synchronization) and
             VS (Vertical Synchronization) signals, and an active HIGH DE (Data Enable) signal. An
             additional two auxiliary bits A[1:0] are provided to permit signaling of miscellaneous status
             or mode information across the link to the display. The serial interface link of the PTN3700
             is based on the open Simple Mobile Interface Link (SMILi) definition. In order to keep
             power low while accommodating various display sizes (e.g., up to 24-bit, 60 frames per
             second XVGA), the number of high-speed serial channels (‘lanes’) is configurable from
             1 to 3 depending on the bandwidth needed. The data link speed is determined by the
             PCLK (Pixel Clock) rate and the number of serial channels selected.
             In order to maintain a low power profile, the PTN3700 has three power modes,
             determined by detection of an active input clock and by shutdown pin XSD. In Shutdown
             mode (XSD = LOW), the PTN3700 is completely inactive and consumes a minimum of
             current. In Standby mode (XSD = HIGH), the device is ready to switch to Active mode as
             soon as an active input clock signal is detected, and assume normal link operation.
             In Transmitter mode, the PTN3700 performs parity calculation on the input data (R[7:0],
             G[7:0], B[7:0] plus HS, VS and DE data bits) and adds an odd parity bit CP to the serial
             transmitted data stream. The PTN3700 in Receiver mode also integrates a parity
             checking function, which checks for odd parity across the decoded input word (R[7:0],
             G[7:0], B[7:0] plus HS, VS and DE data bits), and indicates whether a parity error has
             occurred on its CPO out pin (active HIGH). When a parity error occurs, the most recent
             error-free pixel data will be output instead of the received invalid pixel data.
             PTN3700 in Receiver mode offers an optional advanced frame mixing feature, which
             allows 18-bit displays to effectively display 24-bit color resolution by applying a
             patent-pending pixel data processing algorithm to the 24-bit video input data.
             One of two serial transmission methods is selectable: pseudo source synchronous
             transmission based on the pixel clock, or true source synchronous transmission based on
             the bit clock. The latter uses a patent-pending methodology characterized by zero
             overhead and operation guaranteed free from false pixel synchronization.

                                                                                                          1.8 V simple mobile interface link bridge IC
                               The PTN3700 automatically rotates the order of the essential signals (parallel CMOS and
                               high-speed serial data and clock) depending on whether it is operating as transmitter or as
                               receiver (using pin TX/RX). In addition, two Pinning Select bits (inputs PSEL[1:0]) allow for
                               four additional signal order configurations. This allows for various topologies of printed
                               circuit board or flex foil layout without crossing of traces, and enables the easy
                               introduction of PTN3700 into an existing ‘parallel’ design avoiding board re-layout.
                               The PTN3700 is available in a 56-ball VFBGA package and operates across a
                               temperature range of 40 C to +85 C.

 XSD                            CMOS            Shutdown mode input pin, active LOW, puts PTN3700 in lowest-power mode
                                                by deactivating all circuitry. When HIGH, PTN3700 is either in Active mode or

 FSS                            CMOS            Fully Source Synchronous select pin. When LOW, PTN3700 uses pseudo
                                                source synchronous serial transmission mode with the pixel clock as both the
                                                reference frequency and the frame boundary delineation. When HIGH,
                                                PTN3700 uses true source synchronous transmission with a serial
                                                Double Data Rate (DDR) bit clock for the serial data. Embedded
                                                synchronization words are encoded for pixel synchronization. On both
                                                Receiver and Transmitter, the settings of the FSS pin should match. Otherwise
                                                the link will not function.

                                                                                                  1.8 V simple mobile interface link bridge IC
7. Functional description
                   7.1 General
                       A complete simple mobile interface link consists of one PTN3700 configured as
                       transmitter (see Figure 1); two, three or four differential-pair high-speed signaling
                       channels; and one PTN3700 configured as receiver (see Figure 2). Link power and
                       ground are supplied to pins VDD and GND respectively (power and ground should be
                       routed and decoupled to analog supply pin VDDA and ground pin GNDA separately for
                       lowest jitter operation). Configuration of either transmitter or receiver mode is achieved by
                       strapping the CMOS input pin TX/RX HIGH or LOW, respectively.
                       Configured as transmitter, PTN3700 accepts parallel CMOS input data including color
                       pixel data (R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0]), three control bits HS (horizontal synchronization), VS
                       (vertical synchronization), DE (data enable), auxiliary bits A[1:0] and pixel clock PCLK.
                       The PTN3700 calculates a parity bit (excluding the auxiliary bits, see Section 7.6) and
                       serializes the data and outputs as a high-speed serial data stream on up to three
                       subLVDS differential outputs (D0+, D0, D1+, D1, D2+, D2) depending on the
                       serialization mode selected by pins LS[1:0] (see Section 7.2). An integrated low-jitter PLL
                       generates internally the bit clock used for serialization of video input data, parity bit and
                       control bits, and outputs along with the serial output data a differential pixel clock on
                       differential subLVDS output pair CLK+ and CLK.
                       Configured as receiver, PTN3700 accepts serial differential data inputs D0+, D0, D1+,
                       D1, D2+, D2 and differential input clock CLK+ and CLK from the signaling channel and
                       deserializes the received data into parallel output data on pins R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0], HS,
                       VS, DE and A[1:0] along with the PLL-regenerated pixel clock PCLK. Also, a parity
                       checking function is performed on the incoming R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0], HS, VS, DE bits and
                       an error flagged by signaling a HIGH state on CMOS output pin CPO (see Section 7.6).
                       Serialization mode pins LS[1:0] need to be selected according to the expected
                       serialization mode (see Section 7.2) to correctly receive and decode the up to three
                       subLVDS differential serial inputs. To minimize EMI, the parallel outputs can be configured
                       by tying pin F/XS either HIGH or LOW to output fast or slow output slew rates respectively.
                       The PTN3700 is capable of operating in either of two distinct transmission modes: Pseudo
                       Source Synchronous mode (PSS), and Full (or ‘true’) Source Synchronous mode (FSS),
                       selected by CMOS input pin FSS. In PSS mode, the pixel clock PCLK is used both as the
                       transmission frequency reference and its rising edge as the delineation of the start of a
                       pixel. This transmission mode relies on the Receiver PLL to reconstruct the bit clock at the
                       receiving end. In FSS mode, the bit clock is transmitted (in DDR mode) instead of the pixel
                       clock. Rather than achieve frame boundary detection using the pixel clock edge as in PSS
                       mode, in FSS mode the Transmitter encodes ‘synchronization words’ over the link which
                       are detected and used for data to pixel alignment by the Receiver. This methodology
                       guarantees false-synchronization-free transmission with zero protocol overhead.
                       The PTN3700 can be put into very low ‘Shutdown’ power state by tying CMOS input pin
                       XSD LOW. Additionally, the PTN3700 will automatically enter a low-power ‘Standby’ mode
                       when no active input clock is detected on its inputs (see Section 7.5).

                    7.2 Link programmability
                             The number of high-speed serial channels used is programmed by CMOS input pins
                             LS[1:0]. For a given link consisting of a transmitter and receiver pair of PTN3700’s, the
                             number of channels used must be programmed identically or the link will malfunction. The
                             PTN3700, once programmed, will assume the corresponding serialization ratio as shown
                             in Table 5. When pins LS[1:0] are both HIGH, the PTN3700 is put in a test mode which is
                             used for production testing purposes only and should not be used in application.
                             The 1-lane mode is typically meant for smaller video display formats (e.g., QVGA to
                             HVGA), while the 2-lane mode is typically used for display formats like HVGA and VGA.
                             The 3-lane mode supports larger display formats such as VGA or XGA. Please see
                             Section 12.1 for more information.

                    7.3 Versatile signal mirroring programmability
                             In order to provide flexibility for different signal order and flow requirements in different
                             applications, the PTN3700 can be programmed to mirror its signal order for the parallel
                             and serial I/Os independently using the PSEL[1:0] inputs. The signal order also changes
                             as a function of the TX/RX input by mirroring signals in such a way that the Transmitter
                             and Receiver in a given link can be connected without signal crossings by simply
                             opposing the two instances of PTN3700 and rotating one of them by 180 degrees. The
                             truth table for the versatile signal mirroring scheme is shown in Table 6 and Table 7. The
                             individual ball mappings are given in Figure 4 through Figure 11.

                   7.4 High-speed data channel protocol options
                       The PTN3700 maps the transmission protocol in accordance with the serialization mode
                       selected by pins LS[1:0]. In Mode 00 (1-channel), all RGB, parity and synchronization bits
                       are serialized onto a single 30-bit sequence. In Mode 01 (2-channel), these bits are
                       mapped onto two simultaneous 15-bit sequences divided across two lanes. In Mode 10
                       (3-channel), the 30 bits are serialized onto three simultaneous 10-bit sequences.
                       The serial bit mapping is different between pseudo-source-synchronous mode
                       (FSS = LOW) and fully source-synchronous mode (FSS = HIGH). The mapping of the
                       data bits in pseudo-source synchronous mode is shown in Figure 12, Figure 13 and
                       Figure 14. (Note that the CLK in Mode 01 has an asymmetrical duty cycle of 8/15). The
                       serial bit mapping in fully source-synchronous mode is shown in Figure 15, Figure 16 and
                       Figure 17. Note that the fully source synchronous transmission mode is not dependent on
                       the phase of PCLK for receiver synchronization.

                                                                                                  1.8 V simple mobile interface link bridge IC
                7.4.3 PLL, PCLK, CLK and pixel synchronization
               7.4.3.1 Pixel synchronization
                       PSS mode: The serial clock CLK provides the word boundaries explicitly for frame
                       synchronization. At the receiver side, a PLL is needed to re-generate the bit clock,
                       translating to a higher receiver power dissipation.
                       FSS mode: The serial clock CLK is truly synchronous with the serial data. Embedded
                       synchronization words are transmitted in the non-active display area for pixel
                       synchronization. The receiver PLL is powered down during this mode, hence the lower
                       power consumption when compared with PSS mode. The special embedded
                       synchronization words are guaranteed by design to never trigger false synchronization.
               7.4.3.2 PLL
                       The PLL locks onto the PCLK input during transmit mode or the CLK input during receiver
                       mode. It generates an internal high-speed clock, which is phase-aligned to the input clock.
                       The PLL logic uses the lane select and transmit/receive status to determine the necessary
                       PLL bandwidth settings and PLL divider values automatically. The PLL is able to track
                       spread spectrum clocking to reduce EMI. The spread spectrum clock modulation
                       frequency can be from 30 kHz to 33 kHz.
                       Transmitter: The internally generated clock is always aligned to the input clock PCLK.
                         • PSS mode: Refer to Section 7.4.1.
                         • FSS mode: The output clock CLK is Double Data Rate (DDR) and both clock edges
                           are aligned to the data output.
                       Receiver:
                         • PSS mode: The PLL generates an internal clock at serial bit frequency and locks to
                           the input clock CLK.
                         • FSS mode: The receiver uses Double Data Rate (DDR) input clock CLK, which is
                           aligned to the data already.
                7.4.4 HS, VS and DE signal usage in various PTN3700 modes
                       When frame mixing is not used in PSS mode, VS, HS, DE, R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0] are
                       treated as arbitrary user data. In this mode, PTN3700 functions as a pure serializer and
                       deserializer, and is unaware of the meaning or polarity of VS, HS, DE, R[7:0], G[7:0],
                       B[7:0]. In FSS mode, PTN3700 makes use of VS, HS and DE to implement pixel
                       synchronization with embedded sync words in the non-active display area.
                       When frame mixing is used, VS, HS, DE and R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0] are used to implement
                       NXP-patented frame mixing algorithm.
                       Table 8 summarizes the requirements of VS, HS, DE and RGB in various modes.

                       [1]  ‘X’ signifies that PTN3700 handles this signal transparently, i.e., data is transmitted and received as-is.
                       [2]  ‘R, G, B’ signifies that R, G, B video data have to be input according to the exact chosen pin configuration of
                            PTN3700, specifically:
                            a) Bit order reversal is not allowed, even if both the transmit data and receive data are reversed in bit order.
                                For example, the MSB of ‘R’ color from video source must be input as ‘R7’.
                            b) ‘R’ must be used for red color, ‘G’ for green color, and ‘B’ for blue color.
               7.4.4.1 PSS mode
                       HS, VS and DE are treated by PTN3700 in the same way as RGB signals in PSS mode;
                       that is, HS, VS, and DE are serialized and transmitted transparently by the PTN3700
                       transmitter, and transparently received and deserialized by PTN3700 receiver. Data
                       Enable (DE) signal is typically used to signify the active display area from the non-active
                       display area.
                       In the case that advanced frame mixing is not used:
                         • DE signal can be tied HIGH or LOW, for displays not using DE signal.
                         • HS and VS can be active HIGH or active LOW.
               7.4.4.2 FSS mode
                       In FSS mode, PTN3700 uses true source synchronous transmission with a serial
                       Double Data Rate (DDR) bit clock for the serial data.
                       FSS mode requires the following operating conditions:
                         • Active LOW HS
                         • Active LOW VS
                         • Active HIGH DE
                       In FSS mode, DE = 1 means active video, and PTN3700 generates embedded sync
                       words when DE = 0. DE, VS and HS must be actively driven according to the typical video
                       screen figure shown in Figure 18.

                   7.5 Power modes
                          The PTN3700 has three different power modes to minimize power consumption of the link
                          as a function of link activity: Shutdown mode, Standby mode, and Active mode. The truth
                          table for the three power modes is shown in Table 9 and Table 10.
                            • Shutdown mode: By driving input pin XSD LOW, the PTN3700 assumes lowest
                                power mode. All internal logic circuits are reset during this mode, and the link is
                                completely inactive. The transmitter high-speed serial output channels are put in
                                high-impedance state, and the receiver high-speed serial input channels are pulled
                                LOW. The receiver CMOS parallel outputs will all be set HIGH with the exception of
                                DE and PCLK which are reset LOW. However, the input buffers for the transmitter
                                remain active, so it is recommended to stop PCLK and RGB data to achieve the
                                lowest Shutdown mode power.
                            • Standby mode: When pin XSD is set HIGH but no input clock is active, the PTN3700
                                detects inactivity of the clock3 and remains in a low-power Standby mode until an
                                active input clock is detected. The transmitter serial outputs, receiver serial inputs and
                                receiver parallel outputs all behave identically to their respective states in Shutdown
                                mode.
                            • Active mode: When pin XSD is set HIGH and an active input clock is detected,
                                PTN3700 will assume normal link operation. Current consumption depends on the
                                PCLK frequency, number of lanes, FSS/PSS mode, data pattern, etc.

                       In Transmitter mode, PTN3700 calculates an odd parity bit and merges this into the
                       serialized output data stream to allow the receiver to detect whether parity has been
                       violated for its received input data. The parity bit CP is calculated across the 27-bit input
                       data word (R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0], HS, VS and DE) for every pixel transmitted, as shown in
                       Table 11. Note that the auxiliary bits A[1:0] are excluded from the parity calculation.

                             H           running                                                      odd                                      L

                             H           stopped                                             X or floating                             undefined

                       In Receiver mode, the received encoded parity bit CP is compared against the received
                       27-bit input data word (R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0], HS, VS and DE) for every pixel, and an error
                       is flagged by setting parity error output CPO HIGH for the duration of the pixel clock period
                       in which the error was detected. Note that the auxiliary output bits A[1:0] are excluded
                       from the parity detection.
                       In addition, during the pixel clock period in which the error occurs, the last valid pixel word
                       is output to R[7:0], G[7:0], B[7:0], HS, VS and DE instead of the current erroneous pixel
                       data. The last valid pixel word is defined as the data prior to the first parity error detected
                       in any concatenation of parity errors.
                       If a parity error is detected but no valid previous pixel information is available, the receiver
                       will output values R[7:0] = G[7:0] = B[7:0] = HS = VS = HIGH, and DE = LOW. The truth
                       table for receiver parity function is shown in Table 12. Note that the auxiliary bits A[1:0] are
                       not affected by the last valid pixel repetition.

                     7.7 Frame Mixing and Advanced Frame Mixing
                             When PTN3700 is configured as Receiver (TX/RX = LOW), the CMOS input FM selects
                             whether the Frame Mixing function is turned on (FM = HIGH) or off (FM = LOW). (When
                             PTN3700 is configured as Transmitter (TX/RX = HIGH), the Frame Mixing function is not
                             available, and the FM input should not be used.)
                             Advanced Frame Mixing is a proprietary pixel mapping algorithm that features the ability
                             to render full 24-bit color resolution (provided 24-bit source data is input) using an 18-bit or
                             an 18-bit plus display.
                             When Frame Mixing is off, the full 24-bit data path is maintained unaltered for the link
                             (transparent).
                             When Frame Mixing is enabled, the algorithm maps the incoming 24-bit data to the 18-bit

                             (R[7:2]FM, G[7:2]FM and B[7:2]FM) contain the altered information as calculated by the

                   7.8 Auxiliary signals
                       The two auxiliary bits A[1:0] are user-supplied bits that can be additionally serialized and
                       deserialized by the PTN3700 in transmitter and receiver modes, respectively. These
                       auxiliary bits are transparent to the PTN3700 and can be used to transmit and receive
                       miscellaneous status or mode information across the link to the display. Note that the
                       auxiliary bits A[1:0] are excluded from the parity calculation and detection in the
                       transmitter and receiver modes respectively. Even in the event of parity error being
                       detected in the receiver mode, A[1:0] will still be deserialized as they are detected by the
                       receiver.

12. Application information
                12.1 Typical lane and PCLK configurations
                        The PTN3700 supports PCLK (pixel clock) frequencies from 4 MHz to 65 MHz over 1, 2 or
                        3 data lanes. Table 23 shows the typical number of data lanes needed, assuming blanking
                        overhead of 20 %. Note that 20 % overhead is an example value for illustration/calculation
                        purposes only and not a requirement.

                12.2 Pin configurations for various topologies of PCB
                        There are two input pins, PSEL1 and PSEL0, on the PTN3700 that allow for pinning order
                        configurations.
                        PSEL1 will change the pinning order of the serial signals, and allow for various topologies
                        of PCB or flex layout without crossing the high-speed differential traces. The example
                        shown in Figure 23 has set PSEL1 = 0 at receiver side, and PSEL1 = 1 at the transmitter
                        to avoid the traces crossing. Figure 24 shows another configuration, which has PSEL1 = 1
                        at receiver, and PSEL1 = 0 at transmitter.
                        PSEL0 can configure the pinning order of the parallel signals, and enables the easy
                        introduction of the PTN3700 into an existing parallel design avoiding board re-layout.
                        Figure 23 and Figure 24 show two configuration examples.

                                                                                                 1.8 V simple mobile interface link bridge IC
                12.3 Power decoupling configuration
                     The PTN3700 needs 1.8 V VDD and 1.8 V VDDA. Both can share the same voltage
                     regulator, and use a 10  resistor for isolation. The recommended power configuration of
                     the decoupling is shown in Figure 25. It is recommended to install one 0.1 F ceramic
                     capacitor for each VDD pin and one 0.01 F ceramic capacitor for VDDA pin, and the lead
                     length between the IC power pins and decoupling capacitors should be as short as
                     possible.
                                                                                                                10 Ω

                12.4 PCB/Flex layout guideline
                     The high data rate at the serial I/O requires some specific implementations in the PCB and
                     flex layout design. The following practices can be used as guideline:
                       • The differential pair must be routed symmetrically. Keep all four pairs of differential
                          signal traces the same length. The difference in trace length should be less than
                          20 mils.
                       • Maintain 100  differential impedance.
                       • Do not route signals over any plane split; use only one ground plane underneath the
                          differential signals.
                       • Avoid any discontinuity for signal integrity. Differential pairs should be routed on the
                          same layer and the number of vias on the differential traces should be minimized. Test
                          points should be placed in series and symmetrically. Stubs should not be introduced
                          on the differential pairs.
                12.5 Power-on/power-off requirement
                     PTN3700 does not have any external reset pin. Internally, there is Power-On Reset (POR)
                     circuitry to reset the whole IC at power-up. In order to guarantee that POR works properly,
                     the supply voltage VDD must be powered up from ground level, as illustrated in Figure 26.
                                                                                                       Unexpected behavior.
                                                                                                       Power-up from a higher than GND level
                                                                                                       might set PTN3700 to an unstable state
                                                                                                       without proper POR.

                     It is recommended to have long enough of a power-off time to let VDD discharge
                     completely, reaching to ground level.
                     If the supply voltage VDD cannot be guaranteed to start from ground level, it is
                     recommended to hold the XSD pin at LOW during power-on.

15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                15.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 37) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 24 and 25

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 37.
