data into LVDS(Low Voltage Differential Signaling)                                  • Wide dot clock range, 8-160MHz suited for
data stream. The transmitter can be programmed for ris-                                 TV Signal: NTSC(12.27MHz) - 1080p(148.5MHz)
ing edge or falling edge clocks through a dedicated pin.                                PC Signal: QVGA(8MHz) - WUXGA(154MHz)
At a transmit clock frequency of 160MHz, 24bits of                                  • Supports 1.8V single power supply
RGB data and 4bits of timing and control data                                       • 1.8V/2.5V/3.3V CMOS inputs are supported by
(HSYNC, VSYNC, DE, CONT1) are transmitted at an                                         setting IOVCC=1.8V/2.5V/3.3V
effective rate of 1120Mbps per LVDS channel.
                                                                                    • LVDS swing is reducible by RS-pin to reduce EMI
                                                                                        and power consumption
                                                                                    •   PLL requires no external components

Note
1)Cable Connection and Disconnection
  Don't connect and disconnect the LVDS cable, when the power is supplied to the system.
2)GND Connection
 Connect the each GND of the PCB which THC63LVDM87 and LVDS-Rx on it. It is better for EMI reduction to place
GND cable as close to LVDS cable as possible.
3)Multi Drop Connection
  Multi drop connection is not recommended.
4)Asynchronous use
  Asynchronous use such as following systems are not recommended.
