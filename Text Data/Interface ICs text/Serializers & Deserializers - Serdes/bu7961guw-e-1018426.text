   7. USAGE PRECAUTIONS
(1) Absolute Maximum Ratings
     An excess in the absolute maximum ratings, such as supply voltage, temperature range of operatingconditions, etc., can
     break down devices, thus making impossible to identify breaking mode such as a short circuit or an open circuit. If any
     special mode exceeding the absolute maximum ratings is assumed, consideration should be given to take physical safety
     measures including the use of fuses, etc.
(2) Operating conditions
     These conditions represent a range within which characteristics can be provided approximately as
     expected. The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
(3) Reverse connection of power supply connector
     The reverse connection of power supply connector can break down ICs. Take protective measures against the breakdown
     due to the reverse connection, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power supply
     terminal.
(4) Power supply line
     Design PCB pattern to provide low impedance for the wiring between the power supply and the GND lines.In this regard,
     for the digital block power supply and the analog block power supply, even though these power supplies has the same level
     of potential, separate the power supply pattern for the digital block from that for the analog block, thus suppressing the
     diffraction of digital noises to the analog block power supply resulting from impedance common to the wiring patterns. For
     the GND line, give consideration to design the patterns in a similar manner.
     Furthermore, for all power supply terminals to ICs, mount a capacitor between the power supply and the GND terminal. At
     the same time, in order to use an electrolytic capacitor, thoroughly check to be sure the characteristics of the capacitor to be
     used present no problem including the occurrence of capacity dropout at a low temperature, thus determining the constant.
(5) GND voltage
     Make setting of the potential of the GND terminal so that it will be maintained at the minimum in any operating state.
     Furthermore, check to be sure no terminals are at a potential lower than the GND voltage including an actual electric
     transient.
(6) Short circuit between terminals and erroneous mounting
     In order to mount ICs on a set PCB, pay thorough attention to the direction and offset of the ICs. Erroneous mounting can
     break down the ICs. Furthermore, if a short circuit occurs due to foreign matters entering between terminals or between the
     terminal and the power supply or the GND terminal, the ICs can break down.
(7) Operation in strong electromagnetic field
            Be noted that using ICs in the strong electromagnetic field can malfunction them.
(8) Inspection with set PCB
     On the inspection with the set PCB, if a capacitor is connected to a low-impedance IC terminal, the IC can suffer stress.
     Therefore, be sure to discharge from the set PCB by each process. Furthermore, in order to mount or dismount the set
     PCB to/from the jig for the inspection process, be sure to turn OFF the power supply and then mount the set PCB to the jig.
     After the completion of the inspection, be sure to turn OFF the power supply and then dismount it from the jig. In addition,
     for protection against static electricity, establish a ground for the assembly process and pay thorough attention to the
     transportation and the storage of the set PCB.
(9) Input terminals
     In terms of the construction of IC, parasitic elements are inevitably formed in relation to potential. The operation of the
     parasitic element can cause interference with circuit operation, thus resulting in a malfunction and then breakdown of the
     input terminal. Therefore, pay thorough attention not to handle the input terminals, such as to apply to the input terminals a
     voltage lower than the GND respectively, so that any parasitic element will operate. Furthermore, do not apply a voltage to
     the input terminals when no power supply voltage is applied to the IC. In addition, even if the power supply voltage is
     applied, apply to the input terminals a voltage lower than the power supply voltage or within the guaranteed value of
     electrical characteristics.
(10) Ground wiring pattern
     If small-signal GND and large-current GND are provided, It will be recommended to separate the large-current GND pattern
     from the small-signal GND pattern and establish a single ground at the reference point of the set PCB so that resistance to
     the wiring pattern and voltage fluctuations due to a large current will cause no fluctuations in voltages of the small-signal
     GND. Pay attention not to cause fluctuations in the GND wiring pattern of external parts as well.
(11) External capacitor
     In order to use a ceramic capacitor as the external capacitor, determine the constant with consideration
     given to a degradation in the nominal capacitance due to DC bias and changes in the capacitance due to
     temperature, etc.
(12) No Connecting input terminals
     In terms of extremely high impedance of CMOS gate, to open the input terminals causes unstable state. And unstable state
     brings the inside gate voltage of p-channel or n-channel transistor into active. As a result, battery current may increase. And
     unstable state can also causes unexpected operation of IC. So unless otherwise specified, input terminals not being used
     should be connected to the power supply or GND line.
