General Description                                         Benefits and Features
The MAX9248/MAX9250 digital video serial-to-parallel        ●● Programmable ±4% or ±2% Spread-Spectrum
converters deserialize a total of 27 bits during data and      Output for Reduced EMI (MAX9248)
control phases. In the data phase, the LVDS serial input    ●● Proprietary Data Decoding for DC Balance and
is converted to 18 bits of parallel video data and in the      Reduced EMI
control phase, the input is converted to 9 bits of parallel
control data. The separate video and control phases take    ●● Control Data Deserialized During Video Blanking
advantage of video timing to reduce the serial-data rate.   ●● Five Control Data Inputs are Single-Bit-Error Tolerant
The MAX9248/MAX9250 pair with the MAX9247 serializer        ●● Output Transition Time is Scaled to Operating
to form a complete digital video transmission system. For      Frequency for Reduced EMI
operating frequencies less than 35MHz, the MAX9248/
                                                            ●● Staggered Output Switching Reduces EMI
MAX9250 can also pair with the MAX9217 serializer.
                                                            ●● Output Enable Allows Busing of Outputs (MAX9250)
The MAX9248 features spread-spectrum capability, allow-
ing output data and clock to spread over a specified fre-   ●● Clock Pulse Stretch on Lock
quency range to reduce EMI. The data and clock outputs      ●● Wide ±2% Reference Clock Tolerance
are programmable for a spectrum spread of ±4% or ±2%.
                                                            ●● Synchronizes to MAX9247 Serializer Without
The MAX9250 features output enable input control to

The MAX9248/MAX9250 operate from a +3.3V ±10%                  Temperature Ranges
core supply and feature a separate output supply for
interfacing to 1.8V to 3.3V logic-level inputs. These
devices are available in a 48-lead LQFP package and are

Note 1: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
         except VTH and VTL.
Note 2: Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are production
         tested at TA = +25°C.
Note 3: Parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization, and are not production tested. Limits are set at ±6 sigma.
Note 4: All LVTTL/LVCMOS inputs, except PWRDWN at ≤ 0.3V or ≥ VCC - 0.3V. PWRDWN is ≤ 0.3V, REFCLK is static.
Note 5: CL includes probe and test jig capacitance.
