Precaution on using ROHM Products
    1.  Our Products are designed and manufactured for application in ordinary electronic equipments (such as AV equipment,
        OA equipment, telecommunication equipment, home electronic appliances, amusement equipment, etc.). If you
                                                                                                                    (Note 1)
        intend to use our Products in devices requiring extremely high reliability (such as medical equipment               , transport
        equipment, traffic equipment, aircraft/spacecraft, nuclear power controllers, fuel controllers, car equipment including car
        accessories, safety devices, etc.) and whose malfunction or failure may cause loss of human life, bodily injury or
        serious damage to property (“Specific Applications”), please consult with the ROHM sales representative in advance.
        Unless otherwise agreed in writing by ROHM in advance, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any
        damages, expenses or losses incurred by you or third parties arising from the use of any ROHM’s Products for Specific
        Applications.
                               (Note1) Medical Equipment Classification of the Specific Applications
                                     JAPAN                USA                EU             CHINA
                                    CLASSⅢ                               CLASSⅡb
                                                       CLASSⅢ                              CLASSⅢ
                                    CLASSⅣ                                CLASSⅢ
    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are designed and manufactured for use under standard conditions and not under any special or
        extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below. Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way
        responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the use of any ROHM’s Products under any
        special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our Products under any special or
        extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent verification and confirmation of
        product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                   H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used; if flow soldering method is preferred, please consult with the
        ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

Precautions Regarding Application Examples and External Circuits
    1.   If change is made to the constant of an external circuit, please allow a sufficient margin considering variations of the
         characteristics of the Products and external components, including transient characteristics, as well as static
         characteristics.
    2.   You agree that application notes, reference designs, and associated data and information contained in this document
         are presented only as guidance for Products use. Therefore, in case you use such information, you are solely
         responsible for it and you must exercise your own independent verification and judgment in the use of such information
         contained in this document. ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses
         incurred by you or third parties arising from the use of such information.
Precaution for Electrostatic
    This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper
    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
               [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
               [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
               [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
               [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
         may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton.
    4.   Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of
         which storage time is exceeding the recommended storage time period.
Precaution for Product Label
    QR code printed on ROHM Products label is for ROHM’s internal use only.
Precaution for Disposition
    When disposing Products please dispose them properly using an authorized industry waste company.
Precaution for Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade act
    Since our Products might fall under controlled goods prescribed by the applicable foreign exchange and foreign trade act,
    please consult with ROHM representative in case of export.
