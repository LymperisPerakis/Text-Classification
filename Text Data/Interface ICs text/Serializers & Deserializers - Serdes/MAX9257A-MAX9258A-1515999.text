Note 2: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
        except VTH and VTL.
Note 3: Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are production
        tested at TA = +105NC.
Note 4: One output at a time.
Note 5: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization, and are not production tested.
Note 6: CL includes probe and test jig capacitance.
Note 7: tT is the period of the PCLK_OUT.
Note 8: For high-speed mode timing, see the Detailed Description section.
Note 9: I2C timing parameters are specified for fast-mode I2C. Max data rate = 400kbps.
