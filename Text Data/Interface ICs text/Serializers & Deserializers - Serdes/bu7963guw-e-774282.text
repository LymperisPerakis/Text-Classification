●Operation Control
    MSDL3 Channel Count Selection
      Pin LS is used to control the high-speed data channel count and data format. The LS pin settings (i.e., high-speed data
      channel count, data format) should be the same between the transmitting and receiving devices (the BU7963GUW and
      BU7964GUW, respectively). Table 6 shows the PCLK input frequency ranges and transmission data rate ranges for the
      LS pin settings.

    MSDL3 Pin Assignment
      RVS determines the assignment of MSDL3 pins, CLK+ / CLK−, D0+ / D0−, D1+ / D1− and D2+ / D2-. Only the
      MSDL3 high-speed signaling pins are affected by RVS, while pin assignment of other functions does not change.
      User can select the assignment from ‘straight’ (default) and ‘flipped’ assignment in order to minimize channel-to-channel
      skew in PWB design. Table 7 shows the MSDL3 pin assignment, and Fig.5 shows the ‘straight’ and ‘flipped’

●Power Modes
    BU7963GUW has three power modes.
    1) Shutdown Mode
       BU7963GUW goes to Shutdown Mode when XSD = ‘L’. All logic circuits are initialized in the Shutdown Mode.
       All high-speed signaling channels are disabled, and the outputs keep Hi-Z status.
    2) Standby Mode
       BU7963GUW goes to Standby Mode when XSD = ‘H’ and PCLK is not provided. All high-speed signaling channel outputs
       keep Hi-Z status. BU7963GUW is monitoring whether PCLK input is running or not and the link switches to Active Mode
       when PCLK running is detected.
    3) Active Mode
       BU7963GUW goes to Active Mode when XSD = ‘H’ and PCLK is running. All high-speed signaling channels are enabled.

    “res” is reserved bit for the future use, the default state of those is ‘0.’
    CP is the parity bit of data payload. BU7961GUW adds an odd parity on CP of the high-speed channel data.
            ・When the number of ‘H’ bits in parallel data is even, CP bit is ‘H.’
            ・When the number of ‘H’ bits in parallel data is odd, CP bits is ‘L.’

●PCB Layout for MSDL3
    The following points should be considered about the wiring for PCB of MSDL3.
        ･   Wire for the PCB wiring pattern of high-speed channel (CLK, D0+/-, D1+/-, D2+/-) as short as possible.
        ･   The PCB wiring for high-speed channel must not use the through-hole.
        ･   Do not bend the wiring for high-speed channel squarely.
        ･   Make the wiring length of each high-speed channel the same length (within 0.5mm).

              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
