Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

Note 3: Limits are 100% production tested at TA = +105°C. Limits over the operating temperature range and are guaranteed by
          design and characterization, unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: To provide a midlevel, leave the input open, or, if driven, put driver in high impedance. High-impedance leakage current
          must be less than ±10µA.
Note 5: IIN MIN due to voltage drop across the internal pullup resistor.
Note 6: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design
Note 7: HDCP not enabled (MAX9279 only). See Table 21 for additional supply current when HDCP is enabled.
Note 8: Specified pin to ground.
Note 9: Specified pin to all supply/ground.
Note 10: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 11: The I2C bus standard tLOW min = 0.5µs.
Note 12: I2C valid times apply only when the device is operating as a local-side device.
Note 13: The I2C bus standard tVD:DAT max = 0.45µs.
Note 14: The I2C bus standard tVD:ACK max = 0.45µs.
Note 15: Measured in serial link bit times. Bit time = 1/ (30 x fPCLKIN) for BWS = ‘0’ or open. Bit time = 1/ (40 x fPCLKIN) for
          BWS = ‘1’.

                            UART Receive/I2C Serial Data Input/Output with Internal 30kΩ Pullup to IOVDD. Function is
                            determined by the state of CONF[1:0] at power-up (Table 10). RX/SDA has an open-drain
     30             RX/SDA  driver and requires a pullup resistor.
                            RX: Input of the serializer’s UART.
                            SDA: Data input/output of the serializer’s I2C master/slave.
                            UART Transmit/I2C Serial Clock Input/Output with Internal 30kΩ Pullup to IOVDD. Function is
                            determined by the state of CONF[1:0] at power-up (Table 10). TX/SCL has an open-drain driver
     31              TX/SCL and requires a pullup resistor.
                            TX: Output of the serializer’s UART.
                            SCL: Clock input/output of the serializer’s I2C master/slave.

                            General-Purpose Output/High-Immunity Mode Input.
                            Functions as HIM input with internal pulldown to EP at power-up or when resuming from
                            power-down mode (PWDN = low), and switches to GPO output automatically after power-up.
                            HIM: Default HIGHIMM bit value is latched at power-up or when resuming from power-down
     39            GPO/HIM  mode (PWDN = low) and is active high. Connect HIM to IOVDD with a 30kΩ or less pullup
                            resistor to set high or leave open to set low. HIGHIMM can be programmed to a different value
                            after power-up. HIGHIMM in the deserializer must be set to the same value.
                            GPO: Output follows the state of the GPI (or INT) input on the deserializer. GPO is low after
                            power-up or when PWDN is low.
                            Three-Level Configuration Input. The state of CONF0 latches at power-up or when resuming
     40              CONF0  from power-down mode (PWDN = low). See Table 10 for details. Use 6kΩ (max) for pullup to

                            Three-Level Configuration Input. The state of CONF2 latches at power-up or when resuming
     41              CONF2  from power-down mode (PWDN = low). See Table 11 for details. Use 6kΩ (max) for pullup to
                            IOVDD/pulldown to GND.
                            Three-Level Bus Width Select Input. Set BWS to the same level on both sides of the serial
     42               BWS   link. Set BWS = low with 6kΩ (max) pulldown for 24 bit mode. Set BWS = 6kΩ (max) pullup to
                            IOVDD high for 32-bit mode. Set BWS = open for high-bandwidth mode.
