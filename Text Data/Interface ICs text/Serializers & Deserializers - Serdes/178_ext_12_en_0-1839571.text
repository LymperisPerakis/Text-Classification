                             112MHz 30Bits COLOR LVDS Receiver
General Description                                                          Features
The THC63LVD104C receiver is designed to support                             • Wide dot clock range: 8-112MHz suited for NTSC,
pixel data transmission between Host and Flat Panel                              VGA, SVGA, XGA, and SXGA
Display from NTSC up to SXGA resolutions. The                                •   PLL requires no external components
THC63LVD104C converts the LVDS data streams back                             •   50% output clock duty cycle
into 35bits of CMOS/TTL data with the choice of the
                                                                             •   TTL clock edge programmable
rising edge or falling edge clock for the convenience
with a variety of LCD panel controllers.At a transmit                        •   Power down mode
clock frequency of 112MHz, 30bits of RGB data and                            •   Low power single 3.3V CMOS design
5bits of timing and control data (HSYNC,                                     •   64pin TQFP
VSYNC,DE,CNTL1,CNTL2) are transmitted at an
                                                                             •   Backward compatible with THC63LVDF64x
effective rate of 784Mbps per LVDS channel.Using a
                                                                                 (18bits) / F84x(24bits)
112MHz clock, the data throughput is 490Mbytes per
second.                                                                      • Pin compatible with THC63LVD104A

Note
1)Power On Sequence
 Power on LVDS-Tx after THC63LVD104C.
2)Cable Connection and Disconnection
 Don't connect and disconnect the LVDS cable, when the power is supplied to the system.
3)GND Connection
 Connect the each GND of the PCB which LVDS-Tx and THC63LVD104C on it. It is better for EMI reduction to place
GND cable as close to LVDS cable as possible.
4)Multi Drop Connection
 Multi drop connection is not recommended.
