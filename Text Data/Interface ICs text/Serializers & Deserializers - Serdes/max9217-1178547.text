          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

          The MAX9217 has an integrated 100Ω output-termina-
          tion resistor. This resistor damps reflections from
          induced noise and mismatches between the transmis-

          The integrated 100Ω output termination is made up of
          two 50Ω resistors in series. The junction of the resistors
          is connected to the CMF pin for connecting an optional
          common-mode filter capacitor. Connect the filter
          capacitor to ground close to the MAX9217 as shown in
          Figure 13. The capacitor shunts common-mode switch-
