NOTES:
  1. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See
     Tech Brief TB379.
  2. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.

 4. The various differently-named Ground pins are internally weakly connected. They must be tied together externally. The different names are
    provided to assist in minimizing the current loops involved in bypassing the associated supply VDD pins. In particular, for ESD testing, they
    should be considered a common connection.

this requirement, the 3.3V supply must be powered up before
the 1.8V supply.
For the deserializer, REF_CLK must not be applied before the
device is fully powered up. Applying REF_CLK before power-
up may require the deserializer to be manually reset. A 10ms
delay after the 1.8V supply is powered up guarantees normal
operation.
Power Supply Bypassing
The serializer and deserializer functions rely on the stable
functioning of PLLs locked to local reference sources or locked
to an incoming signal. It is important that the various supplies
(VDD_P, VDD_AN, VDD_CDR, VDD_TX) be well bypassed
over a wide range of frequencies, from below the typical loop
bandwidth of the PLL to approaching the signal bit rate of the
serial data. A combination of different values of capacitors from
1000pF to 5µF or more with low ESR characteristics is
generally required.                                                               FIGURE 4. POWER SUPPLY BYPASSING
