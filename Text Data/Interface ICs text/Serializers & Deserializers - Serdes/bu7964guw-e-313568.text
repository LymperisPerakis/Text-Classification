BU7964GUW                                                                                               Technical Note
●Power Modes
    BU7964UW has three power modes.
    1) Shutdown Mode
      BU7964GUW goes to Shutdown Mode when XSD = ‘L.’ AII logic circuits are
      initialized in the Shutdown Mode. All high-speed signaling are pulled down to
      MSGND. All parallel data interface output ‘L’.
    2) Standby Mode
      BU7964GUW goes to a Standby Mode when XSD = ‘H’ and CLK+ / CLK− is Hi-Z. All high-speed signaling inputs sink
      DC current in order to pull the pins down to MSGND. BU7964GUW is monitoring VCM of CLK+ / CLK−. When TX device
      starts driving high-speed signaling outputs, BU7964GUW detects its VCM and switches to Active Mode. In Standby Mode,
      All parallel data interface output ‘L’.
    3) Active Mode
      BU7964UW goes to Active Mode when XSD = ‘H’ and VCM is running.

●Link Error Detection
    Detection of Parity Error
       BU7964GUW counts the number of ‘H’ bits in PD[26:0] and CP in every pixel information received and detects parity error
       as follows:
          ・There is no parity error occurred if the number of ‘H’ bits in PD[26:0] and CP is odd.
          ・There is parity error occurred if the number of ‘H’ bits in PD[26:0] and CP is even.
       If parity error is detected, BU7964GUW outputs the previous error-free pixel information and discards the invalid pixel
       information. At the same time, BU7964GUW toggles CPO during one PCLK period. BU7964GUW outputs initial value, if
       the parity error is detected when there is no previous pixel information. Otherwise, BU7964GUW outputs the received
       pixel information from the high-speed data channel(s) and CPO keeps ‘L.’
       Error correction is not supported in BU7964GUW.

    “res” is reserved bit for the future use, the default state of those is ‘0.’
    CP is the parity bit of data payload.
    BU7964GUW adds an odd parity on CP of the high-speed channel data.
            ・When the number of ‘H’ bits in parallel data is even, CP bit is ‘H.’
            ・When the number of ‘H’ bits in parallel data is odd, CP bit is ‘L.’

Precaution on using ROHM Products
    1.  Our Products are designed and manufactured for application in ordinary electronic equipments (such as AV equipment,
        OA equipment, telecommunication equipment, home electronic appliances, amusement equipment, etc.). If you
                                                                                                                    (Note 1)
        intend to use our Products in devices requiring extremely high reliability (such as medical equipment               , transport
        equipment, traffic equipment, aircraft/spacecraft, nuclear power controllers, fuel controllers, car equipment including car
        accessories, safety devices, etc.) and whose malfunction or failure may cause loss of human life, bodily injury or
        serious damage to property (“Specific Applications”), please consult with the ROHM sales representative in advance.
        Unless otherwise agreed in writing by ROHM in advance, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any
        damages, expenses or losses incurred by you or third parties arising from the use of any ROHM’s Products for Specific
        Applications.
                               (Note1) Medical Equipment Classification of the Specific Applications
                                     JAPAN                USA                EU             CHINA

    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are designed and manufactured for use under standard conditions and not under any special or
        extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below. Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way
        responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the use of any ROHM’s Products under any
        special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our Products under any special or
        extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent verification and confirmation of
        product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                   H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used; if flow soldering method is preferred, please consult with the
        ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

Precaution for Electrostatic
    This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper
    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
               [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
               [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
               [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
               [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
         may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton.
    4.   Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of
         which storage time is exceeding the recommended storage time period.
