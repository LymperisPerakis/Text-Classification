cal for both the coax and STP EV kits for the MAX9271,
MAX9272, and MAX9273.
For evaluation using a standard FAKRA coaxial cable,
order both the MAX9271 coax EV kit and its companion
board, the MAX9272 coax EV kit.
For evaluation using a standard Rosenberger twisted-pair
cable, order both the MAX9271 STP EV kit and its com-
panion board, the MAX9272 STP EV kit.
