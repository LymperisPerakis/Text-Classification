1588 Clock Features
  •  Steerable by software with 2-8ns time resolution and 2-32ns period resolution
  •  1ns input timestamp accuracy and output edge placement accuracy
  •  Initialized and steered by software on an external processor to follow an external 1588 master
  •  Three time/frequency controls: direct time write, time adjustment, and high-resolution frequency adjustment
  •  Programmable clock and time-alignment I/O to synchronize all boards in large systems
     o Can frequency-lock to an input clock signal from elsewhere in the system
     o Can timestamp an input time alignment signal to time-lock to a master elsewhere in the system (e.g., 1 PPS)
     o Can provide an output clock signal to slave components elsewhere in the system (125MHz/N , 1 ≤ N ≤ 255)
     o Can provide an output time alignment signal to slave components elsewhere in the system (e.g., 1 PPS)
  •  Input signal timestamper can stamp rising edges, falling edges or both
  •  Flexible programmable event generator (PEG) can output 1 PPS, one pulse per period, and a wide variety of
     clock signals
  •  Full support for dual redundant timing cards to match architecture used in SONET/SDH
  •  Full support for switches and routers as transparent clocks or boundary clocks
  •  Compatible with a wide variety of 1588 system architectures
1588 Timestamper Features
  •  Identifies and timestamps 1588 v1 and v2 packets in both transmit and receive directions
  •  Programmable packet classifier can identify packets transported by a variety of protocol stacks
           o 1588 over Ethernet
           o 1588 over IPv4/UDP
           o 1588 over IPv6/UDP
           o 1588 over MPLS
           o Configurable for more complex stacks as well
           o Recognizes 802.1Q VLAN tags and 802.1ah MAC-in-MAC
           o Can be configured to identify CESoP or SAToP for timing over adaptive-mode circuit emulation
  •  Transmit and receive timestamping with 1ns resolution
  •  One-step operation minimizes network bandwidth consumption
           o On-the-fly timestamp insertion
           o On-the-fly corrections in transparent clocks
           o No need for follow-up packets
  •  Can insert ALL timestamps (receive and transmit) into packets for easy software access
           o Three insert methods: direct overwrite, read-add-write, and read-subtract-write
           o Eliminates reads from timestamp FIFOs
           o Minimizes processor bus traffic
  •  Optional two-step operation
  •  Optional 8-entry timestamp FIFOs
Synchronous Ethernet Features
