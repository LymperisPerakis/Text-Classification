Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

Note 1: Current into a pin is defined as positive. Current out of a pin is defined as negative. All voltages are referenced to ground
          except VTH and VTL.
Note 2: Maximum and minimum limits over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization. Devices are production
          tested at TA = +25°C.
Note 3: All LVTTL/LVCMOS inputs, except PWRDWN at ≤ 0.3V or ≥ VCC - 0.3V. PWRDWN is ≤ 0.3V.
Note 4: AC parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization, and are not production tested. Limits are set at ±6 sigma.
Note 5: CL includes probe and test jig capacitance.
