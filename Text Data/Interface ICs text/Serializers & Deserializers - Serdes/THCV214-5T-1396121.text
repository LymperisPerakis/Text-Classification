Detailed Description
  With V-by-One®’s
              One®’s proprietary encoding scheme and CDR (Clock and Data Recovery) architecture, THCV213
and THCV214 enable transmission of 18bit video signals (D17 to D0) and 4bit         bit control signals (SYNC2 to
SYNC0, and DE) by a single differential pair cable with   th minimal external components.
                                                                               components.THCV214, the receiver,
can seamlessly operate for a wide range of a parallel
                                                    parallel clock frequency of 5MHz to 40MHz, detecting the
frequency of an incoming data stream, and recovering both   both the clock and data by itself. It does not need any
external frequency reference, such as a crystal oscillator.
  THCV213 serializes video signals and control signals separately, depending on the polarity of Data Enable
(DE) input. DE is a signal which indicates whether video or control signals ls are active. When DE input is high, it
serializes D17 to D0 inputs into a single differential
                                              different data stream. And it transmits serialized control signals
(SYNC2 to SYNC0) when DE input is low.
  THCV214 automatically  lly extracts the clock from the incoming data stream andd converts the serial data into 18
bit parallel
        llel data with DE being high or three control
                                                co     signals with DE being low, recognizing which type of serial
data is being sent by the transmitter.
Operation Mode
  In order to accommodate various types of data format or to expedite the link establishment betw
                                                                                                between the
transmitter and receiver, THCV214 has two modes of operation, namely Normal Mode       ode and Shake Hand Mode.
Normal Mode
  The Normal mode operation is the one described above in “Detailed Description”. This mode fully utilizes the
chipset’s capability, enabling the transmission of 18bit video signals and 4bit control signals. It is required to
have DE signal which indicates whether video or control signals are active.
Shake Hand Mode
  This mode requires an extra wire connecting THCV214’s LOCKN and THCV213’s          3’s INIT pin. This wire does
not need to be controlled impedance.. While the link is not being established between the transmitter and receiver,
the receiver’s LOCKN is driven high so that the receiver tells the transmitter to send a special set of data pattern
which makes them connect easily. The chipset automatically enters the Shake Hand mode, once THCV214’s
LOCKN pin and THCV213’s INIT pin are connected together. If there is no DE signal, THCV213/214 can still
work in the Shake Hand mode with the transmitter’s DE input tied high. In this case, the amou
                                                                                            amount of data
transmission reduces to 18 bit digital signals (D17 to D0.)

THCV213-214_Rev.2.50_E
DE Requirement
  There are some requirements for DE signal if the chipset is to be used in the Normal mode as described in
Table 2.
DE Requirements for Normal Mode
  The length of DE being low is at least 50 clock cycles
                                                     cycle long. The maximum time of DE being high is 80us, the
minimum of DE=High is 2 clock cycles.
THCV213 Power Down (PDWN)
  THCV213 is set as the Power Down mode when PDWN is low.. All the internal circuitry turns off and the
TXOUT+/- outputs turn to Hi-Z.  Z. Refer to Fig. 7
THCV213 EDGE
  The polarity of the EDGE pin selects which edge (rising or falling) of the input clock by which the input data
are latched in. When EDGE is set high, the transmitter uses the rising edge of the input clock to take in the input
data. When EDGE is low, it takes in the data at the falling edge of the clock. Select its polarity so that the
transmitter latches in the data with
                                  ith better setup/hold time margin.
THCV213 Pre-Emphasis
                   Emphasis (PRE1,0)
  Pre-emphasis
      emphasis can equalize severe signal degradation caused by long distance or high--speed transmission. Two
pins, PRE1 and PRE0, select the strength of pre-emphasis.
                                                pre
THCV213 INIT
  Driving the INIT pin high makess the transmitter send a special set of pattern called SYNC pattern, which
makes it easier for the receiver to recover the clock and data. This function is normally used in the Shake Hand
mode with a wire connecting the transmitter INIT pin and the receiver LOCKN pin. It can also be used to
expedite the link establishment in the Normal mode by driving the INIT pin high at power up, forcing the
transmitter to output the SYNC pattern for a certain amount of time in order to train the recei
                                                                                          receiver.
THCV213 Dual Display Mode (DUAL)
  THCV213 has two high speed output buffers so that it can be used in an application where a video source
wants to send the same data to two displays. The DUAL pin activates the Dual Display mode.
THCV213 PRBS
  Setting the PRBS pin high enables the internal test pattern generator. It generates Pseudo  Pseudo-Random Bit
Sequence of 223-1.
  The generated PRBS is fed into input data latches, formatted as VGA video like data, encoded and serialized
into TXOUT output.

THCV213-214_Rev.2.50_E
  This function iss normally to be used for analyzing the signal integrity of the transmission channel including
PCB traces, connectors, and cables.
THCV214 Lock/Input Detect (LOCKN)
  When the PLL of THCV214 has locked to the incoming data stream, it drives LOCKN low. And then
TTL/CMOS outputs become valid. This LOCKN signal can also be used as an indicator of whether the incoming
data is valid or not.
  This pin is to be connected to the transmitter INIT pin with a cable in the Shake Hand mode.
THCV214 Power Down (PDWN)
  THCV214 is set as the Power Down mode when PDWN is low. All the internal circuitry and input buffers turn
off, and all outputs except LOCKN and CLKOUT are held low. The LOCKN pin is driven high when in the
Power Down mode. The CLKOUT is fixed one way or the other      ther depending on the EDGE input. Refer to Fig. 9.
THCV214 EDGE
  The polarity of the EDGE pin selects which edge (rising or falling) of the output clock by which the output data
are latched out. When EDGE is set high, the receiver uses the falling edge of the output clock to put out the data
so that the next-stage
                  stage chip can use the rising edge of the clock to latch in the data with the maximum setup/hold
time margin, and vice versa. Select its polarity according to the next-stage
                                                                        stage chip input characteristics.
THCV214 Output Enable (OE)
  The OE pin can disable TTL/CMOS outputs and place them in Hi-Z.         Z. Thus THCV214’s TTL/CMOS outputs
can be bused so that the receiver can be used in an application where there are multiple video sources and one
display.
THCV214 MOD1,0
  Both MOD1 and MOD0 must be tied to GND. The receiver enters into an appropriate operation mode by itself.
Cables and Connectors
  In a system with high speed digital signals, a special care must be taken to avoid loss and degradation of the
signals due to limited bandwidth and impedance mismatch along the transmission line. Characteristic impedance
of PCB traces, cables, and connectors must be tightly controlled.
  Use cables that have a differential characteristic impedance of 100Ω. Shielded twisted pair cables are
recommended for increasing noise immunity and lowering EMI.
  Connectors are recommended that cause minimum discontinuities in terms of characteristic impedance and
geometry of the transmission path.

THCV213-214_Rev.2.50_E
PCB Layout Considerations
 Use a four-layer PCB with signal, ground, power, and signal assigned for each layer. PCB traces for high-speed
signals (TXOUT, RXIN) must be microstrip lines with a differential impedance of 100Ω. Route differential
signal traces symmetrically. Avoid right angle turns of thehe high speed traces because they usually cause
impedance discontinuity.
 Place a 100 Ω termination resistor between RXIN+ and RXIN- as close to the receiver as possible to reduce
reflection.
 Separate all the power domains in order to avoid unwanted noise coupling between noisy digital and sensitive
analog domains. Use high frequency ceramic capacitors of 10nF or 0.1μF as bypass capacitors between power
and ground pins. Place them as close to each power pin as possible. A 4.7μF capacitor in parallel with the
smaller capacitor to PLLVDD is recommended for the receiver.
