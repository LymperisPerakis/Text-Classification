    Exposed Pad                 PAD             Must be connected to ground, not an electrical connection
NOTES:
 1. Pins with the same name are internally connected together. However, this connection must NOT be used for connecting together external components
    or features.
 2. The various differently-named Ground pins are internally weakly connected. They must be tied together externally. The different names are provided
    to assist in minimizing the current loops involved in bypassing the associated supply VDD pins. In particular, for ESD testing, they should be
    considered a common connection.

NOTES:
  8. IDDIO is nominally 50µA and not included in this total as it is dominated by the loading of the parallel pins.
  9. This parameter is the output data skew from the invalid edge of PCLK_OUT. The setup and hold time provided to a system is dependent on the PCLK
     frequency and is calculated as follows: 0.5 * fIN - tDV..
10. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design.

Exposed Pad
While it is not a required electrical connection, it is
recommended that the exposed pad on the bottom of the
package be soldered to the circuit board. This will ensure that the
full power dissipation of the package can be utilized. The pad
should be connected to ground and not left floating. For best
thermal conductivity, 16 vias should connect the footprint for the
exposed pad on the circuit board to the ground plane. This
connection is not required for basic operation of the chip.
