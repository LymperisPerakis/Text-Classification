 Functional Description
 Functional Overview
   With V-by-One® HS proprietary encoding scheme and CDR (Clock and Data Recovery) architecture,
 THCV219 enables transmission of 8/10 bit RGB, 2bits of user-defined data (CONT), synchronizing signals
 HSYNC, VSYNC, and DE by a pair cable with minimal external components.
   THCV219 inputs CMOS/TTL data (including video data, CONT, HSYNC, VSYNC, and DE) and serializes
 video data and synchronizing signals separately, depending on the polarity of DE. DE is a signal which indicates
 whether video or synchronizing data are active. When DE is high, it serializes video data inputs into differential
 data streams. And it transmits serialized synchronizing data when DE is low.
   THCV219 can operate for a wide range of a serial bit rate from 600Mbps to 3.0Gbps.
 It does not need any external frequency reference, such as a crystal oscillator.
 Internal Reference Output/Input Function (CAPOUT,CAPINA,CAPINP)
    An internal regulator produces the 1.2V (CAPOUT). This 1.2V linear regulator can not supply any other
 external loads. Bypass CAPOUT to GND with 2.2uF.
    CAPINP supplies reference voltage for internal PLL, and CAPINA supplies reference voltage for any internal
 analog circuit. Bypass CAPINP/CAPINA to GND with 0.1uF to remove high frequency noise. CAPOUT,
 CAPINA and CAPINP must be tied together.
 Analog power supply AVCC is supposed to be stabilized with de-coupling capacitor and series noise filter (for
 example, ferrite bead).

  If ASYNDE input is Low, DE input is inverted before V-by-One® HS processing. RGB/CONT Data is
transmitted during DE input=Low. Please be careful this inverted DE is outputted from V-by-One® HS receiver,
which may cause polarity mismatch against following system requirement.

Hot-Plug Function
 HTPDN indicates connecting condition between the Transmitter and the Receiver. HTPDN of the transmitter
side is high when the Receiver is not active or not connected. Then Transmitter can enter into the power down
mode. HTPDN is set to Low by the Receiver when Receiver is active and connects to the Transmitter, and then
Transmitter must start up and transmit CDR training pattern for link training. HTPDN is open drain output at the
receiver side. Pull-up resistor is needed at the transmitter side.
 HTPDN connection between the Transmitter and the Receiver can be omitted as an application option. In this
case, HTPDN at the Transmitter side should always be taken as Low.
Lock Detect Function
 LOCKN indicates whether the CDR PLL is in the lock state or not. LOCKN at the Transmitter input is set to
High by pull-up resistor when Receiver is not active or at the CDR PLL training state. LOCKN is set to Low by
the Receiver when CDR lock is done. Then the CDR training mode finishes and Transmitter shifts to the normal
mode. LOCKN is open drain output at the receiver side. Pull-up resistor is needed at the transmitter side.
 When HTPDN is included in an application, the LOCKN signal should only be considered when the HTPDN is
pulled low by the Receiver.

 Pre-emphasis and Drive Select Function
  Pre-emphasis can equalize severe signal degradation caused by long-distance or high-speed transmission.
 The PRE pin selects the strength of pre-emphasis.

 Power Down Function
  Setting the PDN pin low places THCV219 in the power-down mode. Internal circuitry turns off and the TXP/N
 outputs turn to High level.

 Field BET Operation
   In order to help users to check validity of CML high-speed serial line, THCV219 has an operation mode in
 which they act as a bit error tester (BET). In this mode, THCV219 internally generates test pattern which is then
 serialized onto the CML high-speed line. THCV220 which is an example or Rx device also has BET function
 mode. THCV220 receives the data stream and checks bit errors.
   This "Field BET" mode is activated by setting BET= H both on THCV219 andTHCV220. The generated data
 pattern is then 8b/10b encoded, scrambled, and serialized onto the CML channel. As for THCV220, the internal
 test pattern check circuit gets enabled and reports result on a certain pin named BETOUT. The BETOUT pin
 goes LOW whenever bit errors occur, or it stays HIGH when there is no bit error. Please refer to Table 5.
