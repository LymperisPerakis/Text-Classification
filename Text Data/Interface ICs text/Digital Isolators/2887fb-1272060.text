The PCB layout in Figures 14 and 15 shows the low EMI
demo board for the LTM2887. The demo board uses a
combination of EMI mitigation techniques, including both
embedded PCB bridge capacitance and discrete GND to
GND2 capacitors. Two safety rated type Y2 capacitors are
used in series, manufactured by MuRata, part number
GA342QR7GF471KW01L. The embedded capacitor ef-
fectively suppresses emissions above 400MHz, whereas
the discrete capacitors are more effective below 400MHz.
EMI performance is shown in Figure 16, measured using
a Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic (GTEM) cell and                        Figure 14. LTM2887 Low EMI Demo Board Layout
