  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.7 × VDD1 or 0.7 × VISO for a high output or VO < 0.3 × VDD1 or 0.3 × VISO for a
  low output. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.7 × VDD1 or 0.7 × VISO for a high output or VO < 0.3 × VDD1 or 0.3 × VISO for a
  low output. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.
