  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOx > 0.8 VDD. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both
  rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 3.135 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.135 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ 125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

ADuM4402W depends on the voltage waveform type imposed
across the isolation barrier. The iCoupler insulation structure                                    RATED PEAK VOLTAGE
degrades at different rates, depending on whether the waveform
                                                                                                                                          11031-023
