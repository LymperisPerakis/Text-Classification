          In case EN1 and EN2 pins are "L" as in no. 1, the logic of OUT1 pin and OUT2 pin becomes "L".
          In case EN1 pin is "L" and EN2 pin is "H" as in no. 2 ~ 5, the logic of OUT1 pin and OUT2 pin will retain its previous
          state.
          In case EN2 pin is "L" and EN1 pin is "H" as in no. 6 ~ 9, the logic of OUT1 pin and OUT2 pin becomes "L".
          In case EN1 and EN2 pins are "H" as in no. 10 ~ 13, the output logic of OUT1 (OUT2) pin changes according to the
          input logic of IN1 (IN2) pins.
          Likewise, since pull up/pull down resistor has not been connected to IN1, IN2, EN1 and EN2 pins, it is necessary to
          connect external resistor in case you would like to fix the input logic of IN1, IN2, EN1 and EN2 pins.
      2.  TEN pins
          The TEN pins serve as a test enable pin, respectively.
          Please connect to GND to avoid the possibility of chip malfunction.
      3.  Output pin voltage
          Logic levels for output pins are indicated in the truth table in Sections 1, 6, and 7. However, it may be assumed that
          such logic levels disable the output circuit to fully turn ON at a low voltage when turning ON or OFF the power supply,
          thus putting the output pin into the high impedance state.
      4. Under Voltage Lock Out (UVLO) function
          This IC has a built-in UVLO function to prevent the IC from malfunctioning whenever the power supply voltage drops.
          It triggers the UVLO state when VCC1 pin and VCC2 pin are changed to 3.8V (Typ) or less and becomes in operational
          state when changed to 4.0V (Typ) or more.
          If VCC1 drops to 3.8V or less, both OUT1 and OUT2 pins retain its state.
          If VCC2 drops to 3.8V or less, both OUT1 and OUT2 pins will be set to “L” logic level.
          In case VCC2 pin voltage was changed from 3.8V (Typ) or less to 4.0V (Typ) or more at 4.0V (Typ) or more for VCC1
          pin voltage, the output logic of OUT1 pin and OUT2 pin becomes "L".
          In case VCC1 pin voltage was changed from 3.8V (Typ) or less to 4.0V (Typ) or more at 4.0V (Typ) or more for VCC2
          pin voltage, the output logic of OUT1 (OUT2) pin changes according to the input logic of input IN1 (IN2) pin.

          In case VCC1 is turned ON first as in no. 1 ~ 4, a signal from VCC1 side to the circuit of VCC2 side cannot be received
          because of the cancellation by the signal before the circuit of VCC2 (receiving) side rises.
          For that reason, the output logic of OUT1 pin and OUT2 pin become "L" and the output logic does not match with the
          input logic as in no. 2, 3, 4*.

     Caution: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. In addition, it is impossible to predict all destructive situations such as
     short-circuit modes, open circuit modes, etc. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, like adding a fuse, in case the IC is operated in a
     special mode exceeding the absolute maximum ratings

Thermal Dissipation
    In consideration of the power consumption (P), package power dissipation (Pd), and ambient temperature (Tj) of this IC,
    ensure that the operating temperature of the chip will not exceed 150C. If Tj is beyond 150C, parasitic elements may
    malfunction and may cause leakage current to increase. Constantly using the IC under the said conditions may deteriorate
    the IC and further lead to its breakdown. Strictly keep Tjmax at 150C under any circumstances.

Operational Notes
      1.   Reverse Connection of Power Supply
            Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
            connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
            supply pins.
      2.     Power Supply Lines
            Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Separate the ground and supply lines of the
            digital and analog blocks to prevent noise in the ground and supply lines of the digital block from affecting the analog
            block. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and
            aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic capacitors.
      3.   Ground Voltage
            Ensure that no pins are at a voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
      4.   Ground Wiring Pattern
            When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
            connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
            ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
            on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
      5.   Thermal Consideration
            Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
            deterioration of the properties of the chip. The absolute maximum rating of the Pd stated in this specification is when
            the IC is mounted on a 70mm x 70mm x 1.6mm glass epoxy board. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum
            rating, increase the board size and copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
      6.   Recommended Operating Conditions
            These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained.
            The electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
      7.   Inrush Current
            When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush
            current may flow instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC
            has more than one power supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance,
            power wiring, width of ground wiring, and routing of connections.
      8.   Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
            Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
      9.   Testing on Application Boards
            When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
            subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
            should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
            process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
            transport and storage.
      10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
            Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
            damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
            Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
            unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.

Operational Notes – continued
      11.    Unused Input Pins
            Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
            extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small
            charge acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and
            cause unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the
            power supply or ground line.
      12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
            This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
            isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
            parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
             When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
             When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
            Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
            interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
            operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should
            be avoided.

    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are not designed under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below.
        Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the
        use of any ROHM’s Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our
        Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent
        verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                   H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

         incurred by you or third parties arising from the use of such information.
Precaution for Electrostatic
    This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper
    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
              [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
              [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
              [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
         may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton.
    4.   Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of
         which storage time is exceeding the recommended storage time period.
Precaution for Product Label
