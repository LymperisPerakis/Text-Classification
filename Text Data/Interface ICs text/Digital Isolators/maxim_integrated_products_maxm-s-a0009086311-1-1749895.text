General Description                                                   Benefits and Features
The MAX12930/MAX12931 are a family of 2-channel,                      ●● Robust Galvanic Isolation of Digital Signals
3kV/5kVRMS digital galvanic isolators using Maxim’s                      • Withstands 5kVRMS for 60s (VISO) Wide-Body
proprietary process technology. These devices transfer                   • Withstands 3kVRMS for 60s (VISO) Narrow-Body
digital signals between circuits with different power domains            • Continuously Withstands 848VRMS (VIOWM) Wide-
while using as little as 0.65mW per channel at 1Mbps with 1.8V.             Body
The two channels of the MAX12931 transfer data in                        • Continuously Withstands 445VRMS (VIOWM)
opposite directions, and this makes the MAX12931 ideal                      Narrow-Body
for isolating the TX and RX lines of a transceiver. The                  • Withstands ±10kV Surge Between GNDA and
MAX12930 features two channels transferring data in the                     GNDB with 1.2/50µs Waveform
same direction.                                                          • High CMTI (50kV/µs, typ)

Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
         respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
         both rising and falling common-mode voltage sedges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and
         GNDB (VCM = 1000V).
