Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +125°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to ground on
         the corresponding side of the device, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: This is the minimum difference between the output logic-low level and the input logic threshold. This ensures that there is no
         possibility of the part latching up the bus to which it is connected.
Note 4: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 5: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining operation. CMTI applies to both rising
         and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and GNDB
         (VCM = 1000V).
