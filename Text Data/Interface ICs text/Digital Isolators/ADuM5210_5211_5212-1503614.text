All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = VDDP = 5 V, VSEL resistor network: R1 = 10 kΩ, R2 = 30.9 kΩ between VISO and
GNDISO. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended operation range, which is 4.5 V ≤ VDD1, VDD2, VDDP ≤ 5.5 V
and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless

 All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 =VDD2 = VDDP = 3.3 V, VSEL resistor network: R1 = 10 kΩ, R2 = 16.9 kΩ between VISO and
 GNDISO. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended operation range, which is 3.135 V ≤ VDD1, VDD2, VDDP ≤
 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels,
 unless otherwise noted.
 The digital isolator channels and the power section work independently, and under the operating voltages in this section, there may not
 be sufficient current from the VISO to run both data channels at the maximum data rate. Verify that the application is within the power
 capability of VISO if that supply is providing power to VDD2.
