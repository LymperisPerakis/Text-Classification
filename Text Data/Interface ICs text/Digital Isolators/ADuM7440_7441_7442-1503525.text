ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range of 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF, and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

                     recommended.
16        VDD2A      Supply Voltage A for Isolator Side 2 (3.0 V to 5.5 V). Pin 16 must be connected externally to Pin 10. Connect a
                     ceramic bypass capacitor of value 0.01 μF to 0.1 μF between VDD2A (Pin 16) and GND2 (Pin 15).
