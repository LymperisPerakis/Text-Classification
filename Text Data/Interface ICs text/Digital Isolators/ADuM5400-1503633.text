The insulation lifetime of the ADuM5400 depends on the
voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation barrier.
The iCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates,
depending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac,
or dc. Figure 18, Figure 19, and Figure 20 illustrate these
different isolation voltage waveforms.
