Note 2: All units are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design. All voltages of side
          A are referenced to GNDA. All voltages of side B are referenced to GNDB, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
Note 4: The undervoltage lockout threshold and hysteresis guarantee that the outputs are in a known state during a slump in the
          supplies. See the Detailed Description section for more information.
Note 5: ΔVTOL = VOL – VIL. This is the minimum difference between the output logic-low voltage and the input logic threshold for
          the same I/O pin. This ensures that the I/O channels are not latched low when any of the I/O inputs are driven low (see the
          Bidirectional Channels section).
Note 6: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
          both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and
          GNDB.
Note 7: Pulse-width distortion is defined as the difference in propagation delay between low-to-high and high-to-low transitions on
          the same channel. Channel-to-channel skew is defined as the difference in propagation delay between different channels on
          the same device. Part-to-part skew is defined as the difference in propagation delays (for unidirectional channels) between
          different devices, when both devices operate with the same supply voltage, at the same temperature and have identical
          package and test circuits.
