2.1 Theory of Operation
The Si873x are pin-compatible, single-channel, drop-in replacements for popular optocouplers with data rates up to 15 Mbps. The oper-
ation of an Si873x channel is analogous to that of an opto coupler, except an RF carrier is modulated instead of light. This simple archi-
tecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special considerations or initialization at start-up. A simplified block dia-
gram for the Si873x is shown in the figure below.

 Note: This truth table assumes VDD is powered (VDD> UVLO). If VDD is below UVLO, see 3.3 Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO) for
 more information. When VDD < UVLO, the output state is not guaranteed. In this condition, the output level is determined by external
 circuity connected to the output.
3.2 Device Startup
During startup-up, for the Si873x, Output VO is high until VDD rises above the UVLO+ threshold for a minimum time period of tSTART.
Following this, the output is low when the current flowing from anode to cathode is > IF(ON). Device startup, normal operation, and shut-
down behavior for the Si873x is shown in the figure below. Note that the figure below assumes that Enable is asserted and that the
outputs are operating in their normal operating condition (inverting for the Si8736). See the table above for more details on the Enable
function.

3.3 Under Voltage Lockout (UVLO)
The UVLO circuit unconditionally drives VO to its default state when VDD is below the lockout threshold. Referring to the figure below,
upon power up, the Si873x is maintained in UVLO until VDD rises above VDDUV+. During power down, the Si873x enters UVLO when
VDD falls below the UVLO threshold plus hysteresis (i.e., VDD < VDDUV+ – VDDHYS).

                                                                                                                              Applications
The optically-coupled circuit of Figure 4.1 Si873x Input Circuit on page 7 turns the LED on when the control input is high. However,
internal capacitive coupling from the LED to the power and ground conductors can momentarily force the LED into its off state when the
anode and cathode inputs are subjected to a high common-mode transient. The circuit shown in Figure 4.2 High CMR Si873x Input
Circuit on page 7 addresses this issue by using a value of R1 sufficiently low to overdrive the LED, ensuring it remains on during an
input common-mode transient. Q1 shorts the LED off in the low output state, again increasing common-mode transient immunity.
Some opto coupler applications recommend reverse-biasing the LED when the control input is off to prevent coupled noise from ener-
gizing the LED. The Si873x input circuit requires less current and has twice the off-state noise margin compared to opto couplers. How-
ever, high CMR opto coupler designs that overdrive the LED (see Figure 4.2 High CMR Si873x Input Circuit on page 7) may require
increasing the value of R1 to limit input current IF to its maximum rating when using the Si873x. In addition, there is no benefit in driving
the Si873x input diode into reverse bias when in the off state. Consequently, opto coupler circuits using this technique should either
leave the negative bias circuitry unpopulated or modify the circuitry (e.g., add a clamp diode or current limiting resistor) to ensure that
the anode pin of the Si873x is no more than –0.3 V with respect to the cathode when reverse-biased.
New designs should consider the input circuit configurations of Figure 4.3 Si873x Other Input Circuit Configurations on page 8,
which are more efficient than those of the figures above. As shown, S1 and S2 represent any suitable switch, such as a BJT or MOS-
FET, analog transmission gate, processor I/O, etc. Also, note that the Si873x input can be driven from the I/O port of any MCU or FPGA
capable of sourcing a minimum of 6 mA (see Figure 4.3 Si873x Other Input Circuit Configurations on page 8C). Additionally, note
that the Si873x propagation delay and output drive do not significantly change for values of IF between IF(MIN) and IF(MAX).

4.2 Output Circuit Design and Power Supply Connections
GND can be biased at, above, or below ground as long as the voltage on VDD with respect to GND is a maximum of 5.5 V. VDD decou-
pling capacitors should be placed as close to the package pins as possible. The optimum values for these capacitors depend on load
current and the distance between the chip and its power source. It is recommended that 0.1 and 1 µF bypass capacitors be used to
reduce high-frequency noise and maximize performance. Opto replacement applications should limit their supply voltages to 5.5 V or
less.

 Note: To determine resistance and capacitance, the Si873x is converted into a 2-terminal device. Pins 1–4 are shorted together to
 form the first terminal, and pins 5–8 are shorted together to form the second terminal. The parameters are then measured between
 these two terminals.
