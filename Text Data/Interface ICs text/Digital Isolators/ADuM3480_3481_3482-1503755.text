  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOL < 0.8 × VDDLx or VOH > 0.7 × VDDIx. The common-mode voltage slew
  rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

  Refers to common-mode transients across the insulation barrier. Common-
  mode transients exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may cause
  latch-up or permanent damage.
Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings
may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress
rating only; functional operation of the device at these or any
other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute
maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.
