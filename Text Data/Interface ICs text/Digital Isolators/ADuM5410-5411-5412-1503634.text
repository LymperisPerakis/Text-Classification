  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining the voltage output (VO) > 0.8 VDDx. |CML| is the maximum common-
  mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both the rising and falling common-mode

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDDP = 5.0 V, VISO = 3.3 V, VSEL resistor network: R1 = 10 kΩ ± 1%, R2 = 16.9 kΩ ±1%
between VISO and GNDISO (see Figure 31). Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended operation range, which
is 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 = VDDP ≤ 5.5 V, 3.0 V ≤ VISO ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are tested
with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining the voltage output (VO) > 0.8 VDDx. |CML| is the maximum common-
  mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both the rising and falling common-mode
  voltage edges.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 2.5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 2.25 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 2.75 V, 2.25 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 2.75 V, −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.

10         PDIS       Power Disable. When tied to any GND1 pin, the power converter is active; when a logic high voltage is applied, the
                      power supply enters a low power standby mode.
11         VDDP       Primary Supply Voltage, 3.0 V to 5.5 V.
13, 16, 23 GNDISO     Ground Reference for VDD2 and VISO on Side 2. Pin 13, Pin 16, and Pin 23 are internally connected, and it is recommended
                      that these pins be connected to a common ground.
14         VISO       Secondary Supply Voltage Output for External Loads. Connect to VDD2 to power the isolator channels.
15         VSEL       Output Voltage Selection.
18         VE2        Output Enable 2. When VE2 is high or disconnected, the VOA and VOB outputs are enabled. When VE2 is low, the VOA
                      and VOB outputs are disabled. In noisy environments, connecting VE2 to either an external logic high or logic low is
                      recommended.

22         VOA        Logic Output A.
24         VDD2       Power Supply for the Side 2 Logic Circuits of the Device. This pin is independent of VDDP and operates between 3.0 V
                      and 5.5 V.

Because only the ac portion of the stress causes wear out, the
equation can be rearranged to solve for the ac rms voltage, as is                The working voltage across the barrier from Equation 1 is

isolation is 240 V ac rms and a 400 V dc bus voltage is present                                     VAC RMS = 240 V rms
