  VCM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common-mode voltage is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew
  rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode edges.

The outputs on the secondary side hold the last state that they
received from the primary side. Either the UVLO level is
reached and the outputs are placed in their high impedance
state, or the outputs detect a lack of activity from the primary
