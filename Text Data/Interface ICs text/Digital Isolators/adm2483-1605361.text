  Common-mode transient immunity is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation.
  VCM is the common-mode potential difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The
  common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

3                 RxD                Receiver Output Data. When enabled, if (A − B) ≥ −30 mV, then RxD = high. If (A − B) ≤ −200 mV, then

In the ADM2483, electrical isolation is implemented on the                        The digital signals are transmitted across the isolation barrier
logic side of the interface. Therefore, the part has two main                     using iCoupler technology. This technique uses chip scale trans-
sections: a digital isolation section and a transceiver section (see              former windings to couple the digital signals magnetically from
Figure 26). Driver input and data enable signals, applied to the                  one side of the barrier to the other. Digital inputs are encoded into
TxD and DE pins, respectively, and referenced to logic ground                     waveforms that are capable of exciting the primary transformer
(GND1), are coupled across an isolation barrier to appear at the                  winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are
transceiver section referenced to isolated ground (GND2).                         then decoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted.
Similarly, the receiver output, referenced to isolated ground in
the transceiver section, is coupled across the isolation barrier to
appear at the RxD pin referenced to logic ground.
