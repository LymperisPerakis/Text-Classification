GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADuM3470/ADuM3471/ADuM3472/ADuM3473/
ADuM3474 devices1 are quad-channel digital isolators with an
integrated PWM controller and transformer driver for an isolated
dc-to-dc converter. Based on the Analog Devices, Inc., iCoupler®
technology, the dc-to-dc converter provides up to 2 W of regulated,
isolated power at 3.3 V to 24 V from a 5.0 V input supply or from                                                          ADuM3473                       ADuM3474
a 3.3 V supply. This eliminates the need for a separate, isolated
dc-to-dc converter in 2 W isolated designs. The iCoupler chip scale
transformer technology is used to isolate the logic signals, and the
integrated transformer driver with isolated secondary side control
provides higher efficiency for the isolated dc-to-dc converter. The
result is a small form factor, total isolation solution. The ADuM347x
isolators provide four independent isolation channels in a variety of
channel configurations and data rates (see the Ordering Guide).                                                                                                                   09369-003

  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
2
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
3
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels is not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
4
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive load
  representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of the available current at less than the maximum data rate.

  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
2
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
3
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels is not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
4
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive load
  representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of the available current at less than the maximum data rate.

  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
2
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
3
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels is not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
4
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive load
  representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of the available current at less than the maximum data rate.

  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
2
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
3
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels is not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
4
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive load
  representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of the available current at less than the maximum data rate.

  Refers to common-mode transients across the insulation barrier. Common-
  mode transients exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may cause latch-up
  or permanent damage.
Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings
may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress
rating only; functional operation of the device at these or any
other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute
maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.

12                 OC                Oscillator Control Pin. When the OC pin is connected high to the VDD2 pin, the secondary controller runs in open-
                                     loop (unregulated) mode. To regulate the output voltage, connect a resistor between the OC pin and GND2; the
                                     secondary controller runs at a frequency of 200 kHz to 1 MHz, as programmed by the resistor value.

17                 FB                Feedback Input from the Secondary Output Voltage, VISO. Use a resistor divider from the VISO output to the FB pin
                                     to set the VFB voltage equal to the 1.25 V internal reference level using the formula VISO = VFB × (R1 + R2)/R2. The
                                     resistor divider is required even in open-loop mode to provide soft start.

                                     voltage is supplied to VREG, the internal regulator regulates the VDD2 pin to 5.0 V. Otherwise, VDD2 should be in the
                                     3.0 V to 5.5 V range. Connect a 0.1 μF bypass capacitor from VDD2 to GND2.

whether the waveform is bipolar ac, dc, or unipolar ac. Figure 46,
Figure 47, and Figure 48 illustrate these different isolation
