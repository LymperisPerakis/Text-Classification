3. Functional Description
3.1 Theory of Operation
The Si88xx family of products is capable of transmitting and receiving digital data signals from an isolated power domain to a local
system power domain with up to 5 kV of isolation. Each part has four unidirectional digital isolation channels. In addition, Si88xx prod-
ucts include an integrated controller and switches for a dc-dc converter which regulates output voltage by sensing it on the isolated
side.
3.2 Digital Isolation
The operation of an Si88xx digital channel is analogous to that of a digital buffer, except an RF carrier transmits data across the isola-
tion barrier. This simple architecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special considerations or initialization at start-
up. A simplified block diagram for a single Si88xx channel is shown in Figure 3.1 Simplified Si88xx Channel Diagram on page 7.

A channel consists of an RF Transmitter and RF Receiver separated by a silicon dioxide capacitive isolation barrier. In the transmitter,
input A modulates the carrier provided by an RF oscillator using on/off keying. The receiver contains a demodulator that decodes the
input state according to its RF energy content and applies the result to output B via the output driver. This RF on/off keying scheme is
superior to pulse code schemes as it provides best-in-class noise immunity, low power consumption, and better immunity to magnetic
fields. See the figure below for more details.

3.3 DC-DC Converter Application Information
The Si88xx isolated dc-dc converter is based on a modified fly-back topology and uses an external transformer and Schottky rectifying
diode for low cost and high operating efficiency. The PWM controller operates in closed-loop, peak current mode control and generates
isolated output voltages with 2 W average output power at 5.0 V. Options are available for up to 24 Vdc input or output operation and
externally configured switching frequency.
The dc-dc controller modulates a pair of internal primary-side power switches (see Figure 3.3 Si883xx Block Diagram: 3 V–5 V Input to
3 V–5 V Output on page 10) to generate an isolated voltage at external diode D1 cathode. Closed-loop feedback is provided by a
compensated error amplifier, which compares the voltage at the VSNS pin to an internal voltage reference. The resulting error voltage
is fed back through the isolation barrier via an internal feedback path to the controller, thus completing the control loop.
For higher input supply voltages than 5 V, an external FET Q2 is modulated by a driver pin ESW as shown in (see Figure 3.5 Si886xx
Block Diagram: 24 V Input to 5 V Output on page 12). A shunt resistor based voltage sense pin RSN provides current sensing capa-
bility to the controller.
Additional features include an externally-triggered shutdown of the converter functionality using the SH pin and a programmable soft
start configured by a capacitor connected to the SS pin. The Si88xx can be used in low- or high-voltage configurations. These features
and configurations are explained in more detail below.
3.3.1 Shutdown
This feature allows the operation of the dc-dc converter to be shut down when asserted high. This function is provided by pin 6 (labeled
“SH” on the Si882xx) and pin 7 (labeled “SH_FC” on the Si883xx and Si886xx). This feature is not available on the Si884xx. Pin 6 or pin
7 provide the exact same functionality and shut down the dc-dc converter when asserted high. For normal operation, pins 6 and 7
should be connected to ground.
3.3.2 Soft-Start
The dc-dc controller has an internal timer that controls the power conversion start-up to limit inrush current. There is also the Soft Start
option where users can program the soft start up by an external capacitor connected to the SS pin. This feature is available on the
Si883xx and the Si886xx.
3.3.3 Programmable Frequency
The frequency of the PWM modulator is set to a default of 250 kHz for Si882xx/4xx. Users can program their desired frequency within a
given band of 200 kHz to 800 kHz by controlling the time constant of an external RC connected to the SH_FC and SS pins for Si883xx/
6xx.
3.3.4 External Transformer Driver
The dc-dc controller has internal switches (VSW) for driving the transformer with up-to a 5.5 V voltage supply. For higher voltages on
the primary side, a driver output (ESW) is provided that can drive an external NMOS power transistor for driving the transformer. When
this configuration is used, a shunt resistor based voltage sense pin (RSN) provides current sensing to the controller.
3.3.5 VREGA, VREGB
For supporting voltages greater than 5.5 V, an internal voltage regulator (VREGA, VREGB) needs to be used in conjunction with an
external NPN transistor, a resistor and a capacitor to provide regulated voltage to the IC.
3.3.6 Output Voltage Control
The isolated output voltage (VOUT) is sensed by a resistor divider that provides feedback to the controller through the VSNS pin. The
voltage error is encoded and transmitted back to the primary side controller across the isolation barrier, which in turn changes the duty
cycle of the transformer driver. The equation for VOUT is as follows:

3.3.7 Compensation
The dc-dc converter uses peak current mode control. The loop is compensated by connecting an external resistor in series with a ca-
pacitor from the COMP pin to GNDB. The compensation resistance, RCOMP is fixed at 49.9 kΩ for Si882xx/3xx and 100 kΩ for
Si884xx/6xx to match internal resistance. Capacitance value is given by the following equation, where fC is crossover frequency:
                                                                           6

For more details on the calculations involved, see AN892: Design Guide for Isolated DC/DC Using the Si882xx/883xx.
3.3.8 Thermal Protection
A thermal shutdown circuit is included to protect the system from over-temperature events. The thermal shutdown is activated at a junc-
tion temperature that prevents permanent damage from occurring.
3.3.9 Cycle Skipping
Cycle skipping is included to reduce switching power losses at light loads. This feature is transparent to the user and is activated auto-
matically at light loads. The product options with integrated power switches (Si882xx/3xx) may never experience cycle skipping during
operation even at light loads while the external power switch options (Si884xx/6xx) are likely to have cycle skipping start at light loads.

3.3.10 Low-Voltage Configuration
The low-voltage configuration is used for converting 3.0 V to 5.5 V. All product options of the Si882xx and Si883xx are intended for this
configuration.
An advantage of Si88xx devices over other converters that use this same topology is that the output voltage is sensed on the secon-
dary side without requiring additional optocouplers and support circuitry to bias those optocouplers. This allows the dc-dc to operate
with superior line and load regulation while reducing external components and increasing lifetime reliability.
In a typical digital signal isolation application, the dc-dc powers the Si882xx and Si883xx VDDB as shown in the figure below. In addi-
tion to powering the isolated side of the dc-dc, it can deliver up to 2 W of power to external loads. The dc-dc requires an input capacitor,
C2, blocking capacitor, C1, transformer, T1, rectifying diode, D1, and an output capacitor, C3. Resistors R1 and R2 divide the output
voltage to match the internal reference of the error amplifier. Type 1 loop compensation made by RCOMP and CCOMP are required at
the COMP pin. Though it is not necessary for normal operation, we recommend that a snubber be used to minimize radiated emissions.

3.3.12 High-Voltage to Low-Voltage Configuration
The high-voltage configuration is used for converting up to 24 V to 3.3 V or 5.0 V. All product options of the Si884xx and Si886xx are
intended for this configuration.
Si884xx and Si886xx can be used for dc-dc applications that have primary side voltage greater than 5.5 V. The dc-dc converter uses
the isolated flyback topology. With this topology, the switch and sense resistor are external, allowing higher switching voltages. Digital
isolator supply VDDA of the Si884xx and Si886xx require a supply less than or equal to 5.5 V. If a suitable supply is not available on the
primary side, the VREGA voltage reference with external NPN transistor can supply VDDA. This eliminates the need to design an addi-
tional linear regulator circuit. Like the Si882xx and Si883xx, the output voltage is sensed on the secondary side without requiring addi-
tional optocouplers and support circuitry to bias those optocouplers. This allows the dc-dc to operate with superior line and load regula-
tion.
The figure below shows the block diagram of an Si886xx with external components. Si886xx is different from the Si882xx/883xx as it
has externally-controlled switching frequency and soft start. The dc-dc requires input capacitor C2, transformer T1, switch Q1, sense
resistor R4, rectifying diode D1 and an output capacitor C3. To supply VDDA, Q2 transistor is biased and filtered by R3 and C1. Exter-
nal frequency and soft start behavior is set by CSS and RFSW. Resistors R1 and R2 divide the output voltage to match the internal
reference of the error amplifier. Type 1 loop compensation made by RCOMP and CCOMP are required at the COMP pin. Though it is
not necessary for normal operation, we recommend to use a snubber, to minimize high-frequency emissions. For further details, see
AN901: Design Guide for Isolated DC-DC Using the Si884xx/886xx.

 Notes:
    1. Over recommended operating conditions as noted in Table 4.1 Recommended Operating Conditions on page 16.
    2. VOUT = VSNS x (1 + R1/R2) + R1 x Ioffset
    3. VDDP current needed for dc-dc circuits.
    4. VDDA current needed for dc-dc circuits.
    5. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of
       the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission
       line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled impedance PCB traces.
    6. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at the same
       supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
    7. Start-up time is the time period from when the UVLO threshold is exceeded to valid data at the output.

 Notes:
    1. The values in this table correspond to the nominal creepage and clearance values. VDE certifies the clearance and creepage
       limits as 8.5 mm minimum for the WB SOIC-20 and WB SOIC-16 packages. UL does not impose a clearance and creepage mini-
       mum for component-level certifications. CSA certifies the clearance and creepage limits as 7.6 mm minimum for the WB SOIC-20
       and WB SOIC-16 packages.
    2. To determine resistance and capacitance, the Si88xx is converted into a 2-terminal device. Pins 1–8 are shorted together to form
       the first terminal and pins 9–16 are shorted together to form the second terminal. The parameters are then measured between
       these two terminals.
    3. Measured from input to ground.

 Notes:
    1. Permanent device damage may occur if the absolute maximum ratings are exceeded. Functional operation should be restricted to
       the conditions as specified in the operational sections of this data sheet. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for ex-
       tended periods may affect device reliability.
4.1 Calculating Total Current Consumption
For calculating dynamic supply current, use the following guidelines:
The dynamic current is calculated as follows:
      ( ) ( ) × (V ) × ( D2 ) × 1E −3
 IDD ac = C L
Where
IDD(ac) is the dynamic component of current, per output channel, in mA
D is the data-rate of that channel, in Mbps
CL is the load capacitance connected to the output, in pF
V is the VDD on the output side, in Volts
For example, for the Si88x21ED-IS, the total current can be calculated as follows:
The average DC IDDA/B is the average of the DC current values at input 0 and input 1, for VDDA and VDDB respectively, as stated in

 Notes:
    1. VDDI and VDDO are the input and output power supplies. VI and VO are the respective input and output terminals.
    2. P = powered; UP = unpowered.
    3. Note that an I/O can power the die for a given side through an internal diode if its source has adequate current. This situation
       should be avoided. We recommend that I/O's not be driven high when primary side supply is turned off or when in dc-dc shut-
       down mode.
    4. See Section 2. Ordering Guide for details. This is the selectable fail-safe operating mode (ordering option). When VDDB is pow-
       ered via the primary side and the integrated dc-dc, the default outputs are undetermined as secondary side power is not available
       when primary side power shuts off.
5.1 Device Startup
Outputs are held low during power up until VDDx is above the UVLO threshold for time period tSU. Following this, the outputs follow the
states of inputs.
5.2 Undervoltage Lockout
Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) is provided to prevent erroneous operation during device startup and shutdown or when VDDx is below
its specified operating circuits range. Both Side A and Side B each have their own undervoltage lockout monitors. Each side can enter
or exit UVLO independently. For example, Side A unconditionally enters UVLO when VDDA falls below VDDUV– and exits UVLO when
VDDA rises above VDDUV+. Side B operates the same as Side A with respect to its VDD supply.
5.3 Layout Recommendations
To ensure safety in the end user application, high voltage circuits (i.e., circuits with >30 VAC) must be physically separated from the
safety extra-low voltage circuits (SELV is a circuit with <30 VAC) by a certain distance (creepage/clearance). If a component, such as a
digital isolator, straddles this isolation barrier, it must meet those creepage/clearance requirements and also provide a sufficiently large
high-voltage breakdown protection rating (commonly referred to as working voltage protection). Table 4.4 Insulation and Safety-Related
Specifications on page 25 and Table 4.6 VDE 0884-10 Insulation Characteristics1 on page 26 detail the working voltage and creepage/
clearance capabilities of the Si88xx. These tables also detail the component standards (UL1577, VDE0884-10, CSA 5A), which are
readily accepted by certification bodies to provide proof for end-system specifications requirements. Refer to the end-system specifica-
tion (61010-1, 60950-1, 60601-1, etc.) requirements before starting any design that uses a digital isolator.
5.3.1 Supply Bypass
The Si88xx family requires a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor between all VDDx and their associated GNDx. The capacitor should be placed as
close as possible to the package. To enhance the robustness of a design, the user may also include resistors (50–300 Ω) in series with
the inputs and outputs if the system is excessively noisy.
5.3.2 Output Pin Termination
The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of the on-
chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving high-impedance terminated PCB traces,
output pins should be source-terminated to minimize reflections.

5.4 Fail-Safe Operating Mode
Si88xx devices feature a selectable (by ordering option) mode whereby the default output state (when the input supply is unpowered)
can either be a logic high or logic low when the output supply is powered. See Table 5.1 Si88xx Logic Operation on page 29 and Table
2.1 Si88x2x Ordering Guide1,2,3,4 on page 5 for more information.
