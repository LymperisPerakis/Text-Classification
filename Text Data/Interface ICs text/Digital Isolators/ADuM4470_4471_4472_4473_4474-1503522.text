lated dc-to-dc isolated power supply controller and an internal                                             to-dc converter with a 3.3 V to 24 V isolated output voltage
MOSFET driver. The dc-to-dc controller has an internal isolated                                             range from either a 5.0 V or a 3.3 V input voltage, with an

iCoupler® chip scale transformer technology and complete loop                                               The ADuM447x isolators provide four independent isolation

  VDD1 is the power supply for the push-pull transformer.
2
  VDDA is the power supply of Side 1 of the ADuM447x.
3
  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
4
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
5
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels were not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
6
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive load
  representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of available current at less than the maximum data rate.

  VDD1 is the power supply for the push-pull transformer.
2
  VDDA is the power supply of Side 1 of the ADuM447x.
3
  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
4
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
5
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels were not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
6
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive
  load representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of available current at less than the maximum
  data rate.

  VDD1 is the power supply for the push-pull transformer.
2
  VDDA is the power supply of Side 1 of the ADuM447x.
3
  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
4
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
5
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels were not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
6
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive
  load representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of available current at less than the maximum
  data rate.

  VDD1 is the power supply for the push-pull transformer.
2
  VDDA is the power supply of Side 1 of the ADuM447x.
3
  The contributions of supply current values for all four channels are combined at identical data rates.
4
  The VISO supply current is available for external use when all data rates are below 2 Mbps. At data rates above 2 Mbps, the data I/O channels draw additional current
  proportional to the data rate. Additional supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the
  Power Consumption section. The dynamic I/O channel load must be treated as an external load and included in the VISO power budget.
5
  The power demands of the quiescent operation of the data channels were not separated from the power supply section. Efficiency includes the quiescent power
  consumed by the I/O channels as part of the internal power consumption.
6
  This current is available for driving external loads at the VISO output. All channels are simultaneously driven at a maximum data rate of 25 Mbps with full capacitive
  load representing the maximum dynamic load conditions. Refer to the Power Consumption section for calculation of available current at less than the maximum
  data rate.

11, 19    GND2       Ground Reference for Isolator Side 2.
12        OC         Oscillator Control Pin. When OC = logic high = VDD2, the secondary controller runs open-loop. To regulate the output
                     voltage, connect a resistor between the OC pin and GND2, and the secondary controller runs at a frequency of 200 kHz
                     to 1 MHz, as programmed by the resistor value.

                     voltage equal to the 1.25 V internal reference level using the VISO = VFB × (R1 + R2)/R2 formula. The resistor divider is
                     required even in open-loop mode to provide soft start.
18        VDD2       Internal Supply Voltage Pin for the Secondary Side. When a sufficient external voltage is supplied to VREG, the internal
                     regulator regulates the VDD2 pin to 5.0 V. Otherwise, VDD2 should be in the 3.0 V to 5.5 V range. Connect a 0.1 µF bypass
                     capacitor from VDD2 to GND2.
20        VREG       Input of the Internal Regulator to Power the Secondary Side Controller. VREG should be in the 5.5 V to 15 V range to
                     regulate the VDD2 output to 5.0 V.

the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of
logic transitions at the input for more than 1 µs, periodic sets of
refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure
dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal
pulses of more than approximately 5 µs, the input side is assumed
to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the isolator
output is forced to a default state (see Table 17) by the watchdog
timer circuit. This situation should occur in the ADuM447x
devices only during power-up and power-down operations.

operating voltage, the power converter holds its oscillator inactive,

are held in a low state. This is to prevent transmission of undefined
states during power-up and power-down operations.
During the application of power to VDDA, the primary side
circuitry is held idle until the UVLO preset voltage is reached.
At that time, the data channels are initialized to their default
low output state until they receive data pulses from the
secondary side.
