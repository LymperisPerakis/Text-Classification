ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range of 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ 105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.
