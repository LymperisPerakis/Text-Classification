  Supply current values are for both channels running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The supply current
  associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 4 through Figure 6 for
  information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 7 and Figure 8 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply
  currents as a function of data rate.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.

  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output
  load within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.

  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in the signal data rate. See Figure 4 through Figure 6 for
  information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on
  calculating per-channel supply current for a given data rate.

  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.

  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output
  load within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in the signal data rate. See Figure 4 through Figure 6 for
  information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on
  calculating per-channel supply current for a given data rate.
