GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADuM1250/ADuM12511 are hot swappable digital isolators                                                  Both the ADuM1250 and the ADuM1251 contain hot swap
with nonlatching, bidirectional communication channels that                                                 circuitry to prevent glitching data when an unpowered card is

for use with standalone optocouplers.                                                                       technology from Analog Devices, Inc. iCoupler is a magnetic

  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
