  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.7 × VDD1 or 0.7 × VISO for a high output or VO < 0.3 × VDD1 or 0.3 × VISO for a
  low output. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

1       VDD1        Primary Supply Voltage, 3.0 V to 5.5 V.
2, 8    GND1        Ground 1. Ground reference for the isolator primary side. Pin 2 and Pin 8 are internally connected to each other, and
                    it is recommended that both pins be connected to a common ground.
3       VIA         Logic Input A.
4       VIB         Logic Input B.
5       RCIN        Regulation Control Input. This pin must be connected to the RCOUT pin of a master isoPower device or tied low. Note
                    that this pin must not be tied high if RCSEL is low; this combination causes excessive voltage on the secondary side,
                    damaging the ADuM5200 and possibly the devices that it powers.
6       RCSEL       Control Input. Determines self-regulation mode (RCSEL high) or slave mode (RCSEL low), allowing external regulation.
                    This pin is weakly pulled to the high state. In noisy environments, tie this pin either high or low.
7, 12   NC          No Internal Connection.
9, 15   GNDISO      Ground Reference for Isolator Side 2. Pin 9 and Pin 15 are internally connected to each other, and it is recommended
                    that both pins be connected to a common ground.
10      VE2         Data Enable Input. When this pin is high or not connected, the secondary outputs are active; when this pin is low,
                    the outputs are in a high-Z state.
11      VSEL        Output Voltage Selection. When VSEL = VISO, the VISO setpoint is 5.0 V. When VSEL = GNDISO, the VISO setpoint is 3.3 V.
                    In slave regulation mode, this pin has no function.
13      VOB         Logic Output B.
14      VOA         Logic Output A.
16      VISO        Secondary Supply Voltage. Output for secondary side isolated data channels and external loads.

1       VDD1     Primary Supply Voltage, 3.0 V to 5.5 V.
2, 8    GND1     Ground 1. Ground reference for isolator primary side. Pin 2 and Pin 8 are internally connected to each other, and it is
                 recommended that both pins be connected to a common ground.
3       VIA      Logic Input A.
4       VOB      Logic Output B.
5       RCIN     Regulation Control Input. This pin must be connected to the RCOUT pin of a master isoPower device or tied low. Note
                 that this pin must not be tied high if RCSEL is low; this combination causes excessive voltage on the secondary side,
                 damaging the ADuM5201 and possibly the devices that it powers.
6       RCSEL    Control Input. Determines self-regulation mode (RCSEL high) or slave mode (RCSEL low), allowing external regulation.
                 This pin is weakly pulled to the high state. In noisy environments, tie this pin either high or low.
7       VE1      Data Enable Input. When this pin is high or not connected, the primary output is active; when this pin is low, the
                 output is in a high-Z state.
9, 15   GNDISO   Ground Reference for Isolator Side 2. Pin 9 and Pin 15 are internally connected to each other, and it is recommended
                 that both pins be connected to a common ground.
10      VE2      Data Enable Input. When this pin is high or not connected, the secondary output is active; when this pin is low, the
                 output is in a high-Z state.
11      VSEL     Output Voltage Selection. When VSEL = VISO, the VISO setpoint is 5.0 V. When VSEL = GNDISO, the VISO setpoint is 3.3 V.
                 In slave regulation mode, this pin has no function.
12      NC       No Internal Connection.
13      VIB      Logic Input B.
