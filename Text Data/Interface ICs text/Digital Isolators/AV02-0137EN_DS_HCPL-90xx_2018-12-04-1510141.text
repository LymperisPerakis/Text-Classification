Propagation delay skew represents the uncertainty of where an edge might be after being sent through a digital isolator.
Figure 4 shows that there will be uncertainty in both the data and clock lines. It is important that these two areas of
uncertainty not overlap. Otherwise, the clock signal might arrive before all of the data outputs have settled, or some of the
data outputs might start to change before the clock signal has arrived. From these considerations, the absolute minimum
pulse width that can be sent through digital isolators in a parallel application is twice tPSK. A cautious design should use a
slightly longer pulse width to ensure that any additional uncertainty in the rest of the circuit does not cause a problem.
Figure 5 shows the minimum pulse width, rise and fall time, and propagation delay enable to output waveforms for
HCPL-9000 or HCPL-0900.
