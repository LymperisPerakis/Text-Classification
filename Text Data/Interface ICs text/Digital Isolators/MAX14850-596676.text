data rates from DC to 2Mbps.                                     • I2C
Independent 3.0V to 5.5V supplies on each side of the            • SPI
isolator also make it suitable for use as a level translator.    • RS-232, RS-422/RS-485
The MAX14850 can be used for isolating SPI buses, I2C            • SMBus, PMBus Interfaces
buses, RS-232, RS-485/RS-422 buses, and general-pur-
pose isolation. When used as a bus isolator, extra chan-      Ordering Information appears at end of data sheet.

Note 1: All units are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design. All voltages of side
         A are referenced to GNDA. All voltages of side B are referenced to GNDB, unless otherwise noted.
Note 2: Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
Note 3: The undervoltage lockout threshold and hysteresis guarantee that the outputs are in a known state during a slump in the
         supplies. See the Detailed Description section for more information.
Note 4: The isolation is guaranteed for t = 60s, and tested at 120% of the guaranteed value for 1s.
Note 5: ΔVTOL = VOL – VIL. This is the minimum difference between the output logic-low voltage and the input logic threshold for
         the same I/O pin. This ensures that the I/O channels are not latched low when any of the I/O inputs are driven low (see the
         Bidirectional Channels section).
Note 6: The common-mode transient immunity guarantees that the device will hold its outputs stable when the isolation voltage
         changes at the specified rate.
Note 7: Pulse-width distortion is defined as the difference in propagation delay between low-to-high and high-to-low transitions on
         the same channel. Channel-to-channel skew is defined as the difference in propagation delay between different channels on
         the same device. Part-to-part skew is defined as the difference in propagation delays (for unidirectional channels) between
         different devices, when both devices operate with the same supply voltage, at the same temperature and have identical
         package and test circuits.
