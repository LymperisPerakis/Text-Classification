  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOUT > 0.8 VDDx. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and
  falling common-mode voltage edges.
ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—2.5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 2.5 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire

recommended operation range of 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 2.25 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 2.75 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted.
Switching specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Refers to common-mode transients across the insulation barrier. Common-
  mode transients exceeding the absolute maximum ratings can cause
  latch-up or permanent damage.
Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a
stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these
or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond
the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may
affect product reliability.
