  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.
