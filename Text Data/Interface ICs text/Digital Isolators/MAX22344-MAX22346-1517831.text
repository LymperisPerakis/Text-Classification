Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +125°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design and
         characterization.
Note 2: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
         respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: All measurements taken with VDDA = VDDB, unless otherwise noted.
Note 5: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
         both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and
         GNDB (VCM = 1000V).

 POWER
                        Power Supply Input for Side A. Bypass VDDA to GNDA with a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor as close as possible
         VDDA
                        to the pin.
        GNDA            Ground Reference for Side A.
                        Power Supply Input for Side B. Bypass VDDB to GNDB with a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor as close as
         VDDB
                        possible to the pin.
        GNDB            Ground reference for Side B.
 INPUTS
          IN1           Logic Input 1 on Side A. Corresponds to Logic Output 1 on Side B.
          IN2           Logic Input 2 on Side A. Corresponds to Logic Output 2 on Side B.
          IN3           Logic Input 3 on Side A/B. Corresponds to Logic Output 3 on Side B/A.
          IN4           Logic Input 4 on Side A/B. Corresponds to Logic Output 4 on Side B/A.
 OUTPUTS
         OUT1           Logic Output 1 on Side B. OUT1 is the logic output for the IN1 input on Side A.
         OUT2           Logic Output 2 on Side B. OUT2 is the logic output for the IN2 input on Side A.
         OUT3           Logic Output 3 on Side B/A. OUT3 is the logic output for the IN3 input on Side A/B.
         OUT4           Logic Output 4 on Side B/A. OUT4 is the logic output for the IN4 input on Side A/B.
 ENABLE INPUTS
         ENA            Active-High Enable for Side A. ENA has an internal 5μA pull-up to VDDA.
         ENA            Active-Low Enable for Side A. ENA has an internal 5μA pull-down to GNDA.
         ENB            Active-High Enable for Side B. ENB has an internal 5μA pull-up to VDDB.
 DEFAULT CONTROL
                        Default Control Input for Side A. Connect DEFA to VDDA to set side A outputs to a default-high state and to
                        enable the pullup current on side A inputs. Connect DEFA to GNDA to set side A outputs to a default-low
         DEFA
                        state and enable the pulldown current on side A inputs. DEFA must be tied to the same state (high or low)
                        as DEFB.
                        Default Control Input for Side B. Connect DEFB to VDDB to set side B outputs to a default-high state and to
                        enable the pullup current on side B inputs. Connect DEFB to GNDB to set side B outputs to a default-low
         DEFB
                        state and enable the pulldown current on side B inputs. DEFB must be tied to the same state (high or low)
                        as DEFA.
 INTERNALLY CONNECTED, NOT CONNECTED
