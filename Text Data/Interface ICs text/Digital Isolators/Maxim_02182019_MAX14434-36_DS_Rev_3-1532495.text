General Description                                          Benefits and Features
The MAX14434–MAX14436 are the fastest, lowest power,         ●● Robust Galvanic Isolation for Fast Digital Signals
4-channel, digital galvanic isolators on the market today       • 200Mbps Data Rate
using Maxim’s proprietary process technology. These             • Withstands 5kVRMS for 60s (VISO)
devices transfer digital signals between circuits with          • Continuously Withstands 848VRMS (VIOWM)
different power domains while using as little as 0.58mW per     • Withstands ±10kV Surge between GNDA and
channel at 1Mbps with a 1.8V supply. The MAX14434/5/6              GNDB with 1.2/50μs waveform
have an isolation rating of 5kVRMS for 60 seconds.              • High CMTI (50kV/μs, Typical)
The MAX14434–MAX14436 family offers all three                ●● Low Power Consumption
possible unidirectional channel configurations to               • 1.1mW per Channel at 1Mbps with VDD = 3.3V
accommodate any 4-channel design, including SPI,                • 3.5mW per Channel at 100Mbps with VDD = 1.8V
RS-232, RS-485, and digital I/O applications. Output         ●● Options to Support a Broad Range of Applications

the traditional active-high enable.                          Applications
Devices are available with a maximum data rate of either     ●● Fieldbus Communications for Industrial Automation
25Mbps or 200Mbps and with outputs that are either           ●● Isolated RS-485/RS-422, CAN

devices suitable for use as level translators.
                                                             ●● cUL According to CSA Bulletin 5A
The MAX14434–MAX14436 are available in a 16-pin wide-
body SOIC package with 8mm of creepage and clearance.        ●● VDE 0884-10
The package material has a minimum comparative track-
ing index (CTI) of 600V, which gives it a group 1 rat­ing
in creepage tables. All devices are rated for operation at
ambient temperatures of -40°C to +125°C.

Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design and characterization,
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
          respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
          both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and
          GNDB (VCM = 1000V).
