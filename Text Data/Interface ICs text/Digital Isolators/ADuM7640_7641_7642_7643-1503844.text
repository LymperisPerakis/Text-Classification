ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended operation
range of 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are tested
with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOL < 0.8 VDDLx or VOH > 0.7 × VDDIx. The common-mode voltage slew
  rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—MIXED 5 V/3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 5 V, VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recom-
mended operation range of 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
3
  Opposing directional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposite sides of the
  isolation barrier.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOL < 0.8 VDDLx or VOH > 0.7 × VDDIx. The common-mode voltage slew
  rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 3.3 V, VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recom-
mended operation range of 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
3
  Opposing directional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposite sides of the
  isolation barrier.

For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum
allowable magnetic field of 0.5 kgauss induces a voltage of 0.25 V at
the receiving coil. This voltage is approximately 50% of the sensing
threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly, if
such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse and is of the
worst-case polarity, it reduces the received pulse from >1.0 V to
0.75 V, still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of the decoder.

All insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to
voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation
degradation depends on the characteristics of the voltage waveform                                    RATED PEAK VOLTAGE
applied across the insulation. In addition to the testing performed
                                                                                                                                             10448-026

Analog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage
levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Accel-
eration factors for several operating conditions are determined.
These factors allow calculation of the time to failure at the actual
working voltage. The values shown in Table 18 summarize the peak
voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating
condition and the maximum working voltages. In many cases,
the approved working voltage is higher than the 50-year service life
voltage. Operation at these high working voltages can lead to
shortened insulation life in some cases.
