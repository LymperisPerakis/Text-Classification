ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operating range of 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF, and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 2.5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operating range of 2.25 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 2.75 V, 2.25 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 2.75 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF, and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—VDD1 = 2.5 V, VDD2 = 3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 2.5, and VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operating range of 2.25 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 2.75 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted.
Switching specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF, and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.
For dc specifications and ac specifications, see Table 6 for Side 1 and see Table 3 for Side 2.

INTRINSIC SAFETY
The ADuM1440/ADuM1441/ADuM1442/ADuM1445/ADuM1446/ADuM1447 support intrinsic safety for IS to IS applications under
IEC 60079-11, and carry ATEX and IECEx certifications. These devices do not currently support IS to non IS galvanic isolation
applications due to the minimum insulation requirements of IEC60079-11.
Product Conformity Certificate
Sira 16ATEX2265U and IECEx SIR 16.0091U
Special Conditions for Safe Use
These components are certified to comply with IEC 60079-11:2011. When one of these components is used in equipment, the component
is to be fitted on a PCB inside a suitable enclosure and recertified as equipment. The creepage and clearance distances across the isolating
component have been evaluated, but the distances to other circuitry remain the responsibility of the user of the certified equipment.
This assembly is an isolating component between separate intrinsically safe circuits. It is recommended that the assembly be connected to
suitably certified intrinsically safe circuits considering the entity parameters in Table 16.

  Li is defined as input inductance, Ci is input capacitance, Pi is input power, Ui is input voltage, and Ii is input current.
The components (for example, digital isolators) being certified have the following safety ratings listed in Table 17. The temperature class is
determined based on Table 17.

  Refers to common-mode transients across the insulation barrier. Common-mode
  transients exceeding the absolute maximum ratings can cause latch-up or
  permanent damage.
Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a
stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these
or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond
the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may
affect product reliability.
