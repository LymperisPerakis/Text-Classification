ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range of 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—2.5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 2.5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 2.25 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 2.75 V, 2.25 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 2.75 V, −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 1.8 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 1.7 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 1.9 V, 1.7 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 1.9 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.

  VIx and VOx refer to the input and output signals of a given channel (A or B). VDDI and VDDO refer to the supply voltages on the input and output sides of the given
  channel, respectively.
3
  N0 refers to the ADuM220N0/ADuM221N0/ADuM225N0/ADuM226N0 models, and N1 refers to the ADuM220N1/ADuM221N1/ADuM225N1/ADuM226N1 models. See
  the Ordering Guide section.

  Input pins (VIx) on the same side as an unpowered supply must be in a low state to avoid powering the device through its ESD protection circuitry.

VRMS is the total rms working voltage.                                          set by the creepage of the package as specified in IEC 60664-1.
VAC RMS is the time varying portion of the working voltage.                     These values can differ for specific system level standards.
VDC is the dc offset of the working voltage.
