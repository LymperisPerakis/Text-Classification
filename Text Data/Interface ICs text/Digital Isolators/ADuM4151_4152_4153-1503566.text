1
  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA, VIB, or VIC.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock not available to users samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA, VIB, or VIC.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock not available to users samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.

  An internal asynchronous clock not available to users samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 3.3 V, and VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL =15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  In accordance with UL 1577, each model is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥6000 V rms for 1 second (current leakage detection limit = 10 µA).
2
  In accordance with DIN V VDE V 0884-10, each model is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥ 1590 V peak for 1 second (partial discharge detection limit = 5 pC).
  The asterisk (*) marked on the component designates DIN V VDE V 0884-10 approval.

  Refers to common-mode transients across the insulation barrier. Common-
  mode transients exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may cause latch-up              ESD CAUTION
  or permanent damage.
Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a
stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these
or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond
the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may
affect product reliability.

The low speed channels draw a constant quiescent current
caused by the internal ping-pong datapath. The operating
frequency is low enough that the capacitive losses caused by
the recommended capacitive load are negligible compared to
the quiescent current. The explicit calculation for the data rate
is eliminated for simplicity, and the quiescent current for each
side of the isolator due to the low speed channels can be found
in Table 3, Table 6, Table 9, and Table 12 for the particular
operating voltages.

Insulation Wear Out
The lifetime of insulation due to wear out is determined by its
thickness, the material properties, and the voltage stress applied.

It is important to verify that the product lifetime is adequate at                                                             TIME

voltage supported for tracking. It is the working voltage

Testing and modeling have shown that the primary driver of

of 60 Hz ac and dc across the barrier, as shown in Equation 1.                                      VAC RMS = VRMS 2 − VDC 2
Because only the ac portion of the stress causes wear out, the
equation can be rearranged to solve for the ac rms voltage, as                                      VAC RMS = 4662 − 4002
shown in Equation 2. For insulation wear out with the
polyimide materials used in this product, the ac rms voltage                                        VAC RMS = 240 V
determines the product lifetime.                                                In this case, the ac rms voltage is simply the line voltage of
                                                                                240 V rms. This calculation is more relevant when the waveform is

1
    Z = RoHS Compliant Part.
2
    The EVAL-ADuM3151Z uses a functionally equivalent device for evaluation. The pad layout on the EVAL-ADuM3151Z board does not support the 20-lead SOIC_IC package.
3
    To evaluate the functionality of the alternative low speed channel configurations of the ADuM4152 and the ADuM4153, the user must purchase an ADuM3152 or an
    ADuM3153 and replace the component on the EVAL-ADuM3151Z evaluation board.
