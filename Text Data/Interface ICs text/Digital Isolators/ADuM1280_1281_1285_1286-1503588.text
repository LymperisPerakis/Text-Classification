  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier. Opposing-direction channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposing sides
  of the isolation barrier.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining Vo > 0.8 VDDx. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and
  falling common-mode voltage edges.
ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended operation
range: 3.135 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.135 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, −40°C ≤ TA ≤ 125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are tested with CL =
15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining Vo > 0.8 VDDX. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and
  falling common-mode voltage edges.
ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—MIXED 5 V/3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 5 V, VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 3.135 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V; and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ 125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are
tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier. Opposing-direction channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposing sides
  of the isolation barrier.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 3.3 V, VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 3.135 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V; and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ 125°C; unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications are
tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier. Opposing-direction channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposing sides
  of the isolation barrier.
