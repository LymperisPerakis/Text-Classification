  Short-circuit duration is less than 1 sec. Average output current must conform to the limit shown under the Absolute Maximum Ratings section.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified timing parameters are guaranteed. Operation below the minimum pulse width is strongly
  discouraged because in some instances pulse stretching to 1 µs may occur.
3
  The maximum switching frequency is the maximum signal frequency at which the specified timing and power conversion parameters are guaranteed. Operation
  above the maximum frequency is strongly discouraged.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  In channel-to-channel matching, the rising or falling matching edge polarity is the magnitude of the propagation delay difference between two channels of the same
  part when both inputs are either both rising or falling edges. The loads on each channel are equal.
6
  In channel-to-channel matching, the rising vs. falling opposite edge polarity is the magnitude of the propagation delay difference between two channels of the same
  part when one input is a rising edge and one input is a falling edge. The loads on each channel are equal.
7
  Part-to-part matching, rising or falling edges, is the magnitude of the propagation delay difference between the same channels of two different parts when the inputs
  are either both rising or falling edges. The supply voltages, temperatures, and loads of each part are equal.
8
  Part-to-part matching, rising vs. falling edges, is the magnitude of the propagation delay difference between the same channels of two different parts when one input
  is a rising edge and the other input is a falling edge. The supply voltages, temperatures, and loads of each part are equal.
