  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.

  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output
  load within the recommended operating conditions.
