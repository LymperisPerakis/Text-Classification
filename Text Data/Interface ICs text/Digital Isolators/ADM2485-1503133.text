  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

1               D1         Transformer Driver Terminal 1.
2               D2         Transformer Driver Terminal 2.
3               GND1       Ground, Logic Side.
4               VDD1       Power Supply, Logic Side (3.3 V or 5 V). Decoupling capacitor to GND1 required; capacitor value should be
                           between 0.01 μF and 0.1 μF.
5               RxD        Receiver Output Data. This output is high when (A − B) > 200 mV and low when (A − B) < −200 mV. The
                           output is tristated when the receiver is disabled, that is, when RE is driven high.
6               RE         Receiver Enable Input. This is an active-low input. Driving this input low enables the receiver; driving it
                           high disables the receiver.
7               RTS        Driver Enable Input. Driving this input high enables the driver; driving it low disables the driver.
8               TxD        Driver Input. Data to be transmitted by the driver is applied to this input.
9, 11, 14, 15   GND2       Ground, Bus Side.
10              DE OUT     Driver Enable Status Output.
12              A          Noninverting Driver Output/Receiver Input. When the driver is disabled or VDD1 or VDD2 is powered down,
                           Pin A is put in a high impedance state to avoid overloading the bus.
13              B          Inverting Driver Output/Receiver Input. When the driver is disabled or VDD1 or VDD2 is powered down,
                           Pin B is put in a high impedance state to avoid overloading the bus.
16              VDD2       Power Supply, Bus Side (Isolated 5 V Supply). Decoupling capacitor to GND2 required; capacitor value
                           should be between 0.01 μF and 0.1 μF.
