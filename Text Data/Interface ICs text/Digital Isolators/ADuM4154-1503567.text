All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C and VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted.
Switching specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

recommended operation range: 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  SSAx = SSA0 or SSA1.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tSSAx SKEW ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  SSAx = SSA0 or SSA1.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tSSAx SKEW ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  In accordance with UL 1577, each ADuM4154 is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥ 6000 V rms for 1 second (current leakage detection limit = 5 µA).
2
  In accordance with DIN V VDE V 0884-10, each ADuM4154 is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥ 1590 V peak for 1 second (partial discharge
  detection limit = 5 pC). The asterisk (*) marked on the component designates DIN V VDE V 0884-10 approval.

Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a
stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these

section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond
the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may
affect product reliability.

channel matching. The MI/SO SPI datapath is optimized for
propagation delay. The device does not synchronize to the clock
channel; therefore, there are no constraints on the clock polarity
or the timing with respect to the data line. To allow
compatibility with nonstandard SPI interfaces, the MI pin is
always active, and does not tristate when the slave select is not
asserted. This precludes tying several MI lines together without
adding a trisate buffer or multiplexor.

This data is regulated by a free running internal clock. Because data
is sampled at discrete times based on this clock, the propagation
delay for mux select lines is between 0.1 µs and 2.6 µs, depending
on where the input data edge changes with respect to the internal
sample clock. After an address propagation delay time of up to
2.6 µs, the multiplexer routes the MSS signals to the desired output.
The outputs that are not selected are set to high-Z, and the
application pulls them to the desired idle state.

caused by the internal ping-pong datapath. The operating
frequency is low enough that the capacitive losses caused by
the recommended capacitive load are negligible compared to
the quiescent current. The explicit calculation for the data rate
is eliminated for simplicity, and the quiescent current for each
side of the isolator due to the low speed channels can be found
in Table 3, Table 5, Table 7, and Table 9 for the particular operating
