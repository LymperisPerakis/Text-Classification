  Output supply current values are with no output load present. See Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on supply current variation with logic signal frequency. See
  the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the input and output supply currents for a given data rate and output load.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VI signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VO signal. tPLH is measured from the 50% level of the
  rising edge of the VI signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VO signal.
5
  Because the input thresholds of the ADuM1100 are at voltages other than the 50% level of typical input signals, the measured propagation delay and pulse width
  distortion can be affected by slow input rise/fall times. See the Propagation Delay-Related Parameters section and Figure 14 through Figure 18 for information on the
  impact of given input rise/fall times on these parameters.
6
  Pulse width distortion change vs. temperature is the absolute value of the change in pulse width distortion for a 1°C change in operating temperature.
7
  tPSK1 is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature and output load within the
  recommended operating conditions. tPSK2 is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating
  temperature, supply voltages, and output load within the recommended operating conditions.
8
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling edges. The transient magnitude is the range
  over which the common mode is slewed.
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on
  supply current variation with logic signal frequency. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the input and output supply currents for a given
  data rate and output load.

  Output supply current values are with no output load present. See Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on supply current variation with logic signal frequency. See
  the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the input and output supply currents for a given data rate and output load.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VI signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VO signal. tPLH is measured from the 50% level of the
  rising edge of the VI signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VO signal.
5
  Because the input thresholds of the ADuM1100 are at voltages other than the 50% level of typical input signals, the measured propagation delay and pulse width
  distortion can be affected by slow input rise/fall times. See the Propagation Delay-Related Parameters section and Figure 14 through Figure 18 for information on the
  impact of given input rise/fall times on these parameters.
6
  Pulse width distortion change vs. temperature is the absolute value of the change in pulse width distortion for a 1°C change in operating temperature.
7
  tPSK1 is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature and output load within the
  recommended operating conditions. tPSK2 is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating
  temperature, supply voltages, and output load within the recommended operating conditions.
8
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling edges. The transient magnitude is the range
  over which the common mode is slewed.
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on
  supply current variation with logic signal frequency. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the input and output supply currents for a given
  data rate and output load.

  Output supply current values are with no output load present. See Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on supply current variation with logic signal frequency. See
  the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the input and output supply currents for a given data rate and output load.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VI signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VO signal. tPLH is measured from the 50% level of the
  rising edge of the VI signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VO signal.
5
  Because the input thresholds of the ADuM1100 are at voltages other than the 50% level of typical input signals, the measured propagation delay and pulse width
  distortion can be affected by slow input rise/fall times. See the Propagation Delay-Related Parameters section and Figure 14 through Figure 18 for information on the
  impact of given input rise/fall times on these parameters.
6
  Pulse width distortion change vs. temperature is the absolute value of the change in pulse width distortion for a 1°C change in operating temperature.
7
  tPSK1 is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature and output load within the
  recommended operating conditions. tPSK2 is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating
  temperature, supply voltages, and output load within the recommended operating conditions.
8
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling edges. The transient magnitude is the range
  over which the common mode is slewed.
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 5 and Figure 6 for information on
  supply current variation with logic signal frequency. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the input and output supply currents for a given
  data rate and output load.
