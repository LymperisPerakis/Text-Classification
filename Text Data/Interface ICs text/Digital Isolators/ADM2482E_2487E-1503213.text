  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common-mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

Figure 35 and Figure 36 show typical applications of the                                  impedance, and stub lengths off the main line must be kept as

be connected to the RS-485 bus. To minimize reflections, the                              be the receiving end.
