2. System Overview
2.1 Theory of Operation
The operation of an Si863x channel is analogous to that of an opto coupler, except an RF carrier is modulated instead of light. This
simple architecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special considerations or initialization at start-up. A simplified
block diagram for a single Si863x channel is shown in the figure below.
                                                 Figure 2.1. Simplified Channel Diagram
A channel consists of an RF Transmitter and RF Receiver separated by a semiconductor-based isolation barrier. Referring to the trans-
mitter, input A modulates the carrier provided by an RF oscillator using on/off keying. The Receiver contains a demodulator that de-
codes the input state according to its RF energy content and applies the result to output B via the output driver. This RF on/off keying
scheme is superior to pulse code schemes as it provides best-in-class noise immunity, low power consumption, and improved immunity
to magnetic fields. See the following figure for more details.

2.2 Eye Diagram
The figure below illustrates an eye diagram taken on an Si8630. For the data source, the test used an Anritsu (MP1763C) Pulse Pattern
Generator set to 1000 ns/div. The output of the generator's clock and data from an Si8630 were captured on an oscilloscope. The re-
sults illustrate that data integrity was maintained even at the high data rate of 150 Mbps. The results also show that 2 ns pulse width
distortion and 350 ps peak jitter were exhibited.

3. Device Operation
Device behavior during start-up, normal operation, and shutdown is shown in Figure 3.1 Device Behavior during Normal Operation on
page 9, where UVLO+ and UVLO– are the respective positive-going and negative-going thresholds. Refer to the following tables to
determine outputs when power supply (VDD) is not present and for logic conditions when enable pins are used.

 Note:
    1. VDDI and VDDO are the input and output power supplies. VI and VO are the respective input and output terminals. EN is the
       enable control input located on the same output side.
    2. X = not applicable; H = Logic High; L = Logic Low; Hi-Z = High Impedance.
    3. It is recommended that the enable inputs be connected to an external logic high or low level when the Si86xx is operating in noisy
       environments.
    4. No Connect (NC) replaces EN1 on Si8630/35. No Connect replaces EN2 on the Si8635. No Connects are not internally connec-
       ted and can be left floating, tied to VDD, or tied to GND.
    5. “Powered” state (P) is defined as 2.5 V < VDD < 5.5 V.
    6. “Unpowered” state (UP) is defined as VDD = 0 V.
    7. Note that an I/O can power the die for a given side through an internal diode if its source has adequate current.
    8. When using the enable pin (EN) function, the output pin state is driven into a high-impedance state when the EN pin is disabled
       (EN = 0).
    9. See Ordering Guide for details. This is the selectable fail-safe operating mode (ordering option). Some devices have default out-
       put state = H, and some have default output state = L, depending on the ordering part number (OPN). For default high devices,
       the data channels have pull-ups on inputs/outputs. For default low devices, the data channels have pull-downs on inputs/outputs.

 Note:
    1. Enable inputs EN1 and EN2 can be used for multiplexing, for clock sync, or other output control. These inputs are internally
       pulled-up to local VDD allowing them to be connected to an external logic level (high or low) or left floating. To minimize noise
       coupling, do not connect circuit traces to EN1 or EN2 if they are left floating. If EN1, EN2 are unused, it is recommended they be
       connected to an external logic level, especially if the Si86xx is operating in a noisy environment.
    2. X = not applicable; H = Logic High; L = Logic Low.
    3. When using the enable pin (EN) function, the output pin state is driven into a high-impedance state when the EN pin is disabled
       (EN = 0).

3.1 Device Startup
Outputs are held low during powerup until VDD is above the UVLO threshold for time period tSTART. Following this, the outputs follow
the states of inputs.
3.2 Undervoltage Lockout
Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) is provided to prevent erroneous operation during device startup and shutdown or when VDD is below its
specified operating circuits range. Both Side A and Side B each have their own undervoltage lockout monitors. Each side can enter or
exit UVLO independently. For example, Side A unconditionally enters UVLO when VDD1 falls below VDD1(UVLO–) and exits UVLO when
VDD1 rises above VDD1(UVLO+). Side B operates the same as Side A with respect to its VDD2 supply.

3.3 Layout Recommendations
To ensure safety in the end-user application, high-voltage circuits (i.e., circuits with >30 VAC) must be physically separated from the
safety extra-low-voltage circuits (SELV is a circuit with <30 VAC) by a certain distance (creepage/clearance). If a component, such as a
digital isolator, straddles this isolation barrier, it must meet those creepage/clearance requirements and also provide a sufficiently large
high-voltage breakdown protection rating (commonly referred to as working voltage protection). Table 4.6 Insulation and Safety-Related
Specifications on page 22 and Table 4.8 IEC 60747-5-5 Insulation Characteristics for Si86xxxx 1 on page 23 detail the working volt-
age and creepage/clearance capabilities of the Si86xx. These tables also detail the component standards (UL1577, IEC60747, CSA
5A), which are readily accepted by certification bodies to provide proof for end-system specifications requirements. Refer to the end-
system specification (61010-1, 60950-1, 60601-1, etc.) requirements before starting any design that uses a digital isolator.
3.3.1 Supply Bypass
The Si863x family requires a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor between VDD1 and GND1 and VDD2 and GND2. The capacitor should be placed
as close as possible to the package. To enhance the robustness of a design, the user may also include resistors (50–300 Ω ) in series
with the inputs and outputs if the system is excessively noisy.
3.3.2 Output Pin Termination
The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of the on-
chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission line effects will
be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled impedance PCB traces.
3.4 Fail-Safe Operating Mode
Si86xx devices feature a selectable (by ordering option) mode whereby the default output state (when the input supply is unpowered)
can either be a logic high or logic low when the output supply is powered. See Table 3.1 Si86xx Logic Operation on page 7 and
1. Ordering Guide for more information.

       the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission
       line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled-impedance PCB traces.
    3. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at the same
       supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
    4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to the appearance of valid data at the output.

 Note:
    1. VDD1 = 3.3 V ±10%; VDD2 = 3.3 V ±10%, TA = –40 to 125 °C
    2. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of
       the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission
       line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled-impedance PCB traces.
    3. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at the same
       supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
    4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to the appearance of valid data at the output.

 Note:
    1. VDD1 = 2.5 V ±5%; VDD2 = 2.5 V ±5%, TA = –40 to 125 °C
    2. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of
       the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission
       line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled-impedance PCB traces.
    3. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at the same
       supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
    4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to the appearance of valid data at the output.

    1. The values in this table correspond to the nominal creepage and clearance values. VDE certifies the clearance and creepage
       limits as 4.7 mm minimum for the NB SOIC-16 package and 8.5 mm minimum for the WB SOIC-16 package. UL does not impose
       a clearance and creepage minimum for component-level certifications. CSA certifies the clearance and creepage limits as 3.9 mm
       minimum for the NB SOIC-16 and 7.6 mm minimum for the WB SOIC-16 package.
    2. To determine resistance and capacitance, the Si86xx is converted into a 2-terminal device. Pins 1–8 are shorted together to form
       the first terminal and pins 9–16 are shorted together to form the second terminal. The parameters are then measured between
       these two terminals.
    3. Measured from input pin to ground.
