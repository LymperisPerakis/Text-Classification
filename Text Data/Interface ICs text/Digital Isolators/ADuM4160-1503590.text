  The supply current values for the device running at a fixed continuous data rate at 50% duty cycle alternating J and K states. Supply current values are specified with
  USB-compliant load present.
2
  Propagation delay of the low speed DD+ to UD+ or DD− to UD− in either signal direction is measured from the 50% level of the rising or falling edge to the 50% level
  of the rising or falling edge of the corresponding output signal.

  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDDx. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
