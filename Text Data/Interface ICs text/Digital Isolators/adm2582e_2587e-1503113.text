  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common-mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

19        VISOIN        Isolated Power Supply Input. This pin must be connected externally to VISOOUT. It is recommended that a
                        0.1 µF and a 0.01 µF decoupling capacitor be fitted between Pin 19 and Pin 20. Connect this pin through a ferrite
                        bead and short trace length to VISOOUT for operation. See Figure 35 for layout recommendations.
