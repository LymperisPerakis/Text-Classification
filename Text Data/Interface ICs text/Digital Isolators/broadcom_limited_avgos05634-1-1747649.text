Description                                                              Features
The HCPL-90xx and HCPL-09xx CMOS digital isolators                       • +3.3V and +5V TTL/CMOS compatible
feature high speed performance and excellent transient                   • 3 ns max. pulse width distortion
immunity specifications. The symmetric magnetic
coupling barrier gives these devices a t­ ypical pulse width             • 6 ns max. propagation delay skew
distortion of 2 ns, a typical propagation delay skew of                  • 15 ns max. propagation delay
4 ns and 100 Mbaud data rate, making them the indus-                     • High speed: 100 MBd
try’s fastest digital isolators.
                                                                         • 15 kV/µs min. common mode rejection

                                                                         • Tri-state output (HCPL-9000/-0900)
-0900) features an active-low logic output enable.
The dual channel digital isolators are configured as                     • 2500 V RMS isolation
­unidirectional (HCPL-9030/-0930) and bi-directional                     • UL1577 and IEC 61010-1 approved
 (HCPL-9031/-0931), operating in full duplex mode making
 it ideal for digital fieldbus applications.                             Applications
 The quad channel digital isolators are configured as                    • Digital fieldbus isolation
 unidirectional (HCPL-900J/-090J), two channels in one                   • Multiplexed data transmission
 direction and two channels in opposite direction (HCPL-
                                                                         • Computer peripheral interface
 901J/-091J), and one channel in one direction and
 three channels in opposite direction (HCPL-902J/-092J).                 • High speed digital systems
 These high channel density make them i­deally suited                    • Isolated data interfaces
 to isolating data conversion devices, parallel buses and
                                                                         • Logic level shifting
 peripheral interfaces.
 They are available in 8-pin PDIP, 8-pin Gull Wing, 8‑pin
 SOIC packages, and 16–pin SOIC narrow-body and
 wide-body packages. They are specified over the tem-
 perature range of -40°C to +100°C.
                           CAUTION: It is advised that normal static precautions be taken in handling and assembly
                           of this component to prevent damage and/or degradation which may be induced by ESD.

Notes:
1. PWD is defined as |tPHL -tPLH|. %PWD is equal to the PWD divided by the pulse width.
2. tPSK is equal to the magnitude of the worst case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that will be seen between units at 25°C.
3. CMH is the maximum common mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOUT > 0.8VDD2. CML is the maximum common mode
input voltage that can be sustained while maintaining VOUT < 0.8V. The common mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common mode
voltage edges.
This product has been tested for electrostatic sensitivity to the limits stated in the specifications. However, Avago recommends that all integrated circuits

Notes:
1. PWD is defined as |tPHL -tPLH|. %PWD is equal to the PWD divided by the pulse width.
2. tPSK is equal to the magnitude of the worst case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that will be seen between units at 25°C.
3. CMH is the maximum common mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOUT > 0.8VDD2. CML is the maximum common mode
input voltage that can be sustained while maintaining VOUT < 0.8V. The common mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common mode
voltage edges.
This product has been tested for electrostatic sensitivity to the limits stated in the specifications. However, Avago recommends that all integrated circuits

Signal Status on Start-up and Shut Down
To minimize power dissipation, the input signals to the
channels of HCPL-90xx and HCPL-09xx digital isolators
are differentiated and then latched on the output side of
the isolation barrier to reconstruct the signal. This could
result in an ambiguous output state depending on power
up, shutdown and power loss sequencing. Therefore, the
designer should consider the inclusion of an initializa-
tion signal in this start-up circuit. Initialization consists of
toggling the input either high then low or low then high.

Propagation delay skew represents the uncertainty of where an edge might be after being sent through a digital
isolator. Figure 5 shows that there will be ­uncertainty in both the data and clock lines. It is ­important that these two
areas of uncertainty not overlap, otherwise the clock signal might arrive ­before all of the data outputs have settled,
or some of the data outputs may start to change before the clock signal has arrived. From these considerations, the
­absolute minimum pulse width that can be sent through digital isolators in a parallel application is twice tPSK. A cautious
 design should use a slightly longer pulse width to ensure that any additional ­uncertainty in the rest of the circuit does
 not cause a problem.
 Figure 6 shows the minimum pulse width, rise and fall time, and propagation delay enable to output waveforms for
 HCPL-9000 or HCPL-0900.
