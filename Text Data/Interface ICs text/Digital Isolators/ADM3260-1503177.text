  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDDP. |CML| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew
  rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The
  transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.

  VISO provides current for dc and dynamic loads on the VISO input/output
  channels. This current must be included when determining the total VISO
  supply current.

                            required output voltage to match the 1.25 V reference voltage. The VISO voltage can be programmed up to
                            20% higher or 75% lower than VIN but must be within the allowed output voltage range.
