   Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier.

2, 8        GND1         Ground Reference for the Primary Side of the Isolator. Pin 2 and Pin 8 are internally connected to each other,
                         and it is recommended that both pins be connected to a common ground.

4           VIB          Logic Input B.
5           RCIN         Regulation Control Input. This pin must be connected to the RCOUT pin of a master isoPower device or tied low.
                         This pin must not be tied high if RCSEL is low; this combination causes excessive voltage on the secondary side
                         of the isolator, damaging the ADuM6200 and possibly the devices that it powers.
6           RCSEL        Control Input. Determines self-regulation mode (RCSEL high) or slave mode (RCSEL low), allowing external
                         regulation. This pin is weakly pulled to the high state. In noisy environments, tie this pin either high or low.

10          VE2          Data Enable Input. When this pin is high or not connected, the secondary outputs are active; when this pin is
                         low, the outputs are in a high-Z state.
11          VSEL         Output Voltage Selection. When VSEL = VISO, the VISO setpoint is 5.0 V. When VSEL = GNDISO, the VISO setpoint is 3.3 V.
                         In slave regulation mode, this pin has no function.
