  The supply current values for all four channels are combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM3300/ADuM3301 channel configurations.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values for all four channels are combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM3300/ADuM3301 channel configurations.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values for all four channels are combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM3300/ADuM3301 channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

Pin No.   Mnemonic       Description
1         VDD1           Supply Voltage for Isolator Side 1, 3.0 V to 5.5 V.
2, 8      GND1           Ground 1. Ground reference for Isolator Side 1.
3         VIA            Logic Input A.
4         VIB            Logic Input B.
5         VOC            Logic Output C.
6, 11     NC             No Connect.
7         VE1            Output Enable 1. Active high logic input. VOC output is enabled when VE1 is high or disconnected. VOC is
                         disabled when VE1 is low. In noisy environments, connecting VE1 to an external logic high or low is
                         recommended.

10        VE2            Output Enable 2. Active high logic input. VOA and VOB outputs are enabled when VE2 is high or disconnected.
                         VOA and VOB outputs are disabled when VE2 is low. In noisy environments, connecting VE2 to an external logic
                         high or low is recommended.
12        VIC            Logic Input C.
