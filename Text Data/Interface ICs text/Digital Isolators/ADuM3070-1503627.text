technology and complete loop compensation. This eliminates                                                  discrete solution. The regulated feedback provides a relatively flat

Pin No.        Mnemonic    Description
1              X1          Transformer Driver Output 1.
2, 8           GND1        Ground Reference for Primary Side.
3, 11, 12      NC          No Connect. Do not connect to this pin.
5, 6           TP          Test Point. Do not connect to this pin.
4              X2          Transformer Driver Output 2.
7              VDDA        Primary Supply Voltage 3.0 V to 5.5 V. Connect to VDD1. Connect a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor from VDDA to GND1.
9, 15          GND2        Ground Reference for Secondary Side.
10             OC          Oscillator Control Pin. When OC = logic high = VDD2, the secondary controller runs open-loop. To regulate the
                           output voltage, connect a resistor between the OC pin and GND2, and the secondary controller runs at a
                           frequency of 200 kHz to 1 MHz, as programmed by the resistor value.
13             FB          Feedback Input from the Secondary Output Voltage VISO. Use a resistor divider from VISO to the FB pin to make
                           the VFB voltage equal to the 1.25 V internal reference level using the VISO = VFB × (R1 + R2)/R2 formula. The resistor
                           divider is required even in open-loop mode to provide soft start.
14             VDD2        Internal Supply Voltage Pin for the Secondary Side Controller. When a sufficient external voltage is supplied to
                           VREG, the internal regulator regulates the VDD2 pin to 5.0 V. Otherwise, VDD2 should be in the 3.0 V to 5.5 V range.
                           Connect a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor from VDD2 to GND2.
16             VREG        Input of the Internal Regulator to Power the Secondary Side Controller. VREG should be in the 5.5 V to 15 V range
                           to regulate the VDD2 output to 5.0 V.
