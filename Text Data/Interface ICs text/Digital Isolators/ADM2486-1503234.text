GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                                                            available in a 16-lead, wide body SOIC package.
The ADM2486 differential bus transceiver is an integrated,
galvanically isolated component designed for bidirectional
data communication on multipoint bus transmission lines. It
is designed for balanced transmission lines and complies with
ANSI EIA/TIA-485-A and ISO 8482: 1987(E).
The device employs Analog Devices iCoupler® technology to
combine a 3-channel isolator, a three-state differential line
driver, and a differential input receiver into a single package.
The logic side of the device is powered with either a 5 V or a
3 V supply, and the bus side uses an isolated 5 V supply.

  Common-mode transient immunity is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation.
  VCM is the common-mode potential difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common-mode is slewed. The
  common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

No.      Mnemonic    Description
1        VDD1        Power Supply (Logic Side), 3 V or 5 V Supply. Decoupling capacitor to GND1 required, capacitor value should be
                     between 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF.
2, 8     GND1        Ground (Logic Side).
3        RxD         Receiver Output Data. This output is high when (A – B) > 200 mV and low when (A – B) < –200 mV. The output
                     is three-stated when the receiver is disabled, that is, when RE is driven high.
4        RE          Receiver Enable Input. This is an active-low input. Driving this input low enables the receiver, and driving it
                     high disables the receiver.
5        RTS         Request to Send Input. Driving this input high enables the driver, and driving it low disables the driver.
6        TxD         Transmit Data Input. Data to be transmitted by the driver is applied to this input.
7        PV          Power_Valid. Used during power-up and power-down, needs to be tied high when the ADM2486 is operational,
                     see the Applications Information section.
9, 15    GND2        Ground (Bus Side).
10       DE          Driver Enable Status Output. This output signals the driver enable or disable status to other devices on the bus.
                     DE is high when the driver is enabled and low when the driver is disabled.
11, 14   NC          No Connect.
12       A           Noninverting Driver Output/Receiver Input. When the driver is disabled, or when VDD1 or VDD2 is powered down,
                     Pin A is put into a high impedance state to avoid overloading the bus.
13       B           Inverting Driver Output/Receiver Input. When the driver is disabled, or when VDD1 or VDD2 is powered down,
                     Pin B is put into a high impedance state to avoid overloading the bus.
16       VDD2        Power Supply (Bus Side), 5 V Isolated Supply. Decoupling capacitor to GND2 required, capacitor value should be
                     between 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF.

2.0 V, this pin should be driven high. Conversely, upon power-
down, PV should be driven low before VDD1 reaches 2.0 V (see                                            Figure 31. Driving PV with an Open-Drain Output
Figure 30).
If the PV pin is driven with an open-drain output, the
recommended value for the pull-up resistor is a 10 kΩ resistor,
bypassed with a 100 pF capacitor to GND1 (see Figure 31).
The power_valid input can be driven, for example, by the
output of a system reset circuit, such as the ADM809Z, which
has a threshold voltage of 2.32 V.

ISOLATED POWER SUPPLY CIRCUIT
The ADM2486 requires isolated power capable of 5 V at up to
approximately 75 mA (this current is dependent on the data
rate and termination resistors used) to be supplied between the
VDD2 and the GND2 pins.
A transformer driver circuit with a center-tapped transformer
and LDO can be used to generate the isolated 5 V supply, as
shown in Figure 32. The center-tapped transformer provides
electrical isolation of the 5 V isolated power supply. The primary
winding of the transformer is excited with a pair of square
waveforms that are 180° out of phase with each other. A pair
of Schottky diodes and a smoothing capacitor are used to create
a rectified signal from the secondary winding. The ADP667
linear voltage regulator provides a regulated 5 V power supply
to the ADM2486’s bus-side circuitry (VDD2).
