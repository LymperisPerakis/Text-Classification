2. System Overview
2.1 Theory of Operation
The operation of an Si838x channel is analogous to that of a bipolar opto-coupler, except an RF carrier is modulated instead of light.
This simple architecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special considerations or initialization at start-up. A simpli-
fied block diagram for a single Si838x channel is shown in the figure below.

This product enables 24 V bipolar digital inputs to be connected to its input through a resistor network which acts as a voltage divider.
Other digital voltage levels and characteristics can be implemented with simple modifications to the resistor network. See 4.2 IEC
61131-2 Compliance Options for resistor network recommendations. The inputs can be sourcing or sinking type. To enable this func-
tionality, there is a diode bridge and an LED emulator at the front end of each input channel that drives an OOK (On-Off Key) modula-
tor/demodulator across the capacitive isolation barrier. See 3.3 Bipolar LED Emulator Input for details on the input channel.
On the output side, the signal is either passed directly to the output stage in the case of a high-speed channel (BHx), or the signal is
routed through a debounce filter block in the case of a low-speed channel (Bx). Thus, the high-speed channel offers the highest per-
formance with the least propagation delay, but also the worst noise immunity. With the addition of the debounce filter block on the low-
speed channel, precise noise control can be achieved.
The debounce block is configured by selecting the debounce filter mode applied and the amount of debounce filter delay time desired.
There are three debounce filter modes available: deglitch filter mode, low-pass filter mode, and blanking filter mode. There are four
debounce filter delay time options available: no delay, or delays of 10, 30, or 100 milliseconds. Additionally, a built-in low-pass filter
delay of 4 µs is always present in low-speed channels, regardless of user configuration options. The desired filter delay time for parallel
output devices can be selected by part number in 1. Ordering Guide. This filter delay time selection applies to all low-speed channels
present on the device. The only filter mode available for parallel output interface devices is the low-pass filter mode.
In addition to the parallel output interface options available on the Si838x, there is also a serial output interface option. The Si8380S
offers a four wire SPI interface with an additional MOSI_THRU output to facilitate the cascading of up to 16 Si8380S devices. Using the
SPI interface detailed in section 3.5 Serial Peripheral Interface, the debounce filter type and filter delay time can each be controlled on a
per channel basis. The debounce filter modes are explained in detail in 3.6 Debounce Filter.

    2. UP = Unpowered (< UVLO).
    3. An undetermined state can be any value within the absolute maximum rating of the output channel. See Table 5.10 Absolute
       Maximum Ratings1 on page 23 for details.
3.1 Device Behavior
During any period in which VDD is below the UVLO threshold, such as device start-up, the output Bx/BHx is in an undetermined state
until VDD is brought above the UVLO threshold for a time period of approximately tSTART, after which Bx/BHx is immediately pulled low.
Following this, the output is high when the current flowing from anode to cathode in the LED emulator is > IF(ON). Note that there is a
propagation delay time (tP) between a valid change on the input and a valid change on the output. Also note that there is a similar rise
(tR) and fall (tF) time that should be accounted for in any valid change of the output. Finally, for low-speed channels, there is an addi-
tional filter delay time added to the propagation delay time. See Table 5.2 Electrical Characteristics on page 16 for detailed propaga-
tion delay specifications for all channel configurations, as well as specifications for all other timing parameters defined here.
Device startup, normal operation, and shutdown behavior are shown in the figure below.

3.2 Undervoltage Lockout
Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) is provided to prevent erroneous operation during device startup and shutdown or when VDD is below its
specified operating range. During UVLO, the outputs from the device do not track the inputs to the device. For example, the device
unconditionally enters UVLO when VDD falls below VDDUV– and exits UVLO when VDD rises above VDDUV+. During UVLO, the out-
puts are in an undetermined state and should be controlled using external components like a pull-up or pull-down resistor. See section
3.4.2 Output Pin Termination and State Control for circuit recommendations
3.3 Bipolar LED Emulator Input
Each input channel on the Si838x can be modeled as a full bridge rectifier attached to an LED. A simplified equivalent circuit is depicted
in Figure 3.2. Note that the model changes based on the whether the channel is sourcing or sinking current.
The input current to the LED emulator is used to power the isolation channel transmitter and send the input signal across the isolation
barrier. This eliminates the need for a power supply on the input side of the device. See section 2.1 Theory of Operation for a complete
overview of the signal path through the device.

3.4 Layout Recommendations
To ensure safety in the end user application, high voltage circuits (i.e., circuits with >30 VAC) must be physically separated from the
safety extra-low voltage circuits (SELV is a circuit with <30 VAC) by a certain distance (creepage/clearance). If a component, such as
the Si838x, straddles this isolation barrier, it must meet those creepage/clearance requirements and also provide a sufficiently large
high-voltage breakdown protection rating (commonly referred to as working voltage protection). Table 5.5 Insulation and Safety-Related
Specifications1 on page 20 and Table 5.7 VDE 0884-10 Insulation Characteristics1 on page 21 detail the creepage/clearance and
working voltage capabilities of the Si838x. These tables also detail the component standards (UL1577, VDE 0884, CSA 5A), which are
readily accepted by certification bodies to provide proof for end-system specification requirements. Refer to the end-system specifica-
tion (60950-1, etc.) requirements before starting any design that uses the Si838x.
3.4.1 Supply Bypass
The Si838x device requires a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor between VDD and GND. The capacitor should be placed as close as possible to
the package. To enhance the robustness of a design, the user may also include resistors (50–300 Ω) in series with the outputs if the
system is excessively noisy.
3.4.2 Output Pin Termination and State Control
The nominal output impedance of an Si838x output channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of the
on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission line effects
will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled impedance PCB traces.
To control for undetermined states on the output channel during UVLO, it is recommended to use a weak 100 kΩ pull-up or pull-down
resistor to enforce either a high or low output state. For more information on output states and their conditions refer to Table 3.1 Truth
Table Summary on page 5 and 3. Device Operation.
3.5 Serial Peripheral Interface
The Si8380S includes a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) that provides control and monitoring capability of the isolated channels using a
commonly available microcontroller protocol. The direct-mapped registers allow an external master SPI controller to monitor the status
of the eight input channels, as well as to control the filtering mode and delay of each channel. Additionally, support is provided to easily
daisy-chain up to sixteen Si8380S devices. Each of these daisy-chained devices may be uniquely addressed by one master SPI con-
troller.
3.5.1 SPI Register Map
The addressable SPI registers include one eight-bit register to reflect the status of each of the eight channels, which is read-only. Also,
four additional registers provide two bits to specify the debounce filter delay, and two bits to specify the debounce filter mode for each of
the eight channels. These user accessible SPI registers are illustrated in the following table.

3.5.2 SPI Communication Transactions
SPI communication is performed using a four wire control interface. The four Si8380S device pins utilized for SPI include:
 • SCLK (input) the SPI clock
 • NSS (input) active low device select
 • MOSI (input) master-out-slave-in
 • MISO (output) master-in-slave-out
Additionally, a fifth wire MOSI_THRU (output) is provided as an Si8380S device pin to facilitate daisy chaining.
An Si8380S SPI communication packet is composed of three serial bytes. In this sequence, byte 0 is the control byte, and specifies the
operation to be performed as well as the device to be selected in a daisy-chain organization. The CID[3:0] field should be set to all
zeros by the SPI master in non daisy-chained operation. Next, byte 1 specifies the address of the internal Si8380S SPI register to be
accessed. The final byte in the packet consists of either the data to be written to the addressed Si8380S SPI register (using MOSI), or
the data read from the addressed Si8380S SPI register (using MISO). Details of the SPI communication packet are presented in the
following figure for an Si8380S SPI write transaction.

The SPI master will provide the timing of the signals and framing of the communication packets for all Si8380S SPI inputs: NSS, SCLK,
and MOSI. Data is communicated from the SPI master to the Si8380S using the MOSI signal. The NSS and SCLK signals provide the
necessary control and timing reference allowing the Si8380S to discern valid data on the MOSI signal. Data is returned to the SPI mas-
ter by the Si8380S utilizing the MISO signal only during the final byte of a three byte SPI read communication packet. At all other times,
the MISO signal is tri-stated by the Si8380S. Each of the eight bits for these three packets is captured by the Si8380S on eight adjacent
rising edges of SCLK. Each frame of eight bits is composed within bounding periods where the device select, NSS, is deasserted. Upon
the reception of the eight bits within a byte transaction, the deassertion of NSS advances the byte counter within the internal Si8380S
SPI state machine. Should the transmission of an eight bit packet be corrupted, either with the deassertion of NSS before the eighth
rising edge of SCLK, or with the absence of the deassertion of NSS after the eighth rising edge of SCLK, the internal SPI state machine
may become unsynchronized with the master SPI controller.
To re-establish SPI synchronization with the Si8380S, the SPI master may, at any time, deassert the SPI device select signal NSS, and
force a clock cycle on SCLK. When unsynchronized, the rising edge of SCLK when NSS is deasserted (high) re-initializes the internal
SPI state machine. The Si8380S will then treat the immediately following eight bit SPI transaction after NSS is once again asserted as
the first byte in a three byte SPI communication packet.
Any preceding communication packet will be abandoned by the Si8380S at the point synchronization is lost, and the NSS signal is
deasserted. This could occur at any point in the three byte sequence of a SPI communication packet. One should note that abandoning
a SPI write operation early, even during the last byte of the three byte SPI communication packet, will leave the destination register

unchanged. However, if the number of SCLK cycles exceeds eight during the last byte of the three byte SPI write packet, the destina-
tion Si8380S register may be corrupted. To remedy both of these situations, it is recommended that such a corrupted write operation be
repeated immediately following resynchronization of the SPI interface.
3.5.3 SPI Read Operation
Referring to Figure 3.4 SPI Communication Packet Structure, Write Operation and Control Byte Structure on page 8, in an SPI read
operation the control byte will only have bit 6 set to a 1 in a single Si8380S device organization (no daisy chaining). Bit 7 (the broadcast
bit) is ignored during a read operation since only one device may be read at a time in either a single or daisy-chained organization.
The second byte in the three byte read packet is provided by the SPI master to designate the address of the Si8380S internal register
to be queried. If the read address provided does not correspond to a physically available Si8380S internal register, all zeroes will be
returned as the read value by the Si8380S.
The read data is provided during the final byte of the three byte read communication packet to the querying master SPI device utilizing
the Si8380S’s MISO output, which remains tri-stated at all other times.
The SPI read operation timing diagram is illustrated in the figure below.

3.5.4 SPI Write Operation
Again referring to Figure 3.4 SPI Communication Packet Structure, Write Operation and Control Byte Structure on page 8, in an SPI
write operation the control byte may optionally have bit 7 (the broadcast bit) set to 1. During an SPI write operation, the broadcast bit
forces all daisy-chained Si8380S devices to update the designated internal SPI register with the supplied write data, regardless of the
Si8380S device being addressed using the CID[3:0] field of the control word.
The second byte in the three byte write packet is provided by the SPI master to designate the address of the Si8380S internal register
to be updated. If the write address provided does not correspond to a physically available Si8380S internal register, no internal Si8380S
SPI register update will occur.
The write data is provided by the SPI master during the final byte of the three byte write communication packet. The Si8380S MISO
output remains tri-stated during the entire SPI write operation.
The SPI write operation timing diagram is illustrated in the figure below.

3.5.5 SPI Daisy-Chain Organization
The Si8380S provides the capability to easily interconnect multiple Si8380S devices on a common SPI interface administered by a sin-
gle SPI master requiring no additional control signals. To accomplish this, the Si8380S includes the additional SPI device output pin
MOSI_THRU. Connecting together multiple Si8380S devices in this manner utilizes the MOSI_THRU pin of one Si8380S device to feed
the MOSI pin of the next Si8380S device in the daisy chain. All bits composing an SPI communication packet from the SPI master are
passed directly through by the Si8380S from the MOSI input to the MOSI_THRU output unchanged, except for the CID[3:0] field of the
control byte.
The least significant four bits of the control byte in an SPI communication packet, CID[3:0], are dedicated to addressing one of up to
sixteen Si8380S devices connected in a daisy chain, with 0000 indicating the device whose MOSI pin is fed directly by the SPI master,
0001 the following Si8380S device, etc. As this bit field is passed through the Si8380S, it is decremented by one. This four bit field is
placed in the control word by the SPI master in reverse order, allowing the carry of the decrement to ripple into the next bit in the CID
field as the bits of the control word proceed: CID[0] is placed at bit 3 and CID[3] placed at bit 0 of the control word. When a given
Si8380S device in the daisy chain is presented with the CID[3:0] code of 0000, it is activated as the one to be addressed. All remaining
operations between the SPI master and the Si8380S activated in this manner proceed as previously discussed in 3.5 Serial Peripheral
Interface for the case of a single Si8380S slave. The organization of a system with Si8380S devices daisy-chained in this manner is
depicted in the figure below.

From the preceding figure, and referring to Figure 3.4 SPI Communication Packet Structure, Write Operation and Control Byte Structure
on page 8, in order to read from Si8380S[1], the control word would be:
Control[7:0] = 0100_1000.
Similarly, in order to write to Si8380S[12], the control word would be:
Control[7:0] = 0000_0011.
Finally, if it were desired to update an internal SPI register of all daisy-chained Si8380S devices, the control word would be:
Control[7:0] = 1000_0000.
If the broadcast bit is zero during a write operation, only the Si8380S device being addressed using the CID[3:0] field of the control
word in a daisy-chain organization will be updated. If the broadcast bit is one during a write operation, the CID[3:0] field is ignored, and
all Si8380S devices connected in a daisy chain will be updated. For non-daisy-chain operation, the CID[3:0] field should always be all
zeros.
Note that there is a finite combinational delay associated with passing the MOSI input pin of a given Si8380S to the MOSI_THRU out-
put pin. As a result, the maximum possible SCLK frequency will be reduced based on the number of Si8380S devices connected in a
daisy-chain organization.

The timing specifications depicted in this figure apply to each byte of the three byte Si8380S SPI communications packet. Refer to the
SPI timing specifications in Table 5.3 SPI Timing Characteristics1 on page 18.
Although this discussion of the Si8380S SPI interface has focused on a preferred organization (separate MISO/MOSI wires), other op-
tions are available with regard to the Si8380S control interface. Possible Si8380S organizations include:
 • MISO/MOSI wired operation
    • MISO/MOSI may be two separate wires, or may be connected together if the SPI master is capable of tri-stating its MOSI pin
       during the data byte packet transfer of a read operation.
 • Multiple Si8380S devices interfaced in a non-daisy-chain format
    • The SPI master provides multiple NSS signals, one for each of a multiple of Si8380S slaves.
    • Every Si8380S shares a single trace from its MOSI input back to the SPI master (the Si8380S MOSI_THRU signal is not utilized).
3.6 Debounce Filter
The Si838x has a debounce filter on low-speed channels. The high-speed channels have no debounce filtering. The debounce filter can
be configured either through part number selection for parallel output devices, or through the SPI interface on the Si8380S device.
When using the Si8380S device, the user has control over the debounce filter mode and filter delay on a per channel basis. Parallel
output devices with low-speed channels use the low-pass filtering mode as defined in 3.6.2 Debounce Filtering Modes. Parallel output
devices also feature part number selectable debounce filter delay times of 0, 10, 30 and 100 ms. The debounce filter is incorporated
directly into the path of the input data stream on low-speed channels allowing signal conditioning of the digital inputs to reduce noise
and improve common mode transient immunity (CMTI.) See 1. Ordering Guide for more details on part numbers.

3.6.1 Debounce Control Registers
When using the Si8380S, debounce filter operation is controlled using read/write control registers mapped into the Si8380S SPI ad-
dress space. The details of these registers are covered in section 3.5.1 SPI Register Map. The options available using these registers
are outlined in tables below. For each of the eight input channels, two data bits are allocated to control the debounce delay, and two
data bits are used to select the debounce filtering mode. This consumes a total of 32 bits, which are allocated across four individual
Si8380S SPI control registers of one byte each.

3.6.2 Debounce Filtering Modes
In addition to configuring filter delay time, the user can also select between three filtering modes provided by the debounce function
which result in different filter behavior. Like the debounce filter delay setting, these debounce filter modes may be unique for each of the
eight Si8380S input channels. All low-speed channels present on parallel output devices are configured with the low-pass filter mode
only.
The first of these three modes, corresponding to dbnc_mode[1:0] == 00, employs only a simple trailing edge delay commonly used in
digital deglitch filters. In this mode, once the channel’s input has been stable for the amount of time specified in the corresponding
channel’s debounce delay setting tD, the channel’s output assumes the value of the channel’s input. Consequently, any glitches on the
channel’s input having a duration less than the channel’s debounce delay setting tD, will be suppressed.
The second mode, corresponding to dbnc_mode[1:0] == 01, performs a low-pass filtering function on the input channel and is the mode
of the built-in 4 µs filter found in all low-speed channels. When the channel’s input has assumed a new value, a counter begins counting
toward the debounce delay setting tD. If before the count tD is reached the channel’s input returns to its previous value, this counter is
decremented. Assuming that the channel’s input again assumes the new value before the counter is decremented back to 0 (i.e., noise
pulse width is less than the time the channel’s input had previously assumed a new value), the counter incrementing resumes from a
non-zero value. Once this count has reached the designated delay tD, the channel’s output assumes the new value. Using this mecha-
nism, any noise pulse on the channel’s input having a duration less than the channel’s debounce filter delay setting tD, will be sup-
pressed. However, unlike dbnc_mode[1:0] == 00, when the channel’s input returns to the new value after this noise pulse, credit is giv-
en for the time this new value was active before the pulse.
The final mode, corresponding to dbnc_mode[1:0] == 1X, realizes a leading edge filtering function on the input channel, similar to a
blanking filter. Internally, a counter is initialized to zero. When the channel’s input changes, the channel’s output immediately assumes
the new value, and the counter is reset to the current delay setting tD. Independent of what occurs on the channel’s input, the counter
begins decrementing after this change, leaving the channel blind to changes on the input. When the counter again reaches zero, the
channel’s current input is compared to the channel’s current output. If they are different the channel’s output immediately assumes the
new value. If they are the same, the channel’s output will immediately change on the next new value seen by the channel’s input. In
either case, a change on the channel’s input resets the counter to the current delay setting tD.
A graphical depiction of the operation and behavior for each debounce filter mode is provided in the following figure, which has been
constrained to the signal path within the filter function only.

         Figure 4.1. System Level Drawing of a High-speed Channel on the Si838x with the Supporting Bill of Materials
The Si838x combined with an appropriate input resistor network and indication LED will produce a 24 V digital input module which ad-
heres to the IEC 61131-2 specification.
Resistors R1 and R2 set the transition voltages and currents for the system, as visualized in the figure below, while capacitor C1, is
required only for high-speed channels and serves to improve CMTI performance. Further, resistor R3 is selected based on desired
LED, D2, brightness during a system ON condition.

4.2 IEC 61131-2 Compliance Options
The IEC 61131-2 standard articulates three types of digital inputs for 24V logic sensing. Each type category dictates boundary condi-
tions on the system level input space, (VIN, IIN), defining the range of values for which the module must output a logic LOW, a logic
HIGH, or transition between the two.
The table below provides a per-input type bill of materials recommendation for plug-n-play designs adhering to the specification or as a
starting point for custom designs. These recommendations assume a resistor tolerance of 5%. A custom input design does not need to
follow the recommendations listed in the table below. However, it is important that a custom design adhere to the electrical specifica-
tions defined in Table 5.2 Electrical Characteristics on page 16.

4.3 Custom Bill of Materials
A PLC digital input module based on the Si838x can have its transition values customized on a per-channel basis in accordance with
the system level equations and tolerances. An extended discussion of this process and an example design are available in AN970:
