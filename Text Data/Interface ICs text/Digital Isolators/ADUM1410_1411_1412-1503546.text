  The supply current values for all four channels are combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through
  Figure 15 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1410/ADuM1411/ADuM1412 channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. |CML| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Input enable time is the duration from when VDISABLE is set low until the output states are guaranteed to match the input states in the absence of any input data logic
  transitions. If an input data logic transition within a given channel does occur within this time interval, the output of that channel reaches the correct state within the
  much shorter duration as determined by the propagation delay specifications within this data sheet. Input disable time is the duration from when VDISABLE is set high
  until the output states are guaranteed to reach their programmed output levels, as determined by the CTRL2 logic state (see Table 14).
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values for all four channels are combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through
  Figure 15 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1410/ADuM1411/ADuM1412 channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. |CML| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Input enable time is the duration from when VDISABLE is set low until the output states are guaranteed to match the input states in the absence of any input data logic
  transitions. If an input data logic transition within a given channel does occur within this time interval, the output of that channel reaches the correct state within the
  much shorter duration as determined by the propagation delay specifications within this data sheet. Input disable time is the duration from when VDISABLE is set high
  until the output states are guaranteed to reach their programmed output levels, as determined by the CTRL2 logic state (see Table 14).
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values for all four channels are combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through
  Figure 15 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1410/ADuM1411/ADuM1412 channel configurations.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. |CML| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Input enable time is the duration from when VDISABLE is set low until the output states are guaranteed to match the input states in the absence of any input data logic
  transitions. If an input data logic transition within a given channel does occur within this time interval, the output of that channel reaches the correct state within the
  much shorter duration as determined by the propagation delay specifications within this data sheet. Input disable time is the duration from when VDISABLE is set high
  until the output states are guaranteed to reach their programmed output levels, as determined by the CTRL2 logic state (see Table 14).
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

In the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation
is significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working
voltages while still achieving a 50-year service life. The working
voltages listed in Table 10 can be applied while maintaining the
50-year minimum lifetime provided the voltage conforms to
either the unipolar ac or dc voltage case. Any cross-insulation
voltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 21 or Figure 22
should be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage
should be limited to the 50-year lifetime voltage value listed in
Table 10.
