  VxVDD = VMVDD or VSVDDx. In these places, either VMVDD or VSVDDx can be used.
3
  IOx is the output current of the pin.
4
  VIXH is the input side, logic high.
5
  VIXL is the input side, logic low.
6
  VOX is the voltage where the output is pulled.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOUT > 0.8 MVDD and/or SVDDx. The common-mode voltage slew
  rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

The lifetime of insulation caused by wear out is determined by
its thickness, material properties, and the voltage stress applied.                 The working voltage across the barrier from Equation 1 is

the application working voltage. The working voltage supported
by an isolator for wear out may not be the same as the working
voltage supported for tracking. The working voltage applicable                                          VRMS = 240 2 + 400 2

of 60 Hz ac and dc across the barrier as shown in Equation 1.
                                                                                                        VAC RMS = 240 V rms
Because only the ac portion of the stress causes wear out, the
equation can be rearranged to solve for the ac rms voltage, as is
shown in Equation 2. For insulation wear out with the polyimide
materials used in these products, the ac rms voltage determines
the product lifetime.
