The ADuM3150 supports a delay clock output on the master
side of the device. This output can be used with an additional
clocked port on the master to support 40 MHz clock performance.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA or VIB.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  VINPUT is the input voltage of any of the MCLK, MSS, MO, SO, VIA, or VIB pins.
3
  IOUTPUT is the output current of any of the SCLK, DCLK, SSS, MI, SI, VOA, or VOB pins.

  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining output voltages within the VOH and VOL limits. The common-mode
  voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C and VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA or VIB.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  VINPUT is the input voltage of any of the MCLK, MSS, MO, SO, VIA, or VIB pins.
3
  IOUTPUT is the output current of any of the SCLK, DCLK, SSS, MI, SI, VOA, or VOB pins.
4
  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining output voltages within the VOH and VOL limits. The common-mode
  voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—MIXED 5 V/3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C and VDD1 = 5 V, VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA or VIB.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—MIXED 3.3 V/5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 3.3 V and VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Refers to common-mode transients across the insulation barrier. Common-
  mode transients exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may cause
  latch-up or permanent damage.
Stresses at or above those listed under Absolute Maximum
Ratings may cause permanent damage to the product. This is a
stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these
or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond
the maximum operating conditions for extended periods may
affect product reliability.

         Figure 12. High Speed SPI Using Isolation Channel Delay
The ADuM3150 eliminates the need for the extra high speed
channel by implementing a delay circuit on the master side, as
shown in Figure 13. DCLK is trimmed at the production test to
match the round trip propagation delay of each isolator. The
DCLK signal can be used as if the clock signal had propagated
alongside the data from the slave in the scheme outlined
previously.
