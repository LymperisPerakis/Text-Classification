  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.7 × VDD1 or 0.7 × VISO for a high input or VO < 0.3 × VDD1 or 0.3 × VISO for a low
  input. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.
ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V PRIMARY INPUT SUPPLY/3.3 V SECONDARY ISOLATED SUPPLY
Typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 5.0 V, VISO = 3.3 V, VSEL = GNDISO. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range, which is 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 3.0 V ≤ VISO ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +105°C, unless otherwise noted.
Switching specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.
