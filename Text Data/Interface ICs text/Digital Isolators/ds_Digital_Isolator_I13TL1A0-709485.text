• Three-channel digital isolator                          The I13xL1A0 is a three-channel passive Digital Isolator which
  n    One receive & two transmit channels                enables secondary referenced digital power system monitoring
                                                          and control when used in conjunction with Vicor’s Digital
• Powered from input signal, no VCC required
                                                          Supervisor and high performance power conversion,
• Small size and low external component count reduce      regulation, and transformation modules.

Absolute Maximum Ratings
ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM ratings are stress ratings only. Operation at or beyond these maximum ratings can cause permanent damage to the device. Electrical
specifications do not apply when operating beyond rated operating conditions. Operating beyond rated operating conditions for extended period of time may
affect device reliability. All voltages are specified are relative to the associated COMMON pin unless otherwise noted. Positive pin current represents current
flowing out of the pin.
