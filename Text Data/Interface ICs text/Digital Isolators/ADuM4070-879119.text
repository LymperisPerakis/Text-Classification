GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADuM40701 is a regulated dc-to-dc isolated power supply                                                 The regulated feedback provides a relatively flat efficiency curve
controller with an internal MOSFET driver. The dc-to-dc controller                                          over the full output power range. The ADuM4070 enables a dc-to-
has internal isolated PWM feedback from the secondary side based                                            dc converter with a 3.3 V to 24 V isolated output voltage range
on the iCoupler® chip scale transformer technology and complete                                             from either a 5.0 V or a 3.3 V input voltage, with an output power
loop compensation. This architecture eliminates the need to use                                             of up to 2.5 W.
an optocoupler for feedback and compensates the loop for stability.
The ADuM4070 isolator provides a more stable output voltage and
higher efficiency compared to unregulated isolated dc-to-dc power
supplies. The fully integrated feedback and loop compensation
in a wide-body SOIC package provide a solution with a smaller
form factor and 8.3 mm creepage distance.

1                 X1         Transformer Driver Output 1.
2, 8              GND1       Ground Reference for the Primary Side of the Isolator. Pin 2 and Pin 8 are internally connected to each other;
                             it is recommended that both pins be connected to a common ground.
3, 5, 6, 11, 12   NC         No Connect. Do not connect to this pin.
4                 X2         Transformer Driver Output 2.
7                 VDDA       Supply Voltage for the Primary Side, 3.0 V to 5.5 V. Connect a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor from VDDA to GND1.
9, 15             GND2       Ground Reference for the Secondary Side of the Isolator. Pin 9 and Pin 15 are internally connected to each
                             other; it is recommended that both pins be connected to a common ground.
10                OC         Oscillator Control Pin. When the OC pin is connected high to the VDD2 pin, the secondary controller runs in
                             open-loop (unregulated) mode. To regulate the output voltage, connect a resistor between the OC pin and
                             GND2; the secondary controller runs at a frequency of 200 kHz to 1 MHz, as programmed by the resistor value.
13                FB         Feedback Input from the Secondary Output Voltage, VISO. Use a resistor divider from the VISO output to the FB
                             pin to set the VFB voltage equal to the 1.25 V internal reference level using the formula VISO = VFB × (R1 + R2)/R2.
                             The resistor divider is required even in open-loop mode to provide soft start.
14                VDD2       Internal Supply Voltage for the Secondary Side. When a sufficient external voltage is supplied to VREG,
                             the internal regulator regulates the VDD2 pin to 5.0 V. Otherwise, VDD2 should be in the 3.0 V to 5.5 V range.
                             Connect a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor from VDD2 to GND2.
16                VREG       Input of the Internal Regulator to Power the Secondary Side Controller. VREG should be in the 5.5 V to 15 V
                             range to regulate the VDD2 output to 5.0 V.
