MAX14937                                                        Two Channel, 5kVRMS I2C Isolator
General Description                                          Benefits and Features
The MAX14937 is a two-channel, 5kVRMS I2C digital isolator   ●● Robust Galvanic Isolation of Digital Signals
utilizing Maxim’s proprietary process technology. For           • Withstands 5kVRMS for 60s (VISO)
applications requiring 2.75kVRMS of isolation, see the          • Continuously Withstands 848VRMS (VIOWM)
MAX14933 data sheet. The device transfers digital               • 1200VPEAK Repetitive Peak Voltage (VIORM)
signals between circuits with different power domains at        • Withstands ±10kV Surge per IEC 61000-4-5
ambient temperatures up to +125°C.
                                                             ●● Interfaces Directly with Most Micros and FPGAs
The device offers two bidirectional, open-drain channels for
                                                                • Accepts 2.25V to 5.5V Supplies
applications, such as I2C, that require data to be transmit-

ted in both directions on the same line. To prevent latch-
up action, the A-side outputs comprise special buffers       ●● Low Power Consumption
that regulate the logic-low voltage at 0.9V (max), and the      • 5.3mA per Channel Typical at 1.7MHz
input logic-low threshold is at least 50mV lower than the
output logic-low voltage. The B side features conventional   Safety Regulatory Approvals
buffers that do not regulate logic-low output voltage.       (See Safety Regulatory Approvals)
The device features independent 2.25V to 5.5V                   • UL According to UL1577
supplies on each side of the isolator. The MAX14937             • cUL According to CSA Bulletin 5A
operates from DC to 1.7MHz and can be used in isolated          • VDE 0884-10
I2C busses with clock stretching.

Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +125°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive; all currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to ground on
         the corresponding side of the device, unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: This is the minimum difference between the output logic-low level and the input logic threshold. This ensures that there is no
         possibility of the part latching up the bus to which it is connected.
Note 4: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design.
Note 5: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining operation. CMTI applies to both rising
         and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and GNDB
         (VCM = 1000V).
