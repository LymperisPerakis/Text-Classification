• Do not place copper on the PCB between the inner col-

   the rated isolation voltage.
• The use of solid ground planes for GND and GND2
   is recommended for non-EMI critical applications to
   optimize signal fidelity, thermal performance, and to
   minimize RF emissions due to uncoupled PCB trace
   conduction. The drawback of using ground planes,
   where EMI is of concern, is the creation of a dipole
   antenna structure which can radiate differential voltages
   formed between GND and GND2. If ground planes are
   used it is recommended to minimize their area, and
   use contiguous planes as any openings or splits can
   exacerbate RF emissions.
