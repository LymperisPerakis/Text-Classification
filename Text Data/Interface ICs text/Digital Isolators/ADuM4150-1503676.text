low data rate isolation channels, one channel in each direction.
                                                                                                            ADuM4154                        5 kV, multiple slave SPIsolator
Data in the slow channels is sampled and serialized for a 250 kbps
data rate with 2.5 µs of jitter.
The ADuM4150 supports a delay clock output on the master
side of the device. This output can be used with an additional
clocked port on the master to support 40 MHz clock performance.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  tPMCLK is the propagation delay of the MCLK signal from Side 1 to Side 2. tPSO is the propagation delay of the SO signal from Side 2 to Side 1. tPDCLK is the difference
  between the DCLK signal and the round trip propagation delay.
4
  VIx = VIA or VIB.
5
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C and VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  tPMCLK is the propagation delay of the MCLK signal from Side 1 to Side 2. tPSO is the propagation delay of the SO signal from Side 2 to Side 1. tPDCLK is the difference
  between the DCLK signal and the round trip propagation delay.
4
  VIx = VIA or VIB.
5
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—MIXED 5 V/3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 5 V, and VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  tPMCLK is the propagation delay of the MCLK signal from Side 1 to Side 2. tPSO is the propagation delay of the SO signal from Side 2 to Side 1. tPDCLK is the difference
  between the DCLK signal and the round trip propagation delay.
4
  VIx = VIA or VIB.
5
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 3.3 V and VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.

  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  tPMCLK is the propagation delay of the MCLK signal from Side 1 to Side 2. tPSO is the propagation delay of the SO signal from Side 2 to Side 1. tPDCLK is the difference
  between the DCLK signal and the round trip propagation delay.

  VIx = VIA or VIB.
5
  An internal asynchronous clock, not available to users, samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  In accordance with UL 1577, each model is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥ 6000 V rms for 1 second (current leakage detection limit = 10 µA).
2
  In accordance with DIN V VDE V 0884-10, each model is proof tested by applying an insulation test voltage ≥ 1590 V peak for 1 second (partial discharge detection limit = 5 pC).
  The asterisk (*) marked on the component designates DIN V VDE V 0884-10 approval.

         Figure 12. High Speed SPI Using Isolation Channel Delay
The ADuM4150 eliminates the need for the extra high speed
channel by implementing a delay circuit on the master side, as
shown in Figure 13. DCLK is trimmed at the production test to
match the round trip propagation delay of each isolator. The
DCLK signal can be used as if the clock signal had propagated
alongside the data from the slave in the scheme outlined previously.

VAC RMS is the time varying portion of the working voltage.                                          VRMS = 240 2 + 400 2
VDC is the dc offset of the working voltage.
