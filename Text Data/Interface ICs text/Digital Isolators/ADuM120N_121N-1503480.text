ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—3.3 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 3.3 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 3.0 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 3.6 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—2.5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 2.5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 2.25 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 2.75 V, 2.25 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 2.75 V, −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.
