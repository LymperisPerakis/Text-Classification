  |CM| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining any DOUTx+/DOUTx− pin in the same state as the corresponding DINx+/DINx−
  pin (no change in output), or producing the expected transition on any DOUTx+/DOUTx− pin if the applied common-mode transient edge is coincident with a data
  transition on the corresponding DINx+/DINx− pin. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

  Duty cycle or pulse skew is the magnitude of the maximum difference between tPLH and tPHL for any channel of a device, that is, |tPLHx – tPHLx|, where x denotes either
  Channel 1 or Channel 2 propagation delay.
3
  Channel to channel or output skew is the difference between the largest and smallest values of tPLHx within a device or the difference between the largest and smallest
  values of tPHLx within a device, whichever of the two is greater.
4
  Part to part output skew is the difference between the largest and smallest values of tPLHx across multiple devices or the difference between the largest and smallest
  values of tPHLx across multiple devices, whichever of the two is greater.

  Jitter parameters are guaranteed by design and characterization. Values do not include stimulus jitter. VID = 400 mV p-p, tR = tF = 0.3 ns (20% to 80%).

  This specification is measured over a population of ~7,000,000 edges.

  Peak-to-peak jitter specifications include jitter due to pulse skew (tSK(D)).

  This specification is measured over a population of ~3,000,000 edges.

   The fail-safe delay is the delay before DOUTx± is switched high to reflect an idle input to DINx± (|VID| < 100 mV, with open, short, or terminated input condition).
