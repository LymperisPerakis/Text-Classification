  Supply current values are for all five channels combined running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The
  supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate is calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 4 through
  Figure 6 for information on the per-channel supply current as a function of the data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 7 and Figure 8 for total IDD1
  and IDD2 supply currents as a function of the data rate for the ADuM1510.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed. Operation below the minimum pulse width is not
  recommended.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL and/or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output
  load within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels within the same component.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOx > 0.8 × VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VOx < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The
  transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in the signal data rate. See Figure 4 through Figure 6 for infor-
  mation on the per-channel supply current as a function of the data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on
  calculating the per-channel supply current for a given data rate.
