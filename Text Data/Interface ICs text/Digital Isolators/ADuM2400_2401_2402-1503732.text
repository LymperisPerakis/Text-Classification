  All voltages are relative to their respective ground.

  Supply current values are for all four channels combined running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The
  supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 8
  through Figure 10 for information on per channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through Figure 15 for
  total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM2400/ADuM2401/ADuM2402 channel configurations.
3
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
5
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
6
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
7
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
8
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information
  on per channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating per channel supply current for a
  given data rate.

  All voltages are relative to their respective ground.

  Supply current values are for all four channels combined running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The
  supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 8
  through Figure 10 for information on per channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through Figure 15 for
  total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM2400/ADuM2401/ADuM2402 channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
5
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
6
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
7
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
8
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information
  on per channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating per channel supply current for a
  given data rate.

  All voltages are relative to their respective ground.
2
  Supply current values are for all four channels combined running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The
  supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate can be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 8
  through Figure 10 for information on per channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 11 through Figure 15 for
  total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM2400/ADuM2401/ADuM2402 channel configurations.
3
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
5
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
6
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
7
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
8
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
9
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 8 through Figure 10 for information
  on per channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating per channel supply current for a
  given data rate.

  VIx and VOx refer to the input and output signals of a given channel (A, B, C, or D). VEx refers to the output enable signal on the same side as the VOx outputs. VDDI and
  VDDO refer to the supply voltages on the input and output sides of the given channel, respectively.
