GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The ADM2491E is an isolated data transceiver with ±8 kV ESD                                                 The differential transmitter outputs and receiver inputs feature
protection and is suitable for high speed, half- or full-duplex                                             electrostatic discharge circuitry that provides protection to
communication on multipoint transmission lines. For half-                                                   ±8 kV using the human body model (HBM). The logic side of
duplex operation, the transmitter outputs and the receiver                                                  the device can be powered with either a 5 V or a 3.3 V supply,
inputs share the same transmission line. Transmitter output                                                 whereas the bus side requires an isolated 5 V supply.
Pin Y is linked externally to receiver input Pin A, and transmit-                                           The device has current-limiting and thermal shutdown features
ter output Pin Z is linked to receiver input Pin B.                                                         to protect against output short circuits and situations in which
The ADM2491E is designed for balanced transmission lines                                                    bus contention could cause excessive power dissipation.
and complies with ANSI TIA/EIA RS-485-A-1998 and ISO                                                        The ADM2491E is available in a wide body, 16-lead SOIC package
8482: 1987(E). The device employs Analog Devices, Inc.,                                                     and operates over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range.

  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply
to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.
