  The supply current values are for all three channels combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1300/ADuM1301 channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values are for all three channels combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1300/ADuM1301 channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values are for all three channels combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The
  supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 6 through
  Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2
  supply currents as a function of data rate for ADuM1300/ADuM1301 channel configurations.
2
  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is measured
  from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load within the
  recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposing
  sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be
  sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient magnitude is the
  range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on
  per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current for a given
  data rate.

  The supply current values are for all three channels combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADUM1300W/ADUM1301W channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values are for all three channels combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load
  present. The supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section.
  See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through
  Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2 supply currents as a function of data rate for ADUM1300W/ADUM1301W channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
3
  The maximum data rate is the fastest data rate at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.
4
  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is
  measured from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.
5
  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load
  within the recommended operating conditions.
6
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of
  the isolation barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with
  inputs on opposing sides of the isolation barrier.
7
  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate
  that can be sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient
  magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed.
8
  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information
  on per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current
  for a given data rate.

  The supply current values are for all three channels combined when running at identical data rates. Output supply current values are specified with no output load present. The
  supply current associated with an individual channel operating at a given data rate may be calculated as described in the Power Consumption section. See Figure 6 through
  Figure 8 for information on per-channel supply current as a function of data rate for unloaded and loaded conditions. See Figure 9 through Figure 12 for total VDD1 and VDD2
  supply currents as a function of data rate for ADUM1300W/ADUM1301W channel configurations.

  The minimum pulse width is the shortest pulse width at which the specified pulse width distortion is guaranteed.

  tPHL propagation delay is measured from the 50% level of the falling edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the falling edge of the VOx signal. tPLH propagation delay is measured
  from the 50% level of the rising edge of the VIx signal to the 50% level of the rising edge of the VOx signal.

  tPSK is the magnitude of the worst-case difference in tPHL or tPLH that is measured between units at the same operating temperature, supply voltages, and output load within the
  recommended operating conditions.
7
  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposing
  sides of the isolation barrier.

  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be
  sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient magnitude is the
  range over which the common mode is slewed.

  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on
  per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current for a
  given data rate.

  Codirectional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation
  barrier. Opposing-directional channel-to-channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on opposing
  sides of the isolation barrier.

  CMH is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VO > 0.8 VDD2. CML is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be
  sustained while maintaining VO < 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. The transient magnitude is the
  range over which the common mode is slewed.

  Dynamic supply current is the incremental amount of supply current required for a 1 Mbps increase in signal data rate. See Figure 6 through Figure 8 for information on
  per-channel supply current for unloaded and loaded conditions. See the Power Consumption section for guidance on calculating the per-channel supply current for a
  given data rate.
