ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range of 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.

  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining the voltage output (VO) > 0.8 VDDx. |CML| is the maximum common-
  mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining VOx > 0.8 V. The common-mode voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode
  voltage edges.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—1.8 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = VDD2 = 1.8 V. Minimum/maximum specifications apply over the entire recommended
operation range: 1.7 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 1.9 V, 1.7 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 1.9 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching specifications
are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted. Supply currents are specified with 50% duty cycle signals.
