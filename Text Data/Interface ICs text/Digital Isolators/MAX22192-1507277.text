Note 1: All units are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: External resistor REFDI is selected to set any desired current limit between 0.48mA and 3.39mA (typical values). The cur-
          rent limit accuracy of ±11% is guaranteed for values greater or equal to 2mA.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
          respective ground (GNDF and GNDL), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
          both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDF and
          GNDL.

*When VLF and VDDL are both valid, the internal isolation is powered up and operates normally, and SPI signals are transmitted
between field-side and logic-side, no matter if VDD24F or VDD3F is valid or not. This is useful when the isolation channels are shared
by multiple field-side devices.

Notes:
LSDI: CRC generated by external device such as MCU, Data D7–D0 clocked out from MCU
LSDO: CRC generated by MAX22192, Data D7–D0 clocked out from MAX22192 Register
NO-OP: No Operation, i.e., write cycle with no valid data to specified address
Write Cycle: DI[7:0] and WB[7:0] are from internal latches, whose outputs are frozen when LCS or LLATCH goes low. Bits 24VL,
24VM and WBG are frozen by LCS going low but not by LLATCH.
Read Cycle: D7–D0 are the register data addressed through LSDI. Bits 24VL, 24VM, and WBG reflect the corresponding bits in the
FAULT1 register.
Input Channel: Pins are numbered IN1–IN8, so input IN1 maps to bit DI0, input IN2 to bit DI1 ... and input IN8 to bit DI7

                         1: WBx = 1, Wire-break condition detected for channel x
    7:0       WB[7:0]    Wire-break status for each channel. The bit remains high even if the wire-break condition disappears and is
                         only cleared upon reading the register. Not cleared if the wire-break condition is still present upon reading the
                         register
Note: Input Channels are numbered IN1–IN8, so IN1 maps to WB0, IN2 to WB1 ... and IN8 to WB7.

                         Digital input state, DI_ is the state of the corresponding input pin.
