ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C and VDD1 = VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 4.5 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 5.5 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL = 15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.

1
  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA, VIB, or VIC.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock not available to users samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.
3
  VIx = VIA, VIB, or VIC.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock not available to users samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

  Codirectional channel matching is the absolute value of the difference in propagation delays between any two channels with inputs on the same side of the isolation barrier.
2
  The MSS signal is glitch filtered in both speed grades, whereas the other fast signals are not glitch filtered in the B grade. To guarantee that MSS reaches the output
  ahead of another fast signal, set up MSS prior to the competing signal by different times depending on speed grade.

  VIx = VIA, VIB, or VIC.
4
  An internal asynchronous clock not available to users samples the low speed signals. If edge sequence in codirectional channels is critical to the end application, the
  leading pulse must be at least 1 tVIx SKEW time ahead of a later pulse to guarantee the correct order or simultaneous arrival at the output.

ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS—MIXED 3.3 V/5 V OPERATION
All typical specifications are at TA = 25°C, VDD1 = 3.3 V, and VDD2 = 5 V. Minimum and maximum specifications apply over the entire
recommended operation range: 3.0 V ≤ VDD1 ≤ 3.6 V, 4.5 V ≤ VDD2 ≤ 5.5 V, and −40°C ≤ TA ≤ +125°C, unless otherwise noted. Switching
specifications are tested with CL =15 pF and CMOS signal levels, unless otherwise noted.
