 2. System Overview
 2.1 Theory of Operation
 The operation of an Si86xx channel is analogous to that of an opto coupler, except an RF carrier is modulated instead of light. This
 simple architecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special considerations or initialization at start-up. A simplified
 block diagram for a single unidirectional Si86xx channel is shown in the figure below.

 A channel consists of an RF Transmitter and RF Receiver separated by a semiconductor-based isolation barrier. Referring to the
 Transmitter, input A modulates the carrier provided by an RF oscillator using on/off keying. The Receiver contains a demodulator that
 decodes the input state according to its RF energy content and applies the result to output B via the output driver. This RF on/off keying
 scheme is superior to pulse code schemes as it provides best-in-class noise immunity, low power consumption, and better immunity to
 magnetic fields. See the following figure for more details.

3. Typical Application Overview
3.1 I2C Background
In many applications, I2C, SMBus, and other digital power supply communications, including those for bus power management, the in-
terfaces require galvanic isolation for safety or ground loop elimination. For example, Power over Ethernet (PoE) applications typically
use an I2C interface for communication between the PoE power sourcing device (PSE), and the earth ground referenced system con-
troller. Galvanic isolation is required both by standard and also as a practical matter to prevent ground loops in Ethernet connected
equipment.
The physical interface consists of two wires: serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). These wires are connected to open collector
drivers that serve as both inputs and outputs. At first glance, it appears that SDA and SCL can be isolated simply by placing two unidir-
ectional isolators in parallel, and in opposite directions. However, this technique creates feedback that latches the bus line low when a
logic low asserted by either master or slave. This problem can be remedied by adding anti-latch circuits, but results in a larger and more
expensive solution. The Si860x products offer a single-chip, anti-latch solution to the problem of isolating I2C/SMBus applications and
require no external components except the I2C/SMBus pull-up resistors. In addition, they provide isolation to a maximum of 5.0 kVRMS,
support I2C clock stretching, and operate to a maximum I2C bus speed of 1.7 Mbps.
3.2 I2C Isolator Operation
Without anti-latch protection, bidirectional I2C isolators latch when an isolator output logic low propagates back through an adjacent
isolator channel creating a stable latched low condition on both sides. Anti-latch protection is typically added to one side of the isolator
to avoid this condition (the “A” side for the Si8600/02/05/06).
The following examples illustrate typical circuit configurations using the Si8600/02/05/06.

The “A side” output low (VOL) and input low (VIL) levels are designed such that the isolator VOL is greater than the isolator VIL to prevent
the latch condition.

3.4 I2C Isolator Design Considerations
The first step in applying an I2C isolator is to choose which side of the bus will be connected to the isolator A side. Ideally, it should be
the side which:
Is compatible with the range of bus pull up specified by the manufacturer. For example, the Si8600/02/05/06 isolators are normally used
with a pull up of 0.5 mA to 3 mA.
Has the highest input low level for devices on the bus. Some devices may specify an input low of 0.9 V and other devices might require
an input low of 0.3 x Vdd. Assuming a 3.3 V minimum power supply, the side with an input low of 0.3 x Vdd is the better side because
this side has an input low level of 1.0 V.
Have devices on the bus that can pull down below the isolator input low level. For example, the Si860x input level is 0.41 V. As most
CMOS devices can pull to within 0.4 V of GND this is generally not an issue.
Has the lowest noise. Due to the special logic levels, noise margins can be as low as 50 mV.

4. Device Operation
Device behavior during start-up, normal operation, and shutdown is shown in Figure 4.1 Device Behavior during Normal Operation on
page 10, where UVLO+ and UVLO- are the positive-going and negative-going thresholds respectively. Refer to Table 4.1 Si86xx Op-
eration Table on page 11 to determine outputs when power supply (VDD) is not present.
4.1 Device Startup
Outputs are held low during powerup until VDD is above the UVLO threshold for time period tSTART. Following this, the outputs follow
the states of inputs.
4.2 Undervoltage Lockout
Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) is provided to prevent erroneous operation during device startup and shutdown or when VDD is below its
specified operating circuits range. Both Side A and Side B each have their own undervoltage lockout monitors. Each side can enter or
exit UVLO independently. For example, Side A unconditionally enters UVLO when AVDD falls below AVDDUVLO– and exits UVLO when
AVDD rises above AVDDUVLO+. Side B operates the same as Side A with respect to its BVDD supply.

4.3 Input and Output Characteristics for Non-I2C Digital Channels
The unidirectional Si86xx inputs and outputs are standard CMOS drivers/receivers. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver
channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resist-
ance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately
terminated with controlled impedance PCB traces. Table 4.1 Si86xx Operation Table on page 11 details powered and unpowered

 Note:
    1. VDDI and VDDO are the input and output power supplies. VI and VO are the respective input and output terminals.
    2. Powered (P) state is defined as 3.0 V < VDD < 5.5 V.
    3. Unpowered (UP) state is defined as VDD = 0 V.
    4. X = not applicable; H = Logic High; L = Logic Low.
    5. Note that an I/O can power the die for a given side through an internal diode if its source has adequate current.
    6. For I2C channels, the outputs for a given side go to Hi-Z when power is lost on the opposite side.
4.4 Layout Recommendations
To ensure safety in the end user application, high voltage circuits (i.e., circuits with >30 VAC) must be physically separated from the
safety extra-low voltage circuits (SELV is a circuit with <30 VAC) by a certain distance (creepage/clearance). If a component, such as a
digital isolator, straddles this isolation barrier, it must meet those creepage/clearance requirements and also provide a sufficiently large
high-voltage breakdown protection rating (commonly referred to as working voltage protection). Table 5.6 Regulatory Information1 on
page 18 and Table 5.7 Insulation and Safety-Related Specifications on page 19 detail the working voltage and creepage/clearance
capabilities of the Si86xx. These tables also detail the component standards (UL1577, IEC60747, CSA 5A), which are readily accepted
by certification bodies to provide proof for end-system specifications requirements. Refer to the end-system specification (61010-1,
60950-1, 60601-1, etc.) requirements before starting any design that uses a digital isolator.
4.4.1 Supply Bypass
The Si860x family requires a 0.1 µF bypass capacitor between AVDD and AGND and BVDD and BGND. The capacitor should be
placed as close as possible to the package. To enhance the robustness of a design, the user may also include resistors (50–300 Ω ) in
series with the inputs and outputs if the system is excessively noisy.
4.4.2 Output Pin Termination
The nominal output impedance of an non-I2C isolator channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the value of the
on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where transmission line effects
will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled impedance PCB traces.

 Note:
    1. The nominal output impedance of a non-I2C isolator driver channel is approximately 50 Ω, ±40%, which is a combination of the
       value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads where trans-
       mission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled impedance PCB traces.
    2. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at the same
       supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.

 Note:
    1. VDE certifies the clearance and creepage limits as 4.7 mm minimum for the NB SOIC-8 and SOIC-16 packages and 8.5 mm
       minimum for the WB SOIC-16 package. UL does not impose a clearance and creepage minimum for component level certifica-
       tions. CSA certifies the clearance and creepage limits as 3.9 mm minimum for the NB SOIC-8 and SOIC-16 packages and 7.6
       mm minimum for the WB SOIC-16 package.
    2. To determine resistance and capacitance, the Si860x, SO-16, is converted into a 2-terminal device. Pins 1–8 (1–4, SO-8) are
       shorted together to form the first terminal and pins 9–16 (5–8, SO-8) are shorted together to form the second terminal. The pa-
       rameters are then measured between these two terminals.
    3. Measured from input pin to ground.
