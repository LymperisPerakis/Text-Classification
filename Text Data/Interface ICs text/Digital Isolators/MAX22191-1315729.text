Note 2:  All units are production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 3:  All voltages are referenced to ground, unless otherwise noted.
Note 4:  See the Boost Current section for more information.
Note 5:  Not production tested. Guaranteed by design
Note 6:  VCC is an auxiliary supply input. When VCC is powered from an external 3V to 5.5V supply, the propagation delay is
         reduced and the output changes from a current souce to a CMOS output. When using power from IN to power the device,
         connect VCC to GND (VCC = 0V).
Note 7: Thermal shutdown protection is only enabled when VCC is present. Thermal shutdown does not occur when VCC = 0V.
