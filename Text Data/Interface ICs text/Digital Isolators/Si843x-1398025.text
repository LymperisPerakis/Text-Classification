Description
Silicon Lab's family of ultra-low-power digital isolators are CMOS
devices offering substantial data rate, propagation delay, power, size,
reliability, and external BOM advantages when compared to legacy
isolation technologies. The operating parameters of these products
remain stable across wide temperature ranges throughout their
service life, and only VDD bypass capacitors are required.
Data rates up to 150 Mbps are supported, and all devices achieve
worst-case propagation delays of less than 10 ns. All products are
safety certified by UL, CSA, and VDE and support withstand voltages
of up to 2.5 kVRMS. These devices are available in 16-pin wide- and
narrow-body SOIC packages.

Notes:
   1. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 85 , ±40%, which is a combination of the
       value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads
       where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled
       impedance PCB traces.
   2. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at
       the same supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
   3. See "3. Errata and Design Migration Guidelines" on page 24 for more details.
   4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to valid data at the output.

   1. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 85 , ±40%, which is a combination of the
       value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads
       where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled
       impedance PCB traces.
   2. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at
       the same supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
   3. See "3. Errata and Design Migration Guidelines" on page 24 for more details.
   4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to valid data at the output.

   1. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 85 , ±40%, which is a combination of the
       value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads
       where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled
       impedance PCB traces.
   2. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at
       the same supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
   3. See "3. Errata and Design Migration Guidelines" on page 24 for more details.
   4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to valid data at the output.

Notes:
   1. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 85 , ±40%, which is a combination of the
       value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads
       where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled
       impedance PCB traces.
   2. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at
       the same supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
   3. See "3. Errata and Design Migration Guidelines" on page 24 for more details.
   4. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to valid data at the output.

   1. Specifications in this table are also valid at VDD1 = 2.6 V and VDD2 = 2.6 V when the operating temperature range is
       constrained to TA = 0 to 85 °C.
   2. The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 85 , ±40%, which is a combination of
       the value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving loads
       where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled
       impedance PCB traces.
   3. tPSK(P-P) is the magnitude of the difference in propagation delay times measured between different units operating at
       the same supply voltages, load, and ambient temperature.
   4. See "3. Errata and Design Migration Guidelines" on page 24 for more details.
   5. Start-up time is the time period from the application of power to valid data at the output.

Notes:
   1. The values in this table correspond to the nominal creepage and clearance values as detailed in “6. Package Outline:
       16-Pin Wide Body SOIC” and “8. Package Outline: 16-Pin Narrow Body SOIC”. VDE certifies the clearance and
       creepage limits as 4.7 mm minimum for the NB SOIC-16 package and 8.5 mm minimum for the WB SOIC-16 package.
       UL does not impose a clearance and creepage minimum for component level certifications. CSA certifies the clearance
       and creepage limits as 3.9 mm minimum for the NB SOIC-16 package and 7.6 mm minimum for the WB SOIC-16
       package.
   2. To determine resistance and capacitance, the Si84xx is converted into a 2-terminal device. Pins 1–8 are shorted
       together to form the first terminal and pins 9–16 are shorted together to form the second terminal. The parameters are
       then measured between these two terminals.
   3. Measured from input pin to ground.

2. Functional Description
2.1. Theory of Operation
The operation of an Si843x channel is analogous to that of an opto coupler, except an RF carrier is modulated
instead of light. This simple architecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special
considerations or initialization at start-up. A simplified block diagram for a single Si843x channel is shown in
Figure 5.

                                  Figure 5. Simplified Channel Diagram
A channel consists of an RF Transmitter and RF Receiver separated by a semiconductor-based isolation barrier.
Referring to the Transmitter, input A modulates the carrier provided by an RF oscillator using on/off keying. The
Receiver contains a demodulator that decodes the input state according to its RF energy content and applies the
                       D e m
result to output B via the output driver. This RF on/off keying scheme is superior to pulse code schemes as it
provides best-in-class noise immunity, low power consumption, and better immunity to magnetic fields. See
Figure 6 for more details.

2.2. Eye Diagram
Figure 7 illustrates an eye-diagram taken on an Si8430. For the data source, the test used an Anritsu (MP1763C)
Pulse Pattern Generator set to 1000 ns/div. The output of the generator's clock and data from an Si8430 were
captured on an oscilloscope. The results illustrate that data integrity was maintained even at the high data rate of
150 Mbps. The results also show that 2 ns pulse width distortion and 250 ps peak jitter were exhibited.

2.4. Layout Recommendations
To ensure safety in the end user application, high voltage circuits (i.e., circuits with >30 VAC) must be physically
separated from the safety extra-low voltage circuits (SELV is a circuit with <30 VAC) by a certain distance
(creepage/clearance). If a component, such as a digital isolator, straddles this isolation barrier, it must meet those
creepage/clearance requirements and also provide a sufficiently large high-voltage breakdown protection rating
(commonly referred to as working voltage protection). Table 6 on page 14 and Table 7 on page 14 detail the
working voltage and creepage/clearance capabilities of the Si84xx. These tables also detail the component
standards (UL1577, IEC60747, CSA 5A), which are readily accepted by certification bodies to provide proof for
end-system specifications requirements. Refer to the end-system specification (61010-1, 60950-1, etc.)
requirements before starting any design that uses a digital isolator.
The following sections detail the recommended bypass and decoupling components necessary to ensure robust
overall performance and reliability for systems using the Si84xx digital isolators.
                   N
2.4.1. Supply Bypass
                     ot
Digital integrated circuit components typically require 0.1 µF (100 nF) bypass capacitors when used in electrically
quiet environments. However, digital isolators are commonly used in hazardous environments with excessively
noisy power supplies. To counteract these harsh conditions, it is recommended that an additional 1 µF bypass
                 fo R
capacitor be added between VDD and GND on both sides of the package. The capacitors should be placed as
close as possible to the package to minimize stray inductance. If the system is excessively noisy, it is
recommended that the designer add 50 to 100  resistors in series with the VDD supply voltage source and 50 to
                   r N ec
300  resistors in series with the digital inputs/outputs (see Figure 8). For more details, see "3. Errata and Design
Migration Guidelines" on page 24.
                        e w om
All components upstream or downstream of the isolator should be properly decoupled as well. If these components
are not properly decoupled, their supply noise can couple to the isolator inputs and outputs, potentially causing
damage if spikes exceed the maximum ratings of the isolator (6 V). In this case, the 50 to 300  resistors protect
the isolator's inputs/outputs (note that permanent device damage may occur if the absolute maximum ratings are
                           D e m
exceeded). Functional operation should be restricted to the conditions specified in Table 1, “Recommended
Operating Conditions,” on page 3.
2.4.2. Pin Connections
                            e s nd
No connect pins are not internally connected. They can be left floating, tied to VDD, or tied to GND.
2.4.3. Output Pin Termination
                               ig e
The nominal output impedance of an isolator driver channel is approximately 85 , ±40%, which is a combination
of the value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance of the output driver FET. When driving
                                 ns d
loads where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated with controlled
impedance PCB traces. The series termination resistor values should be scaled appropriately while keeping in
mind the recommendations described in “2.4.1. Supply Bypass” above.

3. Errata and Design Migration Guidelines
The following errata apply to Revision C devices only. See "5. Ordering Guide" on page 26 for more details. No
errata exist for Revision D devices.
3.1. Enable Pin Causes Outputs to Go Low (Revision C Only)
When using the enable pin (EN1, EN2) function on the 3-channel (Si8430/1) isolators, the corresponding output pin
states (pin = An, Bn, where n can be 1…3) are driven to a logic low (to ground) when the enable pin is disabled
(EN1 or EN2 = 0). This functionality is different from the legacy 3-channel (Si8430/1) isolators. On those devices,
the isolator outputs go into a high-impedance state (Hi-Z) when the enable pin is disabled (EN1 = 0 or EN2 = 0).
3.1.1. Resolution
The enable pin functionality causing the outputs to go low is supported in production for Revision C of the Si84xx
information.   N
devices. Revision D corrects the enable pin functionality (i.e., the outputs will go into the high-impedance state to
match the legacy isolator products). Refer to the Ordering Guide sections of the data sheet(s) for current ordering
                 ot
3.2. Power Supply Bypass Capacitors (Revision C and Revision D)
             fo R
When using the Si84xx isolators with power supplies > 4.5 V, sufficient VDD bypass capacitors must be present on
both the VDD1 and VDD2 pins to ensure the VDD rise time is less than 0.5 V/µs (which is > 9 µs for a > 4.5 V
               r N ec
supply). Although rise time is power supply dependent, > 1 µF capacitors are required on both power supply pins
(VDD1, VDD2) of the isolator device.
3.2.1. Resolution
                    e w om
For recommendations on resolving this issue, see "2.4.1. Supply Bypass" on page 21. Additionally, refer to "5.
Ordering Guide" on page 26 for current ordering information.
3.3. Latch Up Immunity (Revision C Only)
                       D e m
Latch up immunity generally exceeds ± 200 mA per pin. Exceptions: Certain pins provide < 100 mA of latch-up
immunity. To increase latch-up immunity on these pins, 100  of equivalent resistance must be included in series
with all of the pins listed in Table 14. The 100  equivalent resistance can be comprised of the source driver's
                        e s nd
output resistance and a series termination resistor. The Si8431 is not affected when using power supply voltages
(VDD1 and VDD2) < 3.5 V.
3.3.1. Resolution
                           ig e
This issue has been corrected with Revision D of the device. Refer to “5. Ordering Guide” for current ordering
information.
