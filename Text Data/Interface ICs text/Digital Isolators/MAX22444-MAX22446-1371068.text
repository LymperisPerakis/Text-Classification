Note 1: All devices are 100% production tested at TA = +125°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design and
         characterization.
Note 2: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design and characterization.
Note 3: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages are referenced to their
         respective ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 4: All measurements taken with VDDA = VDDB, unless otherwise noted.
Note 5: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
         both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and
         GNDB (VCM = 1000V).
