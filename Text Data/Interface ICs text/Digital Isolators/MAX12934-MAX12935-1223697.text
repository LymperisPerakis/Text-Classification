General Description                                        Benefits and Features
The MAX12934/MAX12935 are the fastest, lowest power,       ●● Robust Galvanic Isolation for Fast Digital Signals
2-channel digital galvanic isolators on the market today,       • 200 Mbps Data Rate
using Maxim’s proprietary process technology. These             • Withstands 5kVRMS for 60s (VISO)
devices transfer digital signals between circuits with          • Continuously Withstands 848VRMS (VIOWM)
different power domains while using as little as 0.65mW         • Withstands ±10kV Surge Between GNDA and
per channel at 1Mbps with a 1.8V supply.                           GNDB with 1.2/50µs Waveform
The two channels of the MAX12935 transfer data in opposite      • High CMTI (50kV/µs Typical)
directions, making the MAX12935 ideal for isolating the    ●● Low Power Consumption
TX and RX lines of a transceiver. The two channels of the       • 1.3mW per Channel at 2Mbps with VDD = 3.3V
MAX12934 transfer data in the same direction.                   • 3.3mW per Channel at 100Mbps with VDD = 1.8V
The MAX12934/MAX12935 have an isolation rating             ●● Options to Support a Broad Range of Applications
of 5kVRMS for 60 seconds. Both devices are available with       • 2 Data Rates (25Mbps/200Mbps)
a maximum data rate of either 25Mbps or 200Mbps                 • 2 Channel Direction Configurations
and with outputs that are either default-high or                • 2 Output Default States (High or Low)
default-low. The default is the state the output
assumes when the input is not powered or if the            Applications
input is open-circuit. See the Ordering Information for    ●●   Fieldbus Communications for Industrial Automation
suffixes associated with each option. Independent 1.71V    ●●   Isolated RS232, RS-485/RS-422, CAN
to 5.5V supplies on each side of the isolator also make    ●●   General Isolation Application
the devices suitable for use as level translators.         ●●   Battery Management
                                                           ●●   Medical Systems
The MAX12934/MAX12935 are available in a 16-pin,
wide-body SOIC package. The package material has a         Safety Regulatory Approvals
minimum comparative tracking index (CTI) of 600V, which    (see Safety Regulatory Approvals)
gives it a group 1 rating in creepage tables. All devices  ●● UL According to UL1577
are rated for operation at ambient temperatures of -40°C   ●● cUL According to CSA Bulletin 5A
to +125°C.

Note 5: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output. CMTI applies to
         both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between GNDA and
         GNDB (VCM = 1000V).
