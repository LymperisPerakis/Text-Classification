Precautions for Using
(1)  This IC does not include built-in protection circuits for excess current or overvoltage. Therefore, if the short−circuit
     between adjacent pins or between outputs, the short-to-power or ground fault has occurred, the current or voltage
     beyond the absolute maximum rating is impressed, and IC destroys.
     When designing, please consider enough in power supply line, output line and GND line. In addition, so as not to
     continue to flow a current that exceeds the absolute maximum rating of the IC, please insert the appropriate fuse in
     the power supply line.
(2)  This IC is being used to drive an inductive load (such as a motor, solenoid or relay), When this IC is being used to
     drive an inductive load (such as a motor, solenoid, or relay), the diodes (pins 1 and 12) should be connected to the
     secondary power supply pin so as to absorb the counter electromotive force generated by the load. Please adhere to
     the device’s absolute maximum ratings.
     Connecting Zener diodes between the diodes (pins 1 and 12) and the secondary power supply pin (as the anode) is
     recommended so as to enable rapid absorption of the counter electromotive force. Again, please adhere to the
     device’s absolute maximum ratings.

IC Usage Considerations
 Notes on handling of ICs
  (1) The absolute maximum ratings of a semiconductor device are a set of ratings that must not be exceeded, even for a
      moment. Do not exceed any of these ratings. Exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or
      deterioration, and may result in injury by explosion or combustion.
  (2) Do not insert devices in the wrong orientation or incorrectly. Make sure that the positive and negative terminals of
      power supplies are connected properly. Otherwise, the current or power consumption may exceed the absolute
      maximum rating, and exceeding the rating(s) may cause device breakdown, damage or deterioration, and may result
      in injury by explosion or combustion. In addition, do not use any device inserted in the wrong orientation or incorrectly
      to which current is applied even just once.
  (3) Use an appropriate power supply fuse to ensure that a large current does not continuously flow in the case of
      overcurrent and/or IC failure. The IC will fully break down when used under conditions that exceed its absolute
      maximum ratings, when the wiring is routed improperly or when an abnormal pulse noise occurs from the wiring or
      load, causing a large current to continuously flow and the breakdown can lead to smoke or ignition. To minimize the
      effects of the flow of a large current in the case of breakdown, appropriate settings, such as fuse capacity, fusing time
      and insertion circuit location, are required.
  (4) If your design includes an inductive load such as a motor coil, incorporate a protection circuit into the design to
      prevent device malfunction or breakdown caused by the current resulting from the inrush current at power ON or the
      negative current resulting from the back electromotive force at power OFF. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or
      ignition. Use a stable power supply with ICs with built-in protection functions. If the power supply is unstable, the
      protection function may not operate, causing IC breakdown. IC breakdown may cause injury, smoke or ignition.
  (5) Carefully select external components (such as inputs and negative feedback capacitors) and load components (such
      as speakers), for example, power amp and regulator. If there is a large amount of leakage current such as from input
      or negative feedback condenser, the IC output DC voltage will increase. If this output voltage is connected to a
      speaker with low input withstand voltage, overcurrent or IC failure may cause smoke or ignition. (The overcurrent may
      cause smoke or ignition from the IC itself.) In particular, please pay attention when using a Bridge Tied Load (BTL)
      connection-type IC that inputs output DC voltage to a speaker directly.
Points to remember on handling of ICs
 Heat Radiation Design
  When using an IC with large current flow such as power amp, regulator or driver, design the device so that heat is
  appropriately radiated, in order not to exceed the specified junction temperature (TJ) at any time or under any condition.
  These ICs generate heat even during normal use. An inadequate IC heat radiation design can lead to decrease in IC life,
  deterioration of IC characteristics or IC breakdown. In addition, when designing the device, take into consideration the
  effect of IC heat radiation with peripheral components.
 Back-EMF
  When a motor rotates in the reverse direction, stops or slows abruptly, current flows back to the motor’s power supply
  owing to the effect of back-EMF. If the current sink capability of the power supply is small, the device’s motor power
  supply and output pins might be exposed to conditions beyond the absolute maximum ratings. To avoid this problem, take
  the effect of back-EMF into consideration in system design.
