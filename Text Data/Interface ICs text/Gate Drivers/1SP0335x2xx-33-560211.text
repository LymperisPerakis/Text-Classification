Data Sheet
Compact, high-performance, plug-and-play single-channel IGBT driver based
on SCALE™-2 technology for individual and parallel-connected modules in
2-level, 3-level and multilevel converter topologies
   Abstract
The SCALE™-2 plug-and-play driver 1SP0335x2x1-33 is a compact single-channel intelligent gate driver
designed for 3300V 130x140mm and 190x140mm IGBT modules. The master driver 1SP0335x2M1-33 features
a fiber-optic interface. It can be used as stand-alone driver or in conjunction with up to three 1SP0335D2S1-
33 slaves to drive up to four parallel-connected IGBT modules.
The DC/DC power supply must be purchased as a separate unit (one per master driver).
The turn-on and turn-off gate resistors as well as the auxiliary gate capacitor are not assembled
in order to provide maximum flexibility. They must be assembled by the user before start of
operation. Please refer to the paragraph on “Gate Resistor Assembly” for the recommended values.

Footnotes to the Key Data
1)     The transceivers required on the host controller side are not supplied with the gate driver. It is
       recommended to use the same types as used in the gate driver. For product information refer to
       www.power.com/igbt-driver/go/fiberoptics.
2)     The recommended transmitter current at the host controller is 20mA. A higher current may increase
       jitter or delay at turn-off.
3)     The typical transmitter current at the gate driver is 18mA. In case of supply undervoltage, the
       minimum transmitter current at the gate driver is 12mA: this is suitable for adequate plastic optical
       fibers with a length of up to 10 meters.
4)     This refers to the manufacturer ordering number, see www.power.com/igbt-driver/go/ext_erni. The
       customer-side connector as well as cables with different lengths can be supplied by Power
       Integrations. Refer to the “Description & Application Manual for 1SP0335 SCALE-2 IGBT Drivers” for
       more information.
5)     This refers to the manufacturer ordering number, see www.power.com/igbt-driver/go/ext_erni. These
       connectors are to be used to connect 1SP0335x2M1 (master) or 1SP0335D2S1 (slave) to
       1SP0335D2S1 (slave) if parallel connection of IGBT modules is required. Cables with different lengths
       can be supplied by Power Integrations. Refer to the “Description & Application Manual for 1SP0335
       SCALE-2 IGBT Drivers” for more information.
6)     If the specified value is exceeded, this indicates a driver overload. It should be noted that the driver is
       not protected against overload.
7)     The given power can only be fully exploited without slaves 1SP0335D2S1 (no parallel connection of
       IGBT modules). If the specified value is exceeded, this indicates a driver overload. It should be noted
       that the driver is not protected against overload. From 70°C to 85°C, the maximum permissible output
       power can be linearly interpolated from the given data.
8)     The given power can be fully exploited with slaves 1SP0335D2S1 (parallel connection of IGBT
       modules). If the specified value is exceeded, this indicates a driver overload. It should be noted that
       the driver is not protected against overload. From 70°C to 85°C, the maximum permissible output
       power can be linearly interpolated from the given data.
9)     The gate current is limited by the gate resistors located on the driver.
10)    This limit is due to active clamping under switching conditions. Refer to the “Description & Application
       Manual for 1SP0335 SCALE-2 IGBT Drivers”.
11)    Due to the Dynamic Active Advanced Clamping Function (DA2C) implemented on the driver, the DC-
       link voltage can be increased in the off-state condition (e.g. after emergency shut-down). This value is
       only valid when the IGBTs are in the off state (not switching). The time during which the voltage can

Data Sheet
12)  The maximum dynamic voltage between auxiliary emitters of parallel-connected drivers due to
     asymmetrical operation at turn-on and turn-off must be limited to the given value.
13)  Maximum allowed rate of change of auxiliary emitter voltage of parallel connected drivers. This
     specification guarantees that the drive information will be transferred reliably even with high rate of
     change of auxiliary emitter voltages (asymmetrical operation).
14)  Dynamic voltages between auxiliary emitters of parallel connected drivers at turn-on and turn-off lead
     to equalizing currents over the X2 or X3 bus. The peak and RMS values of the resulting current must
     be limited to the given value.
15)  Undervoltage monitoring of the secondary-side supply voltage (Viso to Vee and Vee to COM which
     correspond with the approximate turn-on and turn-off gate-emitter voltages). If the corresponding
     voltage drops below this limit on 1SP0335x2M1 (masters), all paralleled IGBTs (master and slaves) are
     switched off and a fault is transmitted to the status output. If the corresponding voltage drops below
     this limit on 1SP0335D2S1 (slaves), the corresponding IGBT is switched off. If the IGBT was turned
     on, a fault will be generated by the gate-monitoring function on the master which will turn off all
     paralleled IGBT after the corresponding delay.
16)  The mean value VGE,mean of all gate voltages (master and all slaves) is filtered and compared to the
     given values at turn-on and turn-off. If the specified values are exceeded (V GE,mean < VGE,on,min at turn-
     on resp. VGE,mean > VGE,off,max at turn-off) after the given filter delay, the driver turns off all parallel-
     connected IGBTs and a fault is transmitted to the status output.
17)  A dynamic Vce protection is implemented on the driver. The maximum allowed Vce voltage at turn-on
     is dynamically adjusted in order to better fit to the IGBT characteristics at turn-on. At the end of the
     turn-on process the given static value applies.
18)  The resulting pulse width of the direct output of the gate drive unit for short-circuit type I (excluding
     the delay of the gate resistors) is the sum of the response time plus the delay to IGBT turn-off.
19)  The turn-off event of the IGBT is delayed by the specified time after the response time.
20)  Including the delay of the external fiber-optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition
     of the turn-on or turn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the direct
     output of the gate drive unit (excluding the delay of the gate resistors).
21)  Output rise and fall times are measured between 10% and 90% of the nominal output swing. The
     values are given for the driver side of the gate resistors with 2Ω/1uF load. The time constant of the
     output load in conjunction with the present gate resistors leads to an additional delay at their load
     side.
22)  Delay of external fiber-optic links. Measured from the driver secondary side (ASIC output) to the
     optical receiver on the host controller (cable length: 1m).
23)  Measured on the host side. The fault status on the secondary side is automatically reset after the
     specified time.
24)  Including the delay of the external fiber-optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition
     of the turn-on or turn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the
     transition of the acknowledge signal at the optical receiver on the host controller side.
25)  The gate resistors and the auxiliary gate capacitor are not assembled on this IGBT gate driver. They
     must be assembled by the user according to the paragraph on “Gate Resistor Assembly”.
26)  The driver supply voltage VDC is split into two distinct voltages on the driver. The first one is the turn-
     on voltage which is regulated at about 15V. The difference between VDC and the turn-on voltage is
     the turn-off voltage which is not regulated and mainly dependent on the driver input voltage VDC.
27)  The fault status is set as long as the gate monitoring fault is present. The given value applies if the
     driver goes from the “off state” to the “on state” and the gate-emitter voltage of one or more parallel
     connected drivers does not turn on. If the driver goes from the “on state” to the “off state” and the
     gate-emitter voltage of one or more parallel connected drivers does not turn off, the fault status is
     applied as long as the gate monitoring fault is present.
28)  The maximum switching frequency is not defined, as it depends on the IGBT module used. Please
     consult the corresponding driver data sheet for more information.
