 Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
 operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
 absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

 Note 2: Specifications at -40°C are guaranteed by design and not production tested.
 Note 3: After relay turn-off, inductive kickback may momentarily cause the voltage at OUT_ to exceed VCOM. This is considered part
          of normal operation and will not damage the device.
