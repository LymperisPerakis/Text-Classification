Preliminary Data Sheet
Single-Channel Cost-Effective SCALE™-2 IGBT Driver Core with Fiber-Optic
Interface for 4500V and 6500V IGBTs
   Abstract
The 1SC0450V2B0-xx features versatile fiber-optic links and drives all usual high-power IGBT modules up to
4500V or 6500V. Thanks to its high output power capability, a single 1SC0450V2B0-xx driver can drive up to
four parallel-connected 4500V or 6500V IGBT modules and consequently provides easy inverter design
covering higher power ratings. Multi-level topologies involving 3300V or 4500V IGBTs with higher isolation
requirements can also be easily supported by 1SC0450V2B0-xx.
The 1SC0450V2B0-xx combines a complete single-channel driver core with all components required for
driving, such as an isolated DC/DC converter, short-circuit protection, Advanced Active Clamping as well as
supply voltage monitoring. Enhanced features such as gate boosting are also implemented and provide further
driving benefits.
The driver’s secondary side is electrically isolated from its primary side. The 1SC0450V2B0-45 meets the
requirements of 4500V IGBT applications while the 1SC0450V2B0-65 covers the requirements of 6500V IGBT
applications.
An output current of 50A and 6W drive power is available, making the 1SC0450V2B0-xx an ideal driver
platform for universal use in medium and high-power applications. The driver provides a gate voltage swing of
15V/-10V. The turn-on voltage is regulated to maintain a stable 15V regardless of the output power level.
Its outstanding EMC allows safe and reliable operation even in harsh industrial applications.

Output Voltage Swing
The output voltage swing consists of two distinct segments. First, there is the turn-on voltage VGH between
pins GH and VE. VGH is regulated and maintained at a constant level for all output power values and
frequencies.
The second segment of the output voltage swing is the turn-off voltage VGL. VGL is measured between pins
GL and VE. It is a negative voltage. It changes with the output power to accommodate the inevitable voltage
drop across the internal DC/DC converter.

Preliminary Datasheet
Footnotes to the Key Data
1)   The transceivers required on the host controller side are not supplied with the gate driver. It is
     recommended to use the same types as used in the gate driver. For product information, refer to
     www.power.com/igbt-driver/go/fiberoptics.
2)   The recommended transmitter current at the host controller is 20mA. A higher current may increase
     jitter or delay at turn-off.
3)   The typical transmitter current at the gate driver is 20.5mA. In case of supply undervoltage, the
     minimum transmitter current at the gate driver is 15mA: this is suitable for adequate plastic optical
     fibers with a length of up to 10 meters.
4)   The maximum peak gate current refers to the highest current level occurring during the product
     lifetime. It is an absolute value and also applies to short pulses.
5)   Twice the given minimum resistance value must be inserted between the interface connectors GH and
     GL. Moreover, the given minimal resistance value must be used in the full gate turn-on (interface
     connector GH to gate) and turn-off (interface connector GL to gate) path.
6)   The average supply input current is limited for thermal reasons. Higher values than specified by the
     absolute maximum rating are permissible (e.g. during power supply start up) if the average remains
     below the given value, provided this average is taken over a time period which is shorter than the
     thermal time constants of the driver in the application.
7)   There is no means of actively controlling or limiting the input current in the driver. In the case of
     start-up with very high blocking capacitor values, or in case of short circuit at the output, the supply
     input current has to be limited externally.
8)   The maximum output power must not be exceeded at any time during operation. It must also be
     observed for time periods shorter than the thermal time constants of the driver in the application.
9)   An extended output power range is specified in the output power section for ambient temperatures
     limited from -40°C to 70°C.
10 ) The gate-boosting output power can be calculated according to “1SC0450V2B0 Description &
     Application Manual” and is specified as a part of the gate driver’s total output power, which is the sum
     of the turn-on power over the output GH plus the gate-boosting power over the output VGB. The
     turn-on power approximately equals the turn-off power of the output GL. The gate boosting is not
     active at turn-off.
11 ) Including the delay of the external fiber-optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition of
     the turn-on or turn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the direct
     output of the gate drive unit (excluding the delay of the gate resistors). The delay time is measured
     between 50% of the input signal and the 10% voltage swing of the corresponding output. The delay
     time is independent of the output loading.
12 ) Output rise and fall times are measured between 10% and 90% of the nominal output swing with an
     output load of 4.7Ω and 270nF. These values are given for the driver side of the gate resistors. The
     time constant of the output load in conjunction with the present gate resistors leads to an additional
     delay at the load side of the gate resistors.
13 ) External blocking capacitors should be placed between the VISO and VE as well as the VE and COM
     terminals. Refer to “1SC0450V2B0 Description & Application Manual” (paragraph “DC/DC output
     (VISO), emitter (VE) and COM terminals)” for recommendations. Ceramic capacitors are
     recommended.
14 ) The minimum response time is valid for the circuit given in the description and application manual
     with the values of the corresponding tables.
15 ) Measured on the host side. The fault status on the secondary side is extended by the “delay in IGBT
     turn-off” and automatically reset after the specified time. Refer to “1SC0450V2B0 Description &
     Application Manual” for more details.
16 ) Undervoltage monitoring of the primary-side supply voltage (VCC to GND). If the voltage drops below
     this limit, a fault is transmitted to the SO output.
17 ) Undervoltage monitoring of the secondary-side supply voltage (VISO to VE and VE to COM, which
     correspond to the approximate turn-on and turn-off gate-emitter voltages). If the corresponding
     voltage drops below this limit, a fault is transmitted to the fiber-optic output and the IGBT is switched
     off after the corresponding delay. Refer to “1SC0450V2B0 Description & Application Manual” for more

      details.
18 )  Delay of external fiber-optic links. Measured from the driver secondary side (ASIC output) to the
      optical receiver on the host controller with a 1m cable.
19 )  HiPot testing (= dielectric testing) must generally be restricted to suitable components. This gate
      driver is suited for HiPot testing. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to limit the testing time to
      1s slots. Excessive HiPot testing at voltages much higher than 3182VAC,rms with 1SC0450V2B0-45 and
      4596VAC,rms with 1SC0450V2B0-65 may lead to insulation degradation. No degradation has been
      observed over 1min. testing at 10.2kVAC,rms. Every production sample (transformer only) shipped to
      customers has undergone 100% testing at the given value for 1s.
20 )  Partial discharge measurements are performed in accordance with IEC 60270 and IEC 60664-1 for
      basic insulation requirements.
21 )  The VCE–monitoring threshold value can be reduced with an external resistor. Refer to “1SC0450V2B0
      Description & Application Manual”.
22 )  The turn-off event of the IGBT after a secondary-side fault (IGBT short circuit or undervoltage
      monitoring) can be additionally delayed with an external capacitor. Refer to “1SC0450V2B0
      Description & Application Manual”.
23 )  The voltage values of the pins VGB resp. GBS are correspondingly about 50V and 34V respectively
      referred to COM. This must be considered for the design of the creepage and clearance distances.
24 )  The given value applies for a full discharge of VGB to VISO at turn-on, when no external capacitor is
      used. It can be increased by using additional external capacitors.
25 )  Including the delay of the external fiber-optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition of
      the turn-on or turn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the transition
      of the acknowledge signal at the optical receiver on the host controller side.
26 )  Creepage distances over additional components (e. g. fiber-optic wires, fixation screws, …) which are
      not part of the driver must be taken into account by the user.
27 )  Including current flowing into the on-board pull-up resistor of 10kΩ.
