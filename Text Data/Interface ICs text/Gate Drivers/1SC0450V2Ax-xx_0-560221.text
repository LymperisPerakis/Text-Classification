Single-Channel Cost-Effective SCALE™-2 IGBT Driver Core for 4500V and
6500V IGBTs
   Abstract
The 1SC0450V2Ax-xx drives all usual high-power IGBT modules up to 4500V or 6500V. Thanks to its high
output power capability, one single driver 1SC0450V2Ax-xx can drive up to four parallel connected 4500V or
6500V IGBT modules and consequently provides easy inverter design covering higher power ratings. Multi-
level topologies involving 3300V or 4500V IGBTs with higher isolation requirements can also be easily
supported by 1SC0450V2Ax-xx.
The 1SC0450V2Ax-xx combines a complete single-channel driver core with all components required for driving,
such as an isolated DC/DC converter, short-circuit protection, Advanced Active Clamping as well as supply
voltage monitoring. Enhanced features such as gate boosting or power supply short-circuit protection are also
implemented and provide further driving benefits.
The driver’s secondary side is electrically isolated from the primary side. The 1SC0450V2Ax-45 meets the
requirements of 4500V IGBT applications while the 1SC0450V2Ax-65 covers the requirements of 6500V IGBT
applications.
An output current of 50A and 6W drive power is available, making the 1SC0450V2Ax-xx an ideal driver
platform for universal use in medium and high-power applications. The driver provides a gate voltage swing of
15V/-10V. The turn-on voltage is regulated to maintain a stable 15V regardless of the output power level.
Its outstanding EMC allows safe and reliable operation even in hard industrial applications.

Output voltage swing
The output voltage swing consists of two distinct segments. First, there is the turn-on voltage VGH between
pins GH and VE. VGH is regulated and maintained at a constant level for all output power values and
frequencies.
The second segment of the output voltage swing is the turn-off voltage VGL. VGL is measured between pins
GL and VE. It is a negative voltage. It changes with the output power to accommodate the inevitable voltage
drop across the internal DC/DC converter.

Footnotes to the Key Data
1)   The transceivers required on the host controller side are not supplied with the gate driver. It is
     recommended to use the same types as used in the gate driver. For product information refer to
     www.IGBT-Driver.com/go/fiberoptics
2)   The recommended transmitter current at the host controller is 20mA. A higher current may increase
     jitter or delay at turn-off.
3)   The typical transmitter current at the gate driver is 20mA. In case of supply undervoltage, the
     minimum transmitter current at the gate driver is 17mA: this is suitable for adequate plastic optical
     fibers with a length of up to 10 meters.
4)   The maximum peak gate current refers to the highest current level occurring during the product
     lifetime. It is an absolute value and does also apply for short pulses.
5)   Two times the given minimum resistance value must be inserted between the interface connectors GH
     and GL. Moreover, the given minimal resistance value must be used in the full gate turn-on path
     (interface connector GH to gate) and in the full gate turn-off path (interface connector GL to gate).
6)   The average supply input current is limited for thermal reasons. Higher values than specified by the
     absolute maximum rating are permissible (e.g. during power supply start up) if the average remains
     below the given value, provided the average is taken over a time period which is shorter than the
     thermal time constants of the driver in the application.
7)   There is no protection against light power supply overload. In the case of start-up with very high
     blocking capacitor values, or in case of short circuit/heavy overload at the output, the supply input
     current is limited internally. The time during which the driver’s output is shorted/overloaded has to be
     limited externally and has to be within the absolute maximum rating.
8)   The maximum output power must not be exceeded at any time during operation. The absolute
     maximum rating must also be observed for time periods shorter than the thermal time constants of
     the driver in the application.
9)   An extended output power range is specified in the output power section for ambient temperatures
     limited from -40°C to 70°C.
10 ) Including the delay of the external fiber-optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition of
     the turn-on or turn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the direct
     output of the gate drive unit (excluding the delay of the gate resistors). The delay time is measured
     between 50% of the input signal and 10% voltage swing of the corresponding output. The delay time
     is independent on the output loading.
11 ) Output rise and fall times are measured between 10% and 90% of the nominal output swing with an
     output load of 4.7Ω and 270nF. The values are given for the driver side of the gate resistors. The time
     constant of the output load in conjunction with the present gate resistors leads to an additional delay
     at the load side of the gate resistors.
12 ) External blocking capacitors should be placed between the VISO and VE as well as the VE and COM
     terminals. Refer to “1SC0450V Description & Application Manual” (paragraph “DC/DC output (VISO),
     emitter (VE) and COM terminals)” for recommendations. Ceramic capacitors are recommended.
13 ) The minimum response time is valid for the circuit given in the description and application manual
     with the values of the corresponding tables.
14 ) Measured on the host side. The fault status on the secondary side is extended by the “delay in IGBT
     turn-off” and automatically reset after the specified time.
15 ) Undervoltage monitoring of the primary-side supply voltage (VCC to GND). If the voltage drops below
     this limit, a fault is transmitted to the SO output.
16 ) Undervoltage monitoring of the secondary-side supply voltage (VISO to VE and VE to COM, which
     correspond to the approximate turn-on and turn-off gate-emitter voltages). If the corresponding
     voltage drops below this limit, a fault is transmitted to the fiber optic output and the IGBT is switched
     off after the corresponding delay. Refer to “1SC0450V Description & Application Manual” for more
     details.
17 ) Delay of external fiber-optic links. Measured from the driver secondary side (ASIC output) to the
     optical receiver on the host controller.

18 )   HiPot testing (= dielectric testing) must generally be restricted to suitable components. This gate
       driver is suited for HiPot testing. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to limit the testing time to
       1s slots. Excessive HiPot testing at voltages much higher than 3182VAC,rms with 1SC0450V2Ax-45 and
       4596VAC,rms with 1SC0450V2Ax-65 may lead to insulation degradation. No degradation has been
       observed over 1min. testing at 10.2kVAC,rms. Every production sample shipped to customers has
       undergone 100% testing at the given value for 1s.
19 )   Partial discharge measurement is performed in accordance with IEC 60270 and IEC 60664-1 for basic
       insulation requirements.
20 )   Jitter measurements are performed with input signals INx switching between 0V and 15V referred to
       GND, with a corresponding rise time and fall time of 6ns.
21 )   The VCE–monitoring threshold value can be reduced with an external resistor. Refer to “1SC0450V
       Description & Application Manual”.
22 )   The turn-off event of the IGBT after a secondary-side fault (IGBT short circuit, undervoltage
       monitoring or power-supply short circuit/heavy driver overload) can be additionally delayed with an
       external capacitor. Refer to “1SC0450V Description & Application Manual”.
23 )   Gate turn-on and turn-off current pulses in normal operation will not affect the power supply
       protection. Power supply protection will only be triggered by corresponding power-supply overload or
       short circuit (which would also occur in case of gate-emitter short circuit/overload).
24 )   The fault feedback pulse length/pattern depends on the available power supply short-circuit/overload.
       The minimum value applies for any power supply overload.
25 )   Maximum short-circuit duration of the driver output. The driver’s power supply VDC has to be
       switched off externally within the given time. The power supply protection prevents the driver’s
       components to be damaged within the given time frame. For details see the driver’s “1SC0450V
       Description & Application Manual”.
26 )   The voltage values of the pins VGB resp. GBS are maximum 50V resp. 35V referred to COM. This must
       be considered for the design of the creepage and clearance distances.
27 )   The given value applies for a full discharge of VGB to VISO. It can be increased using external
       capacitors.
28 )   Including the delay of the external fiber-optic links (cable length: 1m). Measured from the transition of
       the turn-on or turn-off command at the optical transmitter on the host controller side to the transition
       of the acknowledge signal at the optical receiver on the host controller side.
