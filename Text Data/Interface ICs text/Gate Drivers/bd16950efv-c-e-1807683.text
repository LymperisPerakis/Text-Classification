BD16950EFV-C
Selection of Components Externally Connected
Input Capacitor CVS
    The input capacitor (CVS) lowers the power supply impedance and averages the input current. The C VS value is selected
    according to the impedance of the power supply that is used. A ceramic capacitor with a small equivalent series resistance
    (ESR) should be used. Although the capacitance requirement varies according to the impedance of the power supply that is
    used as well as the load current value, it is generally in the range of 1.0μF.
Input Capacitor CVCC
    The input capacitor (CVCC) lowers the power supply impedance and averages the input current. The C VCC value is selected
    according to the impedance of the power supply that is used. A ceramic capacitor with a small equivalent series resistance
    (ESR) should be used. A capacitor value of 0.1μF is recommended.
Charge Pump Capacitor CCP1
    The Charge pump capacitor CCP1 is required for smoothing the ripple voltage. A capacitor value of 0.1μF is recommended.
    Using a capacitor with a capacitance lower than 0.1μF, results in a larger ripple voltage. Conversely, using a capacitor with a
    capacitance greater than 0.1μF results in a larger rush current during start-up, but ripple voltage becomes lower.
Charge Pump Capacitor CCP2
    The charge pump capacitor CCP2 is required for charging up the voltage. A capacitor value of 0.1μF is recommended. Using
    a capacitor with a capacitance lower than 0.1μF, results in a larger ripple voltage. Conversely, using a capacitor with a
    capacitance greater than 0.1μF results in a larger rush current during start-up, but ripple voltage becomes lower.
External N-ch MOSFET
    BD16950EFV is the gate driver for high side and low side N-channel MOSFETs. Select MOSFETs with the required current
    capacity to drive the motor and a Gate-Source breakdown voltage ≥ 12V.

(Note 1)          The Power-On-Reset circuit (POR) monitors the VCC voltage. At power-up, POR is released when VCC ≥ VCC_POR1
                  voltage. The POR circuit has a blanking time for 2μs (Typ) to reject noise.
                  The POR Flag in status resister is set to ’1’ in reset and is kept after recovery reset.
(Note 2)          RSTB is set high by MCU. State is changed to Sleep state.
(Note 3)          MCU sends the EN=’1’ command. State is changed to Normal state.
                  EN=’1’ command can be sent after 1μs(min) to change RSTB from “Low” to “High”.
                  Consequently, analog circuit becomes active (IVS_act=3.2mA Typ and IVCC_act=1.2mA Typ).
                  Transition time is 50μs(Max) from “Sleep state” to “Normal state”.
(Note 4)          MCU sends “Clear Status” Command. Therefore, POR bit in status register is set to ‘0’ (POR=’1’ to POR=’0’).

(Note 5)  VCC voltage drops below VCC_POR1 – VCC_POR_hys. POR_Circuit_Output voltage is low (logic reset signal).
          POR bit register is set to ‘1’. State is changed to Reset state.
          Consequently, the analog circuit is OFF (IVS_qui1=0μA Typ and IVCC_qui1=2μA Typ).
(Note 6)  VCC voltage rises above VCC_POR1. POR_Circuit_Output level is high (logic reset release)
          after filter time(2μs Typ).
(Note 7)  POR_Circuit_Output level is high. Therefore, State is changed to Sleep state.
(Note 8)  MCU sends the EN=’1’ command. State is changed to Normal state.
          Therefore, analog circuit becomes active(IVS_act=3.2mA Typ and IVCC_act=1.2mA Typ).
(Note 9)  MCU sends the “Clear Status” Command. Therefore, the POR bit register is set to ‘0’(POR=’1’ to POR=’0’).
(Note 10) MCU sends the CPEN=’1’ command. Charge pump circuit is activated. Charge time is 0.2ms(Max).
(Note 11) MCU sends the DRVEN=’1’ command. GH1, GL1, GH2 and GL2 outputs are active(Constant current driving).
          Each register setting is set before DRVEN=’1’.
(Note 12) MCU sends the DRVEN=’0’ command. GH1, GL1, GH2 and GL2 outputs are pulled low with a 10Ω pull down.
(Note 13) MCU sends the EN=’0’ command. State is changed to Sleep state.
          Therefore, analog circuit turns OFF(IVS_qui1=0μA Typ, IVCC_qui1=2μA Typ and charge pump circuit is OFF).
(Note 14) RSTB input is set to low level by MCU. State is changed to Reset state.
          POR bit register is to ‘1’.Therefore, the SPI interface can’t be communicable.
(Note 15) VCC voltage falls below VCC_POR1 – VCC_POR_hys. POR_Circuit_Output level is low (logic reset signal).
(Note 16) CSB falling edge and rising edge are described as below.

    If settings are changed while IC is in one of the Protection states, the settings become valid except for those which can
    influence the transition to that particular protection state itself. Transition from Protection states to Reset state or Sleep state
    occurs immediately. Transition to normal state is only possible when the particular protection condition (e.g. OCP, OVP,
    UVLO or TSD) is no more existing. Furthermore, only the channels which are having over current move to OCP Protection
    state. Other channels with normal currents stay in Normal state.
    The following table describes validity of individual command settings when changed in Protection states.

    (note1) Settings become immediately valid except for the Channel which is in OCP. For those channel, settings would become effective only when they move
            out of OCP. E.g. if OCP threshold value is changed while a channel is in OCP, the new value would be effective only when the channel moves out of
            OCP.
    (note2) Settings become immediately valid except for those which can influence the transition to protection mode itself. e.g. when state is Protection2 due to
            UVLO, it cannot be disabled by setting UVLOM as ‘0’.

Reset State (Refer to Table 1, Table 2, Figure 13 and Figure 16)
    If RSTB=Low or VCC < VCC_POR1 – VCC_POR_hys Voltage, the state changes to Reset state.
    Logic is in Reset state, therefore SPI communication is impossible. All register data is cleared. In the Reset State all analog
    circuits are OFF, therefore IVS_qui1=0μA and IVCC_qui1=2μA. The driver outputs of BD16950EFV are pulled down by a 15kΩ
    (Typ) internal resistor. The Reset state changes to Sleep state when RSTB=High and VCC > VCC_POR1 Voltage.
Transition to Reset State
    Transition to Reset State can be made with 2 type of operation methods.
         1. when RSTB=Low.
         2. when VCC < VCC_POR1 – VCC_POR_hys Voltage.
Sleep State (Refer to Table 1, Table 2, Figure 13 and Figure 16)
    When RSTB=High and VCC > VCC_POR1, the state changes to the Sleep state. The logic is released from reset, therefore SPI
    communication is possible and all registers can be set. In the Sleep State, all analog circuits are OFF, therefore IVS_qui1=0μA
    and IVCC_qui1=2μA. The driver outputs of BD16950EFV are pulled down by a 15kΩ (Typ) internal resistor. However, the POR
    circuit remains active in Sleep State. When VCC < VCC_POR1 – VCC_POR_hys, is detected, the logic is reset and the state
    changes to the Reset State.
Transition to Sleep State
    Transition to the Sleep State can be made with 2 type of operation methods.
         1. when EN=0 (RSTB=High and VCC > VCC_POR1)
         2. by software reset (RSTB=High and VCC > VCC_POR1).
Normal State (Refer to Table 1 and Figure 13)
    The Normal State is the standard operating state for BD16950EFV. When the enable register EN is set to ‘1’, the state
    changes from Sleep State to Normal State. In the Normal State, all analog circuits are active and SPI communication is
    possible. Additionally, ON/OFF control of the charge pump and the driver output is possible by setting the registers CPEN
    and DRVEN. The driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ) when CPEN=0. However, when both DRVEN=1 and
    DRVEN=0, the driver outputs are actively driven low with 10Ω (Typ). When CPEN=’1’ and DRVEN=’1’ the driver outputs are
    synchronized with the PWM1 or PWM2 input.
Protection1 State (Refer to Table 1, Table 2, Figure 13 and Figure 25 to 27)
    When Over Current Protection (OCP) or DRAIN terminal Under Voltage Protection (UVP) event is detected, the state
    changes to Protection1 State. In this state, the SPI registers hold their values, SPI communication remains possible and the
    Charge pump is kept in charged-up state. The driver outputs are actively pulled low with 10Ω (Typ). For driver output OFF
    operation of the over current detection, a latch mode and auto recovery mode can be selected. Only the output at which an
    OCP event is detected will be turned OFF.
Protection2 State (Refer to Table 1, Table 2, Figure 13 and Figure 17 to 22)
    When a UVLO or OVP event is detected at the VS terminal, the state changes to the Protection2 state. In this state, the SPI
    registers hold their values, SPI communication remains possible and the charge pump stops charging. The driver outputs
    can either be pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ) or operate in braking mode, which is controlled by the MCU in case of a
    user-generated over-voltage event that is detected by the MCU. Both (UVLO and OVP) detection functions can be disabled,
    but not during an already detected OVP or UVLO event.
Protection3 State (Refer to Table 1, Table 2, Figure 13 and Figure 23)
    When a TSD event is detected, the state changes to Protection3 State. In Protection3 state SPI registers hold their values,
    but SPI is disabled and the charge pump stops charging. The driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ).
Dual Power Supply: VS and VCC
    The supply voltage VS supplies the charge-pump and low-side driver. An internal charge-pump is used to drive the high-side
    switches. The supply voltage VCC (3.3V/5V) is used for analog blocks and digital core of the BD16950EFV. Due to the
    independent VCC supply voltage, the logic control and logic status information is not lost even if the VS supply voltage is
    switched OFF. In case of power-on (VCC increases above the POR threshold VCC_POR1 = 2.00V Typ), the circuit is initialized by
    an internally generated power-on reset (POR). If the VCC voltage decreases under the POR threshold VCC_POR1 – VCC_POR_hys =
    1.90V(Typ), the driver outputs (GH1, GH2, GL1 and GL2) are switched-off and the logic registers are set to default values.

Constant Current Control
   The controlled constant source and sink current values of the gate driver can be set individually by the SPI register. Setting
   ranges are ‘Drivers OFF’ and 1mA - 31mA in steps of 1mA. In the ‘Drivers OFF’ setting, the drivers are set to 0mA setting
   (CUR_SINK [4:0] = 5’b00000). They can be synchronized with PWM1 or PWM2 input signal depending on the Half-bridge
   driver mode.
   In Figure 14, the high-side constant current circuit is shown. Figure 15 shows the low-side constant current circuit. The global
   reference current ‘IREF’ is mirrored into the channel current to generate a local reference voltage while amplifier A1 forces
   the voltage across the current sense resistor to match the local reference voltage.
   The output device is scaled to give a 5 bit output range so that the source/sink current values can be achieved in range of
   1mA to 31mA by steps of 1mA. The source /sink current values do not contain the 15 kΩ pull down current.

High Side Gate Driver Outputs at Saturation Source Current Control
    When the GH1/GH2 terminal voltage exceeds VCP-0.7V (Max), the source current decreases from the setting value.
    Therefore, the constant current drive range is within GH1/GH2 terminal voltage < VCP-0.7V(Max). After constant current drive,
    GH1 and GH2 terminals are pulled up by the current sense resistor and PMOS ON-resistance (current sense resistor(RFB[0],
    RFB[1], RFB[2], RFB[3] and RFB[4]) and PMOS). The effective resistance value of the pulled-up is determined by current
    sense resistor and PMOS Ron.

Low Side Gate Driver Outputs at Saturation Source Current Control
      When the GL1/GL2 terminal voltage exceeds VCLAMP-0.7V (Max), the source current decreases from the setting value.
      Therefore, the constant current drive range is within GL1/GL2 terminal voltage < VGLXH-0.7V (Max). After constant current
      drive, GL1 and GL2 terminals are pulled up on a current sense resistor and PMOS Ron (current sense resistor(RFB[0],
      RFB[1], RFB[2], RFB[3] and RFB[4]) and PMOS). The effective resistance value of the pulled-up is determined by current
      sense resistor and PMOS Ron.

High Side Gate Driver Outputs at Saturation Sink Current Control
     When GH1/GH2 terminal voltage falls below 0.7V (Max), the sink current decreases from the setting value. Therefore,
     constant current drive range is within GH1/GH2 terminal voltage > 0.7V (Max). Beyond this range, GH1 and GH2 terminals
     are pulled down on a current sense resistor and NMOS Ron (current sense resistors RFB[0], RFB[1], RFB[2], RFB[3] and
     RFB[4] and NMOS). The effective resistance value of the pulled-down is determined by current sense resistor and NMOS
     Ron.

BD16950EFV-C
Low Side Gate Driver Outputs at Saturation Sink Current Control
      When GL1/GL2 terminal voltage falls below 0.7V (Max), the sink current decreases from the setting value. Therefore,
      constant current drive range is within GL1/GL2 terminal voltage > 0.7V (Max). Beyond this range, GL1 and GL2 terminals are
      pulled down on a current sense resistor and NMOS Ron (current sense resistors RFB[0], RFB[1], RFB[2], RFB[3] and
      RFB[4] and NMOS).
      The effective resistance value of the pulled-down is determined by current sense resistor and NMOS Ron.

BD16950EFV-C
PWM Control
( Active Free Wheeling : Half-Bridge Control Mode=1000. See Mode Configuration on page 37 )
    The relationship of PWM, GHx and GLx outputs signal are as below. When the BD16950EFV detects the rising edge of the
    PWM signal, the GHx or GLx are turned on, after an asynchronous delay (Synchronization delay tsyn). There is also an
    internal delay time(Propagation delay tpropa ). before GHx or GLx outputs are turned on.
    The external MOSFETs in Half-bridge configuration are switched ON with an additional delay time tCCPT (Cross Current
    Protection Time) between the sink current start of GL1 / GL2 and the source current start of GH1/GH2 to prevent cross
    current in the half-bridge. This value can be set by the SPI register in the range:
         0.25μs…4μs (0.25μs steps)
         4μs…12μs (1μs steps)

PWM Control
( Passive Free Wheeling : Independent Control Mode : PWM Control Mode. See Mode Configuration on page 37 )
    The relationship of PWM, GHx and GLx outputs signal are shown below. When the BD16950EFV is detecting the high edge
    of the PWM signal, an asynchronous delay is present (Synchronization delay tsyn) between the PWM signal and high-side
    source/sink or low-side source/sink of internal logic signal. Then, GHx or GLx are turned on. However, there is an internal
    delay time(Propagation delay tpropa) before GHx or GLx outputs are turned on.
    The GHx or GLx are switched ON with an additional delay time tINCCPT (Internal Cross Current Protection Time) between the
    sink current end of GHx / GLx and the source current start of GHx / GLx to prevent cross current.

Charge Pump
    A charge pump is needed for driving the gates of the high-side external power MOS transistors. It requires a 0.1μF capacitor
    between the CPP and CPM terminals and another 0.1μF capacitor between the CP and VS terminals. Without load or when
    VS>13.5V, the voltage at the CP terminal is boosted up to VS+11V. The charge pump is clocked at 500kHz with a dedicated
    internal oscillator. The VCP voltage decreases with a slope of 1V per 10mA of current load at VS=13.5V. It is also possible to
    use the VCP voltage to drive external parts taking into account the mentioned load current range and VCP drop voltage.

VCC Power On Reset (POR)
    When the VCC terminal voltage drops below 1.90V (Typ), all registers are reset, the driver outputs (GH1, GH2, GL1 and
    GL2) of BD16950EFV are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ) and all analog circuits are OFF. In this case, the POR Status Flag
    register is set to ‘1’ (initial value=1). Reading this SPI register is possible when VCC terminal voltage is above 2.00V (Typ). In
    order to clear the POR flag in this case, a ‘clear status’ command (clear POR bit) should be sent. In addition, POR Blanking
    time of 2μs (Typ) is programmed to avoid a malfunction caused by noise. The BD16950EFV starts counting the blanking time
    When the VCC terminal voltage drops below 1.90V (Typ). After that, the driver outputs are pulled down with the internal 15kΩ
    (Typ) resistor and the POR register is set to ’1’.

BD16950EFV-C
VS Under Voltage Lock Out (UVLO)
     There are 3 modes for UVLO function: Auto recovery, Latch and UVLO disable. The UVLO setting can be set by the SPI
     register.
1. Auto Recovery
     When VS terminal voltage is below 4.5V (Typ), all driver outputs (GH1, GH2, GL1 and GL2) of the BD16950EFV are pulled
     down with 15kΩ (Typ), the charge pump stops and the UVLO Status Read register is set to ‘1’. When the VS terminal voltage
     rises above 5.0V (Typ), the BD16950EFV returns to normal operation mode. The Status Read remains latched UVLO= 1
     until it is cleared via the “Clear Status” command. In addition, a 64μs (Typ) UVLO Blanking time is programmed to reject
     noise. When the VS terminal voltage drops below 4.5V (Typ), BD16950EFV starts the blanking time. After that, the driver
     outputs are pulled low state with 15kΩ (Typ) and the UVLO register is set “1”.

2. Latch
     When the VS terminal voltage drops below 4.5V (Typ), all driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ), the charge pump
     stops charging and the UVLO Status Read register is set ‘1’. When the VS terminal voltage rises above 5.0V (Typ) this
     condition remains until UVLO Status Read register is cleared via “Clear Status” command register. In addition, a 64μs (Typ)
     UVLO Blanking time is programmed to reject any noise. When the VS terminal voltage drops below 4.5V (Typ), the
     BD16950EFV starts counting the blanking time. After that, the driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ) and the UVLO
     register is set to ‘1’.

VS Over Voltage Protection (OVP)
    Similar to the UVLO settings, the over-voltage protection function (OVP) also has three settings: Auto recovery, Latch and
    OVP disable, which can be set by the SPI register.
1.Auto Recovery
    When the VS terminal voltage rises above 22V (Typ), all driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ), the charge pump
    stops and the OVP Status Read register is set to ‘1’. When VS terminal voltage drops below 21V (Typ), the driver outputs
    come back, the charge pump restarts and the BD16950EFV returns to the normal operation mode. The Status Read register
    latches OVP=1. In order to reset this register, it has to be cleared via “Clear Status” command register. Caution should be
    taken to never exceed the absolute maximum power supply voltage, which could destroy the IC. In addition, a 64μs (Typ)
    OVP Blanking time is programmed to reject noise. As soon as the VS terminal voltage rises above 22V (Typ), the
    BD16950EFV starts counting the blanking time. After that, the driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ) and the OVP
    register is set to ‘1’. In addition, when the Half-Bridge control No.2 mode register (Figure 29) is set by SPI in an OVP event,
    the driver outputs can be controlled in the ‘Braking’ mode.

2.Latch
    When the VS terminal voltage rises above 22V (Typ), all driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ), the charge pump
    stops and the OVP Status Read register is set to ‘1’. When VS terminal voltage drops above 21V (Typ), this condition
    remains until the OVP Status Read register is cleared via “Clear Status” command register. In addition, a 64μs (Typ) OVP
    Blanking time is programmed to reject noise. VS terminal voltage above 22V (Typ), BD16950EFV count the blanking time.
    After that, the driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ) and OVP register is set “1”. In addition, when the control No.2
    mode register (Figure 29) is set by SPI in an OVP event, the driver outputs can be controlled in the ‘Braking’ mode.

BD16950EFV-C
Thermal Shut Down (TSD)
    When the junction temperature rises above 175°C (Typ) all driver outputs are pulled down with 15kΩ (Typ), the charge pump
    stops and the SPI is uncommunicable ( SO output is all ’1’ output ). In that case the TSD register is set to ‘1’. The SPI
    registers hold their values. When the junction temperature falls below 160°C (Typ), the BD16950EFV returns to normal
    operation mode and SPI is communicable. There is a 15°C hysteresis. In order to reset this flag, it has to be cleared via
    “Clear Status” command register.

Thermal Warning (TW)
    Before the TSD thermal shut down temperature is detected, the BD16950EFV can warn the MCU when the junction
    temperature rises above 137.5°C (Typ). In that case the TW register is set to ‘1’. The MCU can confirm that the IC is
    heating-up abnormally by reading the register TW. The MCU can turn OFF the charge pump (CPEN=0) or the driver outputs
    (DRVEN=0) before a TSD is detected. BD16950EFV releases the thermal warning TW when the junction temperature falls
    below 117.5°C (Typ). The Status Read remains latched TW=1. In order to reset TW register, it has to be cleared via “Clear
    Status” command.

BD16950EFV-C
Over Current Protection (OCP)
    When the drain-source voltage of one (or more) external MOSFETs of the Half-bridge exceeds the OCP detection threshold
    setting value, the BD16950EFV detects over current. Only those outputs at which an over current is detected, will be turned
    OFF. The OCP detection threshold setting value can be set by the SPI register. Setting ranges are 200mV, 300mV, 400mV,
    500mV, 750mV, 1000mV, 1250mV and 1500mV. High side (Drain-SH1 and Drain-SH2) and Low side (SH1-SL and SH2-SL)
    OCP detection levels can be individually set to different values. For each of the four external MOSFETs, there is an individual
    OCP Status flag (OCP_HS1, OCP_HS2, OCP_LS1 and OCP_LS2).
    There is a latch mode and an auto recovery mode for the driver output OFF operation in case an over current is detected.
    Latch or auto recovery can be selected by the SPI register. OCP function is effective at No.2 mode, No.3 mode, No.4 mode,
    No.6 mode and No.9 mode (Mode Setting Ch2, Ch1).
    To reject noise, the OCP Filter time setting can be set by the SPI register for both the auto recovery mode and the OCP latch
    mode. OCP Filter time setting ranges are 1μs to 64μs with steps of 1μs. OCP Filter time is the same for all output drivers.
    The OCP Filter time starts when the drain-source voltage of the external MOSFET VDS is higher than the OCP detection
    threshold voltage. When the setting value of Filter time exceeds the on time set by the PWM, the BD16950EFV cannot
    detect over current.

BD16950EFV-C
    In latch mode, the BD16950EFV turns OFF (latched) the driver output when over current is detected. In this case, this output
    is actively driven low at the constant current 31mA setting and the OCP Status Read register is set to ‘1’. For each of the four
    external MOSFETs, there is an OCP Status Read register of OCP_HS1, OCP_HS2, OCP_LS1 and OCP_LS2. The OCP
    register corresponding detected over current is latched to ‘1’. In order to reset the OCP register and release the driver output,
    it has to be cleared via Clear Status Command. When the BD16950EFV detects an OCP condition, the charge pump stays
    active.

BD16950EFV-C
    In the auto recovery mode, the BD16950EFV turns OFF (latched) the driver output when over current is detected. After that,
    the driver output recovers from this OCP condition at the rising edge of the PWM signal (from PWM1 or PWM2 terminals).
    Then the detection output is actively driven low at the constant current 31mA setting and the OCP register is set to ‘1’. For
    each of the four external MOSFETs, there is an OCP Status Read register : OCP_HS1, OCP_HS2, OCP_LS1 and OCP_LS2.
    The OCP register bit corresponding to the output which detects over current is latched to “1”. In order to release the driver
    output and reset the OCP register, it has to be cleared via Clear Status Command. When the BD16950EFV detects an OCP
    condition, the charge pump stays active.

BD16950EFV-C
DRAIN Under Voltage Protection(UVP)
    When the DRAIN terminal voltage drops under 4.9V (Typ), DRAIN under voltage is detected. Therefore, GH1 and GH2
    terminal are changed to 31mA sink setting. In other words, high side external MOSFET’s become OFF. The states of high
    side driver GH1 and GH2 move to DRAIN under voltage protection1 states. Low side driver GL1 and GL2 stay in Normal
    states. UVP has same specification with OCP. The filter time of DRAIN under voltage protection is the same as the
    OCP_FILTER. There are latch mode and auto recovery mode for the driver output OFF operation when UVP is detected. In
    other words, when OCP is selected to latch mode, UVP becomes the latch mode. When OCP and UVP are detected at the
    same time, UVP is high priority. OCP_HS1 or OCP_HS2 Bit is changed, too. If GH1 is source setting (e.g. figure 33) and
    GH2 is sink setting, OCP_HS1 bit is changed to 1. If GH1 is sink setting (e.g. figure 30) and GH2 is source setting,
    OCP_HS2 bit is changed to 1. UVP function is become effective other than No.1 mode (Mode Setting Ch2, Ch1).

      Note: In Direct Control (DC) mode, PWM pin is either LOW or HIGH continuously. There is no PWM in DC mode.
      Any other input command will put the driver into High impedance mode.
Half-Bridge Control Mode
    For the high side and low side gate drivers of the BD16950EFV, there are 9 mode settings which can be set by the SPI
    register. In the pictures below, these modes are shown. No.1 is OFF pull down mode. No.4 and No.9 are PWM mode. No.3,
    No.6 and No.8 are Direct Control mode. No.5 and No.7 are PWM & Direct Control mode. No.2 is Braking mode.
    No.1 to No.8 can control the high-side gate driver and low-side gate driver independently. No.9 can control the high-side gate
    driver and low-side gate driver as the Half-Bridge. BD16950EFV can select various modes.
    Therefore, these modes allow the BD16950EFV to supports various applications. In addition, the GH1 and GL1 outputs are
    synchronized to the PWM1 input. GH2 and GL2 outputs are synchronized to PWM2. When Mode2 is set by SPI during an
    OVP detection, the driver outputs can be controlled in the Braking mode. When Inductive loads are used, SH1 and SH2
    terminals might exceed their absolute maximum ratings. Therefore, the SH1 and SH2 terminals must be connected to a
    protection diode as illustrated by the diagrams below(Figure29 to Figure 35). The minimum current and voltage requirements
    of the diode are depending on the corresponding absolute maximum ratings of the SH1 and SH2 terminals.

Serial Communication:
    The serial port is used to write data, read diagnostic status and configure settings of the chip by transferring the data to the
    desired address. During normal operation an 8-bit serial address followed by 8-bit serial data is written into the 16-bit shift
    register. The shift register advances on SCLK rising edge. Depending on the address, valid data is conveyed from or to the
    appropriate register or a command is interpreted. When a read address is latched data is read out from a storage register
    and shifted out of SO to the microcontroller.
Write Register
    The write register protocol is shown below. For input pins we use CSB, SCLK and SI. When CSB is Low, data is accepted.
    Data (SI) is latched at the rising edge of the clock (SCLK) and sent to the register after 16-bit command is completely
    received. For write operation, the highest rank bit (MSB) must be Low. The next 7 bits are address settings, the 8 lowest bits
    are data. On SO, after CSB goes Low, the first 8-bits shifted out during send operation are the Global status register bits and
    the next 8-bits are the values of the register.

Read Register
    Reading–out from the registers is shown below. For read operation, the highest rank bit (MSB) must be High. After that, the
    7 bits address is send followed by 8 data bits (data value is ‘don’t care’). The first 8-bits shifted out on SO during send
    operation are the Global status register bits and the next 8-bits shifted out are the values of the register addressed.

Operational Notes
1.  Reverse Connection of Power Supply
    Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
    connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power supply pins.
2.  Power Supply Lines
    Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at all
    power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
    capacitors.
3.  Ground Voltage
    Except for pins the output and the input of which were designed to go below ground, ensure that no pins are at a voltage
    below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
4.  Ground Wiring Pattern
    When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
    connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal ground
    caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations on the ground
    voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
5.  Thermal Consideration
    Should by any chance the power dissipation rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in
    deterioration of the properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, increase the board size and
    copper area to prevent exceeding the Pd rating.
6.  Recommended Operating Conditions
    These conditions represent a range within which the expected characteristics of the IC can be approximately obtained. The
    electrical characteristics are guaranteed under the conditions of each parameter.
7.  Inrush Current
    When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
    instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power supply.
    Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and routing of
    connections.
8.  Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
    Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
9.  Testing on Application Boards
    When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may subject the
    IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply should always be
    turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection process. To prevent damage
    from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during transport and storage.
10. Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
    Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
    damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin. Inter-pin
    shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and unintentional
    solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
11. Unused Input Pins
    Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
    extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small charge
    acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and cause unexpected
    operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the power supply or ground
    line.

12. Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
    This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them isolated.
    P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a parasitic diode or
    transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
    Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual interference
    among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to operate, such as
    applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be avoided.

13. Ceramic Capacitor
    When using a ceramic capacitor, determine the dielectric constant considering the change of capacitance with temperature
    and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
14. Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
    Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and power dissipation are all within the Area of Safe Operation
    (ASO).
15. Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
    This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always be
    within the IC’s power dissipation rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the junction temperature
    (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF all output pins. When the Tj falls below the TSD threshold,
    the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
    Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
    circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from heat
    damage.

    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are not designed under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below.
        Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the
        use of any ROHM’s Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our
        Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent
        verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                   H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification

Precaution for Electrostatic
    This Product is electrostatic sensitive product, which may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. Please take proper
    caution in your manufacturing process and storage so that voltage exceeding the Products maximum rating will not be
    applied to Products. Please take special care under dry condition (e.g. Grounding of human body / equipment / solder iron,
    isolation from charged objects, setting of Ionizer, friction prevention and temperature / humidity control).
Precaution for Storage / Transportation
    1.   Product performance and soldered connections may deteriorate if the Products are stored in the places where:
              [a] the Products are exposed to sea winds or corrosive gases, including Cl2, H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [b] the temperature or humidity exceeds those recommended by ROHM
              [c] the Products are exposed to direct sunshine or condensation
              [d] the Products are exposed to high Electrostatic
    2.   Even under ROHM recommended storage condition, solderability of products out of recommended storage time period
         may be degraded. It is strongly recommended to confirm solderability before using Products of which storage time is
         exceeding the recommended storage time period.
    3.   Store / transport cartons in the correct direction, which is indicated on a carton with a symbol. Otherwise bent leads
         may occur due to excessive stress applied when dropping of a carton.
    4.   Use Products within the specified time after opening a humidity barrier bag. Baking is required before using Products of
         which storage time is exceeding the recommended storage time period.
