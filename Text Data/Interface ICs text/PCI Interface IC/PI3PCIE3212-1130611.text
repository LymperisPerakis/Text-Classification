Notes:
1. Guaranteed by design. Typical values are at VDD = 3.3V , Ta = 25°C ambient and maximum loading.
2. S parameters are measured with our evaluation board made with Rogers (R04350) material. Trace width is 30 mil, length 540 mil, trace
  impedance is 50 Ohm (+/-5%) and total insertion loss of the trace is 0.5dB@4GHz.
3. Measurement done with fixture deembedding.

Notes:
1. CL = Load capacitance: includes jig and probe capacitance.
2. RT = Termination resistance: should be equal to ZOUT of the Pulse Generator
3. Output 1 is for an output with internal conditions such that the output is low except when disabled by the output control.
        output 2 is for an output with internal conditions such that the output is high except when disabled by the output control.
4. All input impulses are supplied by generators having the following characteristics: PRR ≤ MHz, ZO = 50Ω, tR ≤ 2.5ns, tF ≤ 2.5ns.
5. The outputs are measured one at a time with one transition per measurement.
