Notes:
1. CL = Load capacitance: includes jig and probe capacitance.
2. RT = Termination resistance: should be equal to ZOUT of the Pulse Generator
3. Output 1 is for an output with internal conditions such that the output is low except when disabled by the output control.
       Output 2 is for an output with internal conditions such that the output is high except when disabled by the output control.
4. All input impulses are supplied by generators having the following characteristics: PRR ≤ MHz, ZO = 50Ω, tR ≤ 2.5ns, tF ≤ 2.5ns.
5. The outputs are measured one at a time with one transition per measurement.
