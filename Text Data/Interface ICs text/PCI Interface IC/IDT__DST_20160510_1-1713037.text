     As shown in Figure 3, the master and slave SMBuses may be used in a unified or split configuration. In the unified configuration, shown in Figure
3(a), the master and slave SMBuses are tied together and the PES10T4G2 acts both as a SMBus master as well as a SMBus slave on this bus. This
requires that the SMBus master or processor that has access to PES10T4G2 registers supports SMBus arbitration. In some systems, this SMBus
master interface may be implemented using general purpose I/O pins on a processor or micro controller, and may not support SMBus arbitration. To
support these systems, the PES10T4G2 may be configured to operate in a split configuration as shown in Figure 3(b).
     In the split configuration, the master and slave SMBuses operate as two independent buses and thus multi-master arbitration is never required.
The PES10T4G2 supports reading and writing of the serial EEPROM on the master SMBus via the slave SMBus, allowing in system programming of
the serial EEPROM.

Hot-Plug Interface
     The PES10T4G2 supports PCI Express Hot-Plug on each downstream port. To reduce the number of pins required on the device, the PES10T4G2
utilizes an external I/O expander, such as that used on PC motherboards, connected to the SMBus master interface. Following reset and configura-
tion, whenever the state of a Hot-Plug output needs to be modified, the PES10T4G2 generates an SMBus transaction to the I/O expander with the
new value of all of the outputs. Whenever a Hot-Plug input changes, the I/O expander generates an interrupt which is received on the IOEXPINTN
input pin (alternate function of GPIO) of the PES10T4G2. In response to an I/O expander interrupt, the PES10T4G2 generates an SMBus transaction
to read the state of all of the Hot-Plug inputs from the I/O expander.
General Purpose Input/Output
     The PES10T4G2 provides 9 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that may be used by the system designer as bit I/O ports. Each GPIO pin
may be configured independently as an input or output through software control. Some GPIO pins are shared with other on-chip functions. These
alternate functions may be enabled via software, SMBus slave interface, or serial configuration EEPROM.
                                                                            3 of 30                                                       May 10, 2016

Pin Description
    The following tables list the functions of the pins provided on the PES10T4G2. Some of the functions listed may be multiplexed onto the same pin.
The active polarity of a signal is defined using a suffix. Signals ending with an “N” are defined as being active, or asserted, when at a logic zero (low)
level. All other signals (including clocks, buses, and select lines) will be interpreted as being active, or asserted, when at a logic one (high) level.
            Note: In the PES10T4G2, the three downstream ports are labeled ports 2, 4, and 6.

                   CCLKDS      I  Common Clock Downstream. The assertion of this pin indicates that all
                                  downstream ports are using the same clock source as that provided to
                                  downstream devices.This bit is used as the initial value of the Slot Clock
                                  Configuration bit in all of the Link Status Registers for downstream ports.
                                  The value may be overridden by modifying the SCLK bit in each down-

                   CCLKUS      I  Common Clock Upstream. The assertion of this pin indicates that the
                                  upstream port is using the same clock source as the upstream device. This
                                  bit is used as the initial value of the Slot Clock Configuration bit in the Link
                                  Status Register for the upstream port. The value may be overridden by
                                  modifying the SCLK bit in the P0_PCIELSTS register.
                 MSMBSMODE     I  Master SMBus Slow Mode. The assertion of this pin indicates that the
                                  master SMBus should operate at 100 KHz instead of 400 KHz. This value

                                  state with the Master and Slave SMBuses active. This allows software to
                                  read and write registers internal to the device before normal device opera-
                                  tion begins. The device exits the reset state when the RSTHALT bit is

                   JTAG_TDO    O       JTAG Data Output. This is the serial data shifted out from the boundary
                                       scan logic or JTAG Controller. When no data is being shifted out, this signal
                                       is tri-stated.
                   JTAG_TMS     I      JTAG Mode. The value on this signal controls the test mode select of the
                                       boundary scan logic or JTAG Controller.
                 JTAG_TRST_N    I      JTAG Reset. This active low signal asynchronously resets the boundary
                                       scan logic and JTAG TAP Controller. An external pull-up on the board is
                                       recommended to meet the JTAG specification in cases where the tester
                                       can access this signal. However, for systems running in functional mode,
                                       one of the following should occur:
                                            1) actively drive this signal low with control logic
                                            2) statically drive this signal low with an external pull-down on the board

Pin Characteristics
      Note: Some input pads of the PES10T4G2 do not contain internal pull-ups or pull-downs. Unused inputs should be tied off to appropriate
      levels. This is especially critical for unused control signal inputs which, if left floating, could adversely affect operation. Also, any input pin left
      floating can cause a slight increase in power consumption.
                                                                                             I/O       Internal

            1. The
                   JTAG specification, IEEE 1149.1, recommends that JTAG_TMS should be held at 1 while the signal applied at JTAG_TRST_N
            changes from 0 to 1. Otherwise, a race may occur if JTAG_TRST_N is deasserted (going from low to high) on a rising edge of JTAG_TCK
            when JTAG_TMS is low, because the TAP controller might go to either the Run-Test/Idle state or stay in the Test-Logic-Reset state.

            specified in Table 17. Consequently, the effective junction to ambient thermal resistance (JA) for the worst case scenario must be
            maintained below the value determined by the formula:
                    JA = (TJ(max) - TA(max))/P
            Given that the values of TJ(max), TA(max), and P are known, the value of desired JA becomes a known entity to the system designer. How to
            achieve the desired JA is left up to the board or system designer, but in general, it can be achieved by adding the effects of JC (value
            provided in Table 17), thermal resistance of the chosen adhesive (CS), that of the heat sink (SA), amount of airflow, and properties of the
            circuit board (number of layers and size of the board). As a general guideline, this device will not need a heat sink if the board has 8 or more
            layers AND the board size is larger than 4"x12" AND airflow in excess of 0.5 m/s is available. It is strongly recommended that users perform
            their own thermal analysis for their own board and system design scenarios.
