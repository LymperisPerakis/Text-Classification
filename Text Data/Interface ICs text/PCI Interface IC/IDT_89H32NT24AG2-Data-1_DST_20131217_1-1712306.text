SMBus Interface
    The PES32NT24AG2 contains two SMBus interfaces. The slave interface provides full access to the configuration registers in the
PES32NT24AG2, allowing every configuration register in the device to be read or written by an external agent. The master interface allows the default
configuration register values of the PES32NT24AG2 to be overridden following a reset with values programmed in an external serial EEPROM. The
master interface is also used by an external Hot-Plug I/O expander.
    Each of the two SMBus interfaces contain an SMBus clock pin and an SMBus data pin. In addition, the slave SMBus has SSMBADDR1 and
SSMBADDR2 pins. As shown in Figure 2, the master and slave SMBuses may only be used in a split configuration. In the split configuration, the
master and slave SMBuses operate as two independent buses; thus, multi-master arbitration is not required. The SMBus master interface does not
support SMBus arbitration. As a result, the switch’s SMBus master must be the only master in the SMBus lines that connect to the serial EEPROM
and I/O expander slaves.

Hot-Plug Interface
    The PES32NT24AG2 supports PCI Express Hot-Plug on each downstream port (ports 1 through 23). To reduce the number of pins required on the
device, the PES32NT24AG2 utilizes an external I/O expander, such as that used on PC motherboards, connected to the SMBus master interface.
Following reset and configuration, whenever the state of a Hot-Plug output needs to be modified, the PES32NT24AG2 generates an SMBus transac-
tion to the I/O expander with the new value of all of the outputs. Whenever a Hot-Plug input changes, the I/O expander generates an interrupt which is
received on the IOEXPINTN input pin (alternate function of GPIO) of the PES32NT24AG2. In response to an I/O expander interrupt, the
PES32NT24AG2 generates an SMBus transaction to read the state of all of the Hot-Plug inputs from the I/O expander.
General Purpose Input/Output
    The PES32NT24AG2 provides 9 General Purpose I/O (GPIO) pins that may be individually configured as general purpose inputs, general purpose
outputs, or alternate functions. All GPIO pins are shared with other on-chip functions. These alternate functions may be enabled via software, SMBus
slave interface, or serial configuration EEPROM.
Pin Description
    The following tables list the functions of the pins provided on the PES32NT24AG2. Some of the functions listed may be multiplexed onto the same
pin. The active polarity of a signal is defined using a suffix. Signals ending with an “N” are defined as being active, or asserted, when at a logic zero
(low) level. All other signals (including clocks, buses, and select lines) will be interpreted as being active, or asserted, when at a logic one (high) level.
Differential signals end with a suffix “N” or “P.” The differential signal ending in “P” is the positive portion of the differential pair and the differential signal
ending in “N” is the negative portion of the differential pair.

                PERSTN          I  Fundamental Reset. Assertion of this signal resets all logic inside the device.
                RSTHALT         I  Reset Halt. When this signal is asserted during a switch fundamental reset sequence,
                                   the switch remains in a quasi-reset state with the Master and Slave SMBuses active.
                                   This allows software to read and write registers internal to the device before normal
                                   device operation begins. The device exits the quasi-reset state when the RSTHALT bit
                                   is cleared in the SWCTL register by an SMBus master.
              SWMODE[3:0]       I  Switch Mode. These configuration pins determine the switch operating mode.
                                    These pins should be static and not change following the negation of PERSTN.

                        JTAG_TCK                 I       JTAG Clock. This is an input test clock used to clock the shifting of data into or out of
                                                         the boundary scan logic or JTAG Controller. JTAG_TCK is independent of the system
                                                         clock with a nominal 50% duty cycle.
                         JTAG_TDI                I       JTAG Data Input. This is the serial data input to the boundary scan logic or JTAG
                                                         Controller.
                        JTAG_TDO                 O       JTAG Data Output. This is the serial data shifted out from the boundary scan logic or
                                                         JTAG Controller. When no data is being shifted out, this signal is tri-stated.
                        JTAG_TMS                 I       JTAG Mode. The value on this signal controls the test mode select of the boundary
                                                         scan logic or JTAG Controller.
                      JTAG_TRST_N                I       JTAG Reset. This active low signal asynchronously resets the boundary scan logic
                                                         and JTAG TAP Controller. An external pull-up on the board is recommended to meet
                                                         the JTAG specification in cases where the tester can access this signal. However, for
                                                         systems running in functional mode, one of the following should occur:
                                                         1) actively drive this signal low with control logic
                                                         2) statically drive this signal low with an external pull-down on the board

Pin Characteristics
    Note: Some input pads of the switch do not contain internal pull-ups or pull-downs. Unused SMBus and System inputs should be tied off to
    appropriate levels. This is especially critical for unused control signal inputs which, if left floating, could adversely affect operation. Also, floating
    pins can cause a slight increase in power consumption. Unused Serdes (Rx and Tx) pins should be left floating. Finally, No Connection pins
    should not be connected.

     The input clock frequency will be either 100 or 125 MHz depending on signal GCLKFSEL.
          Note: Refclk jitter compliant to PCIe Gen2 Common Clock architecture is adequate for the GCLKN/P[x] and PE[x]CLKN/P pins of this IDT
          PCIe switch. This same jitter specification is applicable when interfacing the switch to another IDT switch in a Separate (Non-Common)
          Clock architecture.

               The JTAG specification, IEEE 1149.1, recommends that JTAG_TMS should be held at 1 while the signal applied at JTAG_TRST_N
            changes from 0 to 1. Otherwise, a race may occur if JTAG_TRST_N is deasserted (going from low to high) on a rising edge of JTAG_TCK
            when JTAG_TMS is low, because the TAP controller might go to either the Run-Test/Idle state or stay in the Test-Logic-Reset state.

Power-Up/Power-Down Sequence
   During power supply ramp-up, VDDCORE must remain at least 1.0V below VDDI/O at all times. There are no other power-up sequence require-
ments for the various operating supply voltages. The power-down sequence can occur in any order.

         Note 1: The above power consumption assumes that all ports are functioning at Gen2 (5.0 GT/S) speeds. Power consumption can be
         reduced by turning off unused ports through software or through boot EEPROM. Power savings will occur in VDDPEA, VDDPEHA, and
         VDDPETA. Power savings can be estimated as directly proportional to the number of unused ports, since the power consumption of a turned-
         off port is close to zero. For example, if 3 ports out of 16 are turned off, then the power savings for each of the above three power rails can be
         calculated quite simply as 3/16 multiplied by the power consumption indicated in the above table.
         Note 2: Using a port in Gen1 mode (2.5GT/S) results in approximately 18% power savings for each power rail: VDDPEA, VDDPEHA, and
         VDDPETA.

          Note: It is important for the reliability of this device in any user environment that the junction temperature not exceed the TJ(max) value
          specified in Table 19. Consequently, the effective junction to ambient thermal resistance (JA) for the worst case scenario must be
          maintained below the value determined by the formula:
                  JA = (TJ(max) - TA(max))/P
          Given that the values of TJ(max), TA(max), and P are known, the value of desired JA becomes a known entity to the system designer. How to
          achieve the desired JA is left up to the board or system designer, but in general, it can be achieved by adding the effects of JC (value
          provided in Table 19), thermal resistance of the chosen adhesive (CS), that of the heat sink (SA), amount of airflow, and properties of the
          circuit board (number of layers and size of the board). It is strongly recommended that users perform their own thermal analysis for their own
          board and system design scenarios.
