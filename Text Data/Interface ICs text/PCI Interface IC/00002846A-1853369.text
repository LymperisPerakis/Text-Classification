Summary
The Switchtec™ PSX PCIe® Gen3 Storage Switch Family comprises programmable and
high-reliability PCIe Base Specification 3.1-compliant switches supporting up to 96 lanes,
48 ports, 24 virtual switch partitions, 48 Non-Transparent Bridges (NTBs) and hot- and
surprise-plug controllers for each port. The switch family also features advanced error
containment, comprehensive diagnostics and debug capabilities, a wide breadth of I/O
interfaces and an integrated MIPS processor. PSX switches utilize a system-on-chip
                                                                                                     Switchtec�
