High Performance
    In addition to low-latency operation, the Tsi382’s superior queueing
architecture and rich feature set allow designers to optimize their overall
system performance. Features such as short-term caching also enable                      x1 PCIe                     PCI

systems and is used in applications such as intelligent adapter cards.
Opaque mode provides semi-transparent operation for multi-processor
configurations and enhanced private device support.
Typical Applications
    The Tsi382 is suited to applications that need to bridge PCIe to
downstream PCI devices. Its flexibility, high performance, small foot-
print, and low power consumption, make it ideal for a wide range of
applications, including:
     • Digital video recorders
     • ExpressCards for laptop computers
     • Motherboards (PC, ultra-mobile PC, server, SBC, industrial PC)
