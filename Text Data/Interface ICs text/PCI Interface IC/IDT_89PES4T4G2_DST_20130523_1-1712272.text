Hot-Plug Interface
     The PES4T4G2 supports PCI Express Hot-Plug on each downstream port. To reduce the number of pins required on the device, the PES4T4G2
utilizes an external I/O expander, such as that used on PC motherboards, connected to the SMBus master interface. Following reset and configura-
tion, whenever the state of a Hot-Plug output needs to be modified, the PES4T4G2 generates an SMBus transaction to the I/O expander with the new
value of all of the outputs. Whenever a Hot-Plug input changes, the I/O expander generates an interrupt which is received on the IOEXPINTN input pin
(alternate function of GPIO) of the PES4T4G2. In response to an I/O expander interrupt, the PES4T4G2 generates an SMBus transaction to read the
state of all of the Hot-Plug inputs from the I/O expander.
General Purpose Input/Output
     The PES4T4G2 provides 7 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that may be used by the system designer as bit I/O ports. Each GPIO pin
may be configured independently as an input or output through software control. Most GPIO pins are shared with other on-chip functions. These alter-
nate functions may be enabled via software, SMBus slave interface, or serial configuration EEPROM.

Pin Description
    The following tables list the functions of the pins provided on the PES4T4G2. Some of the functions listed may be multiplexed onto the same pin.
The active polarity of a signal is defined using a suffix. Signals ending with an “N” are defined as being active, or asserted, when at a logic zero (low)
level. All other signals (including clocks, buses, and select lines) will be interpreted as being active, or asserted, when at a logic one (high) level.

                     CCLKDS    I  Common Clock Downstream. The assertion of this pin indicates that all
                                  downstream ports are using the same clock source as that provided to

                                  Configuration bit in all of the Link Status Registers for downstream ports.
                                  The value may be overridden by modifying the SCLK bit in each down-

                   JTAG_TCK    I  JTAG Clock. This is an input test clock used to clock the shifting of data
                                  into or out of the boundary scan logic or JTAG Controller. JTAG_TCK is
                                  independent of the system clock with a nominal 50% duty cycle.
                    JTAG_TDI   I  JTAG Data Input. This is the serial data input to the boundary scan logic or
                                  JTAG Controller.
                   JTAG_TDO   O   JTAG Data Output. This is the serial data shifted out from the boundary
                                  scan logic or JTAG Controller. When no data is being shifted out, this signal
                                  is tri-stated.
                   JTAG_TMS    I  JTAG Mode. The value on this signal controls the test mode select of the
                                  boundary scan logic or JTAG Controller.
                 JTAG_TRST_N   I  JTAG Reset. This active low signal asynchronously resets the boundary
                                  scan logic and JTAG TAP Controller. An external pull-up on the board is
                                  recommended to meet the JTAG specification in cases where the tester
                                  can access this signal. However, for systems running in functional mode,
                                  one of the following should occur:
                                       1) actively drive this signal low with control logic
                                       2) statically drive this signal low with an external pull-down on the board

Pin Characteristics
      Note: Some input pads of the PES4T4G2 do not contain internal pull-ups or pull-downs. Unused inputs should be tied off to appropriate
      levels. This is especially critical for unused control signal inputs which, if left floating, could adversely affect operation. Also, any input pin left
      floating can cause a slight increase in power consumption.
                                                                                             I/O       Internal

            1. The
                   JTAG specification, IEEE 1149.1, recommends that JTAG_TMS should be held at 1 while the signal applied at JTAG_TRST_N
            changes from 0 to 1. Otherwise, a race may occur if JTAG_TRST_N is deasserted (going from low to high) on a rising edge of JTAG_TCK
            when JTAG_TMS is low, because the TAP controller might go to either the Run-Test/Idle state or stay in the Test-Logic-Reset state.

    Warning: For proper and reliable operation in adherence with this data sheet, the device should not exceed the recommended operating voltages
in Table 12. The absolute maximum operating voltages in Table 13 are offered to provide guidelines for voltage excursions outside the recommended
voltage ranges. Device functionality is not guaranteed at these conditions and sustained operation at these values or any exposure to voltages outside
the maximum range may adversely affect device functionality and reliability.
Power-Up/Power-Down Sequence
    During power supply ramp-up, VDDCORE must remain at least 1.0V below VDDI/O at all times. There are no other power-up sequence require-
ments for the various operating supply voltages.
    The power-down sequence can occur in any order.

            Note: It is important for the reliability of this device in any user environment that the junction temperature not exceed the TJ(max) value
            specified in Table 16. Consequently, the effective junction to ambient thermal resistance (θJA) for the worst case scenario must be
            maintained below the value determined by the formula:
                    θJA = (TJ(max) - TA(max))/P
            Given that the values of TJ(max), TA(max), and P are known, the value of desired θJA becomes a known entity to the system designer. How to
            achieve the desired θJA is left up to the board or system designer, but in general, it can be achieved by adding the effects of θJC (value
            provided in Table 16), thermal resistance of the chosen adhesive (θCS), that of the heat sink (θSA), amount of airflow, and properties of the
            circuit board (number of layers and size of the board). As a general guideline, this device will not need a heat sink if the board has 8 or more
            layers AND the board size is larger than 4"x12" AND airflow in excess of 0.5 m/s is available. It is strongly recommended that users perform
            their own thermal analysis for their own board and system design scenarios.
