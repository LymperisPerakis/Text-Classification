1        INTRODUCTION
         PI7C9X110 is a PCIe-to-PCI bridge. PI7C9X110 is compliant with the PCI Express Base Specification, Revision
         1.0a, the PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification, Revision 1.0a, the PCI Local Bus Specification,
         Revision 3.0 and PCI Express to PCI Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0. PI7C9X110 supports transparent and
         non-transparent mode of operations. Also, PI7C9X110B supports forward and reverse bridging. In forward bridge
         mode, PI7C9X110 has an x1 PCI Express upstream port and a 32-bit PCI downstream port. The 32-bit PCI
         downstream port is 66MHz capable (see figure 1-1). In reverse bridge mode, PI7C9X110 has a 32-bit PCI
         upstream port and an x1 PCI Express downstream port. PI7C9X110 configuration registers are backward
         compatible with existing PCI bridge software and firmware. No modification of PCI bridge software and firmware
         is needed for the original operation. The PCIe port of the PI7C9X110 bridge always has higher priority over the
         PCI ports if the configuration registers are accessed simultaneously via the PCIe and PCI ports.

         NAME              PIN ASSIGNMENT           TYPE  DESCRIPTION
         AD [31:0]         B3, A4, B4, D4, A5,        B   Address / Data: Multiplexed address and data bus. Address phase is aligned with
                           C5, D5, B6, A7, B7,            first clock of FRAME_L assertion. Data phase is aligned with IRDY_L or TRDY_L
                           D7, A8, C8, D8, B9,            assertion. Data is transferred on rising edges of FBCLKIN when both IRDY_L and
                           C9, C12, D14, D12,             TRDY_L are asserted. During bus idle (both FRAME_L and IRDY_L are de-
                           D11, E13, F14, F13,            asserted), PI7C9X110B drives AD to a valid logic level when arbiter is parking to
                           F11, G12, G11, H13,            PI7C9X110B on PCI bus.

         CBE [3:0]         C6, A10, C14, G14          B   Command / Byte Enables (Active LOW): Multiplexed command at address phase
                                                          and byte enable at data phase. During address phase, the initiator drives commands on
                                                          CBE [3:0] signals to start the transaction. If the command is a write transaction, the
                                                          initiator will drive the byte enables during data phase. Otherwise, the target will drive
                                                          the byte enables during data phase. During bus idle, PI7C9X110B drives CBE [3:0]
                                                          signals to a valid logic level when arbiter is parking to PI7C9X110B on PCI bus.
         PAR               B13                        B   Parity Bit: Parity bit is an even parity (i.e. even number of 1’s), which generates
                                                          based on the values of AD [31:0], CBE [3:0]. If PI7C9X110B is an initiator with a
                                                          write transaction, PI7C9X110B will tri-state PAR. If PI7C9X110B is a target and a
                                                          write transaction, PI7C9X110B will drive PAR one clock after the address or data
                                                          phase. If PI7C9X110B is a target and a read transaction, PI7C9X110B will drive
                                                          PAR one clock after the address phase and tri-state PAR during data phases. PAR is
                                                          tri-stated one cycle after the AD lines are tri-stated. During bus idle, PI7C9X110B
                                                          drives PAR to a valid logic level when arbiter is parking to PI7C9X110B on PCI bus.
         FRAME_L           B10                        B   FRAME (Active LOW): Driven by the initiator of a transaction to indicate the
                                                          beginning and duration an access. The de-assertion of FRAME_L indicates the final
                                                          data phase signaled by the initiator in burst transfers. Before being tri-stated, it is
                                                          driven to a de-asserted state for one cycle.

                                                    not de-asserted until the end of the data phase. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-
                                                    asserted state for one cycle.
         DEVSEL_L         B11                    B  Device Select (Active LOW): Asserted by the target indicating that the device is
                                                    accepting the transaction. As a master, PI7C9X110 waits for the assertion of this
                                                    signal within 5 cycles of FRAME_L assertion; otherwise, terminate with master
                                                    abort. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-asserted state for one cycle.
         STOP_L           A12                    B  STOP (Active LOW): Asserted by the target indicating that the target is requesting
                                                    the initiator to stop the current transaction. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-

         NAME             PIN ASSIGNMENT TYPE  DESCRIPTION
         TM2              K3                I  Mode Select 2: TM2 is a strapping pin. When TM2 is strapped low for normal
                                               operations and strapped high for testing functions. See table 3-1 for mode selection
                                               and 3-2 for strapping control for details.
         TM1              C1                I  Mode Select 1: Mode Selection Pin to select EEPROM or SM Bus. TM1=0 for
                                               EEPROM (I2C) support and TM1=1 for SM Bus support. TM1 is also a strapping
                                               pin. See table 3-1 mode selection and 3-2 for strapping control.
         TM0              D1                I  Mode Select 0: Mode Selection Pin to select transparent or non-transparent mode.
                                               TM0=0 for transparent bridge function mode and TM0=1 for non-transparent bridge
                                               function mode. TM0 is also a strapping pin. See table 3-1 for mode selection and 3-2
                                               for strapping control.
         MSK_IN           P14               I  Mask Input for CLKOUT: MSK_IN is used by PI7C9X110 to enable or disable the
                                               clock outputs. MSK_IN is also a strapping pin. When it is strapped to high, hot-plug
                                               is enabled. See table 3-2 for strapping control.
         REVRSB           M12               I  Forward or Reverse Bridging Pin: REVRSB pin controls the Forward

                                               CFN_L pin should be tied low. When it’s tied high, an external arbiter is required to
                                               arbitrate the bus. In external arbiter mode, REQ_L [0] is re-configured to be the
                                               secondary bus grant input, and GNT_L [0] is reconfigured to be the secondary bus
                                               request output. Also, REQ_L [5:2] and GNT_L [5:2] become GPI [3:0] and GPO
                                               [3:0] respectively if external arbiter is selected. CFN_L has a weak internal pull-down
                                               resistor. See table 3-1 for mode selection.

                                                                                                              PI7C9X110
3        MODE SELECTION AND PIN STRAPPING
3.1 FUNCTIONAL MODE SELECTION
       If TM2 is strapped to low, PI7C9X110 uses TM1, TM0, CFN_L, and REVRSB pins to select different modes of
       operations. These four input signals are required to be stable during normal operation. One of the sixteen
       combinations of normal operation can be selected by setting the logic values for the four mode select pins.
       For example, if the logic values are low for all four (TM1, TM0, CFN_L, and REVRSB) pins, the normal operation
       will have EEPROM (I2C) support in transparent mode with internal arbiter in forward bridge mode. The designated
       operation with respect to the values of the TM1, TM0, CFN_L, and REVRSB pins are defined on Table 3-1:

3.2 PIN STRAPPING
       If TM2 is strapped to high, PI7C9X110 uses TM1, TM0, and MSK_IN as strapping pins. The strapping functions
       are listed in Table 3-2 to show the states of operations during the PCI Express PERST_L de-assertion transition in
       forward bridge mode or PCI RESET_L de-assertion transition in reverse bridge mode.

4        FORWARD AND REVERSE BRIDGING
       PI7C9X110 supports forward or reverse and transparent or non-transparent combination modes of operation. For
       example, when PI7C9X110 is operating in forward (REVRSB=0) and non-transparent bridge mode (TM0=1) shown
       in Figure 4-1, its PCI Express interface is connected to a root complex and its PCI bus interface is connected to PCI
       devices. Another example, PI7C9X110 can be configured as a reverse (REVRSB=1) and transparent (TM0=0)
       bridge shown in Figure 4-2.
       The non-transparent bridge feature of PI7C9X110 allows the I/O Processor to be isolated from the Host Processor
       and its memory map which avoiding memory address conflict when both host and I/O processors are needed
       side-by-side.
       PCI based systems and peripherals are ubiquitous in the I/O interconnect technology market today. It will be a
       tremendous effort to convert existing PCI based products to be used in PCI Express systems. PI7C9X110 provides a
       solution to bridge existing PCI based products to the latest PCI Express technology.

Figure 4-1 Forward and Non-transparent Bridge Mode
       In reverse (REVRSB=1) and transparent (TM0=0) mode shown in Figure 3-2, PI7C9X110 becomes a PCI-to-PCI
       Express bridge that its PCI bus interface is connected to the host chipset between and the PCI Express x1 link. It
       enables the legacy PCI Host Systems to provide PCI Express capability.
       PI7C9X110 provides a solution to convert existing PCI based designs to adapt quickly into PCI Express base
       platforms. Existing PCI based applications will not have to undergo a complete re-architecture in order to interface
       to PCI Express technology.

                                                                                                           PI7C9X110
5        TRANSPARENT AND NON-TRANSPARENT BRIDGING
5.1 TRANSPARENT MODE
       In transparent bridge mode, base class code of PI7C9X110 is set to be 06h (bridge device). The sub-class code is set
       to be 04h (PCI-to-PCI bridge). Programming interface is 00h. Hence, PI7C9X110 is not a subtractive decoding
       bridge.
       PI7C9X110 has type-1 configuration header if TM0 is set to 0 (transparent bridge mode). These configuration
       registers are the same as traditional transparent PCI-to-PCI Bridge. In fact, it is backward compatible to the
       software that supporting traditional transparent PCI-to-PCI bridges. Configuration registers can be accessed from
       several different ways. For PCI Express access, PCI Express configuration transaction is in forward bridge mode.
       For PCI access, PCI configuration cycle is mainly in reverse bridge mode. However, PI7C9X110 allows PCI
       configuration access in forward mode as secondary bus configuration access. For I2C access, I2C bus protocol is
       used with EEPROM selected (TM1=0). For SM bus access, SM bus protocol is used with SM bus selected
       (TM1=1).
5.2 NON-TRANSPARENT MODE
       In non-transparent bridge mode, base class code of PI7C9X110 is set to be 06h (bridge device). The sub-class code
       is set to be 80h (other bridge). Programming interface is 00h. Hence, PI7C9X110 is not a subtractive decoding
       bridge.
       PI7C9X110 has type-0 configuration header if TM0 is set to 1 (non-transparent mode). The configuration registers
       are similar to a traditional PCI device. However, there is one set of configuration registers for the primary interface
       and another set of configuration registers for the secondary interface. In addition, CSRs (Control and Status
       Registers) are implemented to support the memory or IO transfers between the primary and secondary buses.
       The CSRs are accessed through memory transaction access within the lowest memory range of 4K Space (bit [64:12]
       are zeros). The non-transparent configuration registers can be accessed through several different ways (PCI Express,
       PCI, I2C, and SM bus). For PCI Express and PCI access, the type-0 configuration transactions need to be used. For
       I2C access, I2C bus protocol needs to be used through I2C bus interface. For SM bus access, SM bus protocol
       needs to be used through SM bus interface. The hardware pins (A2 and A1) are shared for I2C and SM bus
       interface. If TM1=0, pin A2 and A1 will be SCL and SDA for I2C interface respectively. If TM1=1, pin A2 and A1
       will be SMBCLK and SMBDATA for SM Bus interface respectively.
       In non-transparent bridge mode, PI7C9X110 supports four or three memory BARs (Base Address Registers) and
       one or two IO BARs (Base Address Registers) depending on selection on the primary bus. Also, PI7C9X110
       supports four or three memory BARs (Base Address Registers) and one or two IO BARs (Base Address Registers)
       depending on selection on the secondary bus.
       Offset 10h is defined to be primary CSR and downstream memory 0 BAR. Offset 14h is defined to be primary CSR
       and downstream IO BAR. Offset 18h is defined to be downstream memory 1 or IO BAR (selectable by CSR setup
       register). Offset 1Ch is defined to be downstream memory 2 BAR. Offset 20h and 24h are defined to be
       downstream memory 3 lower BAR and memory 3 upper BAR respectively to support 64-bit decoding.
       The direct offset translation of address from primary to secondary bus will be done by substituting the original Base
       Address at primary with the downstream Translation Base Address Register values and keeping the lower address
       bits the same to form a new address for forward the transaction to secondary bus.
       For downstream memory 2, it uses direct address translation. There is no lookup table for downstream memory
       address translation.

       Offset 50h is defined to be secondary CSR and upstream memory 0 BAR. Offset 54h is defined to be secondary
       CSR and upstream IO BAR. Offset 58h is defined to be upstream memory 1 or IO BAR (selectable by CSR setup
       register offset E4h). Offset 1Ch is defined to be upstream memory 2 BAR. Offset 60h and 64h are defined to be
       upstream memory 3 lower BAR and memory 3 upper BAR respectively to support 64-bit decoding.
       The direct offset translation of address from secondary to primary bus will be done by substituting the original Base
       Address at secondary with the upstream Translation Base Address Register values and keeping the lower address
       bits the same to form a new address for forward the transaction to primary bus.
       For upstream memory 2, it uses lookup table address translation method which using the original base address as
       index to select a new address on the upstream memory 2 lookup table based on the page and window size defined.

6        PCI EXPRESS FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
6.1 TLP STRUCTURE
       PCI Express TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) Structure is comprised of format, type, traffic class, attributes, TLP
       digest, TLP poison, and length of data payload.
       There are four TLP formats defined in PI7C9X110 based on the states of FMT [1] and FMT [0] as shown on Table
       6-1.
       Table 6-1 TLP Format
               FMT [1]               FMT [0]        TLP Format
                  0                     0           3 double word, without data
                  0                     1           4 double word, without data
                  1                     0           3 double word, with data
                  1                     1           4 double word, with data
       Data payload of PI7C9X110 can range from 4 (1DW) to 256 (64DW) bytes. PI7C9X110 supports three TLP
       routing mechanisms. They are comprised of Address, ID, and Implicit routings. Address routing is being used for
       Memory and IO requests. ID based (bus, device, function numbers) routing is being used for configuration requests.
       Implicit routing is being used for message routing. There are two message groups (baseline and advanced
       switching). The baseline message group contains INTx interrupt signaling, power management, error signaling,
       locked transaction support, slot power limit support, vendor defined messages, hot-plug signaling. The other is
       advanced switching support message group. The advanced switching support message contains data packet and
       signal packet messages. Advanced switching is beyond the scope of PI7C9X110 implementation.
       The r [2:0] values of the "type" field will determine the destination of the message to be routed. All baseline
       messages must use the default traffic class zero (TC0).
6.2 VIRTUAL ISOCHRONOUS OPERATION
       This section provides a summary of Virtual Isochronous Operation supported by PI7C9X110. Virtual Isochronous
       support is disabled by default. Virtual Isochronous feature can be turned on with setting bit [26] of offset 40h to one.
       Control bits are designated for selecting which traffic class (TC1-7) to be used for upstream (PCI Express-to-PCI).
       PI7C9X110 accepts only TC0 packets of configuration, IO, and message packets for downstream (PCI
       Express-to-PCI). If configuration, IO and message packets have traffic class other than TC0, PI7C9X110 will treat
       them as malformed packets. PI7C9X110 maps all downstream memory packets from PCI Express to PCI
       transactions regardless the virtual Isochronous operation is enabled or not.

                                                                                                             PI7C9X110
7        CONFIGURATION REGISTERS
       PI7C9X110 supports Type-0 (non-transparent bridge mode) and Type-1 (transparent bridge mode) configuration
       space headers and Capability ID of 01h (PCI power management) to 10h (PCI Express capability structure).
       With pin REVRSB = 0, device-port type (bit [7:4]) of capability register will be set to 7h (PCI Express-to-PCI
       bridge). When pin REVRSB = 1, device-port type (bit [7:4]) of capability register will be set to 8h (PCI-to-PCI
       Express bridge).
       PI7C9X110 supports PCI Express capabilities register structure with capability version set to 1h (bit [3:0] of offset
       02h).
       When pin TM0=0, PI7C9X110 will be in transparent bridge mode and the configuration registers for transparent
       bridge should be used.
       When pin TM0=1, PI7C9X110 will be in non-transparent bridge mode and the configuration registers for
       non-transparent bridge should be used.
7.1 CONFIGURATION REGISTER MAP
       PI7C9X110 supports capability pointer with (ID=07h), PCI power management (ID=01h), PCI bridge sub-system
       vendor ID (ID=0Dh), PCI Express (ID=10h), vital product data (ID=03h), and message signaled interrupt (ID=05h).
       Slot identification (ID=04h) is off by default and can be turned on through configuration programming.

9        CLOCK SCHEME
       PCI Express interface:
       PI7C9X110 requires 100MHz differential clock inputs through REFCLKP and REFCLKN Pins.
       PCI interface:
       PI7C9X110 requires PCI clock (up to 66MHz and at least 10MHz) to be connected to the CLKIN. PI7C9X110 uses
       the CLKIN and generates nine clock outputs, CLKOUT [8:0]. Also, PI7C9X110 requires one of the CLKOUT [8:0]
       (preferably CLKOUT [8]) to be connected to FBCLKIN for the PCI interface logic of PI7C9X110. The actual
       number of masters supported will vary depending on the loading of the PCI bus. Typically, PI7C9X110 can support
       up to four 66MHz PCI slots or eight 33MHz PCI slots.
       The PI7C9X110 PCI Clock Outputs, CLKOUT [8:0], can be enabled or disabled through the configuration register.

                                                                                                                     PI7C9X110
10       INTERRUPTS
       PI7C9X110 supports interrupt message packets on PCIe side. PI7C9X110 supports PCI interrupt (INTA, B, C, D)
       pins or MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) on PCI side. PCI interrupts and MSI are mutually exclusive. In order
       words, if MSI is enabled, PCI interrupts will be disabled. PI7C9X110 support 64-bit addressing MSI.
       In reverse bridge mode, PI7C9X110 maps the interrupt message packets to PCI interrupt pins or MSI if MSI is
       enable (see configuration register bit [16] of Offset F0h).
       In forward bridge mode, PI7C9X110 maps the PCI interrupts pins or MSI if enable on PCI side to interrupt message
       packets on PCIe side.
       There are eight interrupt message packets. They are Assert_INTA, Assert_INTB, Assert_INTC, Assert_INTD,
       Deassert_INTA, Deassert_INTB, Deassert_INTC, and Deassert_INTD. These eight interrupt messages are mapped
       to the four PCI interrupts (INTA, INTB, INTC, and INTD). See Table 10-1 for interrupt mapping information in
       reverse bridge mode. PI7C9X110 tracks the PCI interrupt (INTA, INTB, INTC, and INTD) pins and maps them to
       the eight interrupt messages. See Table 10-2 for interrupt mapping information in forward bridge mode.

                                                                                                 PI7C9X110
11       EEPROM (I2C) INTERFACE AND SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
11.1 EEPROM (I2C) INTERFACE
       PI7C9X110 supports EEPROM interface through I2C bus. In EEPROM interface, pin A2 is the EEPROM clock
       (SCL) and pin A1 is the EEPROM data (SDL). When TM2 is strapped to low, TM1 selects EEPROM interface or
       System Management Bus. To select EEPROM (I2C) interface, TM1 needs to be set to low. When EEPROM
       interface is selected, SCL is an output. SCL is the I2C bus clock to the I2C device. In addition, SDL is a
       bi-directional signal for sending and receiving data.
11.2 SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
       PI7C9X110 supports SM bus protocol if TM1=1 when TM2 is strapped to low. In addition, SMBCLK (pin A2) and
       SMBDAT (pin A1) are utilized as the clock and data pins respectively for the SM bus.
       When SM bus interface is selected, SMBCLK pin is an input for the clock of SM bus and SMBDAT pin is an open
       drain buffer that requires external pull-up resistor for proper operation.

                                                                                                       PI7C9X110
12       HOT PLUG OPERATION
       PI7C9X110 is not equipped with standard hot-plug controller (SHPC) integrated. However, PI7C9X110 supports
       hot-plug signaling messages and registers to simplify the implementation of hot-plug system.
       Using PI7C9X110 on motherboard:
                PI7C9X110 supports hot-plug on PCI bus if forward bridging is selected (REVRSB=0).
                PI7C9X110 supports hot-plug function on PCI Express bus when reverse bridge mode is selected
                 (REVRSB=1).
       Using PI7C9X110 on add-in card:
                PI7C9X110 supports hot-plug on PCI Express bus in forward bridge mode. Hot-plug messages will be
                 generated by PI7C9X110 based on the add-in card conditions.
                PI7C9X110 supports hot-plug function on PCI bus when reverse bridge mode is selected. PI7C9X110 will
                 tri-state the PCI bus when RESET is asserted. Also, PI7C9X110 will de-assert INTA_L if RESET is
                 asserted. The state machine of PI7C9X110 PCI bus interface will remain idle if the RESET is asserted.
                 After RESET is de-asserted, PI7C9X110 will remain in idle state until an address phase containing a valid
                 address for PI7C9X110 or its downstream devices.
                PI7C9X110 expects the REFCLK signal will be provided to its upstream PCI Express Port prior to the
                 de-assertion of RESET. The Downstream PCI Port of PI7C9X110 supports a range of frequency up to
                 66MHz.
                PI7C9X110 also supports subsystem vendor and subsystem ID. PI7C9X110 will ignore target response
                 while the bus is idle.
       PRSNT1# and PRSNT2# are not implemented on both PI7C9X110. The use of these two signals is mandatory on
       an add-in card in order to support hot-plug.

                                                                                                          PI7C9X110
13       RESET SCHEME
       PI7C9X110 requires the fundamental reset (PERST_L) input for internal logic when it is set as forward bridge
       mode. PI7C9X110 requires the PCI reset (RESET_L) input when it is set as reverse bridge mode. Also, PI7C9X110
       has a power-on-reset (POR) circuit to detect VDDCAUX power supply for auxiliary logic control.
              Cold Reset:
       A cold reset is a fundamental or power-on reset that occurs right after the power is applied to PI7C9X110 (during
       initial power up). See section 7.1.1 of PCI Express to PCI Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0 for details.
              Warm Reset:
       A warm reset is a reset that triggered by the hardware without removing and re-applying the power sources to
       PI7C9X110.
              Hot Reset:
       A hot reset is a reset that used an in-band mechanism for propagating reset across a PCIe link to PI7C9X110.
       PI7C9X110 will enter to training control reset when it receives two consecutive TS1 or TS2 order-sets with reset bit
       set.
              DL_DOWN Reset:
       If the PCIe link goes down, the Transaction and Data Link Layer will enter DL_DOWN status. PI7C9X110 discards
       all transactions and returns all logic and registers to initial state except the sticky registers.
       Upon receiving reset (cold, warm, hot, or DL_DOWN) on PCIe interface, PI7C9X110 will generate PCI reset
       (RESET_L) to the downstream devices on the PCI bus in forward bridge mode. The PCI reset de-assertion follows
       the de-assertion of the reset received from PCIe interface. The reset bit of Bridge Control Register may be set
       depending on the application. PI7C9X110 will tolerant to receive and process SKIP order-sets at an average interval
       between 1180 to 1538 Symbol Times. PI7C9X110 does not keep PCI reset active when VD33 power is off even
       though VAUX (3.3v) is supported. It is recommended to add a weak pull-down resistor on its application board to
       ensure PCI reset is low when VD33 power is off (see section 7.3.2 of PCI Bus Power management Specification
       Revision 1.1).
       In reverse bridge mode, PI7C9X110 generates fundamental reset (PERST_L) and then 1024 TS1 order-sets with
       reset bit set when PCI reset (RESET_L) is asserted to PI7C9X110. PI7C9X110 has scheduling skip order-set for
       insertion at an interval between 1180 and 1538 Symbol Times.
       PI7C9X110 transmits one Electrical Idle order-set and enters to Electrical Idle.

                                                                                                                    PI7C9X110
14       IEEE 1149.1 COMPATIBLE JTAG CONTROLLER
       An IEEE 1149.1 compatible Test Access Port (TAP) controller and associated TAP pins are provided to support
       boundary scan in PI7C9X110 for board-level continuity test and diagnostics. The TAP pins assigned are TCK, TDI,
       TDO, TMS and TRST_L. All digital input, output, input/output pins are tested except TAP pins.
       The IEEE 1149.1 Test Logic consists of a TAP controller, an instruction register, and a group of test data registers
       including Bypass and Boundary Scan registers. The TAP controller is a synchronous 16-state machine driven by the
       Test Clock (TCK) and the Test Mode Select (TMS) pins. An independent power on reset circuit is provided to
       ensure the machine is in TEST_LOGIC_RESET state at power-up. The JTAG signal lines are not active when the
       PCI resource is operating PCI bus cycles.
14.1 INSTRUCTION REGISTER
       PI7C9X110 implements a 5-bit Instruction register to control the operation of the JTAG logic. The defined
       instruction codes are shown in Table 14-1. Those bit combinations that are not listed are equivalent to the BYPASS
       (11111) instruction:

14.2 BYPASS REGISTER
       The required bypass register (one-bit shift register) provides the shortest path between TDI and TDO when a bypass
       instruction is in effect. This allows rapid movement of test data to and from other components on the board. This
       path can be selected when no test operation is being performed on the PI7C9X110.
14.3 DEVICE ID REGISTER
       This register identifies Pericom as the manufacturer of the device and details the part number and revision number
       for the device.

14.4 BOUNDARY SCAN REGISTER
       The boundary scan register has a set of serial shift-register cells. A chain of boundary scan cells is formed by
       connected the internal signal of the PI7C9X110 package pins. The VDD, VSS, and JTAG pins are not in the
       boundary scan chain. The input to the shift register is TDI and the output from the shift register is TDO. There are 4
       different types of boundary scan cells, based on the function of each signal pin.
       The boundary scan register cells are dedicated logic and do not have any system function. Data may be loaded into
       the boundary scan register master cells from the device input pins and output pin-drivers in parallel by the
       mandatory SAMPLE and EXTEST instructions. Parallel loading takes place on the rising edge of TCK.

       States with B0, B1, B2 and B3.
       During D3-hot state, the main power supplies of VDDP, VDDC, and VD33 can be turned off to save power while
       keeping the VDDAUX, VDDCAUX, and VAUX with the auxiliary power supplies to maintain all necessary
       information to be restored to the full power D0 state. PI7C9X110 has been designed to have sticky registers that are
       powered by auxiliary power supplies. PME_L pin allows PCI devices to request power management state changes.
       Along with the operating system and application software, PCI devices can achieve optimum power saving by using
       PME_L in forward bridge mode. PI7C9X110 converts PME_L signal information to power management messages
       to the upstream switches or root complex. In reverse bridge mode, PI7C9X110 converts the power management
       event messages from PCIe devices to the PME_L signal and continues to request power management state change
       to the host bridge.
       PI7C9X110 also supports ASPM (Active State Power Management) to facilitate the link power saving.
       PI7C9X110 supports Beacon generation but does not support WAKE# signal.

16       POWER SEQUENCING
       The PI7C9X110SL require two voltages: 3.3V I/O voltage and 1.8V core voltage. The 1.8V VDDCAUX is consider
       the same as core voltage, and can be combined as one. When designing the power supplies for PI7C9X110SL, the
       user can either apply ALL voltages at the same time, or turn on the higher voltage (3.3V) first, followed by the lower
       voltages (1.8V) within suggested limits. If all power rails are not applied at the same time, the PI7C9X110SL will
       not be damaged as long as 3.3V is applied either before or at the same time as 1.8V.
        During power cycle, if there is a delay in applying 1.8V core voltage after the 3.3V is applied, the internal logic
        might be placed in an unknown state if the power off period is not long enough to cause the device totally
        discharged. This condition in turn may produce undetermined I/O states on some pins. If the core logic is totally
        discharged before applying 3.3V, then all bi-directional I/O pins will stay at their default states.
        The typical time for PI7C9X110SL to discharge completely is less than 3 seconds, but in extreme cases this period
        can be as long as 50 seconds. Certain precautions should be made if the delay between 3.3V and 1.8V is larger than
        50ms. Figure 16-1 below shows the I/O timing sequence with undetermined I/O state, and Figure 16-2 shows the
        recommended power sequence timing.

16.1 INITIAL POWER-UP (G3 TO L0)
       As long as PERST# is active, all PCI Express functions are held in reset. The main supplies ramp up to their
       specified levels (3.3V and 12V). Sometime during this stabilization time, the REFCLK starts and stabilizes. After
       there has been time (T PVPERL) for the power and clock to become stable, PERST# is deasserted high and the PCI
       Express functions can start up.

       Note:
       1. Any supplied power is stable when it meets the requirements specified for that power supply.
       2. A supplied reference clock is stable when it meets the requirements specified for the reference clock. The PEREST# signal is asserted and
            de-asserted asynchronously with respect to the supplied reference clock.
       3. The PEREST# signal must be asserted within TFAIL of any supplied power going out specification.
       4. Measured from WAKE# assertion/de-assertion to valid input level at the system PM controller. Since WAKE# is an open-drain signal, the
            rise time is dependent on the total capacitance on the platform and the system board pull-up resistor. It is the responsibility of the system
            designer to meet the rise time specification.

       In order to support auxiliary power management fully, it is recommended to have VDDP and VDDAUX separated.
       By the same token, VD33/VDDC and VAUX/VDDCAUX need to be separated for auxiliary power management
       support. However, if auxiliary power management is not required, VD33 and VDDC can be connected to VAUX
       and VDDCAUX respectively.
       The typical power consumption of PI7C9X110 is about 1.0 watt.
       PI7C9X110 is capable of sustaining 2000V human body model for the ESD protection without any damages.
