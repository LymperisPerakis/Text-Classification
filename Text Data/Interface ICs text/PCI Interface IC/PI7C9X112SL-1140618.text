1        INTRODUCTION
         PI7C9X112SL is a PCIe-to-PCI bridge. PI7C9X112SL is compliant with the PCI Express Base Specification,
         Revision 1.1, the PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification, Revision 1.1, the PCI Local Bus
         Specification, Revision 3.0 and PCI Express to PCI Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0. PI7C9X112SL supports
         forward transparent mode operation. PI7C9X112SL has an x1 PCI Express upstream port and a 32-bit PCI
         downstream port. The 32-bit PCI downstream port is 66MHz capable (see figure 1-1). PI7C9X112SL
         configuration registers are backward compatible with existing PCI bridge software and firmware. No modification
         of PCI bridge software and firmware is needed for the original operation.

                                                          and byte enable at data phase. During address phase, the initiator drives commands on
                                                          CBE [3:0] signals to start the transaction. If the command is a write transaction, the
                                                          initiator will drive the byte enables during data phase. Otherwise, the target will drive
                                                          the byte enables during data phase. During bus idle, PI7C9X112SL drives CBE [3:0]
                                                          signals to a valid logic level when arbiter is parked to PI7C9X112SL on PCI bus.
         PAR               93                         B   Parity Bit: Parity bit is an even parity (i.e. even number of 1’s), which generates
                                                          based on the values of AD [31:0], CBE [3:0]. If PI7C9X112SL is an initiator with a
                                                          write transaction, PI7C9X112SL will tri-state PAR. If PI7C9X112SL is a target and
                                                          a write transaction, PI7C9X112SL will drive PAR one clock after the address or data
                                                          phase. If PI7C9X112SL is a target and a read transaction, PI7C9X112SL will drive
                                                          PAR one clock after the address phase and tri-state PAR during data phases. PAR is
                                                          tri-stated one cycle after the AD lines are tri-stated. During bus idle, PI7C9X112SL
                                                          drives PAR to a valid logic level when arbiter is parked to PI7C9X112SL on PCI bus.
         FRAME_L           66                         B   FRAME (Active LOW): Driven by the initiator of a transaction to indicate the
                                                          beginning and duration an access. The de-assertion of FRAME_L indicates the final

                                                          not de-asserted until the end of the data phase. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-
                                                          asserted state for one cycle.

                                        accepting the transaction. As a master, PI7C9X112SL waits for the assertion of this
                                        signal within 5 cycles of FRAME_L assertion; otherwise, terminate with master
                                        abort. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-asserted state for one cycle.
       STOP_L       95               B  STOP (Active LOW): Asserted by the target indicating that the target is requesting
                                        the initiator to stop the current transaction. Before tri-stated, it is driven to a de-
                                        asserted state for one cycle.
       LOCK_L       96               B  LOCK (Active LOW): Asserted by the initiator for multiple transactions to
                                        complete. PI7C9X112SL does not support any upstream LOCK transaction.

                                        access to bridge’s configuration space.
       PERR_L       92               B  Parity Error (Active LOW): Asserted when a data parity error is detected for data
                                        received on the PCI bus interface. Before being tri-stated, it is driven to a de-asserted
                                        state for one cycle.
       SERR_L       63              IOD System Error (Active LOW): Can be driven LOW by any device to indicate a
                                        system error. If SERR control is enabled, PI7C9X112SL will assert SERR_L.
                                             Address parity error
                                             Posted write data parity error on target bus
                                             Master abort during posted write transaction
                                             Target abort during posted write transaction

                                             Delayed transaction master timeout
                                             Errors reported from PCI Express port (advanced error reporting) in transparent
                                              mode.
                                        This signal is an open drain buffer that requires an external pull-up resistor for proper
                                        operation.
       REQ_L [3:0]  40, 38, 37, 35    I Request (Active LOW): REQ_L’s are asserted by bus master devices to request for
                                        transactions on the PCI bus. The master devices de-assert REQ_Ls for at least 2 PCI
                                        clock cycles before asserting them again. PI7C9X112SL does not support external
                                        arbitor.
                                        When powered up, if both REQ_L2 and REQ_L3 and pulled low (Active LOW) and
                                        stay low in normal operation, the PI7C9X112SL will change the function of
                                        CLKOUT[3]to CLKRUN and CLKOUT[2] to CLKREQ, respectively.

                                        signals are to be connected to an external demux (i.e. 74LVC138A) with GNT_[3]
                                        connected to E3; GNT_L[2] to A2; GNT_L[1] to A1 and GNT_L[0] to A0 and
                                        connect output pins of 74LVC138A to 8 PCI Master Devices.
       CLKOUT [3:0] 52,56,59,58      O  PCI Clock Outputs: PCI clock outputs are derived from the CLKIN and provide
                                        clocking signals to external PCI Devices.
       M66EN        103               I 66MHz Enable: This input is used to specify if Bridge is capable of running at
                                        66MHz. For 66MHz operation on the PCI bus, this signal should be pulled “HIGH”.
                                        For 33MHz operation on the PCI bus, this signal should be pulled LOW.
       RESET_L      49               B  RESET_L (Active LOW): When RESET_L active, all PCI signals should be
                                        asynchronously tri-stated.
       INTA_L       39              IOD Interrupt: Signals are asserted to request an interrupt. After asserted, it can be
       INTB_L       47                  cleared by the device driver. INTA_L, INTB_L, INTC_L, INTD_L signals are inputs
       INTC_L       62                  and asynchronous to the clock.

3        MODE SELECTION AND PIN STRAPPING
3.1      FUNCTIONAL MODE SELECTION
         PI7C9X112SL uses TM1 and TM0 pins to select different modes of operations. These two input signals are
         required to be stable during normal operation. One of the two combinations of normal operation can be selected
         by setting the logic values using the two mode select pins. For example, if the logic values are low for TM1 and
         TM0 pins, the normal operation will have EEPROM (I2C) support with internal arbiter. The designated operation
         with respect to the values of the TM1 and TM0 pins are defined on Table 3-1:
       Table 3-1 Mode Selection
              TM1              TM0                 Functional Mode

3.2      PIN STRAPPING
         If TM1 is strapped to low, PI7C9X112SL uses REQ_L[3:2] as the strapping pins during PCIe PERST# de-
         assertion to enable Clock Power Management feature.

4        FORWARD (PCIe to PCI) BRIDGING
       PI7C9X112SL supports forward mode operation. For example, when PI7C9X112SL is operating in forward PCIe
       Bridge, its PCI Express interface is connected to a root complex and its PCI bus interface is connected to PCI
       Master devices.
       PCI based systems and peripherals are ubiquitous in the I/O interconnect technology market today. It will be a
       tremendous effort to convert existing PCI based products to PCI Express systems. PI7C9X112SL provides the
       drop-in bridging solution to interface legacy PCI I/O Devices to PCI Express Root Complex.

4.1      TLP STRUCTURE
       PCI Express TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) Structure is comprised of format, type, traffic class, attributes, TLP
       digest, TLP poison, and length of data payload.
       There are four TLP formats defined in PI7C9X112SL based on the states of FMT [1] and FMT [0] as shown on
       Table 4-1.

       Data payload of PI7C9X112SL can range from 4 (1DW) to 256 (64DW) bytes. PI7C9X112SL supports three TLP
       routing mechanisms. They are comprised of Address, ID, and Implicit routings. Address routing is being used for
       Memory and IO requests. ID based (bus, device, function numbers) routing is being used for configuration requests.
       Implicit routing is being used for message routing. There are two message groups (baseline and advanced
       switching). The baseline message group contains INTx interrupt signaling, power management, error signaling,
       locked transaction support, slot power limit support, vendor defined messages, hot-plug signaling. The other is
       advanced switching support message group. The advanced switching support message contains data packet and
       signal packet messages. Advanced switching is beyond the scope of PI7C9X112SL implementation.
       The r [2:0] values of the "type" field will determine the destination of the message to be routed. All baseline
       messages must use the default traffic class zero (TC0).
4.2      VIRTUAL ISOCHRONOUS OPERATION
       This section provides a summary of Virtual Isochronous Operation supported by PI7C9X112SL. Virtual
       Isochronous support is disabled by default. Virtual Isochronous feature can be turned on with setting bit [26] of
       offset 40h to one. Control bits are designated for selecting which traffic class (TC1-7) to be used for upstream (PCI
       Express-to-PCI). PI7C9X112SL accepts only TC0 packets of configuration, IO, and message packets for
       downstream (PCI Express-to-PCI). If configuration, IO and message packets have traffic class other than TC0,
       PI7C9X112SL will treat them as malformed packets. PI7C9X112SL maps all downstream memory packets from
       PCI Express to PCI transactions regardless the virtual Isochronous operation is enabled or not.

5        CONFIGURATION REGISTER ACCESS
       PI7C9X112SL supports Type-0 and Type-1 configuration space headers and Capability ID of 01h (PCI power
       management) to 10h (PCI Express capability structure).
       With pin REVRSB = 0, device-port type (bit [7:4]) of capability register will be set to 7h (PCI Express-to-PCI).
       When pin REVRSB = 1, device-port type (bit [7:4]) of capability register will be set to 8h (PCI-to-PCI Express
       bridge).
       PI7C9X112SL supports PCI Express capabilities register structure with capability version set to 1h (bit [3:0] of
       offset 02h).
5.1      CONFIGURATION REGISTER MAP
       PI7C9X112SL supports capability pointer with PCI power management (ID=01h), PCI bridge sub-system vendor
       ID (ID=0Dh), PCI Express (ID=10h), vital product data (ID=03h), and message signaled interrupt (ID=05h). Slot
       identification (ID=04h) is off by default and can be turned on through configuration programming.

7        CLOCK SCHEME
       PCI Express interface:
       PI7C9X112SL requires 100MHz differential clock inputs through the pins of REFCLKP and REFCLKN.
       When the clock applied to PI7C9X112SLB and other end of the PCIe link are from the same clock source,
       The MSK_IN input should be kept unchanged before and after reset (PERST_L). Otherwise, the MSK_IN input
       should be different before and after the reset.
       PCI interface:
       PI7C9X112SL generates four clock outputs, from either external clock input (1MHz to 66MHz) at CLKIN or
       internal clock generator:
       PI7C9X112SL can use configuration control to enable or disable the secondary clock output: CLKOUT[3:0].
       PI7C9X112SL used either internally feedbacked clock from CLKOUT[0] or external clock input applied at
       CLKOUT[0], for internal secondary interface logic.
       For using internal clock source, the internal clock generator needs to be enabled with CLKIN driven high or low.
       CLKIN and M66EN signals become the selection for PCI Frequency at 50MHz/25MHz or 66MHz/33MHz.
       Frequency of PCI CLKOUT with internal clock source:
       CLKIN                M66EN                    PCI Clock
       0                    0                        33MHz
       0                    1                        66MHz
       1                    0                        25MHz
       1                    1                        50MHz
       The PI7C9X112SL PCI Clock Outputs, CLKOUT [3:0], can be enabled or disabled through the configuration
       register.
       PI7C9X112SL supports three different implementation of PCI clock.

                     o Internal feedback

     In this configuration, user simply connects the external clock source to CLKIN pin. And user needs to make sure
     the clock is preset (toggling) before the fundamental reset de-asserted (e.g. PERST_L). In this mode, the frequency
     is the same as the input clock source.

8        INTERRUPTS
       PI7C9X112SL supports interrupt message packets on PCIe side. PI7C9X112SL supports PCI interrupt (INTA, B, C,
       D) pins or MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts) on PCI side. PCI interrupts and MSI are mutually exclusive. In order
       words, if MSI is enabled, PCI interrupts will be disabled. PI7C9X112SL support 64-bit addressing MSI.
       PI7C9X112SL maps the PCI interrupts pins or MSI, if enabled, on PCI side to interrupt message packets on PCIe
       side.
       There are eight PCIe interrupt message packets. They are Assert_INTA, Assert_INTB, Assert_INTC, Assert_INTD,
       Deassert_INTA, Deassert_INTB, Deassert_INTC, and Deassert_INTD. PI7C9X112SL tracks the PCI interrupt
       (INTA, INTB, INTC, and INTD) pins and maps them to the eight PCIe interrupt messages. See Table 8-1 for
       interrupt mapping information.

9        EEPROM (I2C) INTERFACE AND SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
9.1      EEPROM (I2C) INTERFACE
       PI7C9X112SL supports EEPROM interface through I2C bus. In EEPROM interface, pin 3 is the EEPROM clock
       (SCL) and pin 4 is the EEPROM data (SDL). TM1 and TM0 are strapped accordingly to select EEPROM interface
       or System Management Bus. EEPROM (I2C) interface is enabled with TM1=0 and TM0=0. When EEPROM
       interface is selected , SCL is an output. SCL is the I2C bus clock to the I2C device. In addition, SDL is a bi-
       directional signal for sending and receiving data.
9.2      SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
       PI7C9X112SL supports SM bus protocol if TM1=0 and TM0=1. In addition, SMBCLK (pin 3) and SMBDAT (pin
       4) are utilized as the clock and data pins respectively for the SM bus.
       When SM bus interface is selected, SMBCLK pin is an input for the clock of SM bus and SMBDAT pin is an open
       drain buffer that requires external pull-up resistor for proper operation.

      PI7C9X112SL is not equipped with standard hot-plug controller (SHPC) integrated. However, PI7C9X112SL
      supports hot-plug signaling messages and registers to simplify the implementation of hot-plug system.
      Using PI7C9X112SL on motherboard:
              PI7C9X112SL supports hot-plug on PCI bus
      Using PI7C9X112SL on add-in card:
              PI7C9X112SL supports hot-plug on PCI Express bus. Hot-plug messages will be generated by
               PI7C9X112SL based on the add-in card conditions.
              PI7C9X112SL expects the REFCLK signal will be provided to its upstream PCI Express Port prior to the
               de-assertion of RESET. The Downstream PCI Port of PI7C9X112SL supports a range of frequency up to
               66MHz.
              PI7C9X112SL also supports subsystem vendor and subsystem ID. PI7C9X112SL will ignore target
               response while the bus is idle.
      PRSNT1# and PRSNT2# are not implemented on both PI7C9X112SL. The use of these two signals is mandatory
      on an add-in card in order to support hot-plug.

11      RESET SCHEME
      PI7C9X112SL requires the fundamental reset (PERST_L) input for internal logic. Also, PI7C9X112SL has a
      power-on-reset (POR) circuit to detect VDDCAUX power supply for auxiliary logic control.
            Cold Reset:
      A cold reset is a fundamental or power-on reset that occurs right after the power is applied to PI7C9X112SL (during
      initial power up). See section 7.1.1 of PCI Express to PCI Bridge Specification, Revision 1.0 for details.
            Warm Reset:
      A warm reset is a reset that triggered by the hardware without removing and re-applying the power sources to
      PI7C9X112SL.
            Hot Reset:
      A hot reset is a reset that used an in-band mechanism for propagating reset across a PCIe link to PI7C9X112SL.
      PI7C9X112SL will enter to training control reset when it receives two consecutive TS1 or TS2 order-sets with reset
      bit set.
            DL_DOWN Reset:
      If the PCIe link goes down, the Transaction and Data Link Layer will enter DL_DOWN status. PI7C9X112SL
      discards all transactions and returns all logic and registers to initial state except the sticky registers.
      Upon receiving reset (cold, warm, hot, or DL_DOWN) on PCIe interface, PI7C9X112SL will generate PCI reset
      (RESET_L) to the downstream devices on the PCI bus. The PCI reset de-assertion follows the de-assertion of the
      reset received from PCIe interface. The reset bit of Bridge Control Register may be set depending on the
      application. PI7C9X112SL will tolerant to receive and process SKIP order-sets at an average interval between 1180
      to 1538 Symbol Times. PI7C9X112SL does not keep PCI reset active when VD33 power is off even though VAUX
      (3.3v) is supported. It is recommended to add a weak pull-down resistor on its application board to ensure PCI reset
      is low when VD33 power is off (see section 7.3.2 of PCI Bus Power management Specification Revision 1.1).
      PI7C9X112SL transmits one Electrical Idle order-set and enters to Electrical Idle.

12      IEEE 1149.1 COMPATIBLE JTAG CONTROLLER
      An IEEE 1149.1 compatible Test Access Port (TAP) controller and associated TAP pins are provided to support
      boundary scan in PI7C9X112SL for board-level continuity test and diagnostics. The TAP pins assigned are TCK,
      TDI, TDO, TMS and TRST_L. All digital input, output, input/output pins are tested except TAP pins.
      The IEEE 1149.1 Test Logic consists of a TAP controller, an instruction register, and a group of test data registers
      including Bypass and Boundary Scan registers. The TAP controller is a synchronous 16-state machine driven by the
      Test Clock (TCK) and the Test Mode Select (TMS) pins. An independent power on reset circuit is provided to
      ensure the machine is in TEST_LOGIC_RESET state at power-up. The JTAG signal lines are not active when the
      PCI resource is operating PCI bus cycles.
12.1 INSTRUCTION REGISTER
      PI7C9X112SL implements a 5-bit Instruction register to control the operation of the JTAG logic. The defined
      instruction codes are shown in Table 14-1. Those bit combinations that are not listed are equivalent to the BYPASS
      (11111) instruction:

12.2 BYPASS REGISTER
      The required bypass register (one-bit shift register) provides the shortest path between TDI and TDO when a bypass
      instruction is in effect. This allows rapid movement of test data to and from other components on the board. This
      path can be selected when no test operation is being performed on the PI7C9X112SL.
12.3 DEVICE ID REGISTER
      This register identifies Pericom as the manufacturer of the device and details the part number and revision number
      for the device.

12.4 BOUNDARY SCAN REGISTER
      The boundary scan register has a set of serial shift-register cells. A chain of boundary scan cells is formed by
      connected the internal signal of the PI7C9X112SL package pins. The VDD, VSS, and JTAG pins are not in the
      boundary scan chain. The input to the shift register is TDI and the output from the shift register is TDO. There are 4
      different types of boundary scan cells, based on the function of each signal pin.
      The boundary scan register cells are dedicated logic and do not have any system function. Data may be loaded into
      the boundary scan register master cells from the device input pins and output pin-drivers in parallel by the
      mandatory SAMPLE and EXTEST instructions. Parallel loading takes place on the rising edge of TCK.

13      POWER MANAGEMENT
      PI7C9X112SL supports D0, D3-hot, D3-cold Power States. D1 and D2 states are not supported. The PCI Express
      Physical Link Layer of the PI7C9X112SL device supports the PCI Express Link Power Management with L0, L0s,
      L1, L2/L3 ready and L3 Power States. For the PCI Port of PI7C9X112SL, it supports the standard PCI Power
      Management States with B0, B1, B2 and B3.
      During D3-hot state, the main power supplies of VDDP, VDDC, and VD33 can be turned off to save power while
      keeping the VDDAUX, VDDCAUX, and VAUX with the auxiliary power supplies to maintain all necessary
      information to be restored to the full power D0 state. PI7C9X112SL has been designed to have sticky registers that
      are powered by auxiliary power supplies. PME_L pin allows PCI devices to request power management state
      changes. Along with the operating system and application software, PCI devices can achieve optimum power
      saving by using PME_L. PI7C9X112SL converts PME_L signal information to power management messages to
      the upstream switches or root complex.
      PI7C9X112SL also supports ASPM (Active State Power Management) to facilitate the link power saving.
      PI7C9X112SL supports beacon generation but does not support WAKE# signal during power management.

      In order to support auxiliary power management fully, it is recommended to have VDDP and VDDAUX separated.
      By the same token, VD33/VDDC and VAUX/VDDCAUX need to be separated for auxiliary power management
      support. However, if auxiliary power management is not required, VD33 and VDDC can be connected to VAUX
      and VDDCAUX respectively.
      The typical power consumption of PI7C9X112SL is less than 0.45 watt.
      PI7C9X112SL is capable of sustaining 1500V human body model for the ESD protection without any damages.
