   Tsi381 Evaluation Board Product Brief
High Performance
    In addition to low-latency operation and high throughput, the Tsi381
incorporates performance enhancing features, such as short-term
caching, that can provide a significant performance boost in many appli-
cations.
Transparent, Non-transparent, and Opaque
Bridging
    Transparent mode operation is available for efficient, flow through
configurations, while non-transparent bridging allows isolation between
the Tsi381’s PCIe and PCI domains. Non-transparent bridging also
enables multi-host systems and is used in applications such as intelli-
gent adapter cards. Opaque mode provides semi-transparent operation
for multi-processor configurations and enhanced private device support.
Typical Applications
    The Tsi381 is suited to applications that need to bridge PCIe to
downstream PCI devices. Its flexibility, high performance, small foot-
print, and low power consumption, make it ideal for a wide range of
applications, including:
     • Digital video recorders
     • Motherboards (server, SBC, industrial PC)
     • PC adapter cards (communications, graphics, imaging, and
       multimedia)
     • Multifunction printers
     • Line cards and NICs
