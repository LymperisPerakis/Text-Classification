registers are used to
translate addresses; doorbell registers are used to send
interrupts between the address domains; and scratchpad
registers (accessible by both CPUs) allow inter-
processor communication (see Figure 3).
Hot-Plug for High Availability
Hot plug capability allows users to replace hardware
modules and perform maintenance without powering
down the system. The PEX8714 Hot-Plug capability
feature makes it suitable for High Availability (HA)
applications. One downstream ports include a Standard
Hot Plug Controller. If the PEX8714 is used in an
application where one or more of its downstream ports
connect to PCI Express slots, each port’s Hot-Plug
Controller can be used to manage the Hot-Plug event of
its associated slot. Every port on the PEX8714 is
equipped with a Hot-Plug control/status register to
support Hot-Plug capability through external logic via
the I2C interface.
SerDes Power and Signal Management
The PEX8714 supports software control of the SerDes
outputs to allow optimization of power and signal
strength in a system. The PLX SerDes implementation
supports four levels of power – off, low, typical, and
high. The SerDes block also supports loop-back modes
