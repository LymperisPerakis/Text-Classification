SMBus Interface
    The PES6T5 contains two SMBus interfaces. The slave interface provides full access to the configuration registers in the PES6T5, allowing every
configuration register in the device to be read or written by an external agent. The master interface allows the default configuration register values of
the PES6T5 to be overridden following a reset with values programmed in an external serial EEPROM. The master interface is also used by an
external Hot-Plug I/O expander.
    Six pins make up each of the two SMBus interfaces. These pins consist of an SMBus clock pin, an SMBus data pin, and 4 SMBus address pins. In
the slave interface, these address pins allow the SMBus address to which the device responds to be configured. In the master interface, these
address pins allow the SMBus address of the serial configuration EEPROM from which data is loaded to be configured. The SMBus address is set up
on negation of PERSTN by sampling the corresponding address pins. When the pins are sampled, the resulting address is assigned as shown in
Table 1.

    As shown in Figure 3, the master and slave SMBuses may be used in a unified or split configuration. In the unified configuration, shown in Figure
3(a), the master and slave SMBuses are tied together and the PES6T5 acts both as a SMBus master as well as a SMBus slave on this bus. This
requires that the SMBus master or processor that has access to PES6T5 registers supports SMBus arbitration. In some systems, this SMBus master
interface may be implemented using general purpose I/O pins on a processor or micro controller, and may not support SMBus arbitration. To support
these systems, the PES6T5 may be configured to operate in a split configuration as shown in Figure 3(b).
    In the split configuration, the master and slave SMBuses operate as two independent buses and thus multi-master arbitration is never required.
The PES6T5 supports reading and writing of the serial EEPROM on the master SMBus via the slave SMBus, allowing in system programming of the
serial EEPROM.

Hot-Plug Interface
    The PES6T5 supports PCI Express Hot-Plug on each downstream port. To reduce the number of pins required on the device, the PES6T5 utilizes
an external I/O expander, such as that used on PC motherboards, connected to the SMBus master interface. Following reset and configuration, when-
ever the state of a Hot-Plug output needs to be modified, the PES6T5 generates an SMBus transaction to the I/O expander with the new value of all of
the outputs. Whenever a Hot-Plug input changes, the I/O expander generates an interrupt which is received on the IOEXPINTN input pin (alternate
function of GPIO) of the PES6T5. In response to an I/O expander interrupt, the PES6T5 generates an SMBus transaction to read the state of all of the
Hot-Plug inputs from the I/O expander.

General Purpose Input/Output
    The PES6T5 provides 11 General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins that may be used by the system designer as bit I/O ports. Each GPIO pin may
be configured independently as an input or output through software control. Some GPIO pins are shared with other on-chip functions. These alternate
functions may be enabled via software, SMBus slave interface, or serial configuration EEPROM.
Pin Description
    The following tables lists the functions of the pins provided on the PES6T5. Some of the functions listed may be multiplexed onto the same pin. The
active polarity of a signal is defined using a suffix. Signals ending with an “N” are defined as being active, or asserted, when at a logic zero (low) level.
All other signals (including clocks, buses, and select lines) will be interpreted as being active, or asserted, when at a logic one (high) level.

                    RSTHALT      I   Reset Halt. When this signal is asserted during a PCI Express fundamental
                                     reset, the PES6T5 executes the reset procedure and remains in a reset
                                     state with the Master and Slave SMBuses active. This allows software to
                                     read and write registers internal to the device before normal device opera-
                                     tion begins. The device exits the reset state when the RSTHALT bit is
                                     cleared in the PA_SWCTL register by an SMBus master.
                  SWMODE[2:0]    I   Switch Mode. These configuration pins determine the PES6T5 switch
                                     operating mode.
                                     0x0 - Normal switch mode
                                     0x1 - Normal switch mode with Serial EEPROM initialization
                                     0x2 - through 0xF Reserved
                     WAKEN     I/O   Wake Input/Output. The WAKEN signal is an input or output. The WAKEN
                                     signal input/output selection can be made through the WAKEDIR bit setting
                                     in the WAKEUPCNTL register.

                     Signal     Type                                 Name/Description
                   JTAG_TCK        I     JTAG Clock. This is an input test clock used to clock the shifting of data
                                         into or out of the boundary scan logic or JTAG Controller. JTAG_TCK is
                                         independent of the system clock with a nominal 50% duty cycle.
                    JTAG_TDI       I     JTAG Data Input. This is the serial data input to the boundary scan logic or
                                         JTAG Controller.
                   JTAG_TDO        O     JTAG Data Output. This is the serial data shifted out from the boundary
                                         scan logic or JTAG Controller. When no data is being shifted out, this signal
                                         is tri-stated.
                   JTAG_TMS        I     JTAG Mode. The value on this signal controls the test mode select of the
                                         boundary scan logic or JTAG Controller.
                 JTAG_TRST_N       I     JTAG Reset. This active low signal asynchronously resets the boundary
                                         scan logic and JTAG TAP Controller. An external pull-up on the board is
                                         recommended to meet the JTAG specification in cases where the tester
                                         can access this signal. However, for systems running in functional mode,
                                         one of the following should occur:
                                         1) actively drive this signal low with control logic
                                         2) statically drive this signal low with an external pull-down on the board

Pin Characteristics
      Note: Some input pads of the PES6T5 do not contain internal pull-ups or pull-downs. Unused inputs should be tied off to appropriate levels.
      This is especially critical for unused control signal inputs which, if left floating, could adversely affect operation. Also, any input pin left
      floating can cause a slight increase in power consumption.
                                                                                               I/O     Internal

            1. The JTAG specification, IEEE 1149.1, recommends that JTAG_TMS should be held at 1 while the signal applied at JTAG_TRST_N
            changes from 0 to 1. Otherwise, a race may occur if JTAG_TRST_N is deasserted (going from low to high) on a rising edge of JTAG_TCK
            when JTAG_TMS is low, because the TAP controller might go to either the Run-Test/Idle state or stay in the Test-Logic-Reset state.
            2. The values for this symbol were determined by calculation, not by testing.

Power-Up/Power-Down Sequence
   This section describes the sequence in which various voltages must be applied to the part during power-up to ensure proper functionality. For the
PES6T5, the power-up sequence must be as follows:
   1. VDDI/O — 3.3V
   2. VDDCore, VDDPE, VDDAPE — 1.0V
   3. VTTPE — 1.5V
   When powering up, each voltage level must ramp and stabilize prior to applying the next voltage in the sequence to ensure internal latch-up issues
are avoided. There are no maximum time limitations in ramping to valid power levels.
   The power-down sequence must be in the reverse order of the power-up sequence.
