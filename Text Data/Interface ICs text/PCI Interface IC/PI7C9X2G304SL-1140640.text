2 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Similar to the role o f PCI/PCIX Bridge in PCI/PCIX bus architecture, the function of PCI Express (PCIE) Switch is to
expand the connectivity to allow more end devices to be reached by host controllers in PCIE serial interconnect
architecture. The 4-lane PCIe Switch is in 3-port type configuration. It provides users the flexibility to expand or
fan-out the PCI Express lanes based on their application needs.
In the PCI Exp ress Architecture, the PCIE Switch forwards posted and non-posted requests, and completion packets
in either downstream or upstream direct ion concurrently as if a v irtual PCI Bridge is in operation on each port.
By visualizing the port as a virtual Bridge, the Switch can be logically viewed as two-level cascaded multip le virtual
PCI-to-PCI Bridges, where one upstream-port Bridge sits on all downstream-port Bridges. Similar to a PCI Bridge
during enumerat ion, each port is given a unique bus number, device nu mber, and function nu mber by the init iating
software. The bus number, device nu mber, and function number are co mb ined to form a destination ID for each
specific port. In addition to that, the memory-map and IO address ranges are exclusively allocated to each port as
well. After the software enumeration is finished, the packets are routed to the dedicated port based on the embedded
address or destination ID. To ensure the packet integrity during forward ing, the Switch is not allowed to split the
packets to mult iple s mall packets or merge the received packets into a large transmit packet. Also, the IDs of the
requesters and completers are kept unchanged along the path between ingress and egress port.
The Switch emp loys the architecture of Co mbined Input and Output Queue (CIOQ) in imp lementation.
The main reason for choosing CIOQ is that the required memo ry bandwidth of input queue equals to the bandwidth of
ingress port rather than increasing proportionally with port numbers as an output queue Switch does. The CIOQ at
each ingress port contains separate dedicated queues to store packets. The packets are arbitrated to the egress port
based on the PCIe transaction-ordering rule. For the packets without ordering information, they are permitted to pass
over each other in case that the addressed egress port is availab le to accept them. As to the packets required to follow
the ordering rule, the Head-Of-Line (HOL) issue becomes unavoidable for packets destined to different egress ports
since the operation of producer-consumer model has to be retained; otherwise the system might occur hang-up
problem. On the other hand, the Switch places replay buffer at each egress port to defer the packets before sending it
out. This can assure the maximu m throughput being achieved and therefore the Switch wo rks efficiently. Another
advantage of implement ing CIOQ in PCIe Switch is that the cred it announcement to the counterpart is simp lified and
streamlined because of the credit-based flow control protocol. The protocol requires that each ingress port maintains
the credits independently without checking other ports' credit availability, which is otherwise required by pure output
queue architecture.
The Switch supports two virtual channels (VC0, VC1) and eight traffic classes (TC0 ~ TC7) at each port.
The ingress port independently assigns packets into the preferred virtual channel while the egress port outputs the
packet based on the predefined port and VC arbitrat ion algorith m. For instance, the isochronous packet is given a
special traffic class number other than TC0 and mapped into VC1 accord ingly. By employing the strict time based
credit policy for port arbitrat ion and assigning higher priority to VC1 than VC0, the Switch can therefore guarantee
the time-sensitive packet is not blocked by regular traffic to assure the quality of service. In addit ion, some data-
centric applicat ions only carry TC0/ VC0 t raffic. As a result, there are no packets that would consume VC1 bandwidth.
In order to improve the efficiency of buffer usage, the unused VC1 queues can be reassigned to VC0 and enable each
of the ingress ports to handle more data traffic bursts. This virtual channel resource relocation feature enhances the
performance of the PCIe Switch further.
The Switch provides the advanced feature of Access Control Serv ice (A CS). This feature regulates which co mponents
are allowed to commun icate with each other within the PCIe mu ltip le-point fabric, and allows the system to have
more control over packet routing in the Switch. As a result, peer-to-peer traffic can be facilitated more accurately and
efficiently. When the system also implements Address Translation Service (ATS), the peer-to-peer requests with
translated address can be routed directly by enabling the corresponding option in ACS to avoid possible performance
bottleneck associated with re-direction, which introduces extra latency and may increase link and RC congestion.
The built-in Integrated Reference Clock Buffer of the PCI Exp ress Switch supports three reference clock outputs.
The clock buffer is fro m a single 100MHz clock input, and distributes the clock source to three outputs, which can be

3.2    PORT CONFIGURATION SIGNALS
         NAME                      PIN   TYPE DESCRIPTIO N
         VC1_EN               18            I Virtual Channel 1 Re source Sharing Enable: The chip provides the
                                              capability to support virtual channel 1 (VC1), in addition to the
                                              standard virtual channel 0. When this pin is asserted high, Virtual
                                              Channel 1 is enabled, and virtual channel resource sharing is not
                                              available. When it is asserted low, the chip would allocate the
                                              additional VC1 resource to VC0, and VC1 capability is disabled. T his
                                              pin has internal pull-down resistor. If no board trace is connected to
                                              this pin, the internal pull-down resistor of this pin is enough. However,
                                              if pin is connected to a board trace and not driven, it is recommended
                                              that an external 330-ohm pull-down resistor be used.
         RXPOLINV_DIS         24            I Rx Polarity Inversion Disable: When RXPOLINV_DIS is asserted
                                              high, it indicates to disable Rx Polarity Inversion detection function.
                                              Otherwise, it indicates to enable Rx Polarity Inversion detection
                                              function. This pin has internal pull-down resistor. If no board trace is
                                              connected to this pin, the internal pull-down resistor of this pin is
                                              enough. However, if pin is connected to a board trace and not driven, it
                                              is recommended that an external 330-ohm pull-down resistor be used.
         PL_512B              53            I Max. Payload Size 512B: When PL_512B is asserted high, it
                                              indicates the max. payload size capability is 512B. Otherwise, it
                                              indicates the max. Payload size is 256B. This pin has internal pull-
                                              down resistor. If no board trace is connected to this pin, the internal
                                              pull-down resistor of this pin is enough. However, if pin is connected
                                              to a board trace and not driven, it is recommended that an external 330-
                                              ohm pull-down resistor be used.
         PRSNT [2:1]           20, 19       I Pre sent: When PRSNT is asserted low, it indicates that the device is
                                              present in the slot of downstream port. Otherwise, it indicates the
                                              absence of the device. PRSNT[x] is correspondent to Port x, where
                                              x=1,2. T hese pins have internal pull-down resistors.
         SLOT CLK             33            I Slot Clock Configuration: It determines if the downstream
                                              component uses the same physical reference clock that the platform
                                              provides on the connector. When SLOT CLK is high, the platform
                                              reference clock is employed. By default, all downstream ports use the
                                              same physical reference clock provided by platform. T his pin has
                                              internal pull-down resistor. If no board trace is connected to this pin,
                                              the internal pull-down resistor of this pin is enough. However, if pin is
                                              connected to a board trace and not driven, it is recommended that an
                                              external 330-ohm pull-down resistor be used.
         SLOT _IMP[2:1]        46, 45       I Slot Implemented: T hese signals are asserted to indicate that the
                                              downstream ports are connected to slots. SLOT_IMP[x] corresponds to
                                              Portx, where x= 1,2. When SLOT _IMP[x] is asserted, the Portx is
                                              connected to slot. These pins have internal pull-down resistors. If no
                                              board trace is connected to these pins, the internal pull-down resistors
                                              of these pins are enough. However, if pins are connected to a board
                                              trace and not driven, it is recommended that external 330-ohm pull-
                                              down resistors be used.
         PORT ST ATUS[2:0]    69, 68, 67   O  Port Status: These signals indicate the status of each port. Please
                                              connect to pin header for debug used.
                                              PORT ST ATUS[x] is correspondent to Port x, where x=0, 1, 2.

5 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
Multiple virtual PCI-to-PCI Bridges (VPPB), connected by a virtual PCI bus, reside in the Switch. Each VPPB
contains the comp lete PCIe architecture layers that consist of the physical, data link, and transaction layer.
The packets entering the Switch via one of VPPBs are first converted from serial bit-stream into parallel bus signals in
physical layer, stripped off the link-related header by data link layer, and then relayed up to the transaction layer to
extract out the transaction header. According to the address or ID embedded in the transaction header, the entire
transaction packets are forwarded to the destination VPPB for formatting as a serial-type PCIe packet through the
transmit circuits in the data link layer and physical layer. The following sections describe these function elements for
processing PCIe packets within the Switch.
5.1     PHYSICAL LAYER CIRCUIT
The physical layer circu it design is based on the PHY Interface for PCI Exp ress Architecture (PIPE). It contains
Physical Media Attachment (PMA) and Physical Cod ing Sub-layer (PCS) b locks. PMA includes Serializer/
Deserializer (SERDES), PLL 1 , Clock Recovery module, receiver detection circuits, beacon transmitter, electrical idle
detector, and input/output buffers. PCS consists of framer, 8B/10B encoder/decoder, receiver elastic buffer, and PIPE
PHY control/status circuitries. To provide the flexib ility for port configuration, each lane has its own control and
status signals for MA C to access individually. In addition, a pair of PRBS generator and checker is included for PHY
built-in self test. The main functions of physical layer circuits include the conversion between serial-link and parallel
bus, provision of clock source for the Switch, resolving clock difference in receiver end, and detection of physical
layer errors.
In order to meet the needs of different application, the drive amp litude, de-emphasis and equalization of each
transmitting channels can be adjusted using EEPROM indiv idually. De-emphasis of -3.5 db is imp lemented by the
transmitters when full swing signaling is used, while an offset can be individually applied to each channel.
5.1.1 RECEIVER DETECTION
The physical layer circu its imp lement receiver detection, wh ich detects the presence of an attached 50 oh m to ground
termination as per PCI Express Specificat ion. The detect circuits determine if the voltage levels of the receiver have
crossed the internal threshold after a configurable time determined by the Receiver Detection Threshold field in the
PHY Parameter 2 Register (offset 7Ch, bit[6:4]), which can be configured by EEPROM or SMBUS settings.

5.1.5 DRIVE AMPLITUDE AND DE-EMPHASIS SETTINGS
Depending on the operation condition (voltage swing and de-emphasis condition), one of the Drive A mp litude Base
Level fields in the Switch Operation Mode Register (o ffset 74h) and one of the Drive De-Emphasis Base Level fields
in the PHY Parameter 1 Register (offset 7Ah) are active for configuration of the amplitude and de-emphasis.
The final drive amp litude and drive de-emphasis are the summation of the base level value and the offset value.
The offset value for drive amplitude is 25 mV pd, and 6.25 mV pd for drive de-emphasis.
The driver output waveform is the synthesis of amplitude and de-emphasis. The driver amplitude without de-emphasis
is specified as a peak differential voltage level (mVpd), and the driver de-emphasis modifies the driver amplitude.

5.1.8 TRANSMITTER ELECTRICAL IDLE LATENCY
After the last character of the PCI Express transmission, the output current is reduced, and a differential voltage of
less than 20 mV with co mmon mode of VTX-CM -DC is established within 20 UI. This delay time is programmab le
via Transmitter PHY Latency field in the PHY Parameter 2 Register (Offset 7Ch, bit[3:0]), wh ich can be configured
by EEPROM or SMBUS settings.
5.2       DATA LINK LAYER (DLL)
The Data Link Layer (DLL) provides a reliab le data transmission between two PCI Express points. An ACK/NA CK
protocol is emp loyed to guarantee the integrity of the packets delivered. Each Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) is
protected by a 32-bit LCRC for error detection. The DLL receiver performs LCRC calcu lation to determine if the
incoming packet is corrupted in the serial link. If an LCRC error is found, the DLL transmitter wou ld issue a NACK
data lin k layer packet (DLLP) to the opposite end to request a re-transmission, otherwise an A CK DLLP would be
sent out to acknowledge on reception of a good TLP.
In the transmitter, a retry buffer is implemented to store the transmitted TLPs whose corresponding ACK/NA CK
DLLP have not been received yet. When an ACK is received, the TLPs with sequence number equals to and smaller
than that carried in the ACK wou ld be flushed out from the buffer. If a NA CK is received or no ACK/NA CK is
returned fro m the link partner after the replay timer expires, then a replay mechanism built in DLL transmitter is

                                                                                               PI7C9X2G304SL
triggered to re-t ransmit the corresponding packet that receives NACK or time-out and any other TLP t ransmitted after
that packet.
Meanwhile, the DLL is also responsible for the initialization, updating, and mon itoring o f the flow-control cred it. A ll
of the flow control informat ion is carried by DLLP to the other end of the lin k. Unlike TLP, DLLP is guarded by 16-
bit CRC to detect if data corruption occurs.
In addition, the Media Access Control (MAC) block, wh ich is consisted of LTSSM , mult iple lanes de-skew,
scrambler/de-scramb ler, clock correct ion fro m inserting skip order-set, and PIPE-related control/status circuits, is
implemented to interface physical layer with data link layer.
5.3      TRANSACTION LAYER RECEIVE BLOCK (TLP DECAPSULATION)
The receiving end of the transaction layer performs header info rmation retrieval and TC/ VC mapp ing (see section 5.5),
and it validates the correctness of the transaction type and format. If the TLP is found to contain an illegal header or
the indicated packet length mismatches with the actual packet length, then a Malformed TLP is reported as an error
associated with the receiving port. To ensure end-to-end data integrity, a 32-bit ECRC is checked against the TLP at
the receiver if the digest bit is set in header.
5.4      ROUTING
The transaction layer implements three types of routing protocols: ID-based, address-based, and implicit routing. For
configuration reads, configuration writes, transaction completion, and user-defined messages, the packets are routed
by their destination ID constituted of bus number, device nu mber, and function number. Address routing is emp loyed
to forward I/O or memory transactions to the destination port, which is located within the address range indicated by
the address field carried in the packet header. The packet header indicates the packet types including memory read,
memo ry write, IO read, IO write, Message Signaling Interrupt (M SI) and user-defined message. Implicit routing is
mainly used to forward system message transactions such as virtual interrupt line, power management, and so on.
The message type embedded in the packet header determines the routing mechanism.
If the inco ming packet cannot be forwarded to any other port due to a miss to hit the defined address range or targeted
ID, this is considered as Unsupported Request (UR) packet, which is similar to a master abort event in PCI protocol.
5.5      TC/VC MAPPING
The 3-bit TC field defined in the header identifies the traffic class of the incoming packets. To enable the differential
service, a TC/ VC mapping table at destination port that is pre-programmed by system software or EEPROM pre-load
is utilized to cast the TC labeled packets into the desired virtual channel. Note that TC0 t raffic is mapped into VC0
channel by default. After the TC/ VC mapping, the receive block d ispatches the incoming request, comp letion, o r data
into the appropriate VC0 and VC1 queues.
5.6      QUEUE
In PCI Exp ress, it defines six different packet types to represent request, completion, and data. They are respectively
Posted Request Header (PH), Posted Request Data payload (PD), Non-Posted Request Header (NPH), Non-Posted
Data Payload (NPD), Co mpletion Header (CPLH) and Co mp letion Data payload (CPLD). Each packet with different
type would be put into a separate queue in order to facilitate the fo llo wing ordering processor. Since NPD usually
contains one DW, it can be merged with the corresponding NPH into a co mmon queue named NPHD. Except NPHD,
each virtual channel (VC0 or VC1) has its own corresponding packet header and data queue. When only VC0 is

needed in some applications, VC1 can be disabled and its resources assigned to VC0 by asserting VC1_EN (Virtual
Channel 1 Enable) to low.
5.6.1      PH
PH queue provides TLP header spaces for posted memory writes and various message request headers. Each header
space occupies sixteen bytes to accommodate 3 DW o r 4 DW headers. There are two PH queues for VC0 and VC1
respectively.
5.6.2      PD
PD queue is used for storing posted request data. If the received TLP is of the posted request type and is determined to
have payload coming with the header, the payload data would be put into PD queue. There are two PD queues for
VC0 and VC1 respectively.
5.6.3 NPHD
NPHD queue provides TLP header spaces for non-posted request packets, which include memory read, IO read, IO
write, configuration read, and configuration write. Each header space takes twenty bytes to accommodate a 3-DW
header, s 4-DW header, s 3-WD header with 1-DW data, and a 4-DW header with 1-DW data. There is only one
NPHD queue for VC0, since non-posted request cannot be mapped into VC1.
5.6.4 CPLH
CPLH queue provides TLP header space for completion packets. Each header space takes twelve bytes to
accommodate a 3-DW header. Please note that there are no 4-DW comp letion headers. There are two CPLH queues
for VC0 and VC1 respectively.
5.6.5 CPLD
CPLD queue is used for storing complet ion data. If the received TLP is of the complet ion type and is determined to
have payload coming with the header, the payload data would be put into CPLD queue. There are two CPLD queues
for VC0 and VC1 respectively.
5.7      TRANSACTION ORDERING
Within a VPPB, a set of o rdering rules is defined to regulate the transactions on the PCI Express Switch including
Memory, IO, Configurat ion and Messages, in order to avoid deadlocks and to support the Producer-Consumer model.
The ordering rules defined in table 5-4 apply within a single Traffic Class (TC). There is no ordering requirement
among transactions within different TC labels. Since the transactions with the same TC label are not allowed to map
into different virtual channels, it implies no ordering relationship between the traffic in VC0 and VC1.

       Completion
1. When the Relaxed Ordering Attribute bit is cleared, the Posted Request transactions including memory write and
message request must complete on the egress bus of VPPB in the order in which they are received on the ingress bus
of VPPB. If the Relaxed Ordering Attribute bit is set, the Posted Request is permitted to pass over other Posted
Requests occurring before it.
2. A Read Request transmitting in the same d irection as a previously queued Posted Request transaction must push
the posted write data ahead of it. The Posted Request transaction must complete on the egress bus before the Read
Request can be attempted on the egress bus. The Read transaction can go to the same location as the Posted data.
Therefore, if the Read transaction were to pass the Posted transaction, it would return stale data.
3. When the Relaxed Ordering Attribute bit is cleared, a Read co mpletion must ‘‘pull’’ ahead of previously queued
posted data transmitting in the same d irect ion. In this case, the read data transmits in the same d irection as the posted
data, and the requestor of the read transaction is on the same side of the VPPB as the completer of the posted
transaction. The posted transaction must deliver to the completer before the read data is returned to the requestor. If
the Relaxed Ordering Attribute bit is set, then a read co mplet ion is permitted to pass a previously queued Memory
Write or Message Request.
4. Non-Posted Write Co mplet ions are permitted to pass a previous Memory Write or Message Request transaction.
Such transactions are actually transmitting in the opposite directions and hence have no ordering relationship.
5. Posted Request transactions must be given opportunities to pass Non-posted Read and Write Requests as well as
Co mplet ions. Otherwise, deadlocks may occur when some older bridges, which do not support delayed transactions
are mixed with PCIe Switch in the same system. A fairness algorithm is used to arbitrate between the Posted Write
queue and the Non-posted transaction queue
5.8     PORT ARBITRATION
Among mult iple ingress ports, the port arbitration built in the egress port determines which inco ming packets to be
forwarded to the output port. The arbitration algorith m contains hardware fixed Round Robin, 128-phase Weighted
Round-Robin and programmab le 128-phase time-based WRR. The port arb itration is held within the same VC
channel. It means that each port has two port arbitration circuitries for VC0 and VC1 respectively. At the upstream
ports, in addition to the inter-port packets, the intra-port packet such as configurations completion would also jo in the
arbitration loop to get the service from Virtual Channel 0.
5.9     VC ARBITRATION
After port arb itration, VC arbit ration is executed among different VC channels within the same source. Three
arbitration algorith ms are provided to choose the appropriate VC: Strict Priority, Round Robin o r Weighted Round
Robin.
5.10 FLOW CONTROL
PCI Express employs Credit-Based Flo w Control mechanis m to make buffer utilization more efficient.
The transaction layer transmitter ensures that it does not transmit a TLP to an opposite receiver unless the receiver has
enough buffer space to accept the TLP. The transaction layer receiver has the responsibility to advertise the free buffer
space to an opposite transmitter to avoid packet stale. In this Switch, each port has its own separate queues for
different traffic types and the credits are sent to data link layer on the fly. The data lin k layer co mpares the current

                                                                                                PI7C9X2G304SL
available credits with the monitored ones and reports the updated credit to the counterpart. If no new credit is acquired,
the credit reported is scheduled for every 30 us to prevent the lin k fro m entering retrain. On the other hand, the
receiver at each egress port gets the usable credits fro m the opposite end in a link. The output port broadcasts them to
all the other ingress ports to get packet transmission.
5.11 TRANSATION LAYER TRANSMIT BLOCK (TLP ENCAPSULATION)
The transmit portion of transaction layer performs the following functions. They construct the all types of forwarded
TLP generated fro m VC arbiter, respond with the co mp letion packets when the local resource (i.e. configuration
register) is accessed, and regenerate the message that terminates at receiver to RC if acting as an upstream port.
5.12 Access Control Service
Traditionally, the packet routing between the peer-to-peer downstream ports is determined by either the address or ID
field embedded in the packet header. ACS provides a mechanism for customer to selectively control access between
PCI Exp ress Endpoints attached to the downstream ports of packet switch. If ACS is enabled in the ingress port, the
peer-to-peer packet forwarding will follow the ru le sets of ACS rather than the destination ID or address. ACS is
implemented as a set of capabilities and control registers in the associated hardware co mponent. It brings the
following benefits such as preventing the silent data corruption presented in Requests from being incorrectly routed to
a peer Endpoint, validating every Request transaction between two downstream components and enabling direct
routing of peer-to-peer Memory Requests whose addresses have been Translated when ATS system is being used.

6 EEPROM INTERFACE AND SYSTEM MANAGEMENT BUS
The EEPROM interface consists of two pins: EECLK (EEPROM clock output) and EEPD (EEPROM bi-d irectional
serial data). The Switch may control an ISSI IS24C04 o r co mpatib le parts using into 512x8 bits. The EEPROM is
used to init ialize a nu mber of reg isters before enumerat ion. Th is is acco mplished after PRST# is de-asserted, at which
time the data fro m the EEPROM is loaded. The EEPROM interface is organized into a 16-bit base, and the Switch
supplies a 7-bit EEPROM word address. The Switch does not control the EEPROM address input. It can only access
the EEPROM with address input set to 0.
The System Management Bus interface consists of two pins: SM BCLK (System Management Bus Clock input) and
SMBDATA (System Management Bus Data input/ output).
6.1     EEPROM INTERFACE
6.1.1 AUTO MODE EERPOM ACCESS
The Switch may access the EEPROM in a WORD format by utilizing the auto mode through a hardware sequencer.
The EEPROM start-control, address, and read/write commands can be accessed through the configuration register.
Before each access, the software should check the Autoload Status bit before issuing the next start.
6.1.2 EEPROM MODE AT RESET
During a reset, the Switch will automat ically load the information/data fro m the EEPROM if the auto matic load
condition is met. The first offset in the EEPROM contains a signature. If the signature is recognized, the autoload
initiates right after the reset.
During the autoload, the Bridge will read sequential wo rds from the EEPROM and write to the appropriate registers.
Before the Bridge registers can be accessed through the host, the autoload condition should be verified by reading b it
[3] offset DCh (EEPROM Autoload Status). The host access is allowed only after the status of this bit is set to '0'
which indicates that the autoload initialization sequence is complete.

6.2     SMBus INTERFACE
The PI7C9X2G304SL p rovides the System Management Bus (SMBus), a two-wire interface through which a simp le
device can co mmunicate with the rest of the system. The SM Bus interface on the PI7C9X2G304SL is a bi-d irectional
slave interface. It can receive data fro m the SMBus master or send data to the master. The interface allows full access
to the configuration registers. A SMBus master, such as the processor or other SMBus devices, can read or write to
every RW configuration register (read/write register). In addition, the RO and HwInt registers (read-only and
hardware in itialized registers) that can be auto-loaded by the EEPROM interface can also be read and written by the
SMBus interface. This feature allows increases in the system expandability and flexibility in system implementation.

The SM Bus interface on the PI7C9X2G304SL consists of one SMBus clock pin (SMBCLK), a SM Bus data pin
(SM BDATA), and 3 SM Bus address pins (GPIO[5:7]). The SM Bus clock pin provides or receives the clock signal.
The SM Bus data pin facilitates the data transmission and reception. Both of the clock and data pins are b i-directional.
The SMBus address pins determine the address to which the PI7C9X2G304SL responds to. The SMBus address pins
generate addresses according to the following table:

Other than the PCI 2.3 co mpatible configuration space header, the Switch also imp lements PCI exp ress extended
configuration space header, wh ich includes advanced error reporting, v irtual channel, and power budgeting capability
registers. The follo wing table details the allocation of the register fields of PCI express extended capability space
header. The first extended capability always begins at offset 100h with a PCI Exp ress Enhanced Capability header and
the rest of capabilities are located at an offset greater than 0FFh relative to the beginning of PCI co mpatib le
configuration space.

The Port arb itration table is a read-write register array that contains a table for Port arb itration. Each table entry
allocates two bits to represent Port Nu mber. The table entry size is dependent on the number of enabled ports (refer to
bit 10 and 11 of Port VC capability register 1). The arb itration table contains 128 entries if three or four ports are to be
enabled. The following table shows the register array layout for the size of entry equal to two.

8      CLOCK SCHEME
The built-in Integrated Reference Clock Buffer of the PI7C9X2G304SL supports three reference clock outputs.
The clock buffer feature can be enabled and disabled by strapping the CLKBUF_PD pin.
When CLKBUF_PD p in is asserted low, the clock buffer is enabled. The clock buffer distributes a single 100M Hz
reference clock input to three Reference Clock Output Pairs, REFCLKO_P[2:0] and REFCLKO_N[2:0]. The clock
buffer requires 100MHz differential clock inputs through REFCLKI_P and REFCLKI_N Pins as show in the
following table.
When CLKBUF_PD p in is asserted high, the clock buffer is in power down mode and disabled. The 100M Hz
Reference Clock Output Pairs are disabled, and The PI7C9X2G304SL requires 100M Hz d ifferential clock inputs
through REFCLKP and REFCLKN Pins as shown in the following table.

9 IEEE 1149.1 COMPATIBLE JTAG CONTROLLER
An IEEE 1149.1 co mpatib le Test Access Port (TAP) controller and associated TAP pins are provided to support
boundary scan in PI7C9X2G304SL for board-level continuity test and diagnostics. The TAP pins assigned are TCK,
TDI, TDO, TMS and TRST_L. All digital input, output, input/output pins are tested except TAP pins.
9.1    INSTRUCTION REGISTER
The IEEE 1149.1 Test Logic consists of a TAP controller, an instruction register, and a group of test data registers
including Bypass and Boundary Scan registers. The TAP controller is a synchronous 16-state mach ine driven by the
Test Clock (TCK) and the Test Mode Select (TMS) pins. An independent power on reset circuit is provided to ensure
the machine is in TEST_LOGIC_ RESET state at power-up.
PI7C9X2G304SL implements a 5-bit Instruction register to control the operation of the JTAG logic. The defined
instruction codes are shown in the following table. Those bit combinations that are not listed are equivalent to the
BYPASS (11111) instruction.

9.2    BYPASS REGISTER
The required bypass register (one-bit shift register) provides the shortest path between TDI and TDO when a bypass
instruction is in effect. This allows rapid movement of test data to and from other co mponents on the board. This path
can be selected when no test operation is being performed on the PI7C9X2G304SL.
9.3    DEVICE ID REGISTER
This register identifies Perico m as the manufacturer o f the device and details the part nu mber and rev ision number for
the device.

9.4     BOUNDARY SCAN REGISTER
The boundary scan register has a set of serial shift-register cells. A chain of boundary scan cells is formed by
connected the internal signal of the PI7C9X2G304SL package pins. The VDD, VSS, and JTA G pins are not in the
boundary scan chain. The input to the shift register is TDI and the output from the shift register is TDO. There are 4
different types of boundary scan cells, based on the function of each signal pin.
The boundary scan register cells are dedicated logic and do not have any system function. Data may be loaded into the
boundary scan register master cells fro m the device input pins and output pin-drivers in parallel by the mandatory
SAMPLE and EXTEST instructions. Parallel loading takes place on the rising edge of TCK.

10 POWER MANAGEMENT
The PI7C9X2G304SL supports D0, D1, D2, D3-hot, and D3-cold Power States. The PCI Express Physical Link Layer
of the PI7C9X2G304SL device supports the PCI Express Link Power Management with L0, L0s, L1, L2/L3 ready
and L3 Power States.
During the transition fro m D3-hot to D3-cold state, the main power supplies of VDDC and VDDR are turned off to
save power wh ile keeping the VDDCAUX and VA UX with the au xiliary power supplies to maintain all necessary
informat ion to be restored to the full power D0 state. PI7C9X2G304SL has been designed to have sticky registers that
are powered by au xiliary power supplies. PI7C9X2G304SL forwards power management messages to the upstream
Switches or root complex.
PI7C9X2G304SL also supports ASPM (Active State Power Management) to facilitate the link power saving.

11 POWER SEQUENCE
As long as PERST# is active, all PCI Exp ress functions are held in reset. The main supplies ramp up to their specified
levels (3.3V). So met ime during this stabilization time, the REFCLK starts and stabilizes. A fter there has been time
(100 ms) for the power and clock to beco me stable, PERST# is deasserted high and the PCI Exp ress functions can
start up.
It is recommended to power up the I/O voltage (3.3V) first and then the core voltage (1.0V) or power up I/O voltage
and core voltage simultaneously for both Aux and Main power rails.

       Note :
       1. In order to support auxiliary power management fully, it is recommended to have VDDC and VDDCAUX
           separated.
       2. T he min. value for PERST_L Slew Rate is 50 mV/ns, which translates to the requirement that the time for
           PERST _L from 0V to 3.3V should be less than 66 ns.
