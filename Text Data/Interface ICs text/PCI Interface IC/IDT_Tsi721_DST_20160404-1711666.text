About this Document
            Topics discussed include the following:
            • Overview
            • Document Conventions
            • Revision History
      Overview
            The Tsi721 Datasheet provides signal, electrical, and packaging information about the Tsi721. It is intended for hardware
            engineers who are designing system interconnect applications with the device.
      Document Conventions
            This document uses the following conventions.
            Non-differential Signal Notation
            Non-differential signals are either active-low or active-high. An active-low signal has an active state of logic 0 (or the lower
            voltage level), and is denoted by a lowercase “n”. An active-high signal has an active state of logic 1 (or the higher voltage
            level), and is not denoted by a special character. The following table illustrates the non-differential signal naming convention.
                       State              Single-line signal           Multi-line signal
                    Active low                  NAMEn                     NAMEn[3]
                    Active high                  NAME                      NAME[3]
            Differential Signal Notation
            Differential signals consist of pairs of complement positive and negative signals that are measured at the same time to
            determine a signal’s active or inactive state (they are denoted by “_p” and “_n”, respectively). The following table illustrates the
            differential signal naming convention.
                       State              Single-line signal           Multi-line signal
                     Inactive                NAME_p = 0                 NAME_p[3] = 0
                                             NAME_n = 1                 NAME_n[3] = 1
                      Active                 NAME_p = 1                NAME_p[3] is 1
                                             NAME_n = 0                NAME_n[3] is 0

             • Features
             • Block Diagram
             • Typical Applications
1.1          Overview
             IDT is the leading supplier of RapidIO® and PCI Express Interconnect solutions, providing a broad portfolio of switches,
             bridges, IP, and development platforms for defense aerospace, video, imaging, and wireless markets. The Tsi721 is IDT's
             solution for hardware-based PCIe Gen2 to RapidIO Gen2 protocol conversion in a bridging device.
             The Tsi721 converts transactions from PCIe to RapidIO, and vice versa, and provides full line rate bridging at 20 Gbaud. Using
             the Tsi721, designers can develop heterogeneous systems that leverage the peer-to-peer networking performance of RapidIO
             while using multiprocessor clusters that may be only PCIe enabled. In addition, applications that require large amounts of data
             transferred efficiently without processor involvement can be executed using the full line rate of the Tsi721’s Block DMA Engine
             and Messaging Engine.
             Key to the Tsi721 is the hardware bridging functionality that converts PCIe transactions to RapidIO, and vice versa. The Tsi721
             supports PCIe non-transparent bridging for transaction mapping. The device has both RapidIO and PCIe endpoints embedded
             in the bridge, and each of its Block DMA/Messaging DMA channels can buffer up to 8 KB of data on the PCIe side.
1.2          Features
             The Tsi721 supports the following features.
1.2.1        PCIe Features
             • PCIe 2.1 standard compliant

             Three of Tsi721’s typical applications – defense/aerospace, video/imaging, and wireless – are discussed in the following
             sections.
1.4.1        Defense/Aerospace Application
             In defense applications, the Tsi721 supports the use of PCIe enabled x86 processors to RapidIO backplanes. This provides
             system designers with the best of both worlds: the floating point and MIPs horsepower of the latest generation of x86 solutions,
             with the superior peer-to-peer networking performance of RapidIO architectures.
             By using the Tsi721 combined with IDT’s RapidIO Gen2 switches, payload processor cards with x86 processors can be used
             with existing RapidIO 1.3 backplanes operating at up to 3.125 Gbaud, or the same card can be used with RapidIO Gen2
             compatible backplanes operating at 5 Gbaud.

1.4.2        Video and Imaging Application
             In video and imaging applications, system designers need to cluster large numbers of DSPs or FPGAs to perform
             encoding/decoding/trans coding, or do FFTs (Fast Fourier Transform) on large arrays of data. The RapidIO protocol is optimal
             for this DSP/FPGA cluster requirement. However, the analog front-end to the system is usually a sensor with streaming data
             terminated in an FPGA (for example, a camera subsystem). This is usually in an PCIe network, often with a PC back-end. In
             these applications the designer needs to bridge between a PCIe network and the RapidIO DSP/FPGA cluster. The Tsi721 is
             ideal for this application.

1.4.3        Wireless Application
             In wireless base stations, the incumbent interconnect technology in the baseband processing cards – LTE, WiMAX, WCDMA,
             and TD-SCDMA – is RapidIO. RapidIO connects a cluster of DSPs, processor, and FPGA, locally on the baseband processor
             for MAC and PHY layer processing. However, the LTE standard pushes the performance available in existing RapidIO enabled
             microprocessors.
             The Tsi721 provides wireless OEMs with an additional option to use an x86 processor with superior MIPs in a baseband card
             that is predominantly RapidIO. In these card designs, RapidIO is the interconnect between devices and functions as the
             backplane interconnect. x86 processors can now be used with other RapidIO devices on the baseband card and leverage the
             messaging performance of RapidIO for this peer-to-peer multiprocessor network.

2.7         I2C Signals
            The I2C Interface is used for the following:
            • As a master, downloading configuration from EEPROM
            • As a master, allowing the PCIe root complex or the S-RIO host to configure other I2C expansion devices
            • As a slave, exposing internal register space to an I2C master (Note: To be used for lab debug or another master-driven
               initialization).

3.4           Power Supply Sequencing
              This section contains power-up and power-down supply sequencing for the Tsi721.
3.4.1         Power-Up Sequencing
              The Tsi721 must have its supplies powered up as follows:
              1. VDD and AVDD10 (1.0V) must be powered up together.
                 To achieve this requirement AVDD10 can be supplied from the same regulator as VDD, but must be isolated on the board
                 through a ferrite bead.
              2. VDDIO, AVDD25, AVTT, and the 1.0V supplies (VDD and AVDD10) can be powered up in any order.
              3. The voltages on any input or I/O pin cannot exceed its corresponding supply voltage during power supply ramp up.
              4. The power supply ramp rates must be kept between 10 V/s and 0.5x10E6 V/s to minimize power current spikes during power
                 up. This leads to the ramp times specified in the following table.
              Table 14: Power Supply Sequencing Ramp Times

3.4.2         Power-Down Sequencing
              The Tsi721 must have its supplies powered down as follows:
              1. VDD and AVDD10 (1.0V) must be powered down together. To achieve this requirement AVDD10 can be supplied from the
                 same regulator as VDD, but must be isolated on the board through a ferrite bead.
              2. VDDIO, AVDD25, AVTT, and the 1.0V supplies (VDD and AVDD10) can be powered down in any order.

             1. Receiver eye margins are defined into a 2 x 50 W reference load. A Receiver is characterized by driving it with a signal whose
                 characteristics are defined by the parameters specified in Table 4-10 and Table 4-11 of the PCI Express Base Specification
                 (Rev. 2.1)
             2. The four inherent timing error parameters are defined for the convenience of Rx designers, and they are measured during
                 Receiver tolerancing.
             3. Two combinations of PLL BW and peaking are specified at 5.0 Gbps to permit designers to make a trade off between the
                 two parameters. If the PLL’s minimum BW is >= 8MHz, then up to 3.0 dB of peaking is permitted. If the PLL’s minimum BW
                 is relaxed to >= 5.0 MHz, then a tighter peaking value of 1.0 dB must be met. Note: A PLL BW extends from zero up to the
                 value(s) defined as the minimum or maximum in the table. For 2.5 Gbps a single PLL bandwidth and peaking value of 1.5-22
                 MHz and 3.0 dB are defined.
             4. Measurements must be made for both common mode and differential return loss. In both cases the DUT must be powered
                 up and DC isolated, and its D+/D- inputs must be in the low-Z state.
             5. The Rx DC Common Mode Impedance must be present when the Receiver terminations are first enabled to ensure that the
                 Receiver Detect occurs properly. Compensation of this impedance can start immediately and the Rx Common Mode
                 Impedance (constrained by RLRX-CM to 50 W +/-20%) must be within the specified range by the time Detect is entered.
             6. Common mode peak voltage is defined by the expression: maximum{|(Vd+ - Vd-) - VCMDC|}.

              7. ZRX-HIGH-IMP-DC-NEG and ZRX-HIGH-IMP-DC-POS are defined respectively for negative and positive voltages at the
                 input of the Receiver. Transmitter designers need to comprehend the large difference between >0 and <0 Rx impedances
                 when designing Receiver detect circuits.
              8. The LRX-SKEW parameter exists to handle repeaters that regenerate Refclk and introduce differing numbers of skips on
                 different lanes.

              Table 19 lists the electrical characteristics for the PCIe differential transmitters in the Tsi721. Parameters are defined
              separately for 2.5 Gbps and 5.0 Gbps implementations. Table 19 is duplicated from the PCI Express Base Specification

              1. SSC permits a +0, -5000 ppm modulation on the clock frequency at a modulation rate not to exceed 33 kHz.
              2. Measurements at 5.0 Gbps require an oscilloscope with a bandwidth of >= 12.5 GHz, or equivalent, while measurements
                 made at 2.5 Gbps require a scope with at least 6.2 GHz of bandwidth. Measurements at 5.0 Gbps must deconvolve effects
                 of compliance test board to produce an effective measurement at Tx pins. 2.5 Gbps may be measured within 200 mils of Tx
                 device’s pins, although deconvolution is recommended. For measurement setup information, refer to Figure 4-23 and Figure
                 4-24 of PCI Express Base Specification (Rev. 2.1). At least 106 UI of data must be acquired.
              3. Transmitter jitter is measured by driving the Transmitter under test with a low jitter “ideal” clock and connecting the DUT to
                 a reference load.
              4. Transmitter raw jitter data must be convolved with a filtering function that represents the worst case CDR tracking BW.
                 2.5 Gbps use different filter functions that are defined in Figure 4-21 of PCI Express Base Specification (Rev. 2.1). After the
                 convolution process has been applied, the center of the resulting eye must be determined and used as a reference point for
                 obtaining eye voltage and margins.
              5. VTX-AC-CM-PP and VTX-AC-CM-P are defined in Section 4.3.3.7 of PCI Express Base Specification (Rev. 2.1).
                 Measurement is made over at least 106 UI.
              6. The Tx PLL Bandwidth must lie between the minimum and maximum ranges displayed in the table. PLL peaking must lie
                 below the value listed. Note: the PLL B/W extends from zero up to the value(s) specified in the table.
              7. Measurements are made for both common mode and differential return loss. The DUT must be powered up and DC isolated,
                 and its data+/data- outputs must be in the low-Z state at a static value.

             8. A single combination of PLL BW and peaking is specified for 2.5 Gbps implementations. For 5.0 Gbps, two combinations of
                 PLL BW and peaking are specified to permit designers to make a trade-off between the two parameters. If the PLL’s minimum
                 BW is >= 8MHz, the up to 3.0 dB of peaking is permitted. If the PLL’s minimum BW is related to >= 5.0 MHz, then a tighter
                 peaking value of 1.0 dB must be met. In both cases, the maximum PLL BW is 16 MHz.
             9. Low swing output, defined by VTX-DIFF-PP-LOW must be implemented as displayed in Figure 4-27 of the PCI Express Base
                 Specification (Rev. 2.1) with no de-emphasis.
             10.For 5.0 Gbps, de-emphasis timing jitter must be removed. An additional HPF function must be applied as displayed in
                 Figure 4-21 of PCI Express Base Specification (Rev. 2.1). This parameter is measured by accumulating a record of 106 UI
                 while the DUT outputs a compliance pattern. TMIN-PULSE is defined to be nominally 1 UI wide and is bordered on both
                 sides by pulses of the opposite polarity. Refer to Figure 4-29 of PCI Express Base Specification (Rev. 2.1).
             11. Root complex Tx de-emphasis is configured from Upstream controller. Downstream Tx de-emphasis is set through a
                 command, issues at 2.5 Gbps. For information, refer to the appropriate location in Section 4.2 of PCI Express Base
                 Specification (Rev. 2.1).
3.7.3        RapidIO SerDes Characteristics
3.7.3.1      Overview
             The Tsi721’s SerDes are in full compliance to the RapidIO AC specifications for the LP-Serial physical layer [5]. This section
             provides those specifications for reference only; the user should see the specification for complete requirements.
             Chapter 9 of the specification, “1.25 Gbaud, 2.5 Gbaud, and 3.125 Gbaud LP-Serial Links” defines Level I links compatible
             with the 1.3 version of the Physical Layer Specification, that supports throughput rates of 1.25, 2.5, and 3.125 Gbps.
             Chapter 10 of the specification, “5 Gbaud and 6.25 Gbaud LP-Serial Links” defines Level II links that support throughput rates
             of 5 and 6.25 Gbps.
             A Level I link should:
             • Allow 1.25, 2.5, or 3.125 Gbps rates
             • Support AC coupling
             • Support hot plug
             • Support short run (SR) and long run (LR) links achieved with two transmitters
             • Support single receiver specification that will accept signals from both the short run and long run transmitter specifications
             • Achieve Bit Error Ratio of lower than 10-12 per lane
             A Level II link should:
             • Allow 5 Gbps baud rates
             • Support AC coupling and optional DC coupling
             • Support hot plug
             • Support short run (SR), and medium run (MR) links achieved with two transmitters and two receivers
             • Achieve Bit Error Ratio of lower than 10-15 per lane but test requirements will be verified to 10-12 per lane
             Together, these specifications allow for solutions ranging from simple chip-to-chip interconnect to board-to-board interconnect
             driving two connectors across a backplane. The faster and wider electrical interfaces specified here are required to provide
             higher density and/or lower cost interfaces.
             The short run defines a transmitter and a receiver that should be used mainly for chip-to-chip connections on either the same
             printed circuit board or across a single connector. This covers the case where connections are made to a mezzanine
             (daughter) card. The smaller swings of the short run specification reduces the overall power used by the transceivers.

             The Level I long run defines a transmitter and receiver that use larger voltage swings and channel equalization that allows a
             user to drive signals across two connectors and backplanes.
             The two transmitter specifications allows for a medium run specification that also uses larger voltage swings that can drive
             signals across a backplane but simplifies the receiver requirements to minimize power and complexity. This option has been
             included to allow the system integrator to deploy links that take advantage of either channel materials and/or construction
             techniques that reduce channel loss to achieve lower power systems.
             All unit intervals are specified with a tolerance of ±100 ppm. The worst case frequency difference between any transmit and
             receive clock is 200 ppm.
             The electrical specifications are based on loss, jitter, and channel cross-talk budgets and defines the characteristics required to
             communicate between a transmitter and a receiver using nominally 100 Ohm differential copper signal traces on a printed
             circuit board. Rather than specifying materials, channel components, or configurations, this specification focuses on effective
             channel characteristics. Therefore, a short length of poorer material should be equivalent to a longer length of premium
             material. A 'length' is effectively defined in terms of its attenuation rather than physical distance.
3.7.3.2      Definition of Amplitude and Swing
             LP-Serial links use differential signaling. This section defines the terms used in the description and specification of these
             differential signals. Figure 6 shows how these signals are defined and sets out the relationship between absolute and
             differential voltage amplitude. The figure shows waveforms for either the transmitter output (TD and TD_N) or a receiver input
             (RD and RD_N).

           Each signal swings between the voltages VHIGH and VLOW where:
               VHIGH > VLOW
           The differential voltage, VDIFF is defined as:
               VDIFF = VD+ - VD-
           where VD+ is the voltage on the positive conductor and VD- is the voltage on the negative conductor of a differential
           transmission line. VDIFF represents either the differential output signal of the transmitter, VOD, or the differential input signal of
           the receiver, VID where:
               VOD = VTD - VTD
               and
               VID = VRD - VRD
           The common mode voltage, VCM, is defined as the average or mean voltage present on the same differential pair. Therefore:
               VCM = | VD+ + VD- | / 2
           The maximum value, or the peak-to-peak differential voltage, is calculated on a per unit interval and is defined as:
               VDIFFp-p = 2 x max | VD+ - VD- |
           because the differential signal ranges from VD+ - VD- to -(VD+ - VD-)
           To illustrate these definitions using real values, consider the case of a CML (Current Mode Logic) transmitter and each of its
           outputs, TD and TD_N, has a swing that goes between VHIGH = 2.5V and VLOW = 2.0V, inclusive. Using these values the
           common mode voltage is calculated to be 2.25 V and the single-ended peak voltage swing of the signals TD and TD_N is
           500 mVpp. The differential output signal ranges between 500 mV and -500 mV, inclusive. therefore the peak-to-peak
           differential voltage is 1000 mVppd.

3.7.3.3      1.25 Gbps, 2.5 Gbps, and 3.125 Gbps LP-Serial Links
             This section explains the requirements for Level I RapidIO LP-Serial short and long run electrical interfaces of nominal baud
             rates of 1.25, 2.5, and 3.125 Gbps using NRZ coding (thus, 1 bit per symbol at the electrical level). The Tsi721’s SerDes meet
             all of the requirements listed below. The electrical interface is based on a high speed, low voltage logic with a nominal
             differential impedance of 100 Ohm. Connections are point-to-point balanced differential pair and signaling is unidirectional.
             The level of links defined in this section are identical to those defined in the RapidIO Interconnect Specification (Revision 2.1),
             1x/4x LP-Serial Electrical Specification.
3.7.3.4      Equalization
             With the use of high speed serial links, the interconnect media will cause degradation of the signal at the receiver. Effects such
             as Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) or data dependent jitter are produced. This loss can be large enough to degrade the eye
             opening at the receiver beyond what is allowed in the specification. To negate a portion of these effects, equalization can be
             used in the transmitter and/or receiver, but it is not required at baud rates less than 3.125 Gbps.
3.7.3.5      Explanatory Note on Level I Transmitter and Receiver Specifications
             AC electrical specifications are provided for the transmitter and receiver. Long run and short run interfaces at three baud rates
             are described.
             The parameters for the AC electrical specifications are guided by the XAUI electrical interface specified in Clause 47 of IEEE
             802.3ae-2002.[1] The goal of this standard is that electrical designs for Level I electrical designs can reuse XAUI, suitably
             modified for applications at the baud intervals and runs described herein.
3.7.3.6      Level I Electrical Specification
3.7.3.6.1    Level I Transmitter Characteristics
             Level I LP-Serial transmitter electrical and timing specifications are stated in the text and tables of this section. The differential
             return loss, S11, of the transmitter in each case must be better than:
             • -10 dB for (Baud Frequency) / 10 < Freq(f) < 625 MHz, and
             • -10 dB + 10log(f/625 MHz) dB for 625 MHz <= Freq(f) <= Baud Frequency
             The reference impedance for the differential return loss measurements is 100 Ohm resistive. Differential return loss includes
             contributions from on-chip circuitry, chip packaging and any off-chip components related to the driver. The output impedance
             requirement applies to all valid output levels.
             The Tsi721 satisfies the specification requirement that the 20%-80% rise/fall time of the transmitter, as measured at the
             transmitter output, in each case has a minimum value 60 ps.
             Similarly, the timing skew at the output of an LP-Serial transmitter between the two signals that comprise a differential pair
             does not exceed 25 ps at 1.25 Gbps, 20 ps at 2.5 Gbps, and 15 ps at 3.125 Gbps.

             For each baud rate at which the LP-Serial transmitter is specified to operate, the output eye pattern of the transmitter falls
             entirely within the unshaded portion of the Transmitter Output Compliance Mask displayed in Figure 7 when measured at the
             output pins of the device and the device is driving a 100 Ohm + 5% differential resistive load. The specification allows the
             output eye pattern of a LP-Serial transmitter that implements pre-emphasis (to equalize the link and reduce inter-symbol
             interference) to only comply with the Transmitter Output Compliance Mask when pre-emphasis is disabled or minimized.

3.7.4.1      5 Gbps LP-Serial Links
             This chapter describes the requirements for Level II RapidIO LP-Serial short and medium electrical interfaces of nominal baud
             rates of 5.0. Gbps using NRZ coding (thus, 1 bit per symbol at the electrical level). A compliant device must meet all of the
             requirements listed below. The electrical interface is based on a high speed low voltage logic with a nominal differential
             impedance of 100 Ohm. Connections are point-to-point balanced differential pair and signaling is unidirectional.

3.7.4.2      Explanatory Note on Level II Transmitter and Receiver Specifications
             AC electrical specifications are provided for transmitters and receivers. The parameters for the AC electrical specifications are
             guided by the OIF CEI Electrical and Jitter Inter-operability agreement for CEI-6G-SR and CEI-6G-LR.
             OIF CEI-6G-SR and CEI-6G-LR have similar application goals to S-RIO, as described in Section 10.1, “Level II Application
             Goals.” The goal of this standard is that electrical designs for S-RIO can reuse electrical designs for OIF CEI-6G, suitably
             modified for applications at the baud intervals and runs described herein.
3.7.4.3      Level II Electrical Specifications
             The electrical interface is based on high speed, low voltage logic with nominal differential impedance of 100 Ohm. Connections
             are point-to-point balanced differential pair and signaling is unidirectional.
3.7.4.3.1    Level II Transmitter Characteristics
             Level II LP-Serial transmitter electrical and timing specifications are stated in the text and tables of this section.
             The differential return loss must be better than A0 from f0 to f1 and better than
                 A0 + Slope*log10(f/f1)
             Where f is the frequency from f1 to f2 (see section 8.5.11, Figure 8-12 of the RapidIO Specification (Rev. 2.1). Differential
             return loss is measured at compliance points T and R. If AC coupling is used, then all components (internal or external) are to
             be included in this requirement. The reference impedance for the differential return loss measurements is 100 Ohm.
             Common mode return loss measurement must be better than -6dB between a minimum frequency of 100 MHz and a
             maximum frequency of 0.75 times the baud rate. The reference impedance for the common mode return loss is 25 Ohm.
             The Tsi721 satisfies the specification requirement that the 20%-80% rise/fall time of the transmitter, as measured at the
             transmitter output, in each case has a minimum value 30 ps.
             Similarly, the timing skew at the output of an LP-Serial transmitter between the two signals that comprise a differential pair
             does not exceed 10 ps at 5.0.

             2. Load Type 0 with min T_Vdiff, AC-Coupling or floating load.
             3. For load Type 1 through 3: R_Zvtt < 30 Ohm; Vtt is defined for each load type as follows: Load Type 1 R_Vtt = 1.2V +5% / -
                 8%; Load Type 2 R_Vtt = 1.0V +5% / -8%; Load Type 3 R_Vtt = 0.8V +5% / -8%.
             4. DC Coupling compliance is optional (Type 1 through 3). Only Transmitters that support DC coupling are required to meet this
                 parameter. It is acceptable for a transmitter to restrict the range of T_Vdiff in order to comply with the specified T_Vcm range.
                 For a transmitter which supports multiple T_Vdiff levels, it is acceptable for a transmitter to claim DC Coupling Compliance
                 if it meets the T_Vcm ranges for at least one of its T_Vdiff setting as long as those setting(s) that are compliant are indicated.
             5. Simple CML transmitters designed using VDD > 1.2V can still claim DC compliance if this parameter is not met.
             6. Simple CML transmitters designed using VDD < 0.8V can still claim DC compliance if this parameter is not met.
             1. The transmitter must be able to produce a minimum T_Vdiff greater than or equal to 800mVppd. In applications where the
                 channel is better than the worst case allowed, a Transmitter device can be provisioned to produce T_Vdiff less than this
                 minimum value, but greater than or equal to 400mVppd, and is still compliant with this specification.
             2. Load Type 0 with min T_Vdiff, AC-Coupling or floating load.
             3. For load Type 1: R_Zvtt < 30 Ohm; T_Vtt and R_Vtt = 1.2V +5% / - 8%.
             4. DC coupling compliance is optional (Load Type 1). Only Transmitters that support DC coupling are required to meet this
                 parameter.

           1. The transmitter must be able to produce a minimum T_Vdiff greater than or equal to 800mVppd. In applications where the
               channel is better than the worst case allowed, a Transmitter device can be provisioned to produce T_Vdiff less than this
               minimum value, but greater than or equal to 400mVppd, and is still compliant with this specification.
           2. Load Type 0 with min T_Vdiff, AC-Coupling or floating load.
           3. For load Type 1: R_Zvtt < 30 Ohm; T_Vtt and R_Vtt = 1.2V +5% / - 8%.
           4. DC coupling compliance is optional (Load Type 1). Only Transmitters that support DC coupling are required to meet this
               parameter.
           For 5 Gbps links, the Transmitters eye mask will also be evaluated during the steady-state where there are no symbol
           transitions – for example, a 1 followed by a 1 or a 0 followed by a 0 – and the signal has been de-emphasized. This additional
           transmitter eye mask constraint is displayed in the following figure.

           During the steady-state, the eye mask prevents the transmitter from de-emphasizing the low frequency content of the data too
           much and limiting the available signal-to-noise at the receiver. The de-emphasis introduces a jitter artifact that is not accounted
           for in this eye mask. This additional jitter is caused by the finite rise/fall time of the transmitter and the non-uniform voltage
           swing between the transitions. This additional deterministic jitter must be accounted for as part of the high probability jitter and
           is specified in the following table.

3.7.5        Reference Clocks – PCCLKP/N and REFCLKP/N
             Table 32 lists the PCCLKP/N and REFCLKP/N clock electrical characteristics of the Tsi721.
                        The clock source that drives the PCCLK inputs must meet all requirements for the common clock
                        architecture defined for the reference clock in the PCI Express Base Specification (Rev. 2.1).

             a. Common-mode voltage must be supplied by the clock source circuit.
             b. Clock termination must be implemented on the circuit board.
             PCCLKP/N and REFCLKP/N require a terminated, DC biased, differential clock source. This type of reference clock is usually
             used in PCIe systems but not in S-RIO systems. Different clock technologies can be used with the Tsi721 provided that proper
             termination is used.
             The following diagrams provide examples of commonly used clock technologies connected to PCCPLKP/N and REFCLKP/N.

4.3         Thermal Characteristics
            Heat generated by the packaged silicon must be removed from the package to ensure the silicon is maintained within its
            functional and maximum design temperature limits. If heat buildup becomes excessive, the silicon temperature may exceed
            the temperature limits. A consequence of this is that the silicon may fail to meet the performance specifications and the
            reliability objectives may be affected.
            Failure mechanisms and failure rate of a device has an exponential dependence on the silicon operating temperatures.
            Therefore, the control of the package, and by extension the junction temperature, is essential to ensure product reliability. The
            Tsi721 is specified safe for operation when the junction temperature is within the recommended limits as displayed in Table 12.
            Table 38 shows the simulated thermal characteristic (Theta JB and Theta JC) of the Tsi721 package.
            Table 38: Junction to Ambient Characteristics – Theta JB/JC
                   Interface           Results (C/W)
                    Theta JB                 8.78
                    Theta JC                 0.11
            Table 39 shows the simulated junction to ambient characteristics of the Tsi721. The thermal resistance Theta JA
            characteristics of a package depends on multiple variables other than just the package. In a typical application, designers must
            consider various system-level and environmental characteristics, such as:
            • Package mounting (vertical/horizontal)
            • System airflow conditions (laminar/turbulent)
            • Heat sink design and thermal characteristics
            • Heat sink attachment method
            • PWB size, layer count, and conductor thickness
            • Influence of the heat dissipating components assembled on the PWB (neighboring effects)
            Table 39: Junction to Ambient Characteristics – Theta JA
                                                            Theta JA (C/W)

            The results in Table 39 are based on a JEDEC Thermal Test Board configuration (JESD51-9), and do not factor in the
            system-level characteristics described above. As such, these values are for reference only.
