PI3DBS16412
3.3V, 1-20Gbps 2-Lane 2:1 Mux/De-Mux Switch
Features                                                       Description
 ÎÎ4 Differential Channel, 2:1 Mux/DeMux                       The PI3DBS16412 is an 8 to 4 differential channel multiplexer/de-
 ÎÎUp to 20 Gbps for applications including USB3.0, USB3.1,    multiplexer switch. This solution can switch multiple signal types
   10GE, Thunderbolt 3, and SAS3.0                             up to data rate of 20Gbps. Using a unique design technique, Peri-
 ÎÎBi-directional operation                                    com has been able to minimize the impedance of the switch such
 ÎÎ3dB bandwith: 13 GHz                                        that the attenuation observed through the switch is minimal. The
 ÎÎLow Bit-to-Bit Skew, 3ps typ                                unique design technique also offers a layout targeted for USB3.0,
 ÎÎLow channel-to-channel skew, 10ps typ                       USB3.1, 10GE, Thunderbolt 3, and SAS3.0 signals, which mini-
