TS2012EI                                                                          Application information
4        Application information
4.1      Differential configuration principle
         The TS2012EI is a monolithic fully-differential input/output class D power amplifier. The
         TS2012EI also includes a common-mode feedback loop that controls the output bias value
         to average it at VCC/2 for any DC common mode input voltage. This allows the device to
         always have a maximum output voltage swing, and by consequence, maximize the output
         power. Moreover, as the load is connected differentially compared with a single-ended
         topology, the output is four times higher for the same power supply voltage.
         The advantages of a full-differential amplifier are:
              high PSRR (power supply rejection ratio),
              high common mode noise rejection,
              virtually zero pop without additional circuitry, giving a faster start-up time compared to
               conventional single-ended input amplifiers,
              easier interfacing with differential output audio DACs,
              no input coupling capacitors required thanks to the common mode feedback loop.
4.2      Gain settings
         In the flat region of the frequency-response curve (no input coupling capacitor or internal
         feedback loop + load effect), the differential gain can be set to 6, 12 18, or 24 dB, depending
         on the logic level of the G0 and G1 pins, as shown in Table 9.
                                   Table 9. Gain settings with G0 and G1 pins
                     G1                      G0                    Gain (dB)                Gain (V/V)
                      0                       0                        6                        2
                      0                       1                        12                       4
                      1                       0                        18                       8
                      1                       1                        24                      16
Note:    Between pins G0, G1 and GND there is an internal 300 k (+/-20%) resistor. When the pins
         are floating, the gain is 6 dB. In full standby (left and right channels OFF), these resistors
         are disconnected (HiZ input).
4.3      Common mode feedback loop limitations
         As explained previously, the common mode feedback loop allows the output DC bias
         voltage to be averaged at VCC/2 for any DC common mode bias input voltage.
         Due to the Vic limitation of the input stage (see Table 3: Operating conditions on page 4), the
         common mode feedback loop can fulfill its role only within the defined range.

4.4        Low frequency response
           If a low frequency bandwidth limitation is required, it is possible to use input coupling
           capacitors. In the low-frequency region, the input coupling capacitor Cin starts to have an
           effect. Cin forms, with the input impedance Zin, a first order high-pass filter with a -3 dB cut-
           off frequency (see Table 6 to Table 8).
                                                                                                           1
                                                                                   F CL = ------------------------------------
                                                                                          2    Z in  C in
           So, for a desired cut-off frequency FCL, Cin is calculated as follows.
                                                                                                           1
                                                                                   C in = --------------------------------------

           The input impedance Zin is for the whole power supply voltage range and it changes with the
           gain setting. There is also a tolerance around the typical values (see Table 6 to Table 8).

TS2012EI                                                                        Application information
4.5      Decoupling of the circuit
         Power supply capacitors, referred to as CS1 and CS2, are needed to correctly bypass the
         TS2012EI.
         The TS2012EI has a typical switching frequency of 280 kHz and an output fall and rise time
         of approximately 5 ns. Due to these very fast transients, careful decoupling is mandatory.
         A 1 µF ceramic capacitor (CS1) between PVCC and PGND and one additional ceramic
         capacitor 0.1 µF (CS2) are enough. A 1 µF capacitor must be located as close as possible to
         the device PVCC pin in order to avoid any extra parasitic inductance or resistance created
         by a long track wire. Parasitic loop inductance, in relation with di/dt, introduces overvoltage
         that decreases the global efficiency of the device and may cause, if this parasitic inductance
         is too high, a breakdown of the TS2012EI. For filtering low-frequency noise signals on the
         power line, you can use a CS1 capacitor of 4.7 µF or more.
         In addition, even if a ceramic capacitor has an adequate high frequency ESR (equivalent
         series resistance) value, its current capability is also important. A size of 0603 is a good
         compromise, particularly when a 4  load is used.
         Another important parameter is the rated voltage of the capacitor. A 1 µF/6.3 V capacitor
         used at 5 V, loses about 50% of its value. With a power supply voltage of 5 V, the decoupling
         value, instead of 1 µF, could be reduced to 0.5 µF. As CS has particular influence on the
         THD+N in the medium-to-high frequency region, this capacitor variation becomes decisive.
         In addition, less decoupling means higher overshoots, which can be problematic if they
         reach the power supply AMR value (6 V).
4.6      Wake-up time (tWU) and shutdown time (tSTBY)
         During the wake-up sequence when the standby is released to set the device ON, there is a
         delay. The wake-up sequence of the TS2012EI consists of two phases. During the first
         phase tWU-A, a digitally-generated delay, mutes the outputs. Then, the gain increasing
         phase tWU-A begins. The gain increases smoothly from the mute state to the preset gain
         selected by the digital pins G0 and G1. This startup sequence avoids any pop noise during
         startup of the amplifier. Refer to Figure 37: Wake-up phase

            When the standby command is set, the time required to set the output stage to high
            impedance and to put the internal circuitry in shutdown mode is called the standby time.
            This time is used to decrease the gain from its nominal value set by the digital pins G0 and
            G1 to mute and avoid any pop noise during shutdown. The gain decreases smoothly until
            the outputs are muted (Figure 38).

4.7        Consumption in shutdown mode
           Between the shutdown pin and GND there is an internal 300 k (+-/20%) resistor. This
           resistor forces the TS2012EI to be in shutdown when the shutdown input is left floating.
           However, this resistor also introduces additional shutdown power consumption if the
           shutdown pin voltage is not at 0 V.
           With a 0.4 V shutdown voltage pin for example, you must add 0.4 V/300 k = 1.3 µA typical
           (0.4 V/240 k = 1.66 µA maximum) for each shutdown pin to the standby current specified
           in Table 6 to Table 8. Of course, this current will be provided by the external control device
           for the standby pins.
4.8        Single-ended input configuration
           It is possible to use the TS2012EI in a single-ended input configuration. However, input
           coupling capacitors are mandatory in this configuration. Figure 39 shows a typical single-
           ended input application.

Application information                                                                               TS2012EI
4.9         Output filter considerations
            The TS2012EI is designed to operate without an output filter. However, due to very sharp
            transients on the TS2012EI output, EMI-radiated emissions may cause some standard
            compliance issues.
            These EMI standard compliance issues can appear if the distance between the TS2012EI
            outputs and loudspeaker terminal are long (typically more than 50 mm, or 100 mm in both
            directions, to the speaker terminals). Because the PCB layout and internal equipment
            device are different for each configuration, it is difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution.
            However, to decrease the probability of EMI issues, there are several simple rules to follow.
                  Reduce, as much as possible, the distance between the TS2012EI output pins and the
                   speaker terminals.
                  Use a ground plane to "shield" sensitive wires.
                  Place, as close as possible to the TS2012EI and in series with each output, a ferrite
                   bead with a rated current of at least 2.5 A and an impedance greater than 50 at
                   frequencies above 30 MHz. If, after testing, these ferrite beads are not necessary,
                   replace them by a short-circuit.
                  Allow extra footprint to place, if necessary, a capacitor to short perturbations to ground
                   (Figure 40).
                                         Figure 40. Ferrite chip bead placement
                                                       Ferrite chip bead
                              From output                                                to speaker
                                                                                 about 100pF
                                                                                 gnd
            In the case where the distance between the TS2012EI output and the speaker terminals is
            too long, it is possible to have low frequency EMI issues due to the fact that the typical
            operating frequency is 280 kHz. In this configuration, it is necessary to use the output filter
            represented in Figure 1 on page 5 as close as possible to the TS2012EI.
4.10        Short-circuit protection
            The TS2012EI includes output short-circuit protection. This protection prevents the device
            from being damaged in case of fault conditions on the amplifier outputs.
            When a channel is in operating mode and a short-circuit occurs between two outputs of the
            channel or between an output and ground, the short-circuit protection detects this situation
            and puts the appropriate channel into standby. To put the channel back into operating mode,
            it is necessary to put the channel’s standby pin to logical LO, and then back again to logical
            HI and wake up the channel.

4.11     Thermal shutdown
         The TS2012EI device has an internal thermal shutdown protection in the event of extreme
         temperatures to protect the device from overheating. Thermal shutdown is active when the
         device reaches 150° C. When the temperature decreases to safe levels, the circuit switches
         back to normal operation.
