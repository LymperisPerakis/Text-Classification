TDA7293                                                                              Circuit description
3       Circuit description
        In consumer electronics, an increasing demand has arisen for very high power monolithic
        audio amplifiers able to match, with a low cost, the performance obtained from the best
        discrete designs.
        The task of realizing this linear integrated circuit in conventional bipolar technology is made
        extremely difficult by the occurence of 2nd breakdown phoenomenon. It limits the safe
        operating area (SOA) of the power devices, and, as a consequence, the maximum
        attainable output power, especially in presence of highly reactive loads.
        Moreover, full exploitation of the SOA translates into a substantial increase in circuit and
        layout complexity due to the need of sophisticated protection circuits.
        To overcome these substantial drawbacks, the use of power MOS devices, which are
        immune from secondary breakdown is highly desirable.
        The device described has therefore been developed in a mixed bipolar-MOS high voltage
        technology called BCDII 100/120.
3.1     Output Stage
        The main design task in developping a power operational amplifier, independently of the
        technology used, is that of realization of the output stage.
        The solution shown as a principle shematic by Fig6 represents the DMOS unity - gain output
        buffer of the TDA7293.
        Figure 4.     Schematic of a DMOS unity-gain buffer
        This large-signal, high-power buffer must be capable of handling extremely high current and
        voltage levels while maintaining acceptably low harmonic distortion and good behaviour
        over frequency response; moreover, an accurate control of quiescent current is required.
        A local linearizing feedback, provided by differential amplifier A, is used to fullfil the above
        requirements, allowing a simple and effective quiescent current setting. Proper biasing of
        the power output transistors alone is however not enough to guarantee the absence of
        crossover distortion.
                                         Doc ID 6744 Rev 8                                             7/21


Circuit description                                                                                 TDA7293
            While a linearization of the DC transfer characteristic of the stage is obtained, the dynamic
            behaviour of the system must be taken into account.
            A significant aid in keeping the distortion contributed by the final stage as low as possible is
            provided by the compensation scheme, which exploits the direct connection of the Miller
            capacitor at the amplifier’s output to introduce a local AC feedback path enclosing the output
            stage itself.
3.2         Protection
            In designing a power IC, particular attention must be reserved to the circuits devoted to
            protection of the device from short circuit or overload conditions. Due to the absence of the
            2nd breakdown phenomenon, the SOA of the power DMOS transistors is delimited only by a
            maximum dissipation curve dependent on the duration of the applied stimulus.
            In order to fully exploit the capabilities of the power transistors, the protection scheme
            implemented in this device combines a conventional SOA protection circuit with a novel local
            temperature sensing technique which " dynamically" controls the maximum dissipation.
            In addition to the overload protection described above, the device features a thermal
            shutdown circuit which initially puts the device into a muting state (@ Tϕ = 150 °C) and then
            into stand-by (@ Tj = 160 °C).
            Full protection against electrostatic discharges on very pin is included.
3.3         Other Features
            The device is provided with both standby and mute functions, independently driven by two
            CMOS logic compatible input pins.
            The circuits dedicated to the switching on and off of the amplifier have been carefully
            optimized to avoid any kind of uncontrolled audible transient at the output.
            The sequence that we recommend during the on/off transients is shown in Figure 8. The
            application of figure 9 shows the possibility of sing only one command for both st-by and
            mute functions. On both the pins, the maximum applicable range corresponds to the
            operating supply voltage.

TDA7293                                                                      Applications information
4.2     High efficiency
        Constraints of implementing high power solutions are the power dissipation and the size of
        the power supply. These are both due to the low efficiency of conventional AB class
        amplifier approaches.
        The circuit below in Figure 8 is a high efficiency amplifier which can be adopted for both hi-fi
        and car-radio applications. The TDA7293 is a monolithic MOS power amplifier which can be
        operated with a 100-V supply (120 V with no signal applied) while delivering output currents
        up to ±6.5 A. This allows the use of this device as a very high-power amplifier (up to 180 W
        peak power with THD = 10% and RL = 4 Ω); the only drawback is the power dissipation,
        hardly manageable in the above power range.
        The typical junction-to-case thermal resistance of the TDA7293 is 1 °C/W (max = 1.5 °C/W).
        In worst case conditions, to avoid the chip temperature exceeding 150 °C the thermal
        resistance of the heatsink must be 0.038 °C/W (at a maximum ambient temperature of
        50 °C).
        As the above value is pratically unreachable, a high efficiency system is needed in those
        cases where the continuous average output power is higher than 50 to 60 W.
        The TDA7293 was designed to work also in a higher efficiency way. For this reason there
        are four power supply pins: two intended for the signal part and two for the power part. T1
        and T2 are two power transistors that only operate when the output power reaches a certain
        threshold (for example, 20 W).
        If the output power increases, these transistors are switched on during the portion of the
        signal where more output voltage swing is needed, thus "bootstrapping" the power supply
        pins (13 and 15). The current generators formed by T4, T7, zener diodes Z1, Z2 and
        resistors R7, R8 define the minimum drop across the power MOS transistors of the
        TDA7293. L1, L2, L3 and the snubbers C9, R1 and C10, R2 stabilize the loops formed by
        the "bootstrap" circuits and the output stage of the TDA7293.
        By considering again a maximum average output power (music signal) of 20 W, in case of
        the high efficiency application, the thermal resistance value needed from the heatsink is
        2.2 °C/W (with VS = ±50 V and RL = 8 Ω). All components (TDA7293 and power transistors
        T1 and T2) can be placed on a 1.5 °C/W heatsink, with the power darlingtons electrically
        insulated from the heatsink.
        Since the total power dissipation is less than that of a usual class AB amplifier, additional
        cost savings can be obtained while optimizing the power supply, even with a large heatsink.
4.3     Bridge application
        Another application suggestion is the bridge configuration, where two TDA7293 are used.
        In this application, the value of the load must not be lower than 8 Ω for dissipation and
        current capability reasons.
        A suitable field of application includes hi-fi/TV subwoofer realizations. The main advantages
        offered by this solution are:
        z     High power performance with limited supply voltage level.
        z     Considerably higher output power even with high load values, such as 16 Ω.
        With RL = 8 Ω and VS = ±25 V, the maximum output power obtainable is 150 W, whilst with
        RL = 16 Ω and VS = ±40 V, the maximum Pout is 200 W.

Applications information                                                                       TDA7293
4.4        Modular application (ref. figure 12)
           The modular application is where several devices operate in parallel.
           The modular application allows very high power be delivered to very low-impedance loads.
           In this type of application one device acts as a master and the others as slaves.
           The slave power stages are driven by the master device and work in parallel together while
           the input and the gain stages of the slave devices are disabled. The figure below shows the
           connections required to configure two devices to work together.
           z     The master chip connections are the same as the normal single ones.
           z     The outputs can be connected together without the need of any ballast resistor.
           z     The slave SGND pin must be tied to the negative supply.
           z     The slave STANDBY and MUTE pins must be connected to the master STANDBY and
                 MUTE pins.
           z     The bootstrap lines must be connected together and the bootstrap capacitor must be
                 increased: for N devices the bootstrap capacitor must be 22 µF times N.
           z     The slave IN pin must be connected to the negative supply.
4.5        Bootstrap capacitor
           For compatibility purpose with the previous devices of the family, the bootstrap capacitor can
           be connected either between the bootstrap pin (6) and the output pin (14) or between the
           bootstrap pin (6) and the bootstrap loader pin (12).
           When the bootstrap is connected between pins 6 and 14 the maximum supply voltage in the
           presence of an output signal is limited to 100 V, due the bootstrap capacitor overvoltage.
           When the bootstrap is connected between pins 6 and 12 the maximum supply voltage
           extends to the full voltage that the technology can stand, in this case 120 V.
           This is accomplished by the clamp introduced at the bootstrap loader pin (12). This pin
           follows the output voltage up to 100 V and remains clamped at 100 V for higher output
           voltages.
           This feature lets the output voltage swing up to a gate-source voltage from the positive
           supply (VS -3 to 6 V).
