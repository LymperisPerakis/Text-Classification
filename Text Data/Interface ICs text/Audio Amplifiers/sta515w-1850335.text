5       Application information
        The STA515W is a dual channel H-bridge that can deliver 20 W per channel into 8  with
        10% THD at VCC = 18 V with high efficiency.
        The STA515W converts both DDX and binary-logic-controlled PWM signals into audio
        power at the load. It includes a logic interface, integrated bridge drivers, high efficiency
        MOSFET outputs and thermal and short-circuit protection circuitry.
        In DDX mode, two logic-level signals per channel are used to control the high-speed
        MOSFET switches which drive the speaker load in a bridge configuration, according to the
        damped ternary modulation operation.
        In binary mode, both full-bridge and half-bridge modes are supported.
        The STA515W includes overcurrent and thermal protection as well as an undervoltage
        lockout with automatic recovery. A thermal warning status is also provided.

        Logic interface and decode
        The STA515W power outputs are controlled using one or two logic-level timing signals. In
        order to provide a proper logic interface, pin VL must operate at the same voltage as the
        DDX control logic supply.

Application information                                                                              STA515W
            Protection circuits
            The STA515W includes protection circuitry for overcurrent and thermal overload conditions.
            A thermal warning pin (THWARN) is activated low (open-drain MOSFET) when the IC
            temperature exceeds 130 °C, which is in advance of the thermal shutdown protection. When
            a fault condition is detected an internal fault signal acts to immediately disable the output
            power MOSFETs, placing both H-bridges in the high-impedance state. At the same time an
            open-drain MOSFET connected to pin FAULT is switched on.
            There are two possible modes subsequent to activating a fault:
                 Shutdown mode:
                  with pins FAULT (with pull-up resistor) and TRISTATE independent, an activated fault
                  disables the device, signalling low at pin FAULT.
                  The device may subsequently be reset to normal operation by toggling pin TRISTATE
                  from high to low and back to high using an external logic signal.
                 Automatic recovery mode:
                  This is shown in the applications circuit in Figure 7 and Figure 7 on page 11.
                  Pins FAULT and TRISTATE are shorted together and connected to a time constant
                  circuit comprising R59 and C58.
                  An activated fault forces a reset on pin TRISTATE causing normal operation to resume
                  following a delay determined by the time constant of the circuit.
                  If the fault condition is still present, the circuit operation continues, repeating until the
                  fault condition is removed.
                  An increase in the time constant of the circuit produces a longer recovery interval.
            Care must be taken in the overall system design so as not to exceed the protection
            thresholds under normal operation.
            Power outputs
            The STA515W power and output pins are duplicated to provide a low-impedance path for
            the device bridged outputs. All duplicated power, ground and output pins must be connected
            for proper operation.
            Pins PWRDN or TRISTATE should be used to set all MOSFETS to the high-impedance
            state during power-up and until the logic power supply, VL, has settled.
            Parallel-output and high-current operation
            When using DDX mode, the STA515W outputs can be connected in parallel to increase the
            output current capability. In this configuration the device can provide 40 W into 8 .
            This mode of operation is enabled with pin CONFIG connected to VDD. The inputs must be
            combined to give INLA = INLB and INRA = INRB, then the corresponding outputs can be
            shorted together to give OUTLA = OUTLB and OUTRA = OUTRB.
            Output filter
            A passive 2nd-order filter is used on the STA515W power outputs to reconstruct an analog
            audio signal. The system performance can be significantly affected by the output filter
            design and choice of passive components.
            Filter designs for 4- and 8- loads are shown in the applications circuits of Figure 1 on
            page 2 for the half-bridge mode, and Figure 7 and Figure 8 on page 11 for the full bridge.

        Figure 8 below shows a single-BTL configuration capable of supplying 40 W into a 4  load
        at 10% THD with VCC = 19 V. This result was obtained with peak power for <1 s using the
        STA308+STA515W+STA50X demo board. A PWM modulator as driver is required.
