          1. Either or both input voltages must not exceed the magnitude of Vcc+ or Vcc-.
          2. This input current only exists when the voltage at any of the input leads is driven negative. It is due to the
             collector-base junction of the input PNP transistor becoming forward-biased and thereby acting as input
             diode clamp. In addition to this diode action, there is NPN parasitic action on the IC chip. This transistor
             action can cause the output voltages of the Op-amps to go to the VCC voltage level (or to ground for a large
             overdrive) for the time during which an input is driven negative.
             This is not destructive and normal output is restored for input voltages above -0.3 V.
          3. The junction base/substrate of the input PNP transistor polarized in reverse must be protected by a resistor
             in series with the inputs to limit the input current to 400 µA max (R = (Vin - 36 V)/400 µA).
          4. Power dissipation must be considered to ensure maximum junction temperature (Tj) is not exceeded.
          5. Human body model: 100 pF discharged through a 1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device, done for
             all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
          6. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
             two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω), done for all couples of pin
             combinations with other pins floating.
          7. Charged device model: all pins plus package are charged together to the specified voltage and then
             discharged directly to the ground.
