        1. All voltage values are measured with respect to the ground pin.
        2. Thermal shutdown is activated when maximum junction temperature is reached.
        3. The device is protected from over temperature by a thermal shutdown mechanism, active at 150° C.
        4. Exceeding the power derating curves for long periods may provoke abnormal operation.
        5. Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
           1.5 kresistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
           while the other pins are floating.
        6. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
           two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 ). This is done for all couples of
           connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
        7. The measurement is performed on an evaluation board, with ESD protection EMIF02-AV01F3.

4.1         Gain control
            The A22H165 has two gain settings which are controlled via the GAIN pin:
                                              GAIN voltage              Amplifier gain
                                                  0.6 V                     0 dB
                                                  1.3 V                     6 dB
Note:       See Table 6: Electrical characteristics of the amplifier for VIH and VIL levels.
4.2         Overview of the class-G, 2-level headphone amplifier
            The A22H165 uses what is referred to as class-G operating mode. This mode is a
            combination of the class AB biasing technique and an adaptive power supply. For this
            device, the power supply uses two levels: ±1.2 V and ±1.9 V.
            To create the ±1.2 V and ±1.9 V levels, the device uses an internal high-efficiency step-
            down converter linked with a fully capacitive inverter from AVdd. Thanks to these internally-
            generated symmetrical power supply voltages, the output of the amplifier can be biased at
            0 V, thus eliminating the classical bulky DC blocking output capacitors (typically more than
            100 F).

            When an audio signal is playing with the A22H165, the class G feature adjusts in real time
            the internal power supply voltage in order to achieve the best efficiency possible. In addition,
            thanks to the fast transient response of the internal DC-DC converters, the switching
            between ±1.2 V and ±1.9 V can be achieved without audio clipping. Moreover, the out-of-
            audio band DC-DC switching frequency keeps the audio quality at a high level (distortion,
            noise, etc…).

          Most audio signals have a crest factor higher than 6 dB (10 dB on average), which means
          that most of the time the music level is low. In this case, the setting of the internal DC-DC
          converters is low (1.2 V) and in this way, helps to minimize the power dissipation.
          When the audio signal amplitude increases due to a peak or louder music, the setting of the
          internal DC-DC converters increases to 1.9 V, automatically increasing the output dynamic
          range. This 1.9 V value remains until the end of the decay time.

4.3         External component selection
            The A22H165 requires few external passive components to operate correctly. Each
            component is described in the following sections.
4.3.1       Step-down inductor selection (L1)
            The A22H165 needs one inductor for the internal step-down DC-DC converter. This inductor
            must fit the following constraints:
                Typical value: 2.2 µH to 3.3 µH (3.3 µH is recommended)
                Maximum current in operating mode: 400 mA
                Minimum inductor value at maximum current: 1.5 µH
                Maximum inductor value at zero current: 4.3 µH
                DC resistance: from 50 m up to 450 m
            Table 7 shows the part number that should be used according to the inductor value.

4.3.2       Step-down output capacitor selection (Ct)
            For the internal DC-DC step-down converter, the A22H165 needs one output capacitor.
            The three criteria for selecting the output capacitor are the range value of the capacitor
            including self tolerance, DC variation and the minimum ESR value, which is mandatory to
            avoid oscillation of the converter. Therefore the following constraints must be observed.
                Typical capacitor value: 10 µF at DC = 0 V
                Maximum capacitor value: 12 µF at DC = 0 V
                Minimum capacitor value: 4.8 µF at DC = 2 V
                Voltage range across this capacitor: from 1.1 V to 2 V
                Minimum DC ESR value: 5 m
            A ceramic capacitor in a 0603-type package is also recommended because of its close
            placement to the A22H165, which makes it easier to minimize parasitic inductance and
            resistance that have a negative impact on the audio performance.

A22H165                                                                                               Application information
4.3.3   Full capacitive inverter capacitors selection (C12 and CSS)
        Two capacitors (C12 and Css) are needed for this internal DC-DC inverter.
        The three criteria for selecting these capacitors are the range value of the capacitor
        including self tolerance, DC variation and the minimum ESR to minimize power losses.
             Typical capacitor value: 2.2 µF +/-20 %
             Voltage across these capacitors: from 1.1 V to 2 V
             Minimum capacitor value: 1 µF
        Again, a ceramic capacitor in a 0603 or 0402-type package is also recommended because
        of their close placement to the A22H165, which makes it easier to minimize parasitic
        inductance and resistance that have a negative impact on the audio performance.
4.3.4   Power supply decoupling capacitor selection (Cs)
        A 2.2 µF decoupling capacitor with low ESR is recommended for positive power supply
        decoupling. Packages such as the 0402 or 0603 are also recommended because of their
        close placement to the A22H165, which makes it easier to minimize parasitic inductance. It
        is advised to choose a X5R dielectric for capacitor tolerance, and a 10 V DC rating voltage
        for 4.8 V operations (or a 6.3 V DC rating voltage for 3.6 V operations), to take into
        consideration the C/V variation of this type of ceramic capacitor.
        An important parameter is the rated voltage of the capacitor. A 2.2 µF/6.3 V capacitor used
        at 4.8 V DC typically loses about 40 % of its value. In fact, with a 4.8 V power supply
        voltage, the decoupling value is about 1.3 µF instead of 2.2 µF. Because the decoupling
        capacitor influences the THD+N in the medium-to-high frequency region, this capacitor
        variation becomes decisive. In addition, less decoupling means higher overshoots, which
        can be problematic if they reach the power supply’s AMR value (5.5 V). This is why, for a
        2.2 µF value, we recommend a 2.2 µF/10 V, a 4.7 µF/6.3 V or a ceramic capacitor with a low
        DC bias variation rated at 6.3 V.
4.3.5   Input coupling capacitor selection (Cin)
        Cin input coupling capacitors are mandatory for the A22H165’s operation. They block any
        DC component coming from the audio signal source.
        Cin with Rin form a first-order high-pass filter and the -3 dB cut-off frequency is:
                                                                              1
                                          FC  – 3dB  = --------------------------------------------
                                                         2    Rin  Cin
        Rin is the single-ended input impedance that can be approximated at about Rindiff/2.
        Rin also depends on the gain setting. Figure 10 provides the differential input impedance vs.
        gain. One can also see that Rindiff is minimum for the maximum gain setting (that is, 6 dB).
        Therefore, in most cases, Rin should be set to 6 dB to calculate the minimum input capacitor
        Cin.
        Example:
        In this case and for a -3 dB cut-off frequency of 20 Hz, Cin = 0.64 µF. The closest normalized
        value is 0.68 µF but a 1 µF capacitor is more suitable to take into consideration the capacitor
        tolerance +/-20 %.
        If the aim is to have the 20 Hz at -1 dB, the capacitor has to be multiplied by 1.96. As such,
        Cin = 0.64 x 1.96 = 1.25 µF. The closest normalized value would be 1.5 µF or 2.2 µF.

4.3.6              Low-pass output filter (Rout and Cout) and IEC 61000-4-2 ESD
                   protection
                   The A22H165 is designed to operate with a passive first-order low-pass filter (as shown in
                   Figure 1). This low-pass filter is mandatory to ensure correct operation of the A22H165 over
                   the volume range and output capacitance range vs. load.
                   Rout must have a value of 12  minimum and Cout a value of 0.8 nF minimum up to 100 nF
                   maximum. Values of 12  and 1 nF are a good starting point for a design to be able to drive
                   a classic headphone (16 , 32 , 60 ) and the line-in of any hi-fi system or sound card.
                   The cutoff frequency of this filter (12  and 1 nF) is approximately 13 MHz and clearly
                   above the audio band.
                   However, this output RC filter is also a part of the IEC 61000-4-2 ESD protection. In most
                   cases, this RC filter is designed with transient absorbers and the final solution can be a
                   discrete solution or an integrated solution. ST Microelectronics’ portfolio has many
                   integrated solutions for ESD, but one dedicated to headphone amplifiers in particular:
                   IPAD(a) reference EMIF02-AV01F3.
                   To fit the IEC 61000-4-2 standard, this audio line IPAD can be added to the output of the
                   A22H165 as shown in Figure 67.

                 as those outlined in the IEC 61000-4-2 standard. Results may differ depending on the layout
                 of the PCB.

                      8 kV (contact discharge)
                 This IPAD has an internal series resistor Rout = 15  +/-20 % and an output capacitor
                 Cout = 3.2 nF +/-25 %.
4.3.7            Integrated input low-pass filter
                 The A22H165 has an integrated internal first-order low-pass filter with a -3 dB cutoff. This
                 integrated filter is present on each input and filters any out-of-band audio noise coming from
                 the audio source.
4.4              Single-ended input configuration
                 The A22H165 can be used in a single-ended input configuration. InR- and InL- or InR+ and
                 InL+ can be shorted to ground through input capacitors. All Cin capacitors must have the
                 same value to keep the same PSRR performance as in a differential input configuration.
                 Figure 68 and Figure 69 show how to connect the A22H165. Note the ground connection of
                 each input. To avoid PSRR issues resulting from any ground noise, this connection must be
                 done on the ground of the audio source and not on the ground of the A22H165 itself.

             If these inputs are connected to AGnd (the ground of the A22H165 class-G), the output
             voltage can be expressed by the following simplified equation from an AC point of view.
             Equation 1
             Vout = Av x (Vaudio + Vmc + Vgndnoise) + Vbatnoise x PSRR
             As shown in Equation 1, any ground noise and any parasitic AC voltage on Vmc is directly
             multiplied by the gain of the amplifier. If Vmc can be totally controlled by the design of the
             audio source device (no parasitic AC voltage), it is not necessarily the case for Vgndnoise.
             This noise can be significantly reduced by an adequate low impedance ground plane, but
             not totally eliminated. In practice, only ten millivolts in the right frequency range are enough
             to produce an audible parasitic sound in the headphone with a volume level as low as
             -20 dB.

               Correct connection location
               As shown in Figure 71, the best option is to route the single-ended signal in parallel with the
               AC ground line of the other input. The AC grounded terminal must be routed in parallel to
               the audio signal and grounded with the ground of the audio source.

               In this configuration, the AC output voltage is:
               Equation 2
               Vout = Av x (Vaudio + Vmc) + Vgndnoise x CMRR + Vbatnoise x PSRR
               In Equation 2 the ground noise is attenuated by the performance of the CMRR. In practice,
               50 dB of CMRR and ten millivolts for ground noise gives an output of approximately 30 µV,
               which is normally too low to be perceptible in the headphone. If Vmc is also totally controlled
               by the design of the audio source, Equation 2 becomes:
               Equation 3
               Vout = Av x Vaudio + Vbatnoise x PSRR
               Like in differential mode, the main contributor for audio signal degradation is the AC noise
               voltage on Vbat. Thanks to the A22H165’s very high PSRR that can attenuate GSM burst
               noise, Equation 3 becomes:
               Equation 4
               Vout = Av x Vaudio

A22H165                                                                      Application information
4.5     Startup phase
        The A22H165 uses different techniques to reduce the DC current consumption and offer a
        pop-and-click performance close to none.
4.5.1   Auto zero technology
        During the startup phase, the differential output voltage is sensed and adjusted to 0 V
        (+/-500 V) to avoid any pop noise when the amplifier becomes operational. This also helps
        to minimize extra current consumption due to the load (Icc-extra = VoutDC / Rload).
4.5.2   Input impedance
        The A22H165 requires input coupling capacitors. The usual lowest frequency used for the
        headphone is close to 20 Hz. This frequency means a constant time for a first-order high-
        pass filter of approximately 1 / (2 x Pi x 20) = 8 ms.
        To achieve 95 % of the capacitor’s charge, it is necessary to wait 3 x 8 ms = 24 ms, which is
        out of range for a device with a fast startup time.
        Because of the mismatching of all input capacitors and input resistors, if it is decided to start
        the A22H165 at a time of 8 ms, a voltage difference at the inputs (multiplied by the gain) can
        create a voltage step on the output and consequently a pop noise.
        To avoid this issue during the starting phase, the A22H165 accelerates the charging of the
        input capacitors by reducing the input impedance to 2 k.
        In such a case, for a 1 F capacitor the 95 % charge is reached in 6 ms. As the startup time
        of A22H165 is 12 ms, there remains sufficient time to fully charge the input capacitors and
        as such eliminate any pop noise.
4.6     Layout recommendations
        Particular attention must be given to the correct layout of the PCB traces and wires between
        the amplifier, load and power supply (in most cases, the battery of the cellular phone).
        The power and ground traces are critical since they must provide adequate energy and
        grounding for all circuits. Good practice is to use short and wide PCB traces to minimize
        voltage drops and parasitic inductance.
        A track with a width of at least 200 m for a copper thickness of 18 m is recommended for
        bringing energy to the amplifier from the battery.
        Proper grounding guidelines help improve audio performances, minimize crosstalk between
        channels, and prevent switching noise from coupling into the audio signal. It is also
        recommended to use a large-area and multi-via ground plane to minimize parasitic
        impedance.
        A multi-layer PCB board allows double or multiple ground planes to be implemented. Most
        of the time, the top and bottom layers are used as ground planes and provide shielding for
        tracks routed on the intermediate layers. In addition, to minimize parasitic impedance over
        the entire surface, a multi-via technique that connects the bottom and top layer ground
        planes together in many locations is often used.
        The copper traces that connect the output pins to the load and supply pins should be as
        wide as possible to minimize the trace resistances.

4.6.1       Common-mode sense layout
            The A22H165 implements a common-mode sense pin to correct any voltage differences
            that might occur between the return of the headphone jack and the AGND of the device that
            can create parasitic noise in the headphone and/or line out.
            The solution to strongly reduce and practically eliminate this noise consists in connecting
            the headphone jack ground to the CMS pin. This pin senses the difference of potential
            (voltage noise) between the A22H165 ground and the headphone ground. Thanks to the
            frequency response and the attenuation of the common-mode sense pin, this noise is
            removed from the A22H165 outputs.
