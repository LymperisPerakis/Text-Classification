    Rin = Rin-L, Rfeed = Rfeed-L
    Cfeed = Cfeed-L

4.1 BTL configuration principle
BTL (Bridge Tied Load) means that each end of the load is connected to two single-ended output
amplifiers. Thus, we have:
    Single-ended output 1 = Vout1 = Vout (V),
    Single-ended output 2 = Vout2 = -Vout (V), Vout1 - Vout2 = 2Vout (V)
The output power is:
                                                                                                     2
                                                                   ( 2V outRMS )
                                                           P out = -------------------------------------
                                                                                  RL
For the same power supply voltage, the output power in a BTL configuration is four times higher than the
output power in a single-ended configuration.

4.2 Gain in typical application schematic
The typical application schematic (Figure 64) is shown on page 18.
In the flat region (no Cin effect), the output voltage of the first stage is:
                                                                          R feed
                                          V ou t 1 = ( – V in ) ---------------             (V)
                                                                              R in
For the second stage: Vout2 = -Vout1 (V)
The differential output voltage is:
                                                                                  R feed
                                      V out 2 – V ou t 1 = 2V in ---------------                    (V)
                                                                                   R in
The differential gain, referred to as Gv for greater convenience, is:
                                                 V out 2 – V out 1                      R feed
                                        G v = ------------------------------------ = 2 ---------------
                                                            V in                           R in
Vout2 is in phase with Vin and Vout1 is phased 180° with Vin. This means that the positive terminal of the
loudspeaker should be connected to Vout2 and the negative to Vout1.
4.3 Low and high frequency response
In the low frequency region, Cin starts to have an effect. Cin forms with Rin a high-pass filter with a -3dB
cut-off frequency:
                                                                      1
                                             F CL = -------------------------- (Hz)
                                                          2πR in C in
In the high frequency region, you can limit the bandwidth by adding a capacitor (Cfeed) in parallel with
Rfeed. It forms a low-pass filter with a -3dB cut-off frequency. FCH is in Hz.
                                                                    1
                                        F CH = ---------------------------------------- (Hz)
                                                   2πR feed C feed
                                                                                                        19/29


The following graph (Figure 65) shows an example of Cin and Cfeed influence.

4.4 Power dissipation and efficiency
Hypotheses:
  l Voltage and current in the load are sinusoidal (Vout and Iout).
  l Supply voltage is a pure DC source (Vcc).
Regarding the load we have:
                                                        V out = V PEAK sinωt                       (V)
and
                                                                          V out
                                                                  I out = --------------          (A)
                                                                              RL
and
                                                                   V PE AK 2
                                                           P out = -------------------------            (W)
                                                                          2R L
Therefore, the average current delivered by the supply voltage is:
                                                     V PEAK
                                       I CC      = 2 ------------------- (A)
                                            AV G         π RL
The power delivered by the supply voltage is:
                                                   P              = V CC ⋅ I CC                          (W)

Then, the power dissipated by each amplifier is:
                                       P       = P                           – P out              (W)

                                                  π RL
and the maximum value is obtained when:
                                                         ∂P d iss

                                                            ∂P out
and its value is:
                                                                       2V cc   2
                                          P dissmax = ------------               -         (W)

Note:    This maximum value is only depending on power supply voltage and load values.
The efficiency, η, is the ratio between the output power and the power supply:
                                                               P o ut              π V PEAK

The maximum theoretical value is reached when VPEAK = VCC, so that:
                                                                π

                                                                 4
The TS4984 has two independent power amplifiers, and each amplifier produces heat due to its power
dissipation. Therefore, the maximum die temperature is the sum of the each amplifier’s maximum power
dissipation. It is calculated as follows:
                         Pdiss L = Power dissipation due to the left channel power amplifier.
                        Pdiss R = Power dissipation due to the right channel power amplifier.
                                             Total Pdiss = P diss L + Pdiss R (W)
In most cases, Pdiss L = Pdiss R, giving:
                                         Total P                  = 2P                        (W)

or, stated differently:

4.5 Decoupling the circuit
Two capacitors are needed to correctly bypass the TS4984. A power supply bypass capacitor CS and a
bias voltage bypass capacitor CB.
CS has particular influence on the THD+N in the high frequency region (above 7 kHz) and an indirect
influence on power supply disturbances. With a value for CS of 1 µF, you can expect similar THD+N
performances to those shown in the datasheet. For example:
   l In the high frequency region, if CS is lower than 1 µF, it increases THD+N and disturbances on the
                     power supply rail are less filtered.
   l On the other hand, if CS is higher than 1 µF, those disturbances on the power supply rail are more
                     filtered.
Cb has an influence on THD+N at lower frequencies, but its function is critical to the final result of PSRR
(with input grounded and in the lower frequency region), in the following manner:
   l If C b is lower than 1µF, THD+N increases at lower frequencies and PSRR worsens.
   l If C b is higher than 1µF, the benefit on THD+N at lower frequencies is small, but the benefit to PSRR
                     is substantial.
Note that C in has a non-negligible effect on PSRR at lower frequencies. The lower the value of Cin, the
higher the PSRR.
4.6 Wake-up time, TWU
When the standby is released to put the device ON, the bypass capacitor C b will not be charged
immediately. As Cb is directly linked to the bias of the amplifier, the bias will not work properly until the Cb
voltage is correct. The time to reach this voltage is called wake-up time or TWU and specified in electrical
characteristics table with Cb = 1 µF.
If Cb has a value other than 1 µF, please refer to the graph in Figure 66 to establish the wake-up time
value.
Due to process tolerances, the maximum value of wake-up time could be establish by the graph in
Figure 67.

Note:                       Bypass capacitor Cb as also a tolerance of typically +/-20%. To calculate the wake-up time with this tolerance,
                            refer to the previous graph (considering for example for Cb = 1 µF in the range of 0.8 µF ≤ 1 µF ≤ 1.2 µF).

4.7 Shutdown time
When the standby command is set, the time required to put the two output stages in high impedance and
the internal circuitry in shutdown mode is a few microseconds.
Note:   In shutdown mode, Bypass pin and Vin- pin are short-circuited to ground by internal switches. This allows for
        the quick discharge of the Cb and Cin capacitors.
4.8 Pop performance
Pop performance is intimately linked with the size of the input capacitor Cin and the bias voltage bypass
capacitor Cb.
The size of Cin is dependent on the lower cut-off frequency and PSRR values requested. The size of Cb
is dependent on THD+N and PSRR values requested at lower frequencies.
Moreover, Cb determines the speed with which the amplifier turns ON. In order to reach near zero pop
and click, the equivalent input constant time is:
                                                tin = (Rin + 2 kΩ) x Cin (s) with Rin ≥ 5 kΩ
must not reach the τin maximum value as indicated in the graph below in Figure 68.

                                                          Bypass Capacitor Cb ( F)
By following previous rules, the TS4984 can reach near zero pop and click even with high gains such as
20 dB.
Example calculation
With R in = 22 kΩ and a 20 Hz, -3 db low cut-off frequency, Cin = 361 nF. So, Cin =390 nF with standard
value which gives a lower cut-off frequency equal to 18.5 Hz. In this case, (Rin + 2 kΩ) x Cin = 9.36 ms.
When referring to the previous graph, if Cb =1 µF and Vcc = 5 V, we read 20 ms max. This value is twice
as high as our current value, thus we can state that pop and click will be reduced to its lowest value.
Minimizing both Cin and the gain benefits both the pop phenomena, and the cost and size of the
application.
                                                                                                               23/29


4.9 Application example: Differential-input BTL power stereo amplifier
The schematic in Figure 69 shows how to design the TS4984 to work in differential-input mode. For this
discussion, only the left-channel amplifier will be referred to.
Let:
       R1R = R2L = R1, R2R = R2L = R2
       CinR = C inL = Cin
The gain of the amplifier is:
                                                                                    R2
                                                                       G vdif = 2 × -------

In order to reach the optimal performance of the differential function, R1 and R2 should be matched at 1%
maximum.

The value of the input capacitor CIN can be calculated with the following formula, using the -3dB lower
frequency required (where FL is the lower frequency required):
                                                        1
                                             C IN ≈            (F )
                                                    2 π R 1 FL
Note:   This formula is true only if:
                          1
         FCB =                        (Hz )
                 2 π (R 1 + R 2 ) C B
        is 5 times lower than FL.
