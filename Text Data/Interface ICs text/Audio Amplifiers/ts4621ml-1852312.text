         1. All voltage values are measured with respect to the ground pin.
         2. Thermal shutdown is activated when maximum junction temperature is reached.
         3. The device is protected from overtemperature by a thermal shutdown mechanism, active at 150° C.
         4. Exceeding the power derating curves for long periods may provoke abnormal operation.
         5. Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
            1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
            while the other pins are floating.
         6. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
            two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
            connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
         7. The measurement is performed on an evaluation board, with ESD protection EMIF02-AV01F3.

4        Application information
4.1      Gain control
         The TS4621ML has two gain settings which are controlled via the GAIN pin:
            GAIN voltage       Amplifier gain
                ≤ 0.6 V              0 dB
                ≥ 1.3 V              6 dB
Note:    See Table 5: Electrical characteristics of the amplifier for VIH and VIL levels.
4.2      Overview of the class-G, 2-level headphone amplifier
         The TS4621ML uses what is referred to as class-G operating mode. This mode is a
         combination of the class AB biasing technique and an adaptive power supply. For this
         device, the power supply uses two levels: ±1.2 V and ±1.9 V.
         To create the ±1.2 V and ±1.9 V levels, the device uses an internal high-efficiency step-
         down converter linked with a fully capacitive inverter from AVdd. Thanks to these internally-
         generated symmetrical power supply voltages, the output of the amplifier can be biased at
         0 V, thus eliminating the classical bulky DC blocking output capacitors (typically more than
         100 μF).

         When an audio signal is playing with the TS4621ML, the class G feature adjusts in real time
         the internal power supply voltage in order to achieve the best efficiency possible. In addition,
         thanks to the fast transient response of the internal DC/DC converters, the switching
         between ±1.2 V and ±1.9 V can be achieved without audio clipping. Moreover, the out-of-

           Most audio signals have a crest factor higher than 6 dB (10 dB on average), which means
           that most of the time the music level is low. In this case, the setting of the internal DC/DC
           converters is low (1.2 V) and in this way, helps to minimize the power dissipation.
           When the audio signal amplitude increases due to a peak or louder music, the setting of the
           internal DC/DC converters increases to 1.9 V, automatically increasing the output dynamic
           range. This 1.9 V value remains until the end of the decay time.

4.3      External component selection
         The TS4621ML requires few external passive components to operate correctly. Each
         component is described in the following sections.
4.3.1    Step-down inductor selection (L1)
         The TS4621ML needs one inductor for the internal step-down DC/DC converter. This
         inductor must fit the following constraints:
         ●    Typical value: 2.2 µH to 3.3 µH (3.3 µH is recommended)
         ●    Maximum current in operating mode: 400 mA
         ●    Minimum inductor value at maximum current: 1.5 µH
         ●    Maximum inductor value at zero current: 4.3 µH
         ●    DC resistance: from 50 mΩ up to 450 mΩ
         Table 6 shows the part number that should be used according to the inductor value.

4.3.2    Step-down output capacitor selection (Ct)
         For the internal DC/DC step-down converter, the TS4621ML needs one output capacitor.
         The three criteria for selecting the output capacitor are the range value of the capacitor
         including self tolerance, DC variation and the minimum ESR value, which is mandatory to
         avoid oscillation of the converter. Therefore the following constraints must be observed.
         ●    Typical capacitor value: 10 µF at DC = 0 V
         ●    Maximum capacitor value: 12 µF at DC = 0 V
         ●    Minimum capacitor value: 4.8 µF at DC = 2 V
         ●    Voltage range across this capacitor: from 1.1 V to 2 V
         ●    Minimum DC ESR value: 5 mΩ
         A ceramic capacitor in a 0603-type package is also recommended because of its close
         placement to the TS4621ML, which makes it easier to minimize parasitic inductance and
         resistance that have a negative impact on the audio performance.

4.3.3       Full capacitive inverter capacitors selection (C12 and CSS)
            Two capacitors (C12 and Css) are needed for this internal DC/DC inverter.
            The three criteria for selecting these capacitors are the range value of the capacitor
            including self tolerance, DC variation and the minimum ESR to minimize power losses.
            ●      Typical capacitor value: 2.2 µF +/-20 %
            ●      Voltage across these capacitors: from 1.1 V to 2 V
            ●      Minimum capacitor value: 1 µF
            Again, a ceramic capacitor in a 0603 or 0402-type package is also recommended because
            of their close placement to the TS4621ML, which makes it easier to minimize parasitic
            inductance and resistance that have a negative impact on the audio performance.
4.3.4       Power supply decoupling capacitor selection (Cs)
            A 2.2 µF decoupling capacitor with low ESR is recommended for positive power supply
            decoupling. Packages such as the 0402 or 0603 are also recommended because of their
            close placement to the TS4621ML, which makes it easier to minimize parasitic inductance.
            It is advised to choose a X5R dielectric for capacitor tolerance, and a 10 V DC rating voltage
            for 4.8 V operations (or a 6.3 V DC rating voltage for 3.6 V operations), to take into
            consideration the ΔC/ΔV variation of this type of ceramic capacitor.
            An important parameter is the rated voltage of the capacitor. A 2.2 µF/6.3 V capacitor used
            at 4.8 V DC typically loses about 40 % of its value. In fact, with a 4.8 V power supply voltage,
            the decoupling value is about 1.3 µF instead of 2.2 µF. Because the decoupling capacitor
            influences the THD+N in the medium-to-high frequency region, this capacitor variation
            becomes decisive. In addition, less decoupling means higher overshoots, which can be
            problematic if they reach the power supply’s AMR value (5.5 V). This is why, for a 2.2 µF
            value, we recommend a 2.2 µF/10 V, a 4.7 µF/6.3 V or a ceramic capacitor with a low DC
            bias variation rated at 6.3 V.
4.3.5       Input coupling capacitor selection (Cin)
            Cin input coupling capacitors are mandatory for the TS4621ML’s operation. They block any
            DC component coming from the audio signal source.
            Cin with Rin form a first-order high-pass filter and the -3 dB cut-off frequency is:
                                                                                   1
                                               FC ( – 3dB ) = --------------------------------------------
                                                              2 × π × Rin × Cin
            Rin is the single-ended input impedance that can be approximated at about Rindiff/2.
            Rin also depends on the gain setting. Figure 10 provides the differential input impedance vs.
            gain. One can also see that Rindiff is minimum for the maximum gain setting (that is, 6 dB).

TS4621ML                                                                       Application information
         Therefore, in most cases, Rin should be set to 6 dB to calculate the minimum input capacitor
         Cin.
         Example:
         In this case and for a -3 dB cut-off frequency of 20 Hz, Cin = 0.64 µF. The closest normalized
         value is 0.68 µF but a 1 µF capacitor is more suitable to take into consideration the capacitor
         tolerance +/-20 %.
         If the aim is to have the 20 Hz at -1 dB, the capacitor has to be multiplied by 1.96. As such,
         Cin = 0.64 x 1.96 = 1.25 µF. The closest normalized value would be 1.5 µF or 2.2 µF.
4.3.6    Low-pass output filter (Rout and Cout) and IEC 61000-4-2 ESD
         protection
         The TS4621ML is designed to operate with a passive first-order low-pass filter (as shown in
         Figure 1). This low-pass filter is mandatory to ensure correct operation of the TS4621ML
         over the volume range and output capacitance range vs. load.
         Rout must have a value of 12 Ω minimum and Cout a value of 0.8 nF minimum up to 100 nF
         maximum. Values of 12 Ω and 1 nF are a good starting point for a design to be able to drive
         a classic headphone (16 Ω, 32 Ω, 60 Ω) and the line-in of any hi-fi system or sound card.
         The cutoff frequency of this filter (12 Ω and 1 nF) is approximately 13 MHz and clearly
         above the audio band.
         However, this output RC filter is also a part of the IEC 61000-4-2 ESD protection. In most
         cases, this RC filter is designed with transient absorbers and the final solution can be a
         discrete solution or an integrated solution. ST Microelectronics’ portfolio has many
         integrated solutions for ESD, but one dedicated to headphone amplifiers in particular:
         IPAD(a) reference EMIF02-AV01F3.
         To fit the IEC 61000-4-2 standard, this audio line IPAD can be added to the output of the
         TS4621ML as shown in Figure 67.

                   By adding this ESD protection, the TS4621ML complies with the IEC 61000-4-2 level 4
                   standard on jack pins. Our demonstration board has been tested using the same conditions
                   as those outlined in the IEC 61000-4-2 standard. Results may differ depending on the layout
                   of the PCB.

                   ●    8 kV (contact discharge)
                   This IPAD has an internal series resistor Rout = 15 Ω +/-20 % and an output capacitor
                   Cout = 3.2 nF +/-25 %.
4.3.7              Integrated input low-pass filter
                   The TS4621ML has an integrated internal first-order low-pass filter with a -3 dB cutoff . This
                   integrated filter is present on each input and filters any out-of-band audio noise coming from
                   the audio source.
4.4                Single-ended input configuration
                   The TS4621ML can be used in a single-ended input configuration. InR- and InL- or InR+
                   and InL+ can be shorted to ground through input capacitors. All Cin capacitors must have
                   the same value to keep the same PSRR performance as in a differential input configuration.
                   Figure 68 and Figure 69 show how to connect the TS4621ML. Note the ground connection
                   of each input. To avoid PSRR issues resulting from any ground noise, this connection must

               If these inputs are connected to AGnd (the ground of the TS4621ML class-G), the output
               voltage can be expressed by the following simplified equation from an AC point of view.
               Equation 1
               Vout = Av x (Vaudio + Vmc + Vgndnoise) + Vbatnoise x PSRR
               As shown in Equation 1, any ground noise and any parasitic AC voltage on Vmc is directly
               multiplied by the gain of the amplifier. If Vmc can be totally controlled by the design of the
               audio source device (no parasitic AC voltage), it is not necessarily the case for Vgndnoise.
               This noise can be significantly reduced by an adequate low impedance ground plane, but
               not totally eliminated. In practice, only ten millivolts in the right frequency range are enough
               to produce an audible parasitic sound in the headphone with a volume level as low as
               -20 dB.

              Correct connection location
              As shown in Figure 71, the best option is to route the single-ended signal in parallel with the
              AC ground line of the other input. The AC grounded terminal must be routed in parallel to
              the audio signal and grounded with the ground of the audio source.

              In this configuration, the AC output voltage is:
              Equation 2
              Vout = Av x (Vaudio + Vmc) + Vgndnoise x CMRR + Vbatnoise x PSRR
              In Equation 2 the ground noise is attenuated by the performance of the CMRR. In practice,
              50 dB of CMRR and ten millivolts for ground noise gives an output of approximately 30 µV,
              which is normally too low to be perceptible in the headphone. If Vmc is also totally controlled
              by the design of the audio source, Equation 2 becomes:
              Equation 3
              Vout = Av x Vaudio + Vbatnoise x PSRR
              Like in differential mode, the main contributor for audio signal degradation is the AC noise
              voltage on Vbat. Thanks to the TS4621ML’s very high PSRR that can attenuate GSM burst
              noise, Equation 3 becomes:
              Equation 4
              Vout = Av x Vaudio

Application information                                                                          TS4621ML
4.5         Startup phase
            The TS4621ML uses different techniques to reduce the DC current consumption and offer a
            pop-and-click performance close to none.
4.5.1       Auto zero technology
            During the startup phase, the differential output voltage is sensed and adjusted to 0 V
            (+/-500 μV) to avoid any pop noise when the amplifier becomes operational. This also helps
            to minimize extra current consumption due to the load (Icc-extra = VoutDC / Rload).
4.5.2       Input impedance
            The TS4621ML requires input coupling capacitors. The usual lowest frequency used for the
            headphone is close to 20 Hz. This frequency means a constant time for a first-order high-
            pass filter of approximately 1 / (2 x Pi x 20) = 8 ms.
            To achieve 95 % of the capacitor’s charge, it is necessary to wait 3 x 8 ms = 24 ms, which is
            out of range for a device with a fast startup time.
            Because of the mismatching of all input capacitors and input resistors, if it is decided to start
            the TS4621ML at a time of 8 ms, a voltage difference at the inputs (multiplied by the gain)
            can create a voltage step on the output and consequently a pop noise.
            To avoid this issue during the starting phase, the TS4621ML accelerates the charging of the
            input capacitors by reducing the input impedance to 2 kΩ.
            In such a case, for a 1 μF capacitor the 95 % charge is reached in 6 ms. As the startup time
            of TS4621ML is 12 ms, there remains sufficient time to fully charge the input capacitors and
            as such eliminate any pop noise.
4.6         Layout recommendations
            Particular attention must be given to the correct layout of the PCB traces and wires between
            the amplifier, load and power supply (in most cases, the battery of the cellular phone).
            The power and ground traces are critical since they must provide adequate energy and
            grounding for all circuits. Good practice is to use short and wide PCB traces to minimize
            voltage drops and parasitic inductance.
            A track with a width of at least 200 μm for a copper thickness of 18 μm is recommended for
            bringing energy to the amplifier from the battery.
            Proper grounding guidelines help improve audio performances, minimize crosstalk between
            channels, and prevent switching noise from coupling into the audio signal. It is also
            recommended to use a large-area and multi-via ground plane to minimize parasitic
            impedance.
            A multi-layer PCB board allows double or multiple ground planes to be implemented. Most of
            the time, the top and bottom layers are used as ground planes and provide shielding for
            tracks routed on the intermediate layers. In addition, to minimize parasitic impedance over
            the entire surface, a multi-via technique that connects the bottom and top layer ground
            planes together in many locations is often used.
            The copper traces that connect the output pins to the load and supply pins should be as
            wide as possible to minimize the trace resistances.

4.6.1    Common-mode sense layout
         The TS4621ML implements a common-mode sense pin to correct any voltage differences
         that might occur between the return of the headphone jack and the AGND of the device that
         can create parasitic noise in the headphone and/or line out.
         The solution to strongly reduce and practically eliminate this noise consists in connecting
         the headphone jack ground to the CMS pin. This pin senses the difference of potential
         (voltage noise) between the TS4621ML ground and the headphone ground. Thanks to the
         frequency response and the attenuation of the common-mode sense pin, this noise is
         removed from the TS4621ML outputs.
