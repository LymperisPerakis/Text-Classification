      APPLICATIVE SUGGESTIONS
 .1 STAND-BY AND MUTE FUNCTIONS
 .1.1 (A) Microprocessor Application
n order to avoid annoying "Pop-Noise" during Turn-On/Off transients, it is necessary to guarantee the right St-
 y and mute signals sequence.It is quite simple to obtain this function using a microprocessor (Fig. 4 and 5).
At first St-by signal (from µP) goes high and the voltage across the St-by terminal (Pin 11) starts to increase
 xponentially. The external RC network is intended to turn-on slowly the biasing circuits of the amplifier, this to
 void "POP" and "CLICK" on the outputs.
When this voltage reaches the St-by threshold level, the amplifier is switched-on and the external capacitors in
 eries to the input terminals (C1, C3) start to charge.
t's necessary to mantain the mute signal low until the capacitors are fully charged, this to avoid that the device
 oes in play mode causing a loud "Pop Noise" on the speakers.
A delay of 100-200ms between St-by and mute signals is suitable for a proper operation.

 .1.2 B) Low Cost Application
n low cost applications where the µP is not present, the suggested circuit is shown in fig.6.
The St-by and mute terminals are tied together and they are connected to the supply line via an external voltage
 ivider.
The device is switched-on/off from the supply line and the external capacitor C4 is intended to delay the St-by
 nd mute threshold exceeding, avoiding "Popping" problems.
So to avoid any popping or clicking sond, it is important to clock:
   a Correct Sequence: At turn-ON, the Stand-by must be removed at first, then the Mute must be re-
     leased after a delay of about 100-200ms. On the contrary at turn-OFF the Mute must be activated
     as first and then the Stand-by.
     With the values suggested in the Application circuit the right operation is guaranteed.
   b Correct Threshold Voltages: In order to avoid that due to the spread in the internal thresholds (see
     the above limits) a wrong external voltage causes uncertain commutations for the two functions we
     suggest to use the following values:
                   Mute for Vcc>6.4V          : VT = 2.3V
                   Mute for Vcc<6.4V          : VT = Vcc/2 - 1
                   Stand-by                   : VT = 0.8V
                                                                                                             5/12

      PCB LAYOUT AND EXTERNAL COMPONENTS
Regarding the PCB layout care must be taken for three main subjects:
 ) Signal and Power Gnd separation
 ) Dissipating Copper Area
 ) Filter Capacitors positioning
 ) Signal and Power Gnd separation:
   To the Signal GND must be referred the Audio Input Signals, the Mute and Stand-by Voltages and the
   device PIN.14. This Gnd path must be as clean as possible in order to improve the device THD+Noise
   and to avoid spurious oscillations across the speakers.
   The Power GND is directly connected to the Output power Stage transistors (Emitters) and is crossed
   by large amount of current, this path is also used in this device to dissipate the heating generated (no
   needs of external heatsinker).
   Referring to the typical application circuit, the separation between the two GND paths must be obtained
   connecting them separately (star routing) to the bulk
   Electrolithic capacitor C1 (470µF).
   Regarding the Power Gnd dimensioning we have to consider the Dissipated Power the Thermal Pro-
   tection Threshold and the Package thermal Characteristics.
 ) Dissipating Copper Area:
   Dissipated Power:
   The max dissipated power happens for a THD near 1% and is given by the formula:
                                                                           2
                                                               V CC
                                            P dmax ( W ) = 2 ⋅ -------------- + Iq V CC
                                                                   2 Rl
                                                                π ------
                                                                        2
   This gives for: Vcc = 7.5V, Rl = 8Ω ,Iq = 40mA a dissipated power of Pd = 3W.
   Thermal Protection:
   The thermal protection threshold is placed at a junction temperature of 150°C.
   Package Thermal Characteristics:
   The thermal resistance Junction to Ambient obtainable with a GND copper Area of 3x3 cm and with 16 via
   holes (see picture) is about 25°C/W. This means that with the above mentioned max dissipated Power
   (Pd=3W) we can expect a 75°C, this gives a safety margin before the thermal protection intervention in the
   consumer environments where a 50°C ambient is specified as maximum
Figure 11.
 )Filter Capacitors Positioning:
  The two Ceramic capacitors C2/C7 (100nF) must be placed as close as possible
  respectively to the two Vcc pins ( 7 - 18) in order to avoid the possibiltiy of oscillations arising on the
  output Audio signals.
