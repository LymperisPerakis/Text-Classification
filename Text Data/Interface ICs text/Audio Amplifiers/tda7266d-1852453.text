APPLICATIVE SUGGESTIONS
STAND-BY AND MUTE FUNCTIONS
(A) Microprocessor Application
In order to avoid annoying "Pop-Noise" during Turn-On/Off transients, it is necessary to guarantee the right St-
by and mute signals sequence.It is quite simple to obtain this function using a microprocessor (Fig. 1 and 2).
At first St-by signal (from µP) goes high and the voltage across the St-by terminal (Pin 9) starts to increase ex-
ponentially. The external RC network is intended to turn-on slowly the biasing circuits of the amplifier, this to
avoid "POP" and "CLICK" on the outputs.
When this voltage reaches the St-by threshold level, the amplifier is switched-on and the external capacitors in
series to the input terminals (C1, C3) start to charge.
It's necessary to mantain the mute signal low until the capacitors are fully charged, this to avoid that the device
goes in play mode causing a loud "Pop Noise" on the speakers.
A delay of 100-200ms between St-by and mute signals is suitable for a proper operation.

B) Low Cost Application
In low cost applications where the mP is not present, the suggested circuit is shown in fig.3.
The St-by and mute terminals are tied together and they are connected to the supply line via an external voltage
divider.
The device is switched-on/off from the supply line and the external capacitor C4 is intended to delay the St-by
and mute threshold exceeding, avoiding "Popping" problems.
So to avoid any popping or clicking sond, it is important to clock:
   a Correct Sequence: At turn-ON, the Stand-by must be removed at first, then the Mute must be re-
     leased after a delay of about 100-200ms. On the contrary at turn-OFF the Mute must be activated
     as first and then the Stand-by.
     With the values suggested in the Application circuit the right operation is guaranteed.
   b Correct Threshold Voltages: In order to avoid that due to the spread in the internal thresholds (see
     the above limits) a wrong external voltage causes uncertain commutations for the two functions we
     suggest to use the following values:
                   Mute for Vcc>6.4V          : VT = 2.3V
                   Mute for Vcc<6.4V          : VT = Vcc/2 - 1
                   Stand-by                   : VT = 0.8V
                                                                                                             5/13

PCB Layout and External Components:
Regarding the PCB layout care must be taken for three main subjects:
c) Signal and Power Gnd separation
d) Dissipating Copper Area
e) Filter Capacitors positioning
)Signal and Power Gnd separation:
   c To the Signal GND must be referred the Audio Input Signals, the Mute and Stand-by Voltages and
      the device PIN.13. This Gnd path must be as clean as possible in order to improve the device
      THD+Noise and to avoid spurious oscillations across the speakers.
      The Power GND is directly connected to the Output power Stage transistors (Emitters) and is crossed
      by large amount of current, this path is also used in this device to dissipate the heating generated (no
      needs of external heatsinker).
      Referring to the typical application circuit, the separation between the two GND paths must be ob-
      tained connecting them separately (star routing) to the bulk
      Electrolithic capacitor C1 (470µF).
      Regarding the Power Gnd dimensioning we have to consider the Dissipated Power the Thermal Pro-
      tection Threshold and the Package thermal Characteristics.

   d Dissipating Copper Area:
      Dissipated Power:
      The max dissipated power happens for a THD near 1% and is given by the formula:
                                                                          2

                                           P dmax ( W ) = 2 ⋅ -------------
                                                                          - + I q V CC
                                                                  2 Rl
                                                               π ------
                                                                       2
This gives for: Vcc = 9.5V, Rl = 8Ω ,Iq = 50mA a dissipated power of Pd = 5W.
Thermal Protection:
The thermal protection threshold is placed at a junction temperature of 150°C.
Package Thermal Characteristics:
The thermal resistance Junction to Ambient obtainable with a GND copper Area of 3x3 cm and with 16 via
holes (see picture) is about 15°C/W. This means that with the above mentioned max dissipated Power (Pd=5W)
we can expect a 75°C, this gives a safety margin before the thermal protection intervention in the consumer
environments where a 50°C ambient is specified as maximum
The Thermal constraints determine the max supply voltage that can be used for the different Load Impedances,
this in order to avoid the thermal Protection Intervention.
The max. dissipated power must be not in excess of 5W , this at turns gives the following operating supply volt-
ages:

                           16                                                          14
   e Filter Capacitors Positioning:
      The two Ceramic capacitors C2/C7 (100nF) must be placed as close as possible
      respectively to the two Vcc pins ( 6 - 15) in order to avoid the possibiltiy of oscillations arising on the
      output Audio signals.
Package Informations:
You can find a complete description for the PowerSO package into the APPLICATION NOTE AN668 available
on web.
Here we want to focalize the attention only on the the Dissipating elements and ground layer.
                                                                                                             7/13


TDA7266D
Considering the dissipated power involved in the TDA7266D application that is in the range of 5W, as explained
in a previous section, we suggest via holes ( see fig. 4).
Using via holes a more direct thermal path is obtained from the slug to the ground layer.The number of vias is
chosen accordingly to the desired performance (in our demonstration board we use 15 vias).
In fig.4 is shown as an example the footprint to be used to create the vias.
Figure 4.
The above metioned mounting solution is enough to dissipate the power involved
In the most part of the application using the TDA7266D.
If necessary a further improvement in the Rth J-Ambient can be obtained as shown in fig.5 where the
PowerSO20 is soldered onto a via hole structure with a metal plate glued on the opposite side of the board.
