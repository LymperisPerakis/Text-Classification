Description
                                                         It can also deliver 20 W + 20 W into 8-Ω loads
The STA533WF is a monolithic quad half-bridge            with 10% THD at VCC = 18 V in BTL configuration
stage in multipower BCD technology. The device           or, in single parallel BTL configuration, 40 W into
can be used as a dual bridge or reconfigured, by         a 4-Ω load with 10% THD at VCC = 18 V.
connecting pin CONFIG to pins VDD, as a single
bridge with double-current capability.                   The input pins have a threshold proportional to
                                                         the voltage on pin VL.
The device is designed for the output stage of a
stereo Full Flexible Amplifier (FFX™). It is             The STA533WF comes in a 36-pin PowerSSO
capable of delivering 10 W x 4 channels into 4-Ω         package with exposed pad down (EPD).

STA533WF                                                                      Applications information
3        Applications information
         The STA533WF is a dual-channel H-bridge audio power amplifier that can deliver 20 W per
         channel into 8 Ω with 10% THD at VCC = 18 V with high efficiency.
         The STA533WF converts both FFX and binary-logic-controlled PWM signals into audio
         power at the load. It includes a logic interface, integrated bridge drivers, high-efficiency
         MOSFET outputs and thermal and short-circuit protection circuitry.
         In FFX mode, two logic-level signals per channel are used to control the high-speed
         MOSFET switches which drive the speaker load in a bridge configuration, according to the
         damped ternary modulation operation.
         In binary mode, both full-bridge and half-bridge modes are supported.
         The STA533WF includes overcurrent and thermal protection as well as an undervoltage
         lockout with automatic recovery. A thermal warning status is also provided.

         Logic interface and decode
         The STA533WF power outputs are controlled using one or two logic-level timing signals. In
         order to provide a proper logic interface, pin VL must have the same voltage as the PWM
         input signal.

Applications information                                                                            STA533WF
           Protection circuits
           The STA533WF includes protection circuitry for overcurrent and thermal overload
           conditions. A thermal warning pin (THWARN) is activated low (open-drain MOSFET) when
           the IC temperature exceeds 130 °C, which is in advance of the thermal shutdown protection.
           When a fault condition is detected an internal fault signal acts to immediately disable the
           output power MOSFETs, placing both H-bridges in the high-impedance state. At the same
           time an open-drain MOSFET connected to pin FAULT is switched on.
           There are two possible modes subsequent to activating a fault:
           ●     Shutdown mode:
                 with pins FAULT (with pull-up resistor) and TRISTATE independent, an activated fault
                 disables the device, signalling low at pin FAULT.
                 The device may subsequently be reset to normal operation by toggling pin TRISTATE
                 from high to low and back to high using an external logic signal.
           ●     Automatic recovery mode:
                 This is shown in the applications circuit in Figure 6 and Figure 7 on page 10.
                 Pins FAULT and TRISTATE are shorted together and connected to a time constant
                 circuit comprising R59 and C58.
                 An activated fault forces a reset on pin TRISTATE causing normal operation to resume
                 following a delay determined by the time constant of the circuit.
                 If the fault condition is still present this operation continues to repeat until the fault
                 condition is removed.
                 An increase in the time constant of the circuit produces a longer recovery interval.
           Care must be taken in the overall system design so as not to exceed the protection
           thresholds under normal operation.
           Power outputs
           The STA533WF power and output pins are duplicated to provide a low-impedance path for
           the device bridged outputs. All duplicated power, ground and output pins must be connected
           for reliable operation.
           Pins PWRDN or TRISTATE should be used to set all MOSFETS to the high-impedance
           state during power-up and until the logic power supply on pin VL has settled.
           Parallel-output and high-current operation
           When using FFX mode, the STA533WF outputs can be connected in parallel to increase the
           output current capability. In this configuration the device can provide 40 W into 4 Ω.
           This mode of operation is enabled with pin CONFIG connected to VDD. The inputs must be
           combined to give INLA = INLB and INRA = INRB, then the corresponding outputs can be
           shorted together to give OUTLA = OUTLB and OUTRA = OUTRB.
           The snubber RC network shown in the applications figures must be placed as close as
           possible to the output pins. This reduces ringing, over- and undervoltage effects, and
           improves the audio quality and EMI performance.

STA533WF                                                                     Applications information
         Supply decoupling capacitors
         To meet the performance figures given in this datasheet the STA533WF power supply must
         be adequately filtered.
         For this purpose capacitors connected from pins VCC1 to GND1 and from VCC2 to GND2
         must be placed as close as possible to the related IC pins.
         For reliability and optimum performance the following capacitors are suggested:
         ●     100-nF ceramic capacitor with lead length less than 2 mm, connected to the ground
               plane and as close as possible to the GND pin
         ●     1-uF X7R (low ESR) capacitors.
         Pin GNDREG is used to filter the internal reference voltage VDD; This pin must not be
         connected to other ground pins, it is an internally generated supply.
         Pin VCCSIG is used to filter the internal reference voltage VSS; This pin must not be
         connected to other supply pins, it is an internally generated supply.
         Output filter
         A passive 2nd-order filter is used on the STA533WF power outputs to reconstruct an analog
         audio signal. The system performance can be significantly affected by the output filter
         design and choice of passive components.
         Filter designs for 4-Ω and 8-Ω loads are shown in the applications circuits below.
         Applications circuits
         Figure 6 shows a typical full-bridge circuit for supplying 20 W + 20 W into 8-Ω speakers with
         10% THD when VCC = 18 V.
         Figure 7 shows a single-BTL configuration capable of supplying 40 W into a 4-Ω load at
         10% THD when VCC = 19 V. This result was obtained with peak power for <1 s using the
         STA309A + STA533WF demo board.
         For both applications circuits a PWM modulator is required as driver.

         Using the STA533WF mounted on a double-layer PCB having 2 copper ground areas of
         3 x 3 cm2 and with 16 via holes the junction to ambient thermal resistance is approximately
         24 °C/W in natural air convection.

         With the dissipated power within the device depending primarily on the supply voltage, the
         load impedance and the output modulation level, the maximum estimated dissipated power,
         Pdmax, for the STA533WF is:
              4 W for 2 x 20 W into 8 Ω at 18 V
              < 5 W for 2 x 10 W into 8 Ω + 1 x 20 W into 4 Ω at 18 V.
