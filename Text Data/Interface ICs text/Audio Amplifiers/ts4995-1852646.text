Description                                              The TS4995 is specifically designed for high
The TS4995 is an audio power amplifier capable           quality audio applications such as mobile phones
of delivering 1.2 W of continuous RMS output             and requires few external components.
power into an 8 Ω load at 5 V. Thanks to its
differential inputs, it exhibits outstanding noise
immunity.
An external standby mode control reduces the
supply current to less than 10 nA. A STBY MODE
pin allows the standby pin to be active high or
low. An internal thermal shutdown protection is
also provided, making the device capable of
sustaining short-circuits.

TS4995                                                                        Application information
4      Application information
4.1    Differential configuration principle
       The TS4995 is a monolithic full-differential input/ output power amplifier with fixed +6 dB
       gain. The TS4995 also includes a common mode feedback loop that controls the output bias
       value to average it at VCC/2 for any DC common mode input voltage. This allows maximum
       output voltage swing, and therefore, to maximize the output power. Moreover, as the load is
       connected differentially instead of single-ended, output power is four times higher for the
       same power supply voltage.
       The advantages of a full-differential amplifier are:
       ●    Very high PSRR (power supply rejection ratio)
       ●    High common mode noise rejection
       ●    Virtually no pop and click without additional circuitry, giving a faster start-up time
            compared to conventional single-ended input amplifiers
       ●    Easier interfacing with differential output audio DAC
       ●    No input coupling capacitors required due to common mode feedback loop
       In theory, the filtering of the internal bias by an external bypass capacitor is not necessary.
       However, to reach maximum performance in all tolerance situations, it is recommended to
       keep this option.
4.2    Common mode feedback loop limitations
       As explained previously, the common mode feedback loop allows the output DC bias voltage
       to be averaged at VCC/2 for any DC common mode bias input voltage.
       Due to the VIC limitation of the input stage (see Table 4 on page 5), the common mode
       feedback loop can fulfil its role only within the defined range.
4.3    Low frequency response
       The input coupling capacitors block the DC part of the input signal at the amplifier inputs. Cin
       and Rin form a first-order high pass filter with -3 dB cut-off frequency.
                                                             1
                                               FCL =                   (Hz)
                                                     2 × π × Rin × Cin
Note:  The input impedance for the TS4995 is typically 20kΩ and there is tolerance around this
       value.
       From Figure 56, you can easily establish the Cin value required for a -3 dB cut-off frequency.

       Therefore, the power dissipated by each amplifier is:
            Pdiss = Psupply - Pout (W)
                                                  2 2V CC
                                         P diss = ---------------------- P out – P out
                                                      π RL
       and the maximum value is obtained when:
                                                       ∂Pdiss
                                                       --------------------- = 0
                                                          ∂P out
       and its value is:
       Equation 3
                                                                 2 Vcc 2
                                            Pdiss max =                       (W)
                                                                   π2RL
Note:  This maximum value is only dependent on the power supply voltage and load values.
       The efficiency is the ratio between the output power and the power supply:
       Equation 4
                                                         P out               πV peak
                                               η = ------------------- = --------------------
                                                     P supply                 4V CC
       The maximum theoretical value is reached when Vpeak = VCC, so:
                                                              π
                                                    η = ----     - = 78.5%
                                                               4
       The maximum die temperature allowable for the TS4995 is 125° C. However, in case of
       overheating, a thermal shutdown set to 150° C, puts the TS4995 in standby until the
       temperature of the die is reduced by about 5° C.
       To calculate the maximum ambient temperature Tamb allowable, you need to know:
       ●    The power supply voltage, VCC
       ●    The load resistor value, RL
       ●    The package type, Rthja
       Example: VCC=5 V, RL=8 Ω, Rthja-flipchip= 100° C/W (100 mm2 copper heatsink).
       Using the power dissipation formula given above in Equation 3, this gives a result of:
            Pdissmax = 633mW
       Tamb is calculated as follows:
       Equation 5
                                       T amb = 125° C – R thja × P dissmax
       Therefore, the maximum allowable value for Tamb is:
            Tamb = 125-100x0.633=61.7° C
                                                                                                                19/26

4.5        Decoupling of the circuit
           Two capacitors are needed to correctly bypass the TS4995: a power supply bypass
           capacitor CS and a bias voltage bypass capacitor Cb.
           The CS capacitor has particular influence on the THD+N at high frequencies (above 7 kHz)
           and an indirect influence on power supply disturbances. With a value for CS of 1 µF, one can
           expect THD+N performance similar to that shown in the datasheet.
           In the high frequency region, if CS is lower than 1 µF, then THD+N increases and
           disturbances on the power supply rail are less filtered.
           On the other hand, if CS is greater than 1 µF, then those disturbances on the power supply
           rail are more filtered.
           The Cb capacitor has an influence on the THD+N at lower frequencies, but also impacts
           PSRR performance (with grounded input and in the lower frequency region).
4.6        Wake-up time tWU
           When the standby is released to put the device ON, the bypass capacitor Cb is not charged
           immediately. Because Cb is directly linked to the bias of the amplifier, the bias will not work
           properly until the Cb voltage is correct. The time to reach this voltage is called the wake-up
           time or tWU and is specified in Table 4 on page 5, with Cb=1 µF. During the wake-up phase,
           the TS4995 gain is close to zero. After the wake-up time, the gain is released and set to its
           nominal value.
           If Cb has a value different from 1 µF, then refer to the graph in Figure 57 to establish the
           corresponding wake-up time.

TS4995                                                                       Application information
4.7    Shutdown time
       When the standby command is set, the time required to put the two output stages in high
       impedance and the internal circuitry in shutdown mode is a few microseconds.
Note:  In shutdown mode, the Bypass pin and Vin+, Vin- pins are shorted to ground by internal
       switches. This allows a quick discharge of Cb and Cin.
4.8    Pop performance
       Due to its fully differential structure, the pop performance of the TS4995 is close to perfect.
       However, due to mismatching between internal resistors Rin, Rfeed, and external input
       capacitors Cin, some noise might remain at startup. To eliminate the effect of mismatched
       components, the TS4995 includes pop reduction circuitry. With this circuitry, the TS4995 is
       close to zero pop for all possible common applications.
       In addition, when the TS4995 is in standby mode, due to the high impedance output stage in
       this configuration, no pop is heard.
4.9    Single-ended input configuration
       It is possible to use the TS4995 in a single-ended input configuration. However, input
       coupling capacitors are needed in this configuration. The schematic diagram in Figure 58
       shows an example of this configuration.
                                                                                                 21/26
