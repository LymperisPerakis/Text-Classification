4.1         BTL configuration principle
            The TS4990 is a monolithic power amplifier with a BTL output type. BTL (bridge tied load)
            means that each end of the load is connected to two single-ended output amplifiers. Thus,
            we have:
                 Single-ended output 1 = Vout1 = Vout (V)
                 Single-ended output 2 = Vout2 = -Vout (V)
                 and Vout1 - Vout2 = 2Vout (V)
            The output power is:
                                                                                              2

            For the same power supply voltage, the output power in BTL configuration is four times
            higher than the output power in single-ended configuration.
4.2         Gain in a typical application
            The typical application schematics are shown in Figure 1 on page 4.
            In the flat region (no Cin effect), the output voltage of the first stage is (in Volts):
                                                                                     R feed

                                                                                        R in
            For the second stage: Vout2 = -Vout1 (V)
            The differential output voltage is (in Volts):
                                                                                             R feed
                                                  V out2 – V out1 = 2V in --------------
                                                                                              R in
            The differential gain named gain (Gv) for more convenience is:
                                                        V out2 – V out1                        R feed
                                                G v = ---------------------------------- = 2 --------------
                                                                   V in                          R in
            Vout2 is in phase with Vin and Vout1 is phased 180 with Vin. This means that the positive
            terminal of the loudspeaker should be connected to Vout2 and the negative to Vout1.
4.3         Low and high frequency response
            In the low frequency region, Cin starts to have an effect. Cin forms with Rin a high-pass filter
            with a -3 dB cut-off frequency. FCL is in Hz.
                                                                                     1

                                                                          2R in C in
            In the high frequency region, you can limit the bandwidth by adding a capacitor (Cfeed) in
            parallel with Rfeed. It forms a low-pass filter with a -3 dB cut-off frequency. FCH is in Hz.
                                                                                   1

         Hypotheses:

              Supply voltage is a pure DC source (VCC).
         The load can be expressed as:

         Therefore, the average current delivered by the supply voltage is:
                                                                               V PEAK

            Therefore, the power dissipated by each amplifier is:

Note:       This maximum value is only dependent on power supply voltage and load values.

4.5         Decoupling of the circuit
            Two capacitors are needed to correctly bypass the TS4990: a power supply bypass
            capacitor Cs and a bias voltage bypass capacitor Cb.
            Cs has particular influence on the THD+N in the high frequency region (above 7 kHz) and an
            indirect influence on power supply disturbances. With a value for Cs of 1 µF, you can expect
            THD+N levels similar to those shown in the datasheet.
            In the high frequency region, if Cs is lower than 1 µF, it increases THD+N and disturbances
            on the power supply rail are less filtered.
            On the other hand, if Cs is higher than 1 µF, those disturbances on the power supply rail are
            more filtered.
            Cb has an influence on THD+N at lower frequencies, but its function is critical to the final
            result of PSRR (with input grounded and in the lower frequency region).
            If Cb is lower than 1 µF, THD+N increases at lower frequencies and PSRR worsens.
            If Cb is higher than 1 µF, the benefit on THD+N at lower frequencies is small, but the benefit
            to PSRR is substantial.
            Note that Cin has a non-negligible effect on PSRR at lower frequencies. The lower the value
            of Cin, the higher the PSRR.

4.6      Wake-up time (tWU)
         When the standby is released to put the device ON, the bypass capacitor Cb is not charged
         immediately. Because Cb is directly linked to the bias of the amplifier, the bias will not work
         properly until the Cb voltage is correct. The time to reach this voltage is called wake-up time
         or tWU and specified in the electrical characteristics tables with Cb = 1 µF.
         If Cb has a value other than 1 µF, refer to the graph in Figure 61 to establish the wake-up
         time.

Note:    The bypass capacitor Cb also has a typical tolerance of +/-20%. To calculate the wake-up
         time with this tolerance, refer to the graph above (considering for example for Cb=1 µF in
         the range of 0.8 µF Cb 1.2 µF).
4.7      Standby time
         When the standby command is set, the time required to put the two output stages in high
         impedance and the internal circuitry in standby mode is a few microseconds. In standby
         mode, the bypass pin and Vin pin are short-circuited to ground by internal switches. This
         allows a quick discharge of Cb and Cin capacitors.
                                                                                     DocID9309 Rev 14                                                   21/33

4.8        Pop performance
           Pop performance is intimately linked with the size of the input capacitor Cin and the bias
           voltage bypass capacitor Cb.
           The size of Cin is dependent on the lower cut-off frequency and PSRR values requested.
           The size of Cb is dependent on THD+N and PSRR values requested at lower frequencies.
           Moreover, Cb determines the speed with which the amplifier turns ON. In order to reach
           near zero pop and click, the equivalent input constant time,
               in = (Rin + 2 k) x Cin (s) with Rin  5 k
           must not reach the in maximum value as indicated in Figure 63 below.

           By following the previous rules, the TS4990 can reach near zero pop and click even with
           high gains such as 20 dB.
           Example:
           With Rin = 22 k and a 20 Hz, -3 dB low cut-off frequency, Cin = 361 nF. So, Cin = 390 nF
           with standard value which gives a lower cut-off frequency equal to 18.5 Hz. In this case,
           (Rin + 2k) x Cin = 9.36 ms. By referring to the previous graph, if Cb = 1 µF and VCC = 5 V,
           we read 20 ms max. This value is twice as high as our current value, thus we can state that
           pop and click will be reduced to its lowest value.
           Minimizing both Cin and the gain benefits both the pop phenomenon, and the cost and size
           of the application.

         mode. The gain of the amplifier is:

         In order to reach the best performance of the differential function, R1 and R2 should be
         matched at 1% max.

           The daisy chain sample features two-by-two pin connections. The schematics in Figure 68
           illustrate the way pins connect to each other. This sample is used to test continuity on your
           board. Your PCB needs to be designed the opposite way, so that pins that are unconnected
           in the daisy chain sample, are connected on your PCB. If you do this, by simply connecting
           an Ohmmeter between pin A1 and pin A3, the soldering process continuity can be tested.
