                Warning:    Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute maximum
                            ratings” make cause permanent damage to the device. These
                            are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device
                            at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated
                            under “Recommended operating condition” are not implied.
                            Exposure to absolute-maximum-rated conditions for
                            extended periods may affect device reliability. In the real
                            application, power supply with nominal value rated inside
                            recommended operating conditions, may experience some
                            rising beyond the maximum operating condition for short
                            time when no or very low current is sinked (amplifier in mute
                            state). In this case the reliability of the device is guaranteed,
                            provided that the absolute maximum rating is not exceeded.

4       Power supply and control sequencing
        To guarantee correct operation and reliability, the recommended power-on sequence as
        given below should be followed:
            Apply VCC and VL, in any order, keeping PWRDN low in this phase
            Release PWRDN from low to high, keeping TRISTATE low (until VDD and VSS are
             stable)
            Release TRISTATE from low to high
        Always maintain PWM inputs INxy < VL.
                                     Figure 5. Power-ON sequence
        Power-OFF sequence:
           – When TRISTATE or PWRDN go low, the outputs go into HiZ state
           – Inputs INxy are removed before VL is removed
           – VL can be removed before or after VCC

STA516B                                                                           Technical information
5       Technical information
        The STA516B is a dual channel H-bridge that is able to deliver 200 W per channel (into
        RL = 6  with THD = 10% and VCC = 51 V) of audio output power very efficiently. It operates
        in conjunction with a pulse-width modulator driver such as the STA321 or STA309A.
        The STA516B converts ternary, phase-shift or binary-controlled PWM signals into audio
        power at the load. It includes a logic interface, integrated bridge drivers, high efficiency
        MOSFET outputs and thermal and short-circuit protection circuitry.
        In differential mode (ternary, phase-shift or binary differential), two logic level signals per
        channel are used to control high-speed MOSFET switches to connect the speaker load to
        the input supply or to ground in a bridge configuration, according to the damped ternary
        modulation operation.
        In binary mode, both full bridge and half bridge modes are supported. The STA516B
        includes overcurrent and thermal protection as well as an undervoltage lockout with
        automatic recovery. A thermal warning status is also provided.

5.1     Logic interface and decode
        The STA516B power outputs are controlled using one or two logic-level timing signals. In
        order to provide a proper logic interface, the VL input must operate at the same voltage as
        the DDX control logic supply.

Technical information                                                                                STA516B
5.2         Protection circuitry
            The STA516B includes protection circuitry for overcurrent and thermal overload conditions.
            A thermal warning pin (THWARN, pin 28, open drain MOSFET) is activated low when the IC
            temperature exceeds 130 °C, just in advance of thermal shutdown. When a fault condition is
            detected an internal fault signal immediately disables the output power MOSFETs, placing
            both H-bridges in a high-impedance state. At the same time the open-drain MOSFET of pin
            FAULT (pin 27) is switched on.
            There are two possible modes subsequent to activating a fault.
                Shutdown mode: with pins FAULT (with pull-up resistor) and TRISTATE separate, an
                 activated fault disables the device, signaling a low at pin FAULT output.
                 The device may subsequently be reset to normal operation by toggling pin TRISTATE
                 from high to low to high using an external logic signal.
                Automatic recovery mode: This is shown in the applications circuits below where pins
                 FAULT and TRISTATE are connected together to a time-constant circuit (R59 and
                 C58).
                 An activated fault forces a reset on pin TRISTATE causing normal operation to resume
                 following a delay determined by the time constant of the circuit.
                 If the fault condition persists, the circuit operation repeats until the fault condition is
                 cleared.
                 An increase in the time constant of the circuit produces a longer recovery interval. Care
                 must be taken in the overall system design not to exceed the protection threshold
                 under normal operation.
5.3         Power outputs
            The STA516B power and output pins are duplicated to provide a low-impedance path for the
            device bridged outputs. All duplicate power, ground and output pins must be connected for
            proper operation.
            The PWRDN or TRISTATE pin should be used to set all power MOSFETs to the
            high-impedance state during power-up until the logic power supply, VL, has settled.
5.4         Parallel output / high current operation
            When using the DDX mode output, the STA516B outputs can be connected in parallel in
            order to increase the output current capability to a load. In this configuration the STA516B
            can provide up to 240 W into a 3  load.
            This mode of operation is enabled with the pin CONFIG (pin 24) connected to pin VDD. The
            inputs are joined so that IN1A = IN1B, IN2A = IN2B and similarly the outputs
            OUT1A = OUT1B, OUT2A = OUT2B as shown in Figure 9 on page 13
5.5         Output filtering
            A passive 2nd order filter is used on the STA516B power outputs to reconstruct the analog
            audio signal. System performance can be significantly affected by the output filter design
            and choice of passive components. A filter design for 6 or 8  loads is shown in the
            application circuit of Figure 8, and for 3 or 4  loads in Figure 9 and Figure 10.

        10% THD with VCC = 52 V. This result was obtained using the STA30X+STA50X demo
        board. Note that a PWM modulator as driver is required.
