                                                        The TDA7296 is a monolithic integrated circuit in multiwatt15 package, intended to
                                                        be used as audio class AB amplifier in Hi-Fi field applications (home stereo, self
                                                        powered loudspeakers, top class TV).
                                                        Thanks to the wide voltage range and to the high out current capability, it is able to
                                                        supply the highest power into both 4 Ω and 8 Ω loads even in presence of poor
                                                        supply regulation, with high supply voltage rejection.
                                                        The built in muting function with turn-on delay simplifies the remote operation
               Product status link                      avoiding switching on/off noises.

7               General information
                In consumer electronics, an increasing demand has arisen for very high power monolithic audio amplifiers able to
                match, with a low cost the performance obtained from the best discrete designs.
                The task of realizing this linear integrated circuit in conventional bipolar technology is made extremely difficult by
                the occurrence of 2nd breakdown phenomenon. It limits the safe operating area (SOA) of the power devices, and
                as a consequence, the maximum attainable output power, especially in presence of highly reactive loads.
                Moreover, full exploitation of the SOA translates into a substantial increase in circuit and layout complexity due to
                the need for sophisticated protection circuits.
                To overcome these substantial drawbacks, the use of power MOS devices, which are immune from secondary
                breakdown, is highly desirable. The device described has therefore been developed in a mixed bipolar-MOS high
                voltage technology called BCD 80.
7.1             Output stage
                The main design task to cope with, while developing an integrated circuit as a power operational amplifier,
                regardless the technology used, is to develop the output stage. The solution shown as a principle schematic by
                Fig 18 represents the DMOS unity-gain output buffer of the TDA7296.
                This large-signal, high-power buffer must be able to handle extremely high current and voltage levels while
                maintaining acceptably low harmonic distortion and good behaviour over frequency response; moreover, an
                accurate control of quiescent current is required.
                A local linearising feedback, provided by differential amplifier A, is used to fulfil the above requirements, allowing
                a simple and effective quiescent current setting. Proper biasing of the power output transistors alone is however
                not enough to guarantee the absence of crossover distortion. While a linearisation of the DC transfer
                characteristic of the stage is obtained, the dynamic behaviour of the system must be taken into account.
                A significant aid in keeping the distortion contributed by the final stage as low as possible is provided by the
                compensation scheme, which exploits the direct connection of the Miller capacitor at the amplifier’s output to
                introduce a local AC feedback path enclosing the output stage itself.
7.2             Protections
                When a power IC is being designed, particular attention must be reserved to the circuits devoted to protection of
                the device from short-circuit or overload conditions.
                Due to the absence of the 2nd breakdown phenomenon, the SOA of the power DMOS transistors is delimited only
                by a maximum dissipation curve dependent on the duration of the applied stimulus.
                In order to fully exploit the capabilities of the power transistors, the protection scheme implemented in this device
                combines a conventional SOA protection circuit with a novel local temperature sensing technique, which
                "dynamically" controls the maximum dissipation.

                In addition to the overload protection described above, the device features a thermal shutdown circuit, which
                initially puts the device into a muting state (@ Tj = 145 °C) and then into standby (@ Tj = 150 °C).
                Full protection against electrostatic discharges on every pin is included.
7.3             Other features
                The device is provided with both standby and mute functions, independently driven by two CMOS logic
                compatible input pins.
                The circuits, dedicated to the switching on and off of the amplifier, have been carefully optimized to avoid any kind
                of uncontrolled audible transient on the output.
                The sequence we recommend during the ON/OFF transients is shown in Figure 16. Principle schematic of a
                DMOS unity-gain buffer.
                The application in Figure 18. Single signal standby/mute control circuit shows the possibility to use only one
                command for both standby and mute functions.
                On both pins, the maximum applicable range matches the operating supply voltage.

8               Bridge application
                Another application suggestion is the bridge configuration, where two TDA7296 are used, as shown by the
                schematic diagram.
                In this application, the value of the load must not be lower than 8 Ω for dissipation and current capability reasons.
                A suitable field of application includes HI-FI/TV subwoofers realizations. The main advantages offered by this
                solution are:
                •     High power performance with limited supply voltage level
                •     Considerably high output power even with high load values (i.e. 16 Ω)
                The characteristics shown by Figure 21. Distortion vs. output power (Rl= 16 Ω) and Figure 22. Distortion vs.
                output power ( VS= ± 18 V) , measured with loads respectively 8 Ω and 16 Ω.
                With Rl= 8 Ω, VS = ±18 V the maximum output power obtainable is 60 W, while with Rl=16 Ω, Vs = ±24 V the
                maximum Pout is 60 W.
