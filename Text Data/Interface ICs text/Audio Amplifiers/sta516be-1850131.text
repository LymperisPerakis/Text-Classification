1        General information
         The STA516BE is a second generation, high performance, integrated stereo digital
         amplifier power stage with improved protection system. It is capable of driving a 6 W bridge
         tied load (BTL) at up 250 W per channel with very low noise at the output, low THD+N and
         low idle power dissipation.
         The STA516BE is available in PowerSO-36 slug up package.
         The package contains a heat slug that is located on the top side of the device for
         convenient thermal coupling to the heatsink.

4         Power supply and control sequencing
          To guarantee correct operation and reliability, the recommended power-on sequence as
          given below should be followed:
          •    Apply VCC and VL, in any order, keeping PWRDN low in this phase
          •    Release PWRDN from low to high, keeping TRISTATE low (until VDD and VSS are
               stable)
          •    Release TRISTATE from low to high
          Always maintain PWM inputs INxy < VL.
                                         Figure 4: Power-ON sequence
          VCC should be turned on before VL. This prevents uncontrolled current flowing through the
          internal protection diode connected between VL (logic supply) and VCC (high power supply).
          which could result in damage to the device.
          PWRDN must be released after VL is switched on. An input signal can then be sent to the
          power stage.

5           Technical information
            The STA516BE is a dual channel H-bridge that is able to deliver 200 W per channel (into
            RL = 6 W with THD = 10% and VCC = 51V) of audio output power very efficiently. It operates
            in conjunction with a pulse-width modulator driver such as the STA321 or STA309A.
            The STA516BE converts ternary, phase-shift or binary-controlled PWM signals into audio
            power at the load. It includes a logic interface, integrated bridge drivers, high efficiency
            MOSFET outputs and thermal and short-circuit protection circuitry.
            In differential mode (ternary, phase-shift or binary differential), two logic level signals per
            channel are used to control high-speed MOSFET switches to connect the speaker load to
            the input supply or to ground in a bridge configuration, according to the damped ternary
            modulation operation.
            In binary mode, both full bridge and half bridge modes are supported. The STA516BE
            includes overcurrent and thermal protection as well as an undervoltage lockout with
            automatic recovery. A thermal warning status is also provided.

            The STA516BE power outputs are controlled using one or two logic-level timing signals. In

            the FFX control logic supply.

STA516BE                                                                             Technical information
5.2      Protection circuitry
         The STA516BE includes protection circuitry for overcurrent and thermal overload
         conditions. A thermal warning pin (THWARN, pin 28, open drain MOSFET) is activated low
         when the IC temperature exceeds 130 °C, just in advance of thermal shutdown. When a
         fault condition is detected an internal fault signal immediately disables the output power
         MOSFETs, placing both H-bridges in a high-impedance state. At the same time the
         opendrain MOSFET of pin FAULT (pin 27) is switched on.
         There are two possible modes subsequent to activating a fault.
         •     Shutdown mode: with pins FAULT (with pull-up resistor) and TRISTATE separate, an
               activated fault disables the device, signaling a low at pin FAULT output.
         •     The device may subsequently be reset to normal operation by toggling pin TRISTATE
               from high to low to high using an external logic signal.
         •     Automatic recovery mode: This is shown in the applications circuits below where
               pins FAULT and TRISTATE are connected together to a timeconstant circuit (R59 and
               C58).
         •     An activated fault forces a reset on pin TRISTATE causing normal operation to
               resume following a delay determined by the time constant of the circuit.
         •     If the fault condition persists, the circuit operation repeats until the fault condition is
               cleared.
         •     An increase in the time constant of the circuit produces a longer recovery interval.
               Care must be taken in the overall system design not to exceed the protection
               thresholds under normal operation.
5.3      Power outputs
         The STA516BE power and output pins are duplicated to provide a low-impedance path for
         the device bridged outputs. All duplicate power, ground and output pins must be connected
         for proper operation.
         The PWRDN or TRISTATE pin should be used to set all power MOSFETs to the
         highimpedance state during power-up until the logic power supply, VL, has settled.
5.4      Parallel output / high current operation
         When using the FFX mode output, the STA516BE outputs can be connected in parallel in
         order to increase the output current capability to a load. In this configuration the STA516BE
         can provide up to 240 W into a 3 Ω load.
         This mode of operation is enabled with the pin CONFIG (pin 24) connected to pin VDD.
         The inputs are joined so that IN1A = IN1B, IN2A = IN2B and similarly the outputs
         OUT1A = OUT1B, OUT2A = OUT2B as shown in Figure 9: "Typical Mono-BTL (PBTL)
         configuration".
5.5      Output filtering
         A passive 2nd-order filter is used on the STA516BE power outputs to reconstruct the
         analog audio signal. System performance can be significantly affected by the output filter
         design and choice of passive components. A filter design for 6 or 8 Ω loads is shown in the
         application circuit of Figure 8: "Typical Audio Application circuit (dual BTL)", and for 3 or 4
         Ω loads in Figure 9: "Typical Mono-BTL (PBTL) configuration" and Figure 10: "Typical quad
         half-bridge configuration (Quad Single Ended)".

           Figure 9: "Typical Mono-BTL (PBTL) configuration" below shows a single-BTL configuration
           capable of giving 400 W into a 3 Ω load at 10% THD with VCC = 52 V. STA516BE can also
           drive 2 Ω speakers as single-BTL configuration, to provide up to 280 W per channel at
           10% THD with VCC = 37 V.
           Figure 10: "Typical quad half-bridge configuration (Quad Single Ended)" below shows a
           quad-SE configuration capable of giving 110 W into a 3 Ω load at 10% THD with VCC = 54
           V. STA516BE can also drive 2 Ω speakers as quad-SE configuration, to provide up to 80 W
           per channel at 10% THD with VCC = 38 V.
           All results were obtained using the STA309A+STA516B demo board. Note that a PWM
           modulator as driver is required to feed the STA516BE.
