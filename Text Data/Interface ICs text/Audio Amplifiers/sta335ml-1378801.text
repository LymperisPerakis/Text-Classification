4.1         Serial audio interface protocols
            The STA335ML serial audio input interfaces with standard digital audio components and
            accepts serial data formats. The STA335ML always acts as a slave when receiving audio
            input from standard digital audio components. Serial data for two channels is provided using
            3 input pins: left/right clock LRCKI (pin 29), serial clock BICKI (pin 28), and serial data SDI
            (pin 30).
            The available formats are given in Figure 6 and Figure 7. Pin FMT (pin 2) selects the format
            such that FMT = logical 0 gives the I2S format and FMT = logical 1 gives the left-justified.

STA335ML                                                                         Functional description
4.2      Fault-detect recovery bypass
         The on-chip STA335ML power output block provides feedback to the digital controller using
         inputs to the power control block. The fault input is used to indicate a fault condition (either
         overcurrent or thermal). When fault is asserted (set to 0), the power control block attempts a
         recovery from the fault by asserting the 3-state output (setting it to 0 which directs the power
         output block to begin recovery), holds it at 0 for 1 ms and then toggles it back to 1. This
         sequence is repeated for as long as the fault exists.
4.3      Zero-detect mute enable
         If this function is enabled, the zero-detect circuit examines each processing channel to see if
         2048 consecutive zero value samples (regardless of fs) are received. If so, the channel is
         muted.
4.4      Fade-in/out feature
         The STA335ML has an internal fade-in / fade-out feature when powered on or off, or after a
         fault condition.
4.5      Oversampling selector
         Pin ONSEL (33) is used to configure the PLL to accept 256 * fs or 384 * fs master clock.
         Where fs is the I2S LRCKI frequency:
                ONSEL = logical 0 gives 256 * fs
                ONSEL = logical 1 gives 384 * fs.
4.6      Gain selector
         Pin GAIN (34) is used to configure the STA335ML gain:
                GAIN = logical 0 gives 0 dBFs
                GAIN = logical 1 gives 24 dBFs.
4.7      Power-down function
         Pin PWRDN (23) is used to power down the STA335ML:
                PWRDN = logical 0 sets the power-down mode
                PWRDN = logical 1 gives normal operation.
         If the power stage is switched off, then the PLL is also switched off.
         It is possible to use the PWRDN function as a mute function.

5          Applications
5.1        Applications schematic
           Figure 10 on the next page shows the schematic of a typical application for the STA335ML.
           Concerning the power supplies, take care when designing the PCB layout. In particular, the
           3.3-Ω resistors on the digital supplies (VDD_DIG) must be placed as close as possible to
           the device. This helps to prevent parasitic oscillation in the digital part of the device due to
           the inductive tracks of the PCB. The same rule applies for all the decoupling capacitors in
           order to limit any spikes on the supply pins.
5.2        Internal voltage reference
           An embedded voltage regulator produces the reference voltages for the DMOS bridge
           driver. It requires two 100 nF capacitors to keep the regulator stable. The capacitors should
           be place close to the pins.

5.3        PLL filter schematic
           It is recommended to use the circuit in Figure 9 below for the PLL loop filter to achieve the
           best performance from the device in general application. Note that the ground of this filter
           scheme has to be connected to the ground of the PLL without any resistive path.
           Concerning the component values, please take into account that the greater is the filter
           bandwidth, the less is the lock time but the higher is the PLL output jitter.

         The filterless application is more critical in terms of EMI. It is quite important to follow the
         suggestions below:
         ●    Tracks from amplifier to speaker should be as short as possible.
         ●    Ferrite beads can be used (instead of coils) to improve EMI performance.
              –     Ferrite beads must have a low impedance in the audio band and high impedance
                    at high frequencies.
              –     Place ferrite beads as close as possible to the IC.
              –     Ferrite filters must reduce EMI above 1 MHz.
              –     FCC and CE authorities test radiated emission above 30 MHz.

         The presence of snubber networks reduce the EMI. The snubber networks should be placed
         as close as possible to the IC.

Package thermal characteristics                                                               STA335ML
6          Package thermal characteristics
           Using a double layer PCB the thermal resistance junction to ambient with 2 copper ground
           areas of 3 x 3 cm2 and with 16 via holes (see Figure 14) is 24 °C/W in natural air convection.
           The dissipated power within the device depends primarily on the supply voltage, load
           impedance and output modulation level.
           The max estimated dissipated power for the STA335ML is:
           2 x 20 W into 8 Ω, at 18 V                           Pd max is approximately 4 W
