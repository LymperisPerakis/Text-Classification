4      Application information
4.1    Differential configuration principle
       The TS4994 is a monolithic full-differential input/output power amplifier. The TS4994 also
       includes a common mode feedback loop that controls the output bias value to average it at
       VCC/2 for any DC common mode input voltage. This allows the device to always have a
       maximum output voltage swing, and by consequence, maximize the output power.
       Moreover, as the load is connected differentially, compared to a single-ended topology, the
       output is four times higher for the same power supply voltage.
       The advantages of a full-differential amplifier are:
       ●    Very high PSRR (power supply rejection ratio).
       ●    High common mode noise rejection.
       ●    Virtually zero pop without additional circuitry, giving a faster start-up time compared
            with conventional single-ended input amplifiers.
       ●    Easier interfacing with differential output audio DAC.
       ●    No input coupling capacitors required due to common mode feedback loop.
       ●    In theory, the filtering of the internal bias by an external bypass capacitor is not
            necessary. But, to reach maximum performance in all tolerance situations, it is better to
            keep this option.
       The main disadvantage is:
       ●    As the differential function is directly linked to the mismatch between external resistors,
            paying particular attention to this mismatch is mandatory in order to get the best
            performance from the amplifier.
4.2    Gain in typical application schematic
       Typical differential applications are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 on page 4.
       In the flat region of the frequency-response curve (no Cin effect), the differential gain is
       expressed by the relation:

4.3    Common mode feedback loop limitations
       As explained previously, the common mode feedback loop allows the output DC bias voltage
       to be averaged at VCC/2 for any DC common mode bias input voltage.
       However, due to VICM limitation of the input stage (see Table 3 on page 6), the common
       mode feedback loop can play its role only within a defined range. This range depends upon
                                                                                                                                         21/35


Application information                                                                                                            TS4994
            the values of VCC, Rin and Rfeed (AV). To have a good estimation of the VICM value, use the
            following formula:
                                                  V CC × R in + 2 × V ic × R feed
                                        V ICM = --------------------------------------------------------------------------     (V)
                                                               2 × ( R in + R feed )
            with
                                                       Diff input+ + Diff input-
                                             V ic = -------------------------------------------------------                (V)
                                                                                 2
            The result of the calculation must be in the range:
                                                      0.6V ≤V ICM ≤ V CC – 0.9V
            If the result of the VICM calculation is not in this range, an input coupling capacitor must be
            used.
            Example: With VCC=2.5V, Rin = Rfeed = 20k and Vic = 2V, we find VICM = 1.63V. This is
            higher than 2.5V - 0.9V = 1.6V, so input coupling capacitors are required. Alternatively, you
            can change the Vic value.
4.4         Low and high frequency response
            In the low frequency region, Cin starts to have an effect. Cin forms, with Rin, a high-pass filter
            with a -3dB cut-off frequency. FCL is in Hz.
                                                                                  1
                                                  FCL =                                                       (Hz)
                                                                2 × π × Rin × Cin
            In the high-frequency region, you can limit the bandwidth by adding a capacitor (Cfeed) in
            parallel with Rfeed. It forms a low-pass filter with a -3dB cut-off frequency. FCH is in Hz.
                                                                                   1
                                              FCH =                                                                   (Hz)
                                                          2 × π × Rfeed × Cfeed
            While these bandwidth limitations are in theory attractive, in practice, because of low
            performance in terms of capacitor precision (and by consequence in terms of mismatching),
            they deteriorate the values of PSRR and CMRR.
            The influence of mismatching on PSRR and CMRR performance is discussed in more detail
            in the following sections.
            Example: A typical application with input coupling and feedback capacitor with FCL = 50Hz
            and FCH = 8kHz. We assume that the mismatching between Rin1,2 and Cfeed1,2 can be
            neglected. If we sweep the frequency from DC to 20kHz we observe the following with
            respect to the PSRR value:
            ●     From DC to 200Hz, the Cin impedance decreases from infinite to a finite value and the
                  Cfeed impedance is high enough to be neglected. Due to the tolerance of Cin1,2, we

TS4994                                                                                                                                               Application information
              must introduce a mismatch factor (Rin1 x Cin ≠ Rin2 x Cin2) that will decrease the PSRR
              performance.
       ●      From 200Hz to 5kHz, the Cin impedance is low enough to be neglected when
              compared with Rin, and the Cfeed impedance is high enough to be neglected as well. In
              this range, we can reach the PSRR performance of the TS4994 itself.
       ●      From 5kHz to 20kHz, the Cin impedance is low to be neglected when compared to Rin,
              and the Cfeed impedance decreases to a finite value. Due to tolerance of Cfeed1,2, we
              introduce a mismatching factor (Rfeed1 x Cfeed1 ≠ Rfeed2 x Cfeed2) that will decrease the
              PSRR performance.
4.5    Calculating the influence of mismatching on PSRR
       performance
       For calculating PSRR performance, we consider that Cin and Cfeed have no influence.
       We use the same kind of resistor (same tolerance) and ΔR is the tolerance value in %.
       The following PSRR equation is valid for frequencies ranging from DC to about 1kHz.
       The PSRR equation is (ΔR in %):
                                                                           ⎡ ΔR × 100 ⎤
                                       PSRR ≤ 20 × Log ⎢                                                          2 ⎥
                                                                                                                                  (dB )
                                                                           ⎣ (10000 − ΔR ) ⎦
       This equation doesn't include the additional performance provided by bypass capacitor
       filtering. If a bypass capacitor is added, it acts, together with the internal high output
       impedance bias, as a low-pass filter, and the result is a quite important PSRR improvement
       with a relatively small bypass capacitor.
       The complete PSRR equation (ΔR in %, Cb in microFarad and F in Hz) is:
                                                                                   ΔR × 100
                            PSRR ≤20 × log --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ( dB )
                                                                         2                                 2                  2
                                            (1000 – ΔR ) × 1 + F × C b × 22.2
       Example: With ΔR = 0.1% and Cb = 0, the minimum PSRR would be -60dB. With a 100nF
       bypass capacitor, at 100Hz the new PSRR would be -93dB.
       This example is a worst case scenario, where each resistor has extreme tolerance. It
       illustrates the fact that with only a small bypass capacitor, the TS4994 provides high PSRR
       performance.
       Note also that this is a theoretical formula. Because the TS4994 has self-generated noise,
       you should consider that the highest practical PSRR reachable is about -110dB. It is
       therefore unreasonable to target a -120dB PSRR.
                                                                                                                                                                       23/35

4.6                        CMRR performance
                           For calculating CMRR performance, we consider that Cin and Cfeed have no influence. Cb
                           has no influence in the calculation of the CMRR.
                           We use the same kind of resistor (same tolerance) and ΔR is the tolerance value in %.
                           The following CMRR equation is valid for frequencies ranging from DC to about 1kHz.
                           The CMRR equation is (ΔR in %):
                                                                                  ⎡ Δ R × 200      ⎤
                                                                  CMRR ≤ 20 × Log ⎢             2 ⎥
                                                                                                                         (dB )
                                                                                  ⎣ (10000 − Δ R ) ⎦
                           Example: With ΔR = 1%, the minimum CMRR is -34dB.
                           This example is a worst case scenario where each resistor has extreme tolerance. Ut
                           illustrates the fact that for CMRR, good matching is essential.
                           As with the PSRR, due to self-generated noise, the TS4994 CMRR limitation is about
                           -110dB.

                           worst-case conditions (ΔR=0.1%).

Note:  This maximum value is only dependent on the power supply voltage and load values.
       The efficiency is the ratio between the output power and the power supply:

       The maximum theoretical value is reached when VPEAK = VCC, so:

       The maximum die temperature allowable for the TS4994 is 125°C. However, in case of
       overheating, a thermal shutdown set to 150°C, puts the TS4994 in standby until the
       temperature of the die is reduced by about 5°C.
                                                                                                                 27/35


Application information                                                                              TS4994
            To calculate the maximum ambient temperature Tamb allowable, you need to know:
            ●    The value of the power supply voltage, VCC
            ●    The value of the load resistor, RL
            ●    The Rthja value for the package type
            Example: VCC = 5V, RL = 8Ω, Rthja = 80°C/W
            Using the power dissipation formula given above in Equation 3 this gives a result of:
                 Pdissmax = 633mW
            Tamb is calculated as follows:
            Equation 5
                                            T amb = 125° C – R TJHA × P dissmax
            Therefore, the maximum allowable value for Tamb is:
                 Tamb = 125-80x0.633=74°C
4.8         Decoupling of the circuit
            Two capacitors are needed to correctly bypass the TS4994. A power supply bypass
            capacitor Cs and a bias voltage bypass capacitor Cb.
            Cs has particular influence on the THD+N in the high frequency region (above 7kHz) and an
            indirect influence on power supply disturbances. With a value for Cs of 1µF, you can expect
            similar THD+N performance to that shown in the datasheet.
            In the high frequency region, if Cs is lower than 1µF, it increases THD+N, and disturbances
            on the power supply rail are less filtered.
            On the other hand, if Cs is higher than 1µF, the disturbances on the power supply rail are
            more filtered.
            Cb has an influence on THD+N at lower frequencies, but its function is critical to the final
            result of PSRR (with input grounded and in the lower frequency region).
4.9         Wake-up time: tWU
            When the standby is released to put the device ON, the bypass capacitor Cb is not charged
            immediately. As Cb is directly linked to the bias of the amplifier, the bias will not work
            properly until the Cb voltage is correct. The time to reach this voltage is called the wake-up
            time or tWU and is specified in Table 3 on page 6, with Cb=1µF. During the wake-up time, the
            TS4994 gain is close to zero. After the wake-up time, the gain is released and set to its
            nominal value.
            If Cb has a value other than 1µF, refer to the graph in Figure 69 on page 20 to establish the
            wake-up time.

4.10     Shutdown time
         When the standby command is set, the time required to put the two output stages in high
         impedance and the internal circuitry in shutdown mode is a few microseconds.
Note:    In shutdown mode, the Bypass pin and Vin+, Vin- pins are short-circuited to ground by
         internal switches. This allows a quick discharge of the Cb and Cin capacitors.
4.11     Pop performance
         Due to its fully differential structure, the pop performance of the TS4994 is close to perfect.
         However, due to mismatching between internal resistors Rin, Rfeed, and external input
         capacitors Cin, some noise might remain at startup. To eliminate the effect of mismatched
         components, the TS4994 includes pop reduction circuitry. With this circuitry, the TS4994 is
         close to zero pop for all possible common applications.
         In addition, when the TS4994 is in standby mode, due to the high impedance output stage in
         this configuration, no pop is heard.
4.12     Single-ended input configuration
         It is possible to use the TS4994 in a single-ended input configuration. However, input
         coupling capacitors are needed in this configuration. The schematic in Figure 79 shows this
         configuration using the MiniSO-8 version of the TS4994 as an example.
