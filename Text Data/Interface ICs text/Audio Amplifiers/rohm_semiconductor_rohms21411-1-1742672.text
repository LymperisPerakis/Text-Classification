BD3822FS, BD3824FS
ƔDescription
    BD3822FS and BD3824FS are the audio selectors with internal input selector, gain amp, ALC and power save ON/OFF functions.
    BD3822FS contains the 1/2 power compression amp for level meter and 2ch volume. BD3824FS contains the line amp.
    BD3822FS and BD3824FS unify the board pattern by pin compatible, and can be used individually as a high-end and low-end
    model.
ƔFeatures
    1) Low distortion (0.0015%) and low noise (3.2μVrms) by using a resistance ladder type circuit for volume. Shock sound in
         switching is also reduced (BD3822FS)
    2) Low distortion (0.0015%) and low noises (2.3μVrms)(BD3824FS)
    3) Contains an ALC circuit, and can also be used as an RF output
    4) Best suited to energy-saving design by low current consumption by using the Bi-CMOS process; compact regulator in the
         set, being advantageous to heating in terms of quality
    5) SSOP-A32 is used for package. The PCB layout can be easy and the area of PCB is reduced by putting sound input
         terminals together, and output terminals, too.
    6) BD3822FS and BD3824FS can be used with the same PCB board.
         2
    7) I C BUS data format of BD3822FS is upward compatible with BD3824FS, and can be used without changing the software.
    8) A system is employed, in which the waveform connected to the input (tuner, Front, Ext) is not distorted even in standby
         mode.

ƔOperation Notes
    1.                                              Numbers and data in entries are representative design values and are not guaranteed values of the items.
    2.                                              Although ROHM is confident that the example application circuit reflects the best possible recommendations, be sure to verify
                                                    circuit characteristics for your particular application. Modification of constants for other externally connected circuits may cause
                                                    variations in both static and transient characteristics for external components as well as this Rohm IC. Allow for sufficient
                                                    margins when determining circuit constants.
    3.                                              Absolute maximum ratings
                                                    Use of the IC in excess of absolute maximum ratings, such as the applied voltage or operating temperature range (Topr), may
                                                    result in IC damage. Assumptions should not be made regarding the state of the IC (short mode or open mode) when such
                                                    damage is suffered. A physical safety measure, such as a fuse, should be implemented when using the IC at times where the
                                                    absolute maximum ratings may be exceeded.
    4.                                              GND potential
                                                    Ensure a minimum GND pin potential in all operating conditions. Make sure that no pins are at a voltage below the GND at any
                                                    time, regardless of whether it is a transient signal or not.
    5.                                              Thermal design
                                                    Perform thermal design, in which there are adequate margins, by taking into account the permissible dissipation (Pd) in actual
                                                    states of use.
    6.                                              Short circuit between terminals and erroneous mounting
                                                    Pay attention to the assembly direction of the ICs. Wrong mounting direction or shorts between terminals, GND, or other components
                                                    on the circuits, can damage the IC.
    7.                                              Operation in strong electromagnetic field
                                                    Using the ICs in a strong electromagnetic field can cause operation malfunction.
