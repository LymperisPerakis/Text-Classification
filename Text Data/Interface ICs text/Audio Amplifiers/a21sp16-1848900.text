5       Application information
5.1     Differential configuration principle
        The A21SP16 is a monolithic fully-differential input/output class D power amplifier. The
        A21SP16 also includes a common-mode feedback loop that controls the output bias value
        to average it at VCC/2 for any DC common mode input voltage. This allows the device to
        always have a maximum output voltage swing, and by consequence, maximizes the output
        power. Moreover, as the load is connected differentially compared to a single-ended
        topology, the output is four times higher for the same power supply voltage.
        The advantages of a full-differential amplifier are:
             High PSRR (power supply rejection ratio).
             High common mode noise rejection.
             Virtually zero pop without additional circuitry, giving a faster start-up time compared to
              conventional single-ended input amplifiers.
             Easier interfacing with differential output audio DAC.
             No input coupling capacitors required due to common mode feedback loop.
        The main disadvantage is:
             As the differential function is directly linked to external resistor mismatching, paying
              particular attention to this mismatching is mandatory in order to obtain the best
              performance from the amplifier.
5.2     Gain in typical application schematic
        Typical differential applications are shown in Figure 1 on page 4.
        In the flat region of the frequency-response curve (no input coupling capacitor effect), the

5.3         Common mode feedback loop limitations
            As explained previously, the common mode feedback loop allows the output DC bias
            voltage to be averaged at VCC/2 for any DC common mode bias input voltage.
            However, due to Vicm limitation in the input stage (see Table 3: Operating conditions on
            page 3), the common mode feedback loop can ensure its role only within a defined range.
            This range depends upon the values of VCC and Rin (AVdiff). To have a good estimation of
            the Vicm value, we can apply this formula (no tolerance on Rin):
                                                                                     V CC  R in + 2  V IC  150k

                                                                                                                  2
            and the result of the calculation must be in the range:
                                                                                       0.5V  V icm  V CC – 0.8V
            Due to the +/-9% tolerance on the 150k resistor, it’s also important to check Vicm in these
            conditions:
                           V CC  R in + 2  V IC  136.5k                                                                    V CC  R in + 2  V IC  163.5k
                           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  V icm  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         2   R in + 136.5k                                                                            2   R in + 163.5k 
            If the result of Vicm calculation is not in the previous range, input coupling capacitors must
            be used (with VCC from 2.4 V to 2.5 V, input coupling capacitors are mandatory).
For example:
            With VCC = 3 V, Rin = 150 k and VIC = 2.5 V, we typically find Vicm = 2 V and this is lower
            than 3V - 0.8 V = 2.2 V. With 136.5 k we find 1.97 V, and with 163.5 k we have 2.02 V.
            So, no input coupling capacitors are required.
5.4         Low frequency response
            If a low frequency bandwidth limitation is requested, it is possible to use input coupling
            capacitors.
            In the low frequency region, Cin (input coupling capacitor) starts to have an effect. Cin forms,
            with Rin, a first order high-pass filter with a -3dB cut-off frequency:
                                                                                                                1
                                                                                   F CL = ------------------------------------            (Hz)
                                                                                                      2  R in  C in
            So, for a desired cut-off frequency we can calculate Cin,
                                                                                                                 1

A21SP16                                                                      Application information
5.5     Decoupling of the circuit
        A power supply capacitor, referred to as CS, is needed to correctly bypass the A21SP16.
        The A21SP16 has a typical switching frequency at 250 kHz and output fall and rise time
        about 5 ns. Due to these very fast transients, careful decoupling is mandatory.
        A 1 µF ceramic capacitor is enough, but it must be located very close to the A21SP16 in
        order to avoid any extra parasitic inductance created an overly long track wire. In relation
        with dI/dt, this parasitic inductance introduces an overvoltage that decreases the global
        efficiency and, if it is too high, may cause a breakdown of the device.
        In addition, even if a ceramic capacitor has an adequate high frequency ESR value, its
        current capability is also important. A 0603 size is a good compromise, particularly when a
        4  load is used.
        Another important parameter is the rated voltage of the capacitor. A 1 µF/6.3 V capacitor
        used at 5 V, loses about 50% of its value. In fact, with a 5 V power supply voltage, the
        decoupling value is about 0.5 µF instead of 1 µF. As CS has particular influence on the
        THD+N in the medium-high frequency region, this capacitor variation becomes decisive. In
        addition, less decoupling means higher overshoots, which can be problematic if they reach
        the power supply AMR value (6 V).
5.6     Wake-up time (tWU)
        When the standby is released to set the device ON, there is a wait of about 5 ms. The
        A21SP16 has an internal digital delay that mutes the outputs and releases them after this
        time in order to avoid any pop noise.
5.7     Shutdown time (tSTBY)
        When the standby command is set, the time required to put the two output stages into high
        impedance and to put the internal circuitry in shutdown mode, is about 5 ms. This time is
        used to decrease the gain and avoid any pop noise during shutdown.
5.8     Consumption in shutdown mode
        Between the shutdown pin and GND there is an internal 300 k resistor. This resistor forces
        the A21SP16 to be in standby mode when the standby input pin is left floating.
        However, this resistor also introduces additional power consumption if the shutdown pin
        voltage is not 0 V.
        For example, with a 0.4 V standby voltage pin, Table 3: Operating conditions on page 3,
        shows that you must add 0.4 V/300 k = 1.3 µA in typical (0.4 V/273 k = 1.46 µA in
        maximum) to the shutdown current specified in Table 5 on page 5.
5.9     Single-ended input configuration
        It is possible to use the A21SP16 in a single-ended input configuration. However, input
        coupling capacitors are needed in this configuration. The schematic in Figure 61 shows a
        single-ended input typical application.

        In general, for mixed situations (single-ended and differential inputs), it is best to use the
        same rule, that is, to equalize impedance on both A21SP16 inputs.
5.10    Output filter considerations
        The A21SP16 is designed to operate without an output filter. However, due to very sharp
        transients on the A21SP16 output, EMI radiated emissions may cause some standard
        compliance issues.
        These EMI standard compliance issues can appear if the distance between the A21SP16
        outputs and loudspeaker terminal is long (typically more than 50 mm, or 100 mm in both
        directions, to the speaker terminals). As the PCB layout and internal equipment device are
        different for each configuration, it is difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution.
        However, to decrease the probability of EMI issues, there are several simple rules to follow:
             Reduce, as much as possible, the distance between the A21SP16 output pins and the
              speaker terminals.
             Use ground planes for “shielding” sensitive wires.
             Place, as close as possible to the A21SP16 and in series with each output, a ferrite
              bead with a rated current at minimum 2 A and impedance greater than 50 at
              frequencies above 30 MHz. If, after testing, these ferrite beads are not necessary,
              replace them by a short-circuit. Murata BLM18EG221SN1 or BLM18EG121SN1 are
              possible examples of devices you can use.
             Allow enough footprint to place, if necessary, a capacitor to short perturbations to
              ground (see the schematics in Figure 63).

                                                                                       Gnd
        In the case where the distance between the A21SP16 outputs and speaker terminals is
        high, it is possible to have low frequency EMI issues due to the fact that the typical operating
        frequency is 250 kHz. In this configuration, we recommend using an output filter (as shown
                                           DocID026037 Rev 1                                                                             31/37
