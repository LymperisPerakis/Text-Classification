         1. All voltage values are measured with respect to the ground pin.
         2. Thermal shutdown is activated when maximum junction temperature is reached.
         3. The device is protected from over-temperature by a thermal shutdown mechanism, active at 150° C.
         4. Exceeding the power derating curves for long periods may provoke abnormal operation.
         5. Human body model: a 100 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged through a
            1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device. This is done for all couples of connected pin combinations
            while the other pins are floating.
         6. Machine model: a 200 pF capacitor is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between
            two pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω). This is done for all couples of
            connected pin combinations while the other pins are floating.
         7. The measurement is performed on an evaluation board, with ESD protection EMIF02-AV01F3.

4           Application information
4.1         I²C bus interface
            In compliance with the I²C protocol, the A22H165M uses a serial bus to control the chip’s
            functions with the clock (SCL) and data (SDA) wires. These two lines are bi-directional
            (open collector) and require an external pull-up resistor (typically 10 kΩ). The maximum
            clock frequency in fast mode specified by the I²C standard is 400 kHz, which the A22H165M
            supports. In this application, the A22H165M is always the slave device and the controlling
            microcontroller MCU is the master device.
            The slave address of the A22H165M is 1100 000x (C0h).
            Table 8 summarizes the pin descriptions for the I²C bus interface.

            The host MCU can write to the A22H165M control register to control the A22H165M, and
            read from the control register to obtain a configuration from the A22H165M. The A22H165M
            is addressed by the byte consisting of the 7-bit slave address and the R/W bit.

               Writing to the control registers
               To write data to the A22H165M, after the "start" message the MCU must:
               •     send the I²C 7-bit slave address and a low level for the R/W bit.
               •     send the register address to write to.
               •     send the data bytes (control register settings).
               All bytes are sent MSB first. The transfer of written data ends with a "stop" message. When
               transmitting several data bytes, the data can be written without having to repeat the "start"
               message or send the byte with the slave address. If several bytes are transmitted, they will
               be written repeatedly to CR1, CR2 and CR3.

               •     send the I²C 7-bit slave address and a high level for the R/W bit.
               •     receive the data (control register value).
               All bytes are read MSB first. The transfer of read data ends with a "stop" message. When
               transmitting several data bytes, the data can be read without having to repeat the "start"

4.1.3    Control register CR1 - address 1
         Amplifier output short-circuit detection: bits SC_L and SC_R
         The amplifier’s outputs are protected from short-circuit that might accidentally occur during
         manipulation of the device. In a typical application, if a short-circuit arises on the jack plug,
         there will be no detection because of the serial resistor present on the amplifier output, thus
         the output current threshold will not be reached.
         To be active, the detection has to occur directly on the amplifier’s output with a signal
         modulation on the inputs of the A22H165M. This detection is depicted in Figure 74.

               the left channel.
         •     SC_R: equals 0 during normal operation, equals 1 when a short-circuit is detected on
               the right channel.
         The corresponding channel’s output stage is then set to high impedance mode. An I²C read
         command allows the reading of the SC_L and SC_R flags but does not reset them. An I²C
         write command has to be sent to CR1 to reset the flags to 0 and restore normal operation.

Application information                                                                       A22H165M
            Thermal shutdown protection: bit T_SH
            A thermal shutdown protection is implemented to protect the device from overheating. If the
            temperature rises above the thermal junction of 150°C, the device is put into standby mode
            and a flag is raised in the read register CR1.
            •    T_SH: equals 0 during normal operation, equals 1 when a thermal shutdown is
                 detected.
            When the temperature decreases to safe levels, the circuit switches back to normal
            operation and the corresponding flag is cleared.
            Software shutdown: bit SWS
            When SWS equals 1, the device is set to I²C software shutdown. When SWS equals 0, the
            negative supply and buck converters are activated.
            Channel activation: bits HP_EN_L and HP_EN_R
            When HP_EN_L or HP_EN_R equals 1, the corresponding amplifier channel is enabled.
4.2         Wake-up and standby time definition
            The wake-up time of the A22H165M is guaranteed at 12 ms typical (refer to Chapter 3:
            Electrical characteristics on page 7). However, since the A22H165M is activated with an I²C
            bus, the wake-up start procedure is as follows.
            1.   The master sends a start bit.
            2.   The master sends the device address.
            3.   The slave (A22H165M) answers by an acknowledge bit.
            4.   The master sends the register address.
            5.   The slave (A22H165M) answers by an acknowledge bit.
            6.   The master sends the output mode configuration (CR1).
            7.   If the A22H165M was previously in standby mode, the wake-up starts on the falling
                 edge of the eighth clock signal (SCL) corresponding to the CR1 byte.
            8.   After 12 ms (de-pop sequence time), the A22H165M outputs are operational.
            The standby time is guaranteed as 100 µs typical (refer to Chapter 3: Electrical
            characteristics on page 7). However, since the A22H165M is de-activated with an I²C bus,
            the standby time operates as follows.
            1.   The master sends a start bit.
            2.   The master sends the device address.
            3.   The slave (A22H165M) answers by an acknowledge bit.
            4.   The master sends the register address.
            5.   The slave (A22H165M) answers by an acknowledge bit.
            6.   The master sends the output mode configuration (CR1), which corresponds, in this
                 case, to standby mode.
            7.   The standby time starts on the falling edge of the eighth clock signal (SCL)
                 corresponding to the CR1 byte.
            8.   After 100 µs, the A22H165M is in standby mode.

4.3      Common mode sense
         The A22H165M implements a common-mode sense pin to correct any voltage differences
         that might occur between the return of the headphone jack and the GND of the device and
         create parasitic noise in the headphone and/or line out.
         The solution to strongly reduce and practically eliminate this noise consists in connecting
         the headphone jack ground to the CMS pin. This pin senses the difference of potential
         (voltage noise) between the A22H165M ground and the headphone ground. By way of the
         frequency response of the common-mode sense pin, this noise is removed from the
         A22H165M outputs.
