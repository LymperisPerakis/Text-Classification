          1. All voltage values are measured with respect to the ground pin
          2. The magnitude of the input signal must never exceed VCC + 0.3 V / GND - 0.3 V
          3. The device is protected from over heating by a thermal shutdown active @ 150° C
          4. Exceeding the power derating curves during a long period provokes abnormal operating conditions
          5. Human body model: 100 pF discharged through a 1.5 kΩ resistor between two pins of the device, done for
              all couples of pin combinations with other pins floating.
          6. Machine model: a 200 pF cap is charged to the specified voltage, then discharged directly between two
              pins of the device with no external series resistor (internal resistor < 5 Ω), done for all couples of pin
              combinations with other pins floating.
          7. Implemented short-circuit protection protects the amplifier against damage by short-circuit between
              positive and negative outputs and between outputs and ground.

3.2      Electrical characteristic curves
         The graphs shown in this section use the following abbreviations:
         •    RL+ 15 µH or 30 µH = pure resistor + very low series resistance inductor
         •    Filter = LC output filter (1 µF+ 30 µH for 4 Ω and 0.5 µF+15 µH for 8 Ω)
         All measurements are made with CS1 = 1 µF and CS2 = 100 nF (Figure 3), except for the
         PSRR where CS1 is removed (Figure 4).

Application information                                                                            TS2007FC
4           Application information
4.1         Differential configuration principle
            The TS2007FC is a monolithic, fully-differential input/output, class-D power amplifier. It
            includes a common mode feedback loop that controls the output bias value to average it at
            VCC/2 in the range of DC common mode input voltage. This allows the device to always
            have a maximum output voltage swing, and consequently, maximizes the output power. In
            addition, as the load is connected differentially compared to a single-ended topology, the
            output is four times higher for the same power supply voltage.
            A fully-differential amplifier has the following advantages:
            •     High PSRR (power supply rejection ratio)
            •     High CMRR (common mode noise rejection
            •     Virtually zero pop without additional circuitry, giving a faster startup time than
                  conventional single-ended input amplifiers
            •     Easy interfacing with a differential output audio DAC
            •     No input coupling capacitors required since there is a common mode feedback loop
4.2         Gain settings
            In the flat region of the frequency-response curve (no input coupling capacitor or internal
            feedback loop + load effect), the differential gain can be set to either 6 or 12 dB depending
            on the logic level of the GS pin.
                                                 Table 11. GS pin gains
                          GS pin                         Gain (dB)                        Gain (V/V)
                             1                              6 dB                              2
                             0                             12 dB                              4
Note:       Between the GS pin and VCC there is an internal 300 kΩ resistor. When the pin is floating
            the gain is 6 dB. In standby mode, this internal resistor is disconnected (HiZ input).
4.3         Common mode feedback loop limitations
            The common mode feedback loop allows the output DC bias voltage to be averaged at
            VCC/2 for any DC common mode bias input voltage.
            Due to the Vicm limitation of the input stage (see Table 2: Operating conditions), the common
            mode feedback loop can fulfill its role only within the defined range.

4.4      Low frequency response
         If a low frequency bandwidth limitation is required, it is possible to use input coupling
         capacitors. In the low frequency region, the input coupling capacitor Cin has a greater effect.
         Cin and the input impedance Zin form a first-order high-pass filter with a -3 dB cutoff
         frequency (see Table 5 to Table 9).
                                                                          1
                                                 F CL = ------------------------------------
                                                          2 ⋅ π ⋅ Z in ⋅ C in
         where FCL = cutoff frequency
         So, for a desired cutoff frequency we can calculate Cin as follows:
                                                                         1
                                                 C in = --------------------------------------
                                                        2 ⋅ π ⋅ Z in ⋅ F CL
         where FCL is expressed in Hz, Zin in Ω, and Cin in F.
         The input impedance, Zin, is for the whole power supply voltage range, typically 75 kΩ.
         There is also a tolerance around the typical value (see Table 5 to Table 9). The tolerance of
         FCL can also be calculated:
         •      FCLmax = 1.103 ⋅ FCL
         •      FCLmin = 0.915 ⋅ FCL
4.5      Circuit decoupling
         A power supply capacitor, referred to as CS, is needed to correctly bypass the TS2007FC.
         The TS2007FC has a typical switching frequency of 280 kHz and an output fall and rise time
         of less than or equal to 5 ns. Due to these very fast transients, careful decoupling is
         mandatory.
         A 1 µF ceramic capacitor is enough, but it must be located very close to the TS2007FC in
         order to avoid any extra parasitic inductance created by a long track wire. Parasitic loop
         inductance, in relation with di/dt, introduces overvoltage that decreases the global efficiency
         of the device and may cause, if this parasitic inductance is too high, a TS2007FC
         breakdown. For filtering low frequency noise signals on the power line, it is recommended to
         use a capacitor of at least 1 µF.
         In addition, even if a ceramic capacitor has an adequate high frequency ESR (equivalent
         series resistance) value, its current capability is also important. A 0603 size is a good
         compromise, particularly when a 4 Ω load is used.
         Another important parameter is the rated voltage of the capacitor. A 1 µF/6.3 V capacitor
         used at 5 V, can loose about 50% of its value. With a power supply voltage of 5 V, the
         decoupling value, instead of 1 µF, can be reduced to 0.5 µF. As CS has particular influence
         on the THD+N in the medium to high frequency region, this capacitor variation becomes
         decisive. In addition, less decoupling means higher overshoots which can be problematic if
         they reach the power supply AMR value (6 V).

Application information                                                                        TS2007FC
4.6         Wakeup time (twu)
            When the standby is released to set the device ON, there is a wait of 1 ms typically. The
            TS2007FC has an internal digital delay that mutes the outputs and releases them after this
            time in order to avoid any pop noise.
Note:       The gain increases smoothly (see Figure 43 and Figure 44) from the mute to the gain
            selected by the GS pin (Section 4.2).
4.7         Shutdown time
            When the standby command is set to high, the time required to put the two output stages
            into high impedance and to put the internal circuitry in shutdown mode, is typically 1 ms.
            This time is used to decrease the gain and avoid any pop noise during shutdown.
Note:       The gain decreases smoothly until the outputs are muted (see Figure 43 and Figure 44).
4.8         Consumption in shutdown mode
            Between the shutdown pin and GND there is an internal 300 kΩ resistor. This resistor forces
            the TS2007FC to be in shutdown when the shutdown input is left floating.
            However, this resistor also introduces additional shutdown power consumption if the
            shutdown pin voltage does not equal 0 V. This extra current is provided by the device that
            drives the standby pin of the amplifier.
            Referring to Table 2: Operating conditions, with a 0.4 V shutdown voltage pin for example,
            you must add 0.4 V/300 k = 1.3 µA in typical (0.4 V/273 k = 1.46 µA maximum) to the
            shutdown current specified in Table 5 to Table 9.
4.9         Single-ended input configuration
            It is possible to use the TS2007FC in a single-ended input configuration. However, input
            coupling capacitors are needed in this configuration. The following schematic diagram
            shows a typical single-ended input application.

4.10       Output filter considerations
           The TS2007FC is designed to operate without an output filter. However, due to very sharp
           transients on the TS2007FC output, EMI radiated emissions may cause some standard
           compliance issues.
           These EMI standard compliance issues can appear if the distance between the TS2007FC
           outputs and loudspeaker terminal are long (typically more than 50 mm, or 100 mm in both
           directions). As the PCB layout and internal equipment device are different for each
           configuration, it is difficult to provide a one-size-fits-all solution.
           However, to decrease the probability of EMI issues, there are several simple rules to follow:
           •   Reduce, as much as possible, the distance between the TS2007FC output pins and the
               speaker terminals
           •   Use a ground plane for shielding sensitive wires
           •   Place, as close as possible to the TS2007FC and in series with each output, a ferrite
               bead with a rated current of minimum 2.5 A and impedance greater than 50 Ω at
               frequencies above 30 MHz
           •   Allow an extra footprint to place, if necessary, a capacitor to short perturbations to
               ground (Figure 46)

                                                                              gnd
            In the case where the distance between the TS2007FC output and the speaker terminals is
            too long, it is possible to have low frequency EMI issues due to the fact that the typical
            operating PWM frequency is 280 kHz and the fall and rise time of the output signal is less
            than or equal to 5 ns. In this configuration, it is necessary to use the output filter shown in
            Figure 47, that consists of L1, C1, L2, and C2 as close as possible to the TS2007FC
            outputs.
            When an output filter is used and there exists a possibility to disconnect a load, it is
            recommended to use an RC network that consists of C3 and R as shown in Figure 47. In
            this case, when the output filter is connected without any load, the filter acts like a short-
            circuit for input frequencies above 10 kHz. The RC network corrects the frequency response
            of the output filter and compensates this limitation.

4.11     Short-circuit protection
         The TS2007FC includes an output short-circuit protection. This protection prevents the
         device from being damaged if there are fault conditions on the amplifier outputs.
         When a channel is in operating mode and a short-circuit occurs directly between two
         outputs (Out+ and Out-) or between an output and ground (Out+ and GND or Out- and
         GND), the short-circuit protection detects this situation and puts the amplifier into standby.
         To put the amplifier back into operating mode, put the standby pin to logical LO and then to
         logical HI.
4.12     Thermal shutdown
         The TS2007FC device has an internal thermal shutdown protection in the event of extreme
         temperatures to protect the device from overheating. Thermal shutdown is active when the
         device reaches 150 °C. When the temperature decreases to a safe level, the circuit
         switches back to normal operation.
