                  Rev. 10 — 8 November 2017                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9554 and PCA9554A are 16-pin CMOS devices that provide 8 bits of General
              Purpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and
              were developed to enhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders.
              The improvements include higher drive capability, 5 V I/O tolerance, lower supply current,
              individual I/O configuration, 400 kHz clock frequency, and smaller packaging. I/O
              expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/O is needed for ACPI power
              switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fans, and so on.
              The PCA9554/PCA9554A consist of an 8-bit Configuration register (Input or Output
              selection); 8-bit Input Port register, 8-bit Output Port register and an 8-bit Polarity
              Inversion register (active HIGH or active LOW operation). The system master can enable
              the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for
              each input or output is kept in the corresponding Input Port or Output Port register. The
              polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register. All
              registers can be read by the system master. Although pin-to-pin and I2C-bus address
              compatible with the PCF8574 series, software changes are required due to the
              enhancements and are discussed in Application Note AN469.
              The PCA9554/PCA9554A open-drain interrupt output is activated when any input state
              differs from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the
              system master that an input state has changed. The power-on reset sets the registers to
              their default values and initializes the device state machine.
              Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) vary the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
              devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The PCA9554A is identical to the PCA9554
              except that the fixed I2C-bus address is different allowing up to sixteen of these devices
              (eight of each) on the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       [1]   HVQFN16 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must
                             be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board
                             level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad
                             on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the
                             PCB in the thermal pad region.

                6.1.2 Register 0 - Input Port register
                      This register is a read-only port. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                      of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by Register 3. Writes to this register
                      have no effect.
                      The default ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level, normally ‘1’ when no
                      external signal externally applied because of the internal pull-up resistors.

                   6.2 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the
                       PCA9554/PCA9554A in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the
                       reset condition is released and the PCA9554/PCA9554A registers and state machine will
                       initialize to their default states. Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the
                       device.
                       For a power reset cycle, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V and then restored to the
                       operating voltage.

                                                                                                      8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with interrupt
                         6.3 Interrupt output
                                   The open-drain interrupt output is activated when one of the port pins change state and
                                   the pin is configured as an input. The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to its
                                   previous state or the Input Port register is read.
                                   Note that changing an I/O from and output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                                   if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register.
                         6.4 I/O port
                                   When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a
                                   high-impedance input with a weak pull-up (100 k typ.) to VDD. The input voltage may be
                                   raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                                   If the I/O is configured as an output, then either Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the
                                   state of the Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied
                                   to an I/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance paths that exist between
                                   the pin and either VDD or VSS.

                                  Data is transmitted to the PCA9554/PCA9554A registers using the Write mode as shown
                                  in Figure 11 and Figure 12. Data is read from the PCA9554/PCA9554A registers using the
                                  Read mode as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14. These devices do not implement an
                                  auto-increment function, so once a command byte has been sent, the register which was
                                  addressed will continue to be accessed by reads until a new command byte has been
                                  sent.

12. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 23) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window

                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
