General Description                                           Benefits and Features
The DS4550 is a 9-bit, nonvolatile (NV) I/O expander          ●● Programmable Replacement for Mechanical Jumpers
with 64 bytes of NV user memory controlled by either an           and Switches
I2C-compatible serial interface or JTAG port. The DS4550      ●● Nine NV Inputs/Outputs
offers a digitally programmable alternative to hardware
jumpers and mechanical switches that are being used to        ●● 64-Byte NV User Memory (EEPROM)
control digital logic nodes. Each I/O pin is independently    ●● I2C-Compatible Serial Interface and JTAG
configurable. The outputs are open-drain with selectable      ●● Up to 8 Devices can be Multidropped on the Same
pullups. Each output has the ability to sink up to 16mA,          I2C Bus
and since the device is NV, it powers up in the desired

Note 1:  All voltages referenced to ground.
Note 2:  ISTBY is specified with SDA = SCL = TMS = TDI = VCC, outputs floating, and inputs connected to VCC or GND.
Note 3:  Guaranteed by design.
Note 4:  Timing shown is for fast-mode (400kHz) operation. This device is also backward-compatible with I2C standard mode timing.
Note 5:  After this period, the first clock pulse is generated.
Note 6:  CB—total capacitance of one bus line in picofarads.
Note 7:  EEPROM write time applies to all the EEPROM memory and SRAM-shadowed EEPROM memory when SEE = 0. The
         EEPROM write time begins after a stop condition occurs.
Note 8: TCK can be stopped either high or low.
Note 9: EEPROM write begins immediately after the UPDATE-DR state that latches the data to be written. The EEPROM cannot be
         accessed until the EEPROM write has completed. However, the remainder of the JTAG functionality is active and accessible
         during the EEPROM write.
