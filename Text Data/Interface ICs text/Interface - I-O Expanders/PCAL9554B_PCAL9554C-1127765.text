                 Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus low power I/O port with
                 interrupt, weak pull-up and Agile I/O
                 Rev. 4 — 19 December 2014                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCAL9554B and PCAL9554C are a low-voltage 8-bit General Purpose Input/Output
             (GPIO) expanders with interrupt and weak pull-up for I2C-bus/SMBus applications. The
             only difference between the PCAL9554B and PCAL9554C is their I2C-bus fixed address,
             allowing a larger number of the same device on the I2C-bus with no chance of address
             conflicts. NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed
             while keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in ACPI power switches,
             sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fan control, etc.
             In addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, the wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V
             allows the PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C to interface with next-generation microprocessors
             and microcontrollers where supply levels are dropping down to conserve power.
             The PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C contains the PCA9554A register set of four 8-bit
             Configuration, Input, Output, and Polarity Inversion registers, and additionally, the
             PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C has Agile I/O, which are additional features specifically
             designed to enhance the I/O. These additional features are: programmable output drive
             strength, latchable inputs, programmable pull-up/pull-down resistors, maskable interrupt,
             interrupt status register, programmable open-drain or push-pull outputs.
             The PCAL9554B is a pin-for-pin replacement for the PCA9554, while the PCAL9554C
             replaces the PCA9554A, however both versions power-up with all I/O interrupted masked.
             This mask default allows for a board bring-up free of spurious interrupts at power-up.
             The PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any
             input state differs from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to
             the system master that an input state has changed.
             INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
             signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
             on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCAL9554B or
             PCAL9554C can remain a simple slave device.
             The device outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while consuming
             low device current.
             Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) select the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
             devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The PCAL9554B and PCAL9554C differ only
             in their base I2C-bus addresses permitting a total of 16 of the same devices on the
             I2C-bus, minimizing the chance of address conflict, even in the most complex system.

                          [2]   HVQFN16 package die supply ground is connected to both the VSS pin and the exposed center pad. The
                                VSS pin must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical,
                                and board-level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding
                                thermal pad on the board, and for proper heat conduction through the board thermal vias need to be
                                incorporated in the printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.

                          Fig 4.    Device address
                        A2, A1 and A0 are the hardware address package pins and are held to either HIGH
                        (logic 1) or LOW (logic 0) to assign one of the eight possible slave addresses. The last bit
                        of the slave address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH
                        (logic 1) selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.
                    6.2 Pointer register and command byte
                        Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                        command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C.
                        Two bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers
                        (Input, Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. Bit 6 in
                        conjunction with the lower three bits of the Command byte are used to point to the
                        extended features of the device (Agile I/O). This register is write only.
                                                                          B7     B6      B5      B4       B3     B2   B1   B0

                            The Input port register (register 0) reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                            of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. The
                            Input port register is read only; writes to this register have no effect. The default value ‘X’
                            is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port register read operation is
                            performed as described in Section 7.2 “Read commands”.

                    6.4.2 Output port register (01h)
                            The Output port register (register 1) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as
                            outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no effect on pins
                            defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that was written to this
                            register, not the actual pin value.

                          corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a
                          ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s original polarity is retained.

                          The Output drive strength registers control the output drive level of the GPIO. Each GPIO
                          can be configured independently to a certain output current level by two register control
                          bits. For example, Port 7 is controlled by register 41 CC7 (bits [7:6]), Port 6 is controlled
                          by register 41 CC6 (bits [5:4]). The output drive level of the GPIO is programmed
                          00b = 0.25, 01b = 0.5, 10b = 0.75 or 11b = 1 of the drive capability of the I/O.

                    6.4.6 Input latch register (42h)
                          The Input latch register enables and disables the input latch of the I/O pins. These
                          registers are effective only when the pin is configured as an input port. When an input
                          latch register bit is 0, the corresponding input pin state is not latched. A state change in
                          the corresponding input pin generates an interrupt. A read of the input port register clears
                          the interrupt. If the input goes back to its initial logic state before the input port register is
                          read, then the interrupt is cleared.
                          When an input latch register bit is 1, the corresponding input pin state is latched. A change
                          of state of the input generates an interrupt and the input logic value is loaded into the
                          corresponding bit of the input port register (registers 0). A read of the input port register
                          clears the interrupt. If the input pin returns to its initial logic state before the input port
                          register is read, then the interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of the input port
                          register keeps the logic value that initiated the interrupt. See Figure 11. For example, if the
                          P4 input was as logic 0 and the input goes to logic 1 then back to logic 0, the input port
                          register will capture this change and an interrupt is generated (if unmasked). When the
                          read is performed on the input port register, the interrupt is cleared, assuming there were
                          no additional input(s) that have changed, and bit 4 of the input port register will read ‘1’.
                          The next read of the input port register bit 4 should now read ‘0’.
                          An interrupt remains active when a non-latched input simultaneously switches state with a
                          latched input and then returns to its original state. A read of the input port register reflects
                          only the change of state of the latched input and also clears the interrupt. The interrupt is
                          not cleared if the input latch register changes from latched to non-latched configuration.
                          If the input pin is changed from latched to non-latched input, a read from the input port
                          register reflects the current port logic level. If the input pin is changed from non-latched to
                          latched input, the read from the input port register reflects the latched logic level.

                          This register allows the user to enable or disable pull-up/pull-down resistors on the I/O
                          pins. Setting the bit to logic 1 enables the selection of pull-up/pull-down resistors. Setting
                          the bit to logic 0 disconnects the pull-up/pull-down resistors from the I/O pins. Also, the
                          resistors will be disconnected when the outputs are configured as open-drain outputs (see
                          Section 6.4.11). Use the pull-up/pull-down registers to select either a pull-up or pull-down
                          resistor.

                     6.4.8 Pull-up/pull-down selection register (44h)
                           The I/O port can be configured to have pull-up or pull-down resistor by programming the
                           pull-up/pull-down selection register. Setting a bit to logic 1 selects a 100 k pull-up
                           resistor for that I/O pin. Setting a bit to logic 0 selects a 100 k pull-down resistor for that
                           I/O pin. If the pull-up/down feature is disconnected, writing to this register will have no
                           effect on I/O pin. Typical value is 100 k with minimum of 50 k and maximum of 150 k.

                     6.4.9 Interrupt mask register (45h)
                           Interrupt mask register is set to logic 1 upon power-on, disabling interrupts during system
                           start-up. Interrupts may be enabled by setting corresponding mask bits to logic 0. If an
                           input changes state and the corresponding bit in the Interrupt mask register is set to 1, the
                           interrupt is masked and the interrupt pin (INT) will not be asserted. If the corresponding bit
                           in the Interrupt mask register is set to 0, the interrupt pin will be asserted.
                           When an input changes state and the resulting interrupt is masked (interrupt mask bit is
                           1), setting the input mask register bit to 0 will cause the interrupt pin to be asserted. If the
                           interrupt mask bit of an input that is currently the source of an interrupt is set to 1, the
                           interrupt pin will be de-asserted.

                    6.4.10 Interrupt status register (46h)
                           This read-only register is used to identify the source of an interrupt. When read, a logic 1
                           indicates that the corresponding input pin was the source of the interrupt. A logic 0
                           indicates that the input pin is not the source of an interrupt.
                           When a corresponding bit in the interrupt mask register is set to 1 (masked), the interrupt
                           status bit will return logic 0.

                    6.4.11 Output port configuration register (4Fh)
                           The output port configuration register selects port-wise push-pull or open-drain I/O stage.
                           A logic 0 configures the I/O as push-pull (Q1 and Q2 are active, see Figure 6). A logic 1
                           configures the I/O as open-drain (Q1 is disabled, Q2 is active). The recommended
                           command sequence is to program this register (4Fh) before the Configuration register
                           (03h) sets the port pins as outputs.

                    6.5 I/O port
                        When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                        high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                        If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                        Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                        either VDD or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                        recommended levels for proper operation.

                                                                               Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus/SMBus low power I/O port
                    6.6 Power-on reset
                        When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the
                        PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that time,
                        the reset condition is released and the PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C registers and
                        I2C-bus/SMBus state machine initialize to their default states. After that, VDD must be
                        lowered to below VPOR and back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See
                        Section 8.4 “Power-on reset requirements”.
                    6.7 Interrupt output (INT)
                        An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                        After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when
                        data on the port is changed to the original setting or when data is read from the port that
                        generated the interrupt (see Figure 10). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the
                        acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL
                        signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very
                        short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after
                        resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                        A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                        to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                        contents of the Input port register.
                        The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires a pull-up resistor to VDD. INT
                        should be connected to the voltage source of the device that requires the interrupt
                        information. When using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt
                        is reset only when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs
                        in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the
                        rising edge of the SCL signal.

7. Bus transactions
                                    The PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the
                                    master and PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C through write and read commands using I2C-bus.
                                    The two communication lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL).
                                    Both lines must be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to
                                    the output stages of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                         7.1 Write commands
                                    Data is transmitted to the PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C by sending the device address and
                                    setting the Least Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 for device address). The
                                    command byte is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data
                                    that follows the command byte. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in
                                    one write transmission.

                         7.2 Read commands
                                    To read data from the PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C, the bus master must first send the
                                    PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see
                                    Figure 4 for device address). The command byte is sent after the address and determines
                                    which register is to be accessed.
                                    After a restart the device address is sent again, but this time the LSB is set to a logic 1.
                                    Data from the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the
                                    PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C (see Figure 9 and Figure 10).
                                    Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no
                                    limit on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte
                                    received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

               Transfer of data can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge
               phase is valid (output mode). It is assumed that the command byte has previously been programmed with 00h (read Input port
               register).
               This figure eliminates the command byte transfer, a restart, and slave address call between the initial slave address call and
               actual data transfer from P port (see Figure 9).

              P6, P7 are not used and need 100 k pull-up resistors to protect them from floating or the internal pull-up or pull-down
              selected.
        (1) No resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float due to the weak pull-up integrated into the device.

                       8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                               When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                               resistor as shown in Figure 12. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the
                               I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes
                               lower than VDD.
                               Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                               should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                               Figure 13 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED, which is not needed with
                               the PCAL9554B or PCAL9554C that integrate a weak pull-up resistor on all pins.
                               Figure 14 shows VDD less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these
                               methods maintain the I/O VI at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current
                               consumption when the LED is off.

                             The Output drive strength registers allow the user to control the output drive level of the
                             GPIO. Each GPIO can be configured independently to one of the four possible output
                             current levels. By programming these bits the user is changing the number of transistor
                             pairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad.
                             Figure 15 shows a simplified output stage. The behavior of the pad is affected by the
                             Configuration register, the output port data, and the current control register. When the
                             Current Control register bits are programmed to 10b, then only two of the fingers are
                             active, reducing the current drive capability by 50 %.

                        Reducing the current drive capability may be desirable to reduce system noise. When the
                        output switches (transitions from H/L), there is a peak current that is a function of the
                        output drive selection. This peak current runs through VDD and VSS package inductance
                        and will create noise (some radiated, but more critically Simultaneous Switching Noise
                        (SSN)). In other words, switching many outputs at the same time will create ground and
                        supply noise. The output drive strength control through the Current Control registers
                        allows the user to mitigate SSN issues without the need of additional external
                        components.
                    8.3 12 V tolerant I/Os
                        The PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C device SCR group reference diode can go up to 10 V
                        before latch back to 8 V. The ESD gate oxide will protect the device, but not if used
                        continually. Therefore, to achieve 12 V tolerant I/Os, the external protection circuitry
                        (diode) must be used as shown in Figure 16.

                    8.4 Power-on reset requirements
                        In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCAL9554B/PCAL9554C can be reset to its
                        default conditions by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the
                        device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the
                        device is powered on for the first time in an application.
                        The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18.

                                other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and device impedance are factors that
                                affect power-on reset performance. Figure 19 and Table 18 provide more information on
                                how to measure these specifications.

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 20 and Table 18 provide more details on this specification.

                                                                               Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus/SMBus low power I/O port
                    8.5 Device current consumption with internal pull-up and pull-down
                        resistors
                        The PCAL9554B; PCAL9554C integrates programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors
                        to eliminate external components when pins are configured as inputs and pull-up or
                        pull-down resistors are required (for example, nothing is driving the inputs to the power
                        supply rails. Since these pull-up and pull-down resistors are internal to the device itself,
                        they contribute to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the
                        overall system design.
                        The pull-up or pull-down function is selected in register 44h, while the resistor is
                        connected by the enable register 43h. The configuration of the resistors is shown in
                        Figure 6.
                        If the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to VDD, a current will flow from
                        the VDD pin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will
                        appear as additional IDD upsetting any current consumption measurements.
                        In the same manner, if the resistor is configured as a pull-down and the pin is held HIGH,
                        current will flow from the power supply through the pin to the VSS pin. While this current
                        will not be measured as part of IDD, one must be mindful of the 200 mA limiting value
                        through VSS.
                        The pull-up and pull-down resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with
                        voltage. The resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 k with a nominal
                        100 k value. Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins
                        held HIGH or LOW and the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 24 for a
                        graph of supply current versus the number of pull-up resistors.

                         All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                         normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                         described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                         This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                         of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                         soldering description”.
                    17.1 Introduction to soldering
                         Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                         Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                         the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                         ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                         Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                         suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                         densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                    17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                         Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                         a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                           • Through-hole components
                           • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                         Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                         packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                         leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                         due to an increased probability of bridging.
                         The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                         component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                         packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                         Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                           •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                           •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                           •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                           •  Package placement
                           •  Inspection and repair
                           •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                              transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                              exposed to the wave
                           • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                    17.4 Reflow soldering
                         Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                           • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                              higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 34) than a SnPb process, thus
                              reducing the process window
                           • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                              window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                           • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                              heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                              temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                              characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                              packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                              depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                              Table 25 and 26

                         Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                         times.
                         Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                         soldering, see Figure 34.
