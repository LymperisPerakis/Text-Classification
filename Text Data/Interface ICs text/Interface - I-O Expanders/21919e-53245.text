The GPIO module contains the data port (GPIO),
                                                                           Registers
internal pull up resistors and the Output Latches                The Configuration and Control blocks contain the
(OLAT).                                                          registers as shown in Table 1-3.
Reading the GPIO register reads the value on the port.
Reading the OLAT register only reads the OLAT, not
the actual value on the port.
Writing to the GPIO register actually causes a write to
the OLAT. Writing to the OLAT register forces the
associated output drivers to drive to the level in OLAT.
Pins configured as inputs turn off the associated output
driver and put it in high-impedance.

against the associated bit in the DEFVAL register. If a

by a read of INTCAP or GPIO.
1.7.1        INTERRUPT CONDITIONS
There are two possible configurations to cause                  INT           ACTIVE             ACTIVE
interrupts (configured via INTCON):
1.   Pins configured for interrupt-on-pin-change
     will cause an interrupt to occur if a pin changes
                                                                   Port value
     to the opposite state. The default state is reset                                       Read GPIU
                                                                   is captured
     after an interrupt occurs. For example, an                    into INTCAP               or INTCAP
     interrupt occurs by an input changing from 1 to                                   (INT clears only if interrupt
     0. The new initial state for the pin is a logic 0.                                condition does not exist.)
2.   Pins configured for interrupt-on-change from
     register value will cause an interrupt to occur if
     the corresponding input pin differs from the
     register bit. The interrupt condition will remain as
     long as the condition exists, regardless if the
     INTAP or GPIO is read.
See Figure 1-6 and Figure 1-7 for more information on
interrupt operations.

NOTES:
DS21919E-page 42  © 2007 Microchip Technology Inc.


 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
