1.0        DEVICE OVERVIEW
The MCP23X09 device provides 8-bit, general purpose
parallel I/O expansion for I2C bus or SPI applications.
The two devices differ only in the serial interface.
• MCP23009 - I2C interface
• MCP23S09 - SPI interface
The MCP23X09 consists of multiple 8-bit configuration
registers for input, output and polarity selection. The
system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or
outputs by writing the I/O configuration bits. The data
for each input or output is kept in the corresponding
input or output register. The polarity of the input port
register can be inverted with the polarity inversion
register. All registers can be read by the system master.
The interrupt output can be configured to activate
under two conditions (mutually exclusive):
1.   When any input state differs from its
     corresponding input port register state. This is
     used to indicate to the system master that an
     input state has changed.
2.   When an input state differs from a pre-
     configured register value (DEFVAL register).
The Interrupt Capture register captures port values at
the time of the interrupt, thereby saving the condition
that caused the interrupt.
The Power-on Reset (POR) sets the registers to their
default values and initializes the device state machine.
The hardware address pin is used to determine the
device address.

1.3.3        SPI INTERFACE
The MCP23S09 operates in Mode 0,0 and Mode 1,1.
The difference between the two modes is the idle state
of the clock.
Mode 0,0: The idle state of the clock is LOW. Input data
is latched on the rising edge of the clock; output data is
driven on the falling edge of the clock.
Mode 1,1: The idle state of the clock is HIGH. Input
data is latched on the rising edge of the clock; output
data is driven on the falling edge of the clock.
1.3.3.1        SPI Write Operation
The SPI write operation is started by lowering CS. The
write command (slave address with R/W bit cleared) is
then clocked into the device. The opcode is followed by
an address and at least one data byte.
1.3.3.2        SPI Read Operation
The SPI read operation is started by lowering CS. The
SPI read command (slave address with R/W bit set) is
then clocked into the device. The opcode is followed by
an address, with at least one data byte being clocked
out of the device.
1.3.3.3        SPI Sequential Write/Read
For sequential operations, instead of deselecting the
device by raising CS, the master clocks the next byte
pointed to by the address pointer. (see Section 1.3.1
“Byte Mode and Sequential Mode” for details
regarding sequential operation control).
The sequence ends by the raising of CS.
The MCP23S09 address pointer will roll over to
address zero after reaching the last register address.

MCP23009/MCP23S09
1.5       GPIO Port
The GPIO module is a general purpose 8-bit wide
bidirectional port.
The outputs are open-drain.
The GPIO module contains the data ports (GPIOn),
internal pull up resistors and the Output Latches
(OLATn).
The pull up resistors are individually configured and
can be enabled when the pin is configured as an input
or output.
Reading the GPIOn register reads the value on the
port. Reading the OLATn register only reads the
latches, not the actual value on the port.
Writing to the GPIOn register actually causes a write to
the latches (OLATn). Writing to the OLATn register
forces the associated output drivers to drive to the level
in OLATn. Pins configured as inputs turn off the
associated output driver and put it in high-impedance.

1.6.8        INTERRUPT FLAG REGISTER
The INTF register reflects the interrupt condition on the
port pins of any pin that is enabled for interrupts via the
GPINTEN register. A ‘set’ bit indicates that the
associated pin caused the interrupt.
This register is ‘read only’. Writes to this register will be
ignored.

• INTCON - Controls the source for the IOC
• DEFVAL - Contains the register default for IOC
   operation
• IOCON (ODR and INTPOL) - configures the INT
   pin as push-pull, open-drain, and active level
   (high or low).
1.7.1         IOC FROM PIN CHANGE
If enabled, the MCP23X09 will generate an interrupt if
a mismatch condition exists between the current port
value and the previous port value. Only IOC enabled
pins will be compared. See GPINTEN and INTCON
registers.
1.7.2         IOC FROM REGISTER DEFAULT
If enabled, the MCP23X09 will generate an interrupt if
a mismatch occurs between the DEFVAL register and
the port. Only IOC enabled pins will be compared. See
GPINTEN, INTCON, and DEFVAL registers.
1.7.3         INTERRUPT OPERATION
The INT interrupt output can be configured as “active
low”, “active high”, or “open-drain” via the IOCON
register.
Only those pins that are configured as an input (IODIR
register) with interrupt-on-change (IOC) enabled
(GPINTEN register) can cause an interrupt. Pins
configured as an output have no effect on the interrupt
output pin.
Input change activity on a port input pin that is enabled
for IOC will generate an internal device interrupt and
the device will capture the value of the port and copy it
into INTCAP.
The first interrupt event will cause the port contents to
be copied into the INTCAP register. Subsequent
interrupt conditions on the port will not cause an
interrupt to occur as long as the interrupt is not cleared
by a read of INTCAP or GPIO.

                Note:   In the event the full Microchip part number cannot be marked on one line, it will
                        be carried over to the next line, thus limiting the number of available
                        characters for customer-specific information.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
