                 8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with 2-kbit EEPROM
                 Rev. 4.1 — 5 May 2017                                               Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9500 is an 8-bit I/O expander with an on-board 2-kbit EEPROM.
              The I/O expander's eight quasi-bidirectional data pins can be independently assigned as
              inputs or outputs to monitor board level status or activate indicator devices such as LEDs.
              The system master writes to the I/O configuration bits in the same way as for the
              PCF8574. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding Input or Output
              register. The system master can read all registers.
              The EEPROM can be used to store error codes or board manufacturing data for
              read-back by application software for diagnostic purposes and is included in the I/O
              expander package.
              The PCA9500 has three address pins with internal pull-up resistors allowing up to eight
               devices to share the common two-wire I2C software protocol serial data bus. The fixed
              GPIO I2C-bus address is the same as the PCF8574 and the fixed EEPROM I2C-bus
              address is the same as the PCF8582C-2, so the PCA9500 appears as two separate
              devices to the bus master.
              The PCA9500 supports hot insertion to facilitate usage in removable cards on backplane
              systems.
              The PCA9501 is an alternative to the functionally similar PCA9500 for systems where a
              higher number of devices are required to share the same I2C-bus or an interrupt output is
              required.

                   [1]  HVQFN16 package supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must be
                        connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level
                        performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the
                        board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the
                        printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.

                       Following a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is
                       accessing. The address of the PCA9500 is shown in Figure 6. Internal pull-up resistors
                       are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins.
                       The last bit of the address byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1
                       a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.

                       The PCA9500 contains a single 8-bit register called the Control register, which can be
                       written and read via the I2C-bus. This register is sent after a successful acknowledgment
                       of the slave address. It contains the I/O operation information.

                                    Each of the PCA9500's eight I/Os can be independently used as an input or output.
                                    Output data is transmitted to the port by the I/O Write mode (see Figure 7). Input I/O data
                                    is transferred from the port to the microcontroller by the Read mode (see Figure 8).

                 7.3.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/Os
                             A quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control
                             signal for data direction. At power-on the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode, only a current
                             source to VDD is active. An additional strong pull-up to VDD allows fast rising edges into
                             heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH, and are
                             switched off by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being used as
                             inputs. See Figure 9.

                     7.4 Memory operations
                 7.4.1 Write operations
                             Write operations require an additional address field to indicate the memory address
                             location to be written. The address field is eight bits long, providing access to any one of
                             the 256 words of memory. There are two types of write operations, ‘byte write’ and
                             ‘page write’.
                             Write operation is possible when the Write Control pin (WC) is put at a LOW logic level (0).
                             When this control signal is set at 1, write operation is not possible and data in the memory
                             is protected.
                             ‘Byte write’ and ‘page write’ explained below assume that WC is set to 0.
                7.4.1.1      Byte write
                             To perform a byte write the START condition is followed by the memory slave address and
                             the R/W bit set to 0. The PCA9500 will respond with an acknowledge and then consider
                             the next eight bits sent as the word address and the eight bits after the word address as
                             the data. The PCA9500 will issue an acknowledge after the receipt of both the word
                             address and the data. To terminate the data transfer the master issues the STOP
                             condition, initiating the internal write cycle to the non-volatile memory. Only write and read
                             operations to the quasi-bidirectional I/Os are allowed during the internal write cycle.

               7.4.1.2      Page write
                            A page write is initiated in the same way as the byte write. If after sending the first word of
                            data, the STOP condition is not received, the PCA9500 considers subsequent words as
                            data. After each data word the PCA9500 responds with an acknowledge and the two least
                            significant bits of the memory address field are incremented. Should the master not send
                            a STOP condition after four data words, the address counter will return to its initial value
                            and overwrite the data previously written. After the receipt of the STOP condition the
                            inputs will behave as with the byte write during the internal write cycle.

                 7.4.2 Read operations
                            PCA9500 read operations are initiated in an identical manner to write operations with the
                            exception that the memory slave address R/W bit is set to ‘1’. There are three types of
                            read operations: current address read, random read and sequential read.
               7.4.2.1      Current address read
                            The PCA9500 contains an internal address counter that increments after each read or
                            write access and as a result, if the last word accessed was at address ‘n’, then the
                            address counter contains the address ‘n + 1’.
                            When the PCA9500 receives its memory slave address with the R/W bit set to one it
                            issues an acknowledge and uses the next eight clocks to transmit the data contained at
                            the address stored in the address counter. The master ceases the transmission by issuing
                            the STOP condition after the eighth bit. There is no ninth clock cycle for the acknowledge.
                            See Figure 12.

                7.4.2.2       Random read
                              The PCA9500's random read mode allows the address to be read from to be specified by
                              the master. This is done by performing a dummy write to set the address counter to the
                              location to be read. The master must perform a byte write to the address location to be
                              read, but instead of transmitting the data after receiving the acknowledge from the
                              PCA9500, the master re-issues the START condition and memory slave address with the
                              R/W bit set to one. The PCA9500 will then transmit an acknowledge and use the next
                              eight clock cycles to transmit the data contained in the addressed location. The master
                              ceases the transmission by issuing the STOP condition after the eighth bit, omitting the
                              ninth clock cycle acknowledge.

                7.4.2.3       Sequential read
                              The PCA9500 sequential read is an extension of either the current address read or
                              random read. If the master does not issue a STOP condition after it has received the
                              eighth data bit, but instead issues an acknowledge, the PCA9500 will increment the
                              address counter and use the next eight cycles to transmit the data from that location. The
                              master can continue this process to read the contents of the entire memory. Upon
                              reaching address 255 the counter will return to address 0 and continue transmitting data
                              until a STOP condition is received. The master ceases the transmission by issuing the
                              STOP condition after the eighth bit, omitting the ninth clock cycle acknowledge.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                             PCA9500
                                                                           8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with 2-kbit EEPROM
8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 15).

                8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S).
                       A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 16).

                   8.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 17).

                   8.3 Acknowledge
                       The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                       transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                       acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                       whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                       A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                       each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                       that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                       pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                       LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
                       time must be taken into account.
                       A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                       acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                       transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                       condition.

9. Application design-in information
                       A central processor/controller typically located on the system main board can use the
                       400 kHz I2C-bus/SMBus to poll the PCA9500 devices located on the system cards for
                       status or version control type of information. The PCA9500 may be programmed at
                       manufacturing to store information regarding board build, firmware version, manufacturer
                       identification, configuration option data, and so on. Alternately, these devices can be used
                       as convenient interface for board configuration, thereby utilizing the I2C-bus/SMBus as an
                       intra-system communication bus.

  Fig 21. VOH versus IOH
                               Remark: Rapid fall-off in VOH at current inception is due to a diode that provides 5 V
                               overvoltage protection for the GPIO I/O pins. When the GPIO I/O are being used as
                               inputs, the internal current source VOH should be evaluated to determine if external pull-up
                               resistors are required to provide sufficient VIH threshold noise margin.

       voltage swing of VSS to VDD.
[2]    tpu(R) and tpu(W) are the delays required from the time VDD is stable until the specified operation can be initiated. These parameters are
       guaranteed by design.
[3]    Tcy(W) is the maximum time that the device requires to perform the internal write operation.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                                                                         8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with 2-kbit EEPROM
                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 27) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                      > 2.5                                   250                                         245                     245
                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 27.
