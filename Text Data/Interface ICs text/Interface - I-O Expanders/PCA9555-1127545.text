                  16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with interrupt
                  Rev. 10 — 8 November 2017                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9555 is a 24-pin CMOS device that provides 16 bits of General Purpose parallel
              Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was developed to
              enhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. The improvements
              include higher drive capability, 5 V I/O tolerance, lower supply current, individual I/O
              configuration, and smaller packaging. I/O expanders provide a simple solution when
              additional I/O is needed for ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fans, etc.
              The PCA9555 consists of two 8-bit Configuration (Input or Output selection); Input, Output
              and Polarity Inversion (active HIGH or active LOW operation) registers. The system
              master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration
              bits. The data for each Input or Output is kept in the corresponding Input or Output
              register. The polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion
              register. All registers can be read by the system master. Although pin-to-pin and I2C-bus
              address compatible with the PCF8575, software changes are required due to the
              enhancements, and are discussed in Application Note AN469.
              The PCA9555 open-drain interrupt output is activated when any input state differs from its
              corresponding input port register state and is used to indicate to the system master that
              an input state has changed. The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values
              and initializes the device state machine.
              Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) vary the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
              devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The fixed I2C-bus address of the PCA9555 is
              the same as the PCA9554, allowing up to eight of these devices in any combination to
              share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                      regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by Register 3. Writes to
                      this register have no effect.
                      The default value ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level.

                      This register is an output-only port. It reflects the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined
                      as outputs by Registers 6 and 7. Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined
                      as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that is in the flip-flop controlling
                      the output selection, not the actual pin value.

                6.2.5 Registers 6 and 7: Configuration registers
                       This register configures the directions of the I/O pins. If a bit in this register is set (written
                       with ‘1’), the corresponding port pin is enabled as an input with high-impedance output
                       driver. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with ‘0’), the corresponding port pin is
                       enabled as an output. Note that there is a high value resistor tied to VDD at each pin. At
                       reset, the device's ports are inputs with a pull-up to VDD.

                   6.3 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9555 in a reset
                       condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the
                       PCA9555 registers and SMBus state machine will initialize to their default states. The
                       power-on reset typically completes the reset and enables the part by the time the power
                       supply is above VPOR. However, when it is required to reset the part by lowering the power
                       supply, it is necessary to lower it below 0.2 V.
                   6.4 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a
                       high-impedance input with a weak pull-up to VDD. The input voltage may be raised above
                       VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, then either Q1 or Q2 is on, depending on the state of
                       the Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied to an
                       I/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance path that exists between the
                       pin and either VDD or VSS.

                6.5.1 Writing to the port registers
                       Data is transmitted to the PCA9555 by sending the device address and setting the least
                       significant bit to a logic 0 (see Figure 7 “PCA9555 device address”). The command byte is
                       sent after the address and determines which register will receive the data following the
                       command byte.
                       The eight registers within the PCA9555 are configured to operate as four register pairs.
                       The four pairs are Input Ports, Output Ports, Polarity Inversion Ports, and Configuration
                       Ports. After sending data to one register, the next data byte will be sent to the other
                       register in the pair (see Figure 9 and Figure 10). For example, if the first byte is sent to
                       Output Port 1 (register 3), then the next byte will be stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).
                       There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this
                       way, each 8-bit register may be updated independently of the other registers.

                                                                                                   16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with interrupt
                   6.5.2 Reading the port registers
                                In order to read data from the PCA9555, the bus master must first send the PCA9555
                                address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 7 “PCA9555 device
                                address”). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will
                                be accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent again, but this time the least
                                significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte will
                                then be sent by the PCA9555 (see Figure 11, Figure 12 and Figure 13). Data is clocked
                                into the register on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is
                                read, additional bytes may be read but the data will now reflect the information in the other
                                register in the pair. For example, if you read Input Port 1, then the next byte read would be
                                Input Port 0. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes received in one read
                                transmission but the final byte received, the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

                                                                                       16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with interrupt
                6.5.3 Interrupt output
                       The open-drain interrupt output is activated when one of the port pins changes state and
                       the pin is configured as an input. The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to its
                       previous state or the Input Port register is read (see Figure 12). A pin configured as an
                       output cannot cause an interrupt. Since each 8-bit port is read independently, the interrupt
                       caused by Port 0 will not be cleared by a read of Port 1 or the other way around.
                       Remark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register.
7. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   7.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 14).

                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 15).

                   7.2 System configuration
                         A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                         device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                         the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 16).

                   7.3 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                         acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                         whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                         LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
                         time must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

14. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 30) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 16 and 17

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 30.

16. Soldering of through-hole mount packages
                16.1 Introduction to soldering through-hole mount packages
                     This text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.
                     Wave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages
                     on a printed-circuit board.
                16.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave
                     Driven by legislation and environmental forces the worldwide use of lead-free solder
                     pastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from
                     3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 C or 265 C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb
                     or Pb-free respectively.
                     The total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.
                     The device may be mounted up to the seating plane, but the temperature of the plastic
                     body must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (Tstg(max)). If the
                     printed-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately
                     after soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.
                16.3 Manual soldering
                     Apply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the
                     seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If the temperature of the soldering iron bit is
                     less than 300 C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is
                     between 300 C and 400 C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.
