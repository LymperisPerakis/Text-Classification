16 I/O ports. Ports are divided into eight push-pull outputs                        ●● +1.71V to +5.5V Operation
and eight I/Os with selectable internal pullups and transition
detection. Eight ports are push-pull outputs and eight I/Os                         ●● 8 Push-Pull Outputs
may be used as a logic input or an open-drain output.                               ●● 8 Open-Drain I/O Ports, Rated to 20mA Sink Current
Ports are overvoltage protected to +6V.                                             ●● I/O Ports are Overvoltage Protected to +6V
All I/O ports configured as inputs are continuously monitored                       ●● Selectable I/O Port Power-Up Default Logic States

 Setup Time
Note 1: All parameters are tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: A master device must provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to VIL of the SCL signal) in order to
         bridge the undefined region of SCL’s falling edge.
Note 3: Guaranteed by design.
Note 4: Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF. ISINK ≤ 6mA. tR and tF measured between 0.3 × V+ and 0.7 × V+.
Note 5: Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50ns.

The MAX7325 is a general-purpose port expander operating
from a +1.71V to +5.5V supply with eight push-pull outputs   Configure any port as a logic input by setting the port
and eight open-drain I/O ports. Each open-drain output is    output logic-high (logic-high for an open-drain output is
rated to sink 20mA, and the entire device is rated to sink   high impedance). When the MAX7325 is read through
100mA into all ports combined. The outputs drive loads       the serial interface, the actual logic levels at the ports are
connected to supplies up to +5.5V.                           read back.
