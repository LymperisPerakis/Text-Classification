The Intersil 82C55A is a high performance CMOS version of             Features
the industry standard 8255A and is manufactured using a
self-aligned silicon gate CMOS process (Scaled SAJI IV).              • Pb-Free Plus Anneal Available (RoHS Compliant)
                                                                        (See Ordering Info)
The MX82C55A has identical features as the X82C55 with
the exception of no bus hold devices on the port pins. It is a        • Pin Compatible with OKI MSM82C55A
general purpose programmable I/O device which may be                    - No Bus Hold Devices on any Port Pins
used with many different microprocessors. There are 24 I/O

pins which may be individually programmed in two groups of
12 and used in three major modes of operation. The high               • Fully TTL Compatible
performance and industry standard configuration of the                • High Speed, No “Wait State” Operation with 8MHz 80C86
82C55A make it compatible with the 80C86, 80C88 and                     and 80C88
other microprocessors.

Intersil advanced SAJI process results in performance equal
to or greater than existing functionally equivalent products at       • L7 Process
a fraction of the power.

**Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through hole wave solder processing
only. They are not intended for use in Reflow solder processing
applications.
NOTE: Intersil Pb-free plus anneal products employ special Pb-free
material sets; molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte
tin plate termination finish, which are RoHS compliant and compatible
with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations. Intersil Pb-free
products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that
meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

     VCC                 VCC: The +5V power supply pin. A 0.1F capacitor between VCC and GND is recommended for decoupling.
     GND                 GROUND
    D0-D7         I/O    DATA BUS: The Data Bus lines are bidirectional three-state pins connected to the system data bus.
    RESET           I    RESET: A high on this input clears the control register and all ports (A, B, C) are set to the input mode.
      CS            I    CHIP SELECT: Chip select is an active low input used to enable the 82C55A onto the Data Bus for CPU
                         communications.

There are three basic modes of operation than can be selected
by the system software:                                                                                             PORT C (LOWER)

   Mode 2 - Bidirectional Bus                                                                                       1 = INPUT

When the reset input goes “high”, all ports will be set to the                                                      MODE SELECTION

required. The control word register will contain 9Bh. During the                                                         GROUP A

• Each group contains one 8-bit port and one 4-bit control/data

• The 8-bit data port can be either input or output. Both inputs
   and outputs are latched.
• The 4-bit port is used for control and status of the 8-bit port.
Input Control Signal Definition
(Figures 6 and 7)
STB (Strobe Input)
A “low” on this input loads data into the input latch.
IBF (Input Buffer Full F/F)
A “high” on this output indicates that the data has been loaded
into the input latch: in essence, an acknowledgment. IBF is set by
STB input being low and is reset by the rising edge of the RD
input.
INTR (Interrupt Request)
A “high” on this output can be used to interrupt the CPU when an
input device is requesting service. INTR is set by the condition:
STB is a “one”, IBF is a “one” and INTE is a “one”. It is reset by the
falling edge of RD. This procedure allows an input device to
request service from the CPU by simply strobing its data into the
port.
INTE A
Controlled by bit set/reset of PC4.
INTE B
Controlled by bit set/reset of PC2.

     mold protrusion is 0.010 inch (0.25mm) per side. Dimensions D1
     and E1 include mold mismatch and are measured at the extreme
     material condition at the body parting line.
 4. To be measured at seating plane -C- contact point.
 5. Centerline to be determined where center leads exit plastic body.
 6. “N” is the number of terminal positions.
