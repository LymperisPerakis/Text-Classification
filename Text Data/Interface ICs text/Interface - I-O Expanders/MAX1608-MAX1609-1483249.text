                                                                                                                                                MAX1608/MAX1609
The MAX1608/MAX1609 provide remote input/output (I/O)           ♦ Serial-to-Parallel or Parallel-to-Serial Conversions
expansion through an SMBus™ 2-wire serial interface.
Each device has eight high-voltage open-drain outputs           ♦ 8 General-Purpose Digital I/O Pins
that double as TTL-level logic inputs, providing continuous       (Withstand +28V)
bidirectional capabilities. The open-drain outputs tailor the   ♦ SMBus 2-Wire Serial Interface
MAX1608/MAX1609 for use in load-switching and other
level-shifting applications as well as general-purpose I/O      ♦ Supports SMBSUS Asynchronous Suspend
applications.
                                                                ♦ 9 Pin-Selectable Slave Addresses
Two complete sets of registers allow the device and its
outputs to be toggled between two states using the              ♦ Outputs High Impedance on Power-Up (MAX1609)
SMBSUS input, without the inherent latency of reprogram-        ♦ Outputs Low on Power-Up (MAX1608)
ming outputs over the serial bus. The eight I/O lines are
continuously monitored and can be used as inputs. Each          ♦ 2.5µA Supply Current
line can generate asynchronous maskable interrupts on           ♦ +2.7V to +5.5V Supply Range
the falling edge, the rising edge, or both edges.

For load-switching applications, the MAX1608 is designed
to drive n-channel MOSFETs, and its outputs are low upon
power-up; the MAX1609 is designed to drive p-channel
MOSFETs, and its I/Os are high impedance upon power-
up. Other features of both devices include thermal-over-                                            Ordering Information
load and output-overcurrent protection, ultra-low supply

                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

 SMBDATA Valid Time
Note 1:                        Specifications from 0°C to -40°C are guaranteed by design, not production tested.
Note 2:                        For supply current, SMBus logic inputs driven to 0 or V+.
Note 3:                        Data hold and set-up times measured from falling edge of 9th clock.
Note 4:                        Must be driven to GND, V+, or floating. See SMBus Addressing section.
Note 5:                        The SMBus logic block is a static design and will work with clock frequencies down to DC. While slow operation is possible,
                               it violates the 10kHz minimum clock frequency and SMBus specifications and may use excessive space on the bus.
