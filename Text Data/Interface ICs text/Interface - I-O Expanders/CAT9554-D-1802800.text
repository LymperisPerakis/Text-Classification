CAT9554, CAT9554A
8-bit I2C and SMBus I/O Port
with Interrupt
Description
  The CAT9554 and CAT9554A are CMOS devices that provide 8−bit
parallel input/output port expansion for I2C and SMBus compatible                             http://onsemi.com
applications. These I/O expanders provide a simple solution in
applications where additional I/Os are needed: sensors, power
switches, LEDs, pushbuttons, and fans.
  The CAT9554/9554A consist of an input port register, an output port
register, a configuration register, a polarity inversion register and an
I2C/SMBus−compatible serial interface.                                           SOIC−16                         TQFN−16
                                                                                 W SUFFIX                       HV4 SUFFIX
  Any of the eight I/Os can be configured as an input or output by              CASE 751BG                      CASE 510AE
writing to the configuration register. The system master can invert the
CAT9554/9554A input data by writing to the active−high polarity
inversion register.
  The CAT9554/9554A features an active low interrupt output which
                                                                                                    TSSOP−16
indicates to the system master that an input state has changed.                                     Y SUFFIX
  The device’s extended addressing capability allows up to 8 devices                               CASE 948AN
to share the same bus. The CAT9554A is identical to the CAT9554
except the fixed part of the I2C slave address is different. This allows
up to 16 of devices (eight CAT9554 and eight CAT9554A) to be                               PIN CONNECTIONS
connected on the same bus.                                                                         1
