A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’, a device
receiving the message is the ‘receiver’. The device that
controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which
are controlled by the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Fig.5).

    Remote 16-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus                                                                            PCF8575
7      FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
7.1          Quasi-bidirectional I/Os
The PCF8575’s 16 ports (see Fig.7) are entirely independent and can be used either as input or output ports. Input data
is transferred from the ports to the microcontroller in the READ mode (see Fig.10). Output data is transmitted to the ports
in the WRITE mode (see Fig.9).
This quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control signal for data direction.
At power-on the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode only a current source (IOH) to VDD is active. An additional strong pull-up to
VDD (IOHt) allows fast rising edges into heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH,
and are switched off by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being used as inputs. After power-on
as all the I/Os are set HIGH all of them can be used as input. Any change in setting of the I/Os as either inputs or outputs
can be done with the write mode. Warning: If a HIGH is applied to an I/O which has been written earlier to LOW, a large
current (IOL) will flow to VSS. (see Characteristics note 3).

7.2          Addressing
Figures 8, 9 and 10 show the address and timing diagrams. Before any data is transmitted or received the master must
send the address of the receiver via the SDA line. The first byte transmitted after the START condition carries the address
of the slave device and the read/write bit. The address of the slave device must not be changed between the START and
the STOP conditions. The PCF8575 acts as a slave receiver or a slave transmitter.

Note
1. Stress above those listed under ‘Absolute Maximum Ratings’ may cause permanent damage to the device. This is
     a stress ratings only and functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in
     the operational sections of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for

9    HANDLING
Inputs and outputs are protected against electrostatic discharge in normal handling. However, to be totally safe, it is
desirable to take precautions appropriate to handling MOS devices. Advice can be found in Data Handbook IC12 under
“Handling MOS Devices”.

Notes
1. The power-on reset circuit resets the I2C-bus logic with VDD < VPOR and sets all I/Os to logic 1 (with current source
      to VDD).
2. The value is not tested, but verified on sampling basis.
3. A single LOW-level output current (IOL) must not exceed 20 mA for an extended time. The sum of all IOLs at any point
      in time must not exceed 100 mA.

Notes
1. All the timing values are valid within the operating supply voltage and ambient temperature range and refer to VIL
     and VIH with an input voltage swing of VSS to VDD.
2. The device inputs SDA and SCL are filtered and will reject spikes on the bus lines of widths less than tSW(max).
3. The rise and fall times specified here refer to the driver device (PCF8575) and are part of the general fast I2C-bus
     specification when PCF8575 asserts an acknowledge on SDA, the minimum fall time is 20 ns + 0.1Cb.

Notes
1. All surface mount (SMD) packages are moisture sensitive. Depending upon the moisture content, the maximum
    temperature (with respect to time) and body size of the package, there is a risk that internal or external package
    cracks may occur due to vaporization of the moisture in them (the so called popcorn effect). For details, refer to the
    Drypack information in the “Data Handbook IC26; Integrated Circuit Packages; Section: Packing Methods”.
2. These packages are not suitable for wave soldering as a solder joint between the printed-circuit board and heatsink
    (at bottom version) can not be achieved, and as solder may stick to the heatsink (on top version).
3. If wave soldering is considered, then the package must be placed at a 45° angle to the solder wave direction.
    The package footprint must incorporate solder thieves downstream and at the side corners.
4. Wave soldering is only suitable for LQFP, TQFP and QFP packages with a pitch (e) equal to or larger than 0.8 mm;
    it is definitely not suitable for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.65 mm.
5. Wave soldering is only suitable for SSOP and TSSOP packages with a pitch (e) equal to or larger than 0.65 mm; it is
    definitely not suitable for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.5 mm.
