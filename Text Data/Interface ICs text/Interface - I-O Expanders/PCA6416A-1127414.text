1. General description
             The PCA6416A is a 16-bit general purpose I/O expander that provides remote I/O
             expansion for most microcontroller families via the I2C-bus interface.
             NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while
             keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in battery-powered mobile
             applications for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, keypad, etc. In addition to providing
             a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of a processor running at one voltage
             level to I/O devices operating at a different (usually higher) voltage level. The PCA6416A
             has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely flexible in mixed
             signal environments where communication between incompatible I/O voltages is required.
             Its wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V on the dual power rail allows seamless
             communications with next-generation low voltage microprocessors and microcontrollers
             on the interface side (SDA/SCL) and peripherals at a higher voltage on the port side.
             There are two supply voltages for PCA6416A: VDD(I2C-bus) and VDD(P). VDD(I2C-bus)
             provides the supply voltage for the interface at the master side (for example, a
             microcontroller) and the VDD(P) provides the supply for core circuits and Port P. The
             bidirectional voltage level translation in the PCA6416A is provided through VDD(I2C-bus).
             VDD(I2C-bus) should be connected to the VDD of the external SCL/SDA lines. This indicates
             the VDD level of the I2C-bus to the PCA6416A. The voltage level on Port P of the
             PCA6416A is determined by the VDD(P).
             The PCA6416A register set consists of four pairs of 8-bit Configuration, Input, Output, and
             Polarity Inversion registers.
             At power-on, the I/Os are configured as inputs. However, the system master can enable
             the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for
             each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of
             the Input Port register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register, saving external
             logic gates.
             The system master can reset the PCA6416A in the event of a time-out or other improper
             operation by asserting a LOW in the RESET input. The power-on reset puts the registers
             in their default state and initializes the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The RESET pin
             causes the same reset/initialization to occur without depowering the part.
             The PCA6416A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
             from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system
             master that an input state has changed.

                                                           Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
                   signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
                   on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCA6416A can
                   remain a simple slave device.
                   The device Port P outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while
                   consuming low device current.
                   One hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C-bus address
                   and allow up to two devices to share the same I2C-bus or SMBus.

                         Fig 6.   PCA6416A address
                       ADDR is the hardware address package pin and is held to either HIGH (logic 1) or LOW
                       (logic 0) to assign one of the two possible slave addresses. The last bit of the slave
                       address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH (logic 1)
                       selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.

                   7.3 Pointer register and command byte
                          Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                          command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCA6416A. The lower three
                          bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers (Input,
                          Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. This register is write only.
                          Once a new command has been sent, the register that was last addressed continues to
                          be accessed by reads until a new command byte is sent.
                                                                           B7     B6      B5      B4       B3     B2     B1   B0

                   7.4 Register descriptions
                7.4.1 Input port registers (00h, 01h)
                       The Input port registers (registers 0 and 1) reflect the incoming logic levels of the pins,
                       regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration
                       register. The Input port registers are read only; writes to these registers have no effect.
                       The default value ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port

                       The Output port registers (registers 2 and 3) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins
                       defined as outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no
                       effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from these registers reflect the value that
                       was written to these registers, not the actual pin value. A register pair write is described in
                       Section 8.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 8.2.

                7.4.3 Polarity inversion registers (04h, 05h)
                      The Polarity inversion registers (registers 4 and 5) allow polarity inversion of pins defined
                      as inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in these registers is set (written with ‘1’), the
                      corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted in the input register. If a bit in this register is
                      cleared (written with a ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s polarity is retained. A register pair
                      write is described in Section 8.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 8.2.

                      The Configuration registers (registers 6 and 7) configure the direction of the I/O pins. If a
                      bit in these registers is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a
                      high-impedance input. If a bit in these registers is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin
                      is enabled as an output. A register pair write is described in Section 8.1 and a register pair
                      read is described in Section 8.2.

                   7.5 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD(P) to a maximum of
                       5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD(P) or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                   7.6 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD(P), an internal power-on reset holds the
                       PCA6416A in a reset condition until VDD(P) has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCA6416A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                       initializes to their default states. After that, VDD(P) must be lowered to below VPOR and
                       back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 9.2 “Power-on reset
                       requirements”.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  PCA6416A
                                                               Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   7.7 Reset input (RESET)
                       The RESET input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the VDD(P) at its
                       operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a
                       minimum of tw(rst). The PCA6416A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are
                       changed to their default state once RESET is LOW (0). When RESET is HIGH (1), the I/O
                       levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input requires a
                       pull-up resistor to VDD(I2C-bus) if no active connection is used.
                   7.8 Interrupt output (INT)
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. The interrupt is reset when data on the port
                       changes back to the original value or when data is read from the port that generated the
                       interrupt (see Figure 12). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK)
                       or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that
                       occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the
                       resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Any change of the I/Os after resetting is
                       detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input Port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pull-up resistor to VDD(P) or
                       VDD(I2C-bus) depending on the application. INT should be connected to the voltage source
                       of the device that requires the interrupt information.
8. Bus transactions
                       The PCA6416A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                       PCA6416A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Write commands
                       Data is transmitted to the PCA6416A by sending the device address and setting the Least
                       Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 6 for device address). The command byte is
                       sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows the
                       command byte.
                       The eight registers within the PCA6416A are configured to operate as four register pairs.
                       The four pairs are input ports, output ports, polarity inversion and configuration registers.
                       After sending data to one register, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair
                       (see Figure 9 and Figure 10). For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1
                       (register 3), the next byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).
                       There is no limit on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way,
                       the host can continuously update a register pair independently of the other registers or the
                       host can simply update a single register.

                      8.2 Read commands
                                 To read data from the PCA6416A, the bus master must first send the PCA6416A address
                                 with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 6 for device address).
                                 The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is to be
                                 accessed.
                                 After a restart, the device address is sent again, but this time the least significant bit is set
                                 to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte is sent by the PCA6416A
                                 (see Figure 11 and Figure 12). Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the
                                 ACK clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read, but the data
                                 now reflects the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is
                                 read, the next byte read is Input Port 0.There is no limit on the number of data bytes
                                 received in one read transmission, but on the final byte received the bus master must not
                                 acknowledge the data.
                                 After a subsequent restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register to be
                                 read in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 was read last before the restart, the register
                                 that is read after the restart is the Input Port 0.

             P0_1 and P1_1 through P1_7 are configured as outputs.
         (1) External resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor
             is not needed. If an output in the P port is configured as a push-pull output there is no need for external pull-up resistors. If an
             output in the P port is configured as an open-drain output, external pull-up resistors are required.
  Fig 14. Typical application
                       9.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                               When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD(P) through a
                               resistor as shown in Figure 14. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O
                               VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD(P). The supply current, IDD(P), increases as VI becomes
                               lower than VDD(P).
                               Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                               should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD(P) when the LED is
                               off. Figure 15 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 16 shows VDD(P)
                               less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O
                               VI at or above VDD(P) and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is

                   9.2 Power-on reset requirements
                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCA6416A can be reset to its default conditions
                       by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a
                       power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is
                       powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18.

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 20 and Table 15 provide more details on this specification.

17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 35) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 23 and 24

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 35.
