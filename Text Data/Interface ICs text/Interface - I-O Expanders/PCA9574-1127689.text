1. General description
             The PCA9574 is a CMOS device that provides 8 bits of General Purpose parallel
             Input/Output (GPIO) expansion in low voltage processor and handheld battery powered
             mobile applications and was developed to enhance the NXP family of I2C-bus I/O
             expanders. The improvements include lower supply current, lower operating voltage of
             1.1 V to 3.6 V, dual and separate supply rails to allow voltage level translation anywhere
             between 1.1 V and 3.6 V, 400 kHz clock frequency, and smaller packaging. Any of the
             eight I/O ports can be configured as an input or output independent of each other and
             default on start-up to inputs. I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os
             are needed while keeping interconnections to a minimum; for example in battery powered
             mobile applications and clamshell devices for interfacing to sensors, push buttons,
             keypad, etc. In addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of
             a processor running at one voltage level to I/O devices operating at a different (usually
             higher) voltage level. PCA9574 has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices
             extremely flexible in mixed signal environments where communication between
             incompatible I/Os is required. The core of PCA9574 can operate at a voltage as low as
             1.1 V while the I/O bank can operate in the range 1.1 V to 3.6 V. Bus-hold with
             programmable on-chip pull-up or pull-down feature for I/Os is also provided.
             The system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O
             configuration register bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding
             Input or Output register. The polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity
             inversion register (active HIGH or active LOW operation). Either a bus-hold function or
             pull-up/pull-down feature can be selected by programming corresponding registers. The
             bus-hold provides a valid logic level when the I/O bus is not actively driven. When
             bus-hold feature is not selected, the I/O ports can be configured to have pull-up or
             pull-down by programming the pull-up/pull-down configuration register.
             An open-drain interrupt output pin (INT) allows monitoring of the input pins and is asserted
             each time a change occurs on an input port unless that port is masked
             (default = masked). A ‘GPIO All Call’ command allows programming multiple PCA9574s
             at the same time even if they have different individual I2C-bus addresses. This allows
             optimal code programming when more than one device needs to be programmed with the
             same instruction or if all outputs need to be turned on or off at the same time. The internal
             Power-On Reset (POR) or hardware reset pin (RESET) initializes the eight I/Os as inputs,
             sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state machine. The I/O
             bank is held in its default state when the logic supply (VDD) is off.
             One address select pin allows up to two PCA9574 devices to be connected with two
             different addresses on the same I2C-bus.

[1]   HVQFN16 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must be connected to supply
      ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be
      soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias
      need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

                      7.1 Device address
                             Following a START condition the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                             accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address of the
                             PCA9574 is shown in Figure 5. Slave address pin A0 chooses 1 of 2 slave addresses:
                             40h or 42h.
                                                                                       slave address

                   7.2 Command register
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address + R/W bit, the bus
                       master will send a byte to the PCA9574, which will be stored in the Command register.
                                                                     AI      X       X      X        X       D2     D1  D0

                                  Remark: The Command register does not apply to Software Reset I2C-bus address.
                         Fig 6.   Command register
                       The lowest three bits are used as a pointer to determine which register will be accessed.
                       Only a command register code with the three least significant bits equal to the eight
                       allowable values as defined in Table 4 “Register summary” will be acknowledged.
                       Reserved or undefined command codes will not be acknowledged. At power-up, this
                       register defaults to 00h, with the AI bit set to ‘0’, and the lowest 3 bits set to ‘0’.
                       If the Auto-Increment flag is set (AI = 1), the three least significant bits of the Command
                       register are automatically incremented after a read or write. This allows the user to
                       program and/or read the eight command registers (listed in Table 4) sequentially. It will
                       then roll over to register 00h after the last register is accessed and the selected registers
                       will be overwritten or re-read.
                       If the Auto-Increment flag is cleared (AI = 0), the three least significant bits are not
                       incremented after data is read or written, only one register will be repeatedly read or
                       written.

                       Data is transmitted to the PCA9574 by sending the device address and setting the least
                       significant bit to logic 0 (see Figure 5 for device address). The command byte is sent after
                       the address and determines which register will receive the data following the command
                       byte. Each 8-bit register may be updated independently of the other registers.

                                                            8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, level translating, low voltage GPIO
                   7.5 Reading the port registers
                       In order to read data from the PCA9574, the bus master must first send the PCA9574
                       address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 5 for device address). The
                       command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will be accessed.
                       After a restart, the device address is sent again but this time, the least significant bit is set
                       to logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte will then be sent by the
                       PCA9574. Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock
                       pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read using the auto-increment
                       feature.
                7.5.1 Register 0 - Input port register
                       This register is read-only. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless of
                       whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. Writes to
                       this register will be acknowledged but will have no effect.
                       The default ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level.

                7.5.2 Register 1 - Polarity inversion register
                       This register allows the user to invert the polarity of the Input port register data. If a bit in
                       this register is set (written with ‘1’), the corresponding Input port data is inverted. If a bit in
                       this register is cleared (written with a ‘0’), the Input port data polarity is retained.

                      Bit 0 of this register allows the user to enable/disable the bus-hold feature for the I/O pins.
                      Setting the bit 0 to logic 1 enables bus-hold feature for the I/O bank. In this mode, the
                      pull-up/pull-downs will be disabled. Setting the bit 0 to logic 0 disables bus-hold feature.
                      Bit 1 of this register allows the user to enable/disable pull-up/pull-downs on the I/O pins.
                      Setting the bit 1 to logic 1 enables selection of pull-up/pull-down using Register 3. Setting
                      the bit 1 to logic 0 disables pull-up/pull-downs on the I/O pins and contents of Register 3
                      will have no effect on the I/O.

                      can be configured to have pull-up or pull-down by programming the pull-up/pull-down
                      register. Setting a bit to logic 1 will select a 100 k pull-up resistor for that I/O pin. Setting
                      a bit to logic 0 will select a 100 k pull-down resistor for that I/O pin. If the bus-hold
                      feature is enabled, writing to this register will have no effect on pull-up/pull-down
                      selection.

                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9574 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA9574 registers and state machine will initialize to their default states. The
                       power-on reset typically completes the reset and enables the part by the time the power
                       supply is above VPOR. However, when it is required to reset the part by lowering the power
                       supply, it is necessary to lower it below 0.2 V.
                   7.7 RESET input
                       A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The
                       PCA9574 registers and I2C-bus state machine will be held in their default state until the
                       RESET input is once again HIGH.
                   7.8 Software reset
                       The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up
                       state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it
                       implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the bus.
                       The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
                         1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                         2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write)
                            is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                         3. The PCA9574 device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the General Call address
                            ‘0000 0000’ (00h) only. If the R/W bit is set to logic 1 (read), no acknowledge is
                            returned to the I2C-bus master.
                         4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
                            1 byte. The value of the byte must be equal to 06h.The PCA9574 acknowledges this
                            value only. If the byte is not equal to 06h, the PCA9574 does not acknowledge it. If
                            more than 1 byte of data is sent, the PCA9574 does not acknowledge anymore.

                                                            8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, level translating, low voltage GPIO
                         5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a
                            STOP command to end the Software Reset sequence: the PCA9574 then resets to
                            the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again within the
                            specified bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no reset is
                            performed. The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9574
                            (at any time) as a ‘Software Reset Abort’. The PCA9574 does not initiate a software
                            reset.
                   7.9 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The open-drain active LOW interrupt is activated when one of the port pins changes state
                       and the port pin is configured as an input and the interrupt on it is not masked. The
                       interrupt is deactivated when the port pin input returns to its previous state or the Input
                       Port register is read. It is highly recommended to program the MSK register, and the CFG
                       registers during the initialization sequence after power-up, since any change to them
                       during Normal mode operation may cause undesirable interrupt events to happen.
                       Remark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input port register. Only a read of
                       the Input port register that contains the bit(s) image of the input(s) that generated the
                       interrupt clears the interrupt condition.
                7.10 Standby
                       The PCA9574 goes into standby when the I2C-bus is idle. Standby supply current is lower
                       than 1.0 A (typical).

8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 7).
                                              SDA
                                              SCL
                                                                               data line                change
                                                                                 stable;                 of data
                                                                               data valid               allowed            mba607

                8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 8).

                   8.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 9).

  Fig 9.   System configuration
                   8.3 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                         acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                         whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                         LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
                         time must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

                                Data is transmitted to the PCA9574 registers using ‘Write Byte’ transfers (see Figure 11

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 23) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is

                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
