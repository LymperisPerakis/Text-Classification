                 Rev. 6 — 7 November 2017                                            Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9535 and PCA9535C are 24-pin CMOS devices that provide 16 bits of General
              Purpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was
              developed to enhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. The
              improvements include higher drive capability, 5 V I/O tolerance, lower supply current,
              individual I/O configuration, and smaller packaging. I/O expanders provide a simple
              solution when additional I/O is needed for ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons,
              LEDs, fans, etc.
              The PCA9535 and PCA9535C consist of two 8-bit Configuration (Input or Output
              selection), Input, Output and Polarity Inversion (active HIGH or active LOW operation)
              registers. The system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to
              the I/O configuration bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding
              Input or Output register. The polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity
              Inversion register. All registers can be read by the system master. Although pin-to-pin and
              I2C-bus address compatible with the PCF8575, software changes are required due to the
              enhancements and are discussed in Application Note AN469.
              The PCA9535 is identical to the PCA9555 except for the removal of the internal I/O
              pull-up resistor which greatly reduces power consumption when the I/Os are held LOW.
              The PCA9535C is identical to the PCA9535 except that all the I/O pins are
              high-impedance open-drain outputs.
              The PCA9535 and PCA9535C open-drain interrupt output is activated when any input
              state differs from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the
              system master that an input state has changed. The power-on reset sets the registers to
              their default values and initializes the device state machine.
              Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) vary the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
              devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The fixed I2C-bus address of the PCA9535
              and PCA9535C are the same as the PCA9555 allowing up to eight of these devices in any
              combination to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       This register is an output-only port. It reflects the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined
                       as outputs by Registers 6 and 7. Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined
                       as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that is in the flip-flop controlling
                       the output selection, not the actual pin value.

                 6.2.5 Registers 6 and 7: Configuration registers
                       This register configures the directions of the I/O pins. If a bit in this register is set (written
                       with ‘1’), the corresponding port pin is enabled as an input with high-impedance output
                       driver. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with ‘0’), the corresponding port pin is
                       enabled as an output. At reset, the device's ports are inputs.

                   6.3 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9535/PCA9535C
                       in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is
                       released and the PCA9535/PCA9535C registers and SMBus state machine will initialize
                       to their default states. Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                       For a power reset cycle, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V and then restored to the
                       operating voltage.
                   6.4 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input on PCA9535, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a
                       high impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       In the case of PCA9535C, FET Q1 has been removed and the open-drain FET Q2 will
                       function the same as PCA9535.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, then on PCA9535 either Q1 or Q2 is on, depending
                       on the state of the Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is
                       applied to an I/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance path that exists
                       between the pin and either VDD or VSS.

                               (1) PCA9535C I/Os are open-drain only. The portion of the PCA9535 schematic marked inside the
                                      dotted line box is not in PCA9535C.

                 6.5.1 Writing to the port registers
                       Data is transmitted to the PCA9535/PCA9535C by sending the device address and
                       setting the least significant bit to a logic 0 (see Figure 6 “PCA9535; PCA9535C device
                       address”). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will
                       receive the data following the command byte.
                       The eight registers within the PCA9535/PCA9535C are configured to operate as four
                       register pairs. The four pairs are Input Ports, Output Ports, Polarity Inversion Ports, and
                       Configuration Ports. After sending data to one register, the next data byte will be sent to
                       the other register in the pair (see Figure 8 and Figure 9). For example, if the first byte is
                       sent to Output Port 1 (register 3), then the next byte will be stored in Output Port 0
                       (register 2). There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write
                       transmission. In this way, each 8-bit register may be updated independently of the other
                       registers.

                     6.5.2 Reading the port registers
                                  In order to read data from the PCA9535/PCA9535C, the bus master must first send the
                                  PCA9535/PCA9535C address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 6
                                  “PCA9535; PCA9535C device address”). The command byte is sent after the address and
                                  determines which register will be accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent
                                  again, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register
                                  defined by the command byte will then be sent by the PCA9535/PCA9535C (see
                                  Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12). Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of
                                  the acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read but
                                  the data will now reflect the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if you
                                  read Input Port 1, then the next byte read would be Input Port 0. There is no limitation on
                                  the number of data bytes received in one read transmission but the final byte received, the
                                  bus master must not acknowledge the data.

                                                              16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, low power I/O port with interrupt
                 6.5.3 Interrupt output
                       The open-drain interrupt output is activated when one of the port pins change state and
                       the pin is configured as an input. The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to its
                       previous state or the Input Port register is read (see Figure 11). A pin configured as an
                       output cannot cause an interrupt. Since each 8-bit port is read independently, the interrupt
                       caused by Port 0 will not be cleared by a read of Port 1 or the other way around.
                       Remark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register.
7. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   7.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 13).

                                                                                 stable;                 of data

                 7.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 14).

                    7.2 System configuration
                          A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                          device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                          the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 15).

                    7.3 Acknowledge
                          The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                          transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                          acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                          whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                          A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                          each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                          that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                          pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                          LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
                          time must be taken into account.
                          A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                          acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                          transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                          condition.

                                                              16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, low power I/O port with interrupt
                   8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                       When the PCA9535 I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD
                       through a resistor as shown in Figure 17. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is
                       off the I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI
                       becomes lower than VDD.
                       Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                       should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                       Figure 18 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 19 shows VDD less
                       than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                       at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.
                       This concern does not occur in the case of PCA9535C because the I/O pins are
                       open-drain.
                                                                                                                       3.3 V           5V

14. Handling information
                      Inputs and outputs are protected against electrostatic discharge in normal handling.
                      However, to be completely safe you must take normal precautions appropriate to handling
                      integrated circuits.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                      This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                      of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                      soldering description”.
                 15.1 Introduction to soldering
                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                 15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                        • Through-hole components
                        • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                      Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                      packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                      leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                      due to an increased probability of bridging.
                      The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                      component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                      packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                      Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                        • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                        • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                        • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                        • Package placement
                        • Inspection and repair
                        • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                        • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                           transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                           exposed to the wave
                        • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                 15.4 Reflow soldering
                      Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                        • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                           higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 29) than a SnPb process, thus
                           reducing the process window
                        • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                           window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                        • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                           heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                           temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                           characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                           packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                           depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                           Table 16 and 17

                      Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                      times.
                      Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                      soldering, see Figure 29.
