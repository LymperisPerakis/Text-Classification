                  40-bit I2C-bus I/O port with RESET, OE and INT
                  Rev. 4 — 3 August 2010                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9505/PCA9506 provide 40-bit parallel input/output (I/O) port expansion for
              I2C-bus applications organized in 5 banks of 8 I/Os. At 5 V supply voltage, the outputs are
              capable of sourcing 10 mA and sinking 15 mA with a total package load of 600 mA to
              allow direct driving of 40 LEDs. Any of the 40 I/O ports can be configured as an input or
              output. Output ports are totem-pole and their logic state changes at the Acknowledge
              (bank change). The PCA9505 is identical to the PCA9506 except that it includes 100 kΩ
              internal pull-up resistors on all the I/Os. The PCA9506 does not include the internal
              pull-ups on the I/Os to reduce power consumption when used as outputs or when the
              input is driven by a push-pull driver.
              The device can be configured to have each input port to be masked in order to prevent it
              from generating interrupts when its state changes and to have the I/O data logic state to
              be inverted when read by the system master.
              An open-drain interrupt (INT) output pin allows monitoring of the input pins and is asserted
              each time a change occurs in one or several input ports (unless masked).
              The Output Enable (OE) pin 3-states any I/O selected as an output and can be used as an
              input signal to blink or dim LEDs (PWM with frequency > 80 Hz and change duty cycle).
              The internal Power-On Reset (POR) or hardware reset (RESET) pin initializes the 40 I/Os
              as inputs. Three address select pins configure one of 8 slave addresses.
              The PCA9506 is available in 56-pin TSSOP and HVQFN packages, while the PCA9505 is
              available only in a TSSOP package. They are both specified over the −40 °C to +85 °C
              industrial temperature range.

                            must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and
                            board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding
                            thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be
                            incorporated in the printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.
7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9505/06” and Figure 2 “Simplified schematic of
                       IO0_0 to IO4_7”.
                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                       accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address of the
                       PCA9505/06 is shown in Figure 5. Slave address pins A2, A1, and A0 choose 1 of 8 slave
                       addresses and need to be connected to VDD (1) or VSS (0). To conserve power, no internal
                       pull-up resistors are incorporated on A2, A1, and A0.
                                                                                         slave address
                                                                           0     1        0       0       A2     A1    A0 R/W

                                                                                                                       002aab494
                         Fig 5.    PCA9505/06 address
                       The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a
                       read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.
                   7.2 Command register
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address + R/W bit, the bus
                       master will send a byte to the PCA9505/06, which will be stored in the Command register.

                   The lowest 6 bits are used as a pointer to determine which register will be accessed. The
                   registers are:
                     •  IP: Input Port registers (5 registers)
                     •  OP: Output Port registers (5 registers)
                     •  PI: Polarity Inversion registers (5 registers)
                     •  IOC: I/O Configuration registers (5 registers)
                     •  MSK: Mask interrupt registers (5 registers)
                   If the Auto-Increment flag is set (AI = 1), the 3 least significant bits are automatically
                   incremented after a read or write. This allows the user to program and/or read the
                   5 register banks sequentially.
                   If more than 5 bytes of data are written and AI = 1, previous data in the selected registers
                   will be overwritten. Reserved registers are skipped and not accessed (refer to Table 3).
                   If the Auto-Increment flag is cleared (AI = 0), the 3 least significant bits are not
                   incremented after data is read or written. During a read operation, the same register bank
                   is read each time. During a write operation, data is written to the same register bank each
                   time.
                   Only a Command register code with the 5 least significant bits equal to the 25 allowable
                   values as defined in Table 3 are valid. Reserved or undefined command codes must not
                   be accessed for proper device functionality. At power-up, this register defaults to 0x80,
                   with the AI bit set to logic 1, and the lowest 7 bits set to logic 0.
                   During a write operation, the PCA9505/06 will acknowledge a byte sent to OPx, PIx, and
                   IOCx and MSKx registers, but will not acknowledge a byte sent to the IPx registers since
                   these are read-only registers.

                           These registers are read-only. They reflect the incoming logic levels of the port pins
                           regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the I/O Configuration
                           register. If the corresponding Px[y] bit in the PI registers is set to logic 0, or the inverted
                           incoming logic levels if the corresponding Px[y] bit in the PI register is set to logic 1. Writes
                           to these registers have no effect.

                           The Polarity Inversion register can invert the logic states of the port pins. The polarity of
                           the corresponding bit is inverted when Px[y] bit in the PI register is set to logic 1. The
                           polarity of the corresponding bit is not inverted when Px[y] bits in the PI register is set to
                           logic 0.

                           inputs. In turn, reads from these registers reflect the values that are in the flip-flops
                           controlling the output selection, not the actual pin values.
                             Ox[y] = 0: IOx_y = 0 if IOx_y defined as output (Cx[y] in IOC register = 0).

                   7.4 Power-on reset
                         When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9505/06
                         in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is
                         released and the PCA9505/06 registers and I2C-bus state machine will initialize to their
                         default states. Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                   7.5 RESET input
                         A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The
                         PCA9505/06 registers and I2C-bus state machine will be held in their default states until
                         the RESET input is once again HIGH.

                                                                                          40-bit I2C-bus I/O port with RESET, OE and INT
                   7.6 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The open-drain active LOW interrupt is activated when one of the port pins changes state
                       and the port pin is configured as an input and the interrupt on it is not masked. The
                       interrupt is deactivated when the port pin input returns to its previous state or the Input
                       Port register is read.
                       Remark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register.
                       Only a read of the Input Port register that contains the bit(s) image of the input(s) that
                       generated the interrupt clears the interrupt condition.
                       If more than one input register changed state before a read of the Input Port register is
                       initiated, the interrupt is cleared when all the input registers containing all the inputs that
                       changed are read.
                       Example: If IO0_5, IO2_3, and IO3_7 change state at the same time, the interrupt is
                       cleared only when INREG0, INREG2, and INREG3 are read.
                   7.7 Output enable input (OE)
                       The active LOW output enable pin allows to enable or disable all the I/Os at the same
                       time. When a LOW level is applied to the OE pin, all the I/Os configured as outputs are
                       enabled and the logic value programmed in their respective OP registers is applied to the
                       pins. When a HIGH level is applied to the OE pin, all the I/Os configured as outputs are
                       3-stated.
                       For applications requiring LED blinking with brightness control, this pin can be used to
                       control the brightness by applying a high frequency PWM signal on the OE pin. LEDs can
                       be blinked using the Output Port registers and can be dimmed using the PWM signal on
                       the OE pin thus controlling the brightness by adjusting the duty cycle.
                   7.8 Live insertion
                       The PCA9505/06 are fully specified for live insertion applications using IOFF, power-up
                       3-states, robust state machine, and 50 ns noise filter. The IOFF circuitry disables the
                       outputs, preventing damaging current backflow through the device when it is powered
                       down. The power-up 3-state’s circuitry places the outputs in the high-impedance state
                       during power-up and power-down, which prevents driver conflict and bus contention.
                       The robust state machine does not respond until it sees a valid START condition and the
                       50 ns noise filter will filter out any insertion glitches. The PCA9505/06 will not cause
                       corruption of active data on the bus, nor will the device be damaged or cause damage to
                       devices already on the bus when similar featured devices are being used.
                   7.9 Standby
                       The PCA9505/06 goes into standby when the I2C-bus is idle. Standby supply current is
                       lower than 1 μA (typical).

8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 7).

                                              SCL
                                                                               data line                change
                                                                                 stable;                 of data
                                                                               data valid               allowed         mba607

                8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 8).

                   8.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master' and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves' (see Figure 9).

                    8.3 Acknowledge
                          The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                          transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                          acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                          whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                          A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                          each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                          that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                          pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                          LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold
                          times must be taken into account.
                          A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                          acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                          transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                          condition.

[1]    Minimum SCL clock frequency is limited by the bus time-out feature, which resets the serial bus interface if either SDA or SCL is held
       LOW for a minimum of 25 ms. Disable bus time-out feature for DC operation.
[2]    tVD;ACK = time for Acknowledgement signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
[3]    tVD;DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
[4]    A master device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to the VIL of the SCL signal) in order to
       bridge the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
[5]    The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at
       250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without
       exceeding the maximum specified tf.
[6]    Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
[7]    Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 22) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 12 and 13

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 22.
