(1) Assuming no load connected to outputs and inputs fixed to VCC1,2 or GND.
(2) Can be increased in RegAdvanced register. Please refer to §2.2.1 for more details.
(3) All values referred to VIHMR min and VILM max levels.
(4) A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to VIHMR min) to bridge the undefined region of
the falling edge of SCL.
(5) The maximum tHD;DAT has only to be met if the device does not stretch the LOW period (tLOW ) of the SCL signal.
(6) A Fast-mode I2C-bus device can be used in a Standard-mode I2C-bus system, but the requirement tSU;DAT ≥ 250 ns must then be met.
This will automatically be the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal.
If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal, it must output the next data bit to the SDA line tr max+ tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250
= 1250 ns (according to the Standard-mode I2C-bus specification) before the SCL line is released.
(7) Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with Hs-mode devices, faster fall-times are allowed.

4.4    Reset (NRESET)
The SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503 generate their own power on reset signal after a power supply is connected
to the VDDM pin. The reset signal is made available for the user at the pin NRESET. The rising edge of the
NRESET indicates that the startup sequence of the SX1501, SX1502 or SX1503 has finished. NRESET must be
connected to VDDM (or greater) either directly, or via a resistor.

        by the SX1501, SX1502 or SX1503.
     2. After tRESET, NRESET is released (high-impedance) by the SX1501, SX1502 or SX1503 to allow it to be
        pulled high by an external resistor.
     3. In operation, the SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503 may be reset at anytime by an external device driving
        NRESET low during tPULSE. Chip can be accessed normally again after NRESET rising edge.

     4. During a brown-out event, if VDDM drops above VDROPH a reset will not occur.
     5. During a brown-out event, if VDDM drops between VDROPH and VDROPL a reset may occur.
     6. During a brown-out event, if VDDM drops below VDROPL a reset will occur next time VPOR is crossed.
Please note that a brown-out event is defined as a transient event on VDDM. If VDDM is attached to a battery,
then the gradual decay of the battery voltage will not be interpreted as a brown-out event.
Please also note that a sharp rise in VDDM (> 1V/us) may induce a circuit reset.

The SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503 are read-write slave-mode I C devices and comply with the Philips I C
standard Version 2.1 dated January, 2000. The SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503 have respectively 12, 16, and 31

user-accessible internal 8-bit registers. The I C interface has been designed for program flexibility, in that once
the slave address has been sent to the SX1501, SX1502 or SX1503 enabling it to be a slave
transmitter/receiver, any register can be written or read independently of each other. While there is no auto
                                                                       2
increment/decrement capability in the SX1501 and SX1502 I C logic, a tight software loop can be designed to
access the next register independent of which register you begin accessing. SX1503 implements auto increment
capability. The start and stop commands frame the data-packet and the repeat start condition is allowed if
necessary.
Seven bit addressing is used and ten bit addressing is not allowed. Any general call address will be ignored by
the SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503. The SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503 are not CBUS compatible and can
operate in standard mode (100kbit/s) or fast mode (400kbit/s).
4.5.1 WRITE
                                    2
The simplest format for an I C write is given below. After the start condition [S], the slave address is sent,
                                                         2
followed by an eighth bit indicating a write. The I C then acknowledges that it is being addressed, and the master
responds with an 8 bit data byte consisting of the register address. The slave acknowledges and the master
sends the appropriate 8 bit data byte. Once again the slave acknowledges and the master terminates the
transfer with the stop condition [P].

Please note that SX1503 implements register address auto-increment i.e. after the Data ACK from Slave the
master can write further bytes and the interface will handle the register address increment automatically. Finally
the master terminates the transfer normally the stop condition [P].

After the start condition [S], the slave address is sent, followed by an eighth bit indicating a write. The I C then
acknowledges that it is being addressed, and the master responds with an 8 bit data byte consisting of the
register address. The slave acknowledges and the master sends the repeated start condition [Sr]. Once again,
the slave address is sent, followed by an eighth bit indicating a read. The slave responds with an acknowledge
and the previously addressed 8 bit data byte; the master then sends a non-acknowledge (NACK). Finally, the
master terminates the transfer with the stop condition [P].

Please note that SX1503 implements register address auto-increment i.e. after the Data byte from Slave the
master can acknowledge (ACK) to indicate that it wants to read the next byte and the interface will handle the
register address increment automatically. Finally the master terminates the transfer normally with a NACK
followed by the stop condition [P].
4.5.3 READ - STOP separated format (SX1501 and SX1502 only)
When operating SX1501 or SX1502, stop-separated reads can also be used. This format allows a master to set
up the register address pointer for a read and return to that slave at a later time to read the data. In this format
the slave address followed by a write command are sent after a start [S] condition. The slave then acknowledges
it is being addressed, and the master responds with the 8-bit register address. The master sends a Stop or
Restart condition and may then address another slave. After performing other tasks, the master can send a start
or restart condition to the slave with a read command. The slave acknowledges this request and returns the data
from the register location that had previously been set up.

4.6      Interrupt (NINT)
At start-up, the transition detection logic is reset, and NINT is released to a high-impedance state. The interrupt
mask register is set to 0xFF, disabling the interrupt output for transitions on all I/O ports. The transition flags are
cleared to indicate no data changes.
An interrupt NINT can be generated on any programmed combination of I/Os rising and/or falling edges through
the RegInterruptMask and RegSense registers.
If needed, the I/Os which triggered the interrupt can then be identified by reading RegInterruptSource register.
When NINT is low (i.e. interrupt occurred), it can be reset back high (i.e. cleared) by writing 0xFF in
RegInterruptSource (this will also clear corresponding bits in RegEventStatus register).
SX1503 also allows the interrupt to be cleared automatically when reading RegData register (Cf. RegAdvanced)
Example: We want to detect rising edge of I/O[1] on SX1502 (NINT will go low).
     1. We enable interrupt on I/O[1] in RegInterruptMask
      RegInterruptMask =“XXXXXX0X”
     2. We set edge sense for I/O[1] in RegSense
      RegSenseLow =“XXXX01XX”
4.7      Programmable Logic Functions (PLD)
The SX1501, SX1502 and SX1503 offer a unique fully programmable logic functions like a PLD to give more
flexibility and reduce external logic gates used for standard applications.
Since the whole truth table is fully programmable, the SX1501, SX1502, and SX1503 can implement
combinatory functions ranging from the basic AND/OR gates to the most complicated ones with up to four 3-to1
PLDs or two 3-to-2 PLDs which can also be externally cascaded if needed.
In all cases, any IO not configured for PLD functionality retains its GPIO functionality while I/Os used by the PLD
have their direction automatically set accordingly.
Please note that while RegDir corresponding bits are ignored for PLD operation they may still be set to input to
access unused PLD inputs as normal GPI (PLD truth table can define some inputs to have no effect on PLD
output) and/or generate interrupt based on any of the PLD inputs or outputs bits.
4.7.1 SX1501
The SX1501 I/Os can be configured to provide any combinational 2-to-1 logic function using I/O[0-2] whilst
retaining GPIO capability on I/O[3] OR provide a combinational 3-to-1 decode function using all 4 I/O ports.

4.7.4 Tutorial
The generic method described in this paragraph can be applied to any of the SX1501, SX1502 or SX1503.
Example: We want to implement an AND gate between I/O[0] and IO[1] on SX1502
    1. Identify in the tables above the RegPLDMode setting to be programmed.
       What we need corresponds to the second line of the SX1502 PLD Table => RegPLDMode = “xx00xx01”
    2. Fill corresponding RegPLDTableX with the wanted truth table.
       As mentioned in RegPLDMode description, using PLD 2-to-1 mode on I/0[0-2] implies to fill the truth
       table located in RegPLDTable0(3:0)
                          I/O[1]  I/O[0]   I/O[2]
                             0       0        0
                             0       1        0      => RegPLDTable0 = “xxxx1000”

                                   0 : No event has occured on this IO
                                   1 : An event has occured on this IO (an edge as configured in relevant RegSense
0x11  RegEventStatusA  0x00    7:0 register occured).
                                   Writing '1' clears the bit in RegEventStatusA and in RegInterruptSourceA if relevant.
                                   If the edge sensitivity of the IO is changed, the bit(s) will be cleared automatically

6.2   Typical LED Operation
Typical LED operation is described below. The LED is usually connected to a high voltage (VBAT) to take
advantage of the high sink current of the I/O and to accommodate high LED threshold voltages (VLED).
                                                                  VCCx      VBAT

Important:
     VCCx must exceed VBAT-VLED (VCCx = VBAT is recommended) else the LED will never be
        completely OFF
     R must be calculated for IOL not to exceed its max spec (Cf. Table 5)

6.2.2 LED Intensity Control
When the max IOL spec is not enough it is possible to drive simultaneously multiple I/Os connected together
hence increasing the total sink capability.
Example: on an SX1502, by driving an LED with both IO[2] and IO[3] one can sink up to 24+24 =48mA.
Driving an LED with multiple I/Os can also be used to implement more intensity steps for the LED.
Example: with two I/Os capable of sinking each 24mA the LED can sink a total of 0mA (no I/O set to “0”), 24mA
(one I/O set to “0”) or 48mA (both I/Os set to “0”) => 3 LED intensity steps ( 4 steps with 3 I/Os, 5 steps with 4
I/Os, etc)
6.3    Keypad Implementation
SX1501, SX1502, and SX1503 can be used to implement keypad applications up to 8x8 matrix (i.e. 64 keys)
Example: We want to implement a 4x4matrix keypad on SX1502

                                  IO[7-0] as inputs with internal pull-ups enabled
                                  Figure 14 – 4x4 keypad connection to SX1502
    1. Set all I/Os as inputs with internal pull-up (RegDir = 0xFF, RegPullUp = 0xFF)
    2. Set NINT to be triggered on any IO’s falling edge (RegInterruptMask = 0x00, RegSenseHigh = 0xAA,
         RegSenseLow = 0xAA)
    3. When NINT goes low read RegData (or RegInterruptSource) to know the X:Y coordinates of the button
         which has been pressed.
    4. Clear NINT (RegInterruptSource = 0xFF, can be done automatically on SX1503 depending on
         RegAdvanced setting)
    5. Restart from point 3
6.4    Level Shifter Implementation Hints
Because of their I/O banks with independent supply voltages between 1.2V and 5.5V, the SX1502 and SX1503
can be easily used to perform level shifting of signals from one I/O bank to an other (uC reads I/O from one I/O
bank and sends it back to the other I/O bank)
This can save significant BOM cost in a final application where only a few slow signals need to be level-shifted.
