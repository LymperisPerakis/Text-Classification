                 Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and reset
                 Rev. 1 — 28 September 2012                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9538A is a low-voltage 8-bit General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) expander
             with interrupt and reset for I2C-bus/SMBus applications. NXP I/O expanders provide a
             simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while keeping interconnections to a
             minimum, for example, in ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fan control,
             etc.
             In addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, the wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V
             allows the PCA9538A to interface with next-generation microprocessors and
             microcontrollers where supply levels are dropping down to conserve power.
             The PCA9538A contains the PCA9538A register set of four 8-bit Configuration, Input,
             Output, and Polarity Inversion registers.
             The PCA9538A is a pin-to-pin replacement for the PCA9538 and other industry-standard
             devices. A more fully functional device, the PCAL9538A, is available with Agile I/O
             features. See the respective data sheet for more details.
             The PCA9538A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
             from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system
             master that an input state has changed.
             INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
             signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
             on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCA9538A can
             remain a simple slave device.
             The device outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while consuming
             low device current.
             The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
             machine. In the PCA9538A, the RESET pin causes the same reset/default I/O input
             configuration to occur without de-powering the device, holding the registers and I2C-bus
             state machine in their default state until the RESET input is once again HIGH. This input
             requires a pull-up to VDD.
             Two hardware pins (A0, A1) select the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to four devices
             to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                         [2]   HVQFN16 package die supply ground is connected to both the VSS pin and the exposed center pad. The
                               VSS pin must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical,
                               and board-level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding
                               thermal pad on the board, and for proper heat conduction through the board thermal vias need to be
                               incorporated in the printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.

                           A1 and A0 are the hardware address package pins and are held to either HIGH (logic 1)
                           or LOW (logic 0) to assign one of the four possible slave addresses. The last bit of the
                           slave address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH
                           (logic 1) selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.
                    6.2 Pointer register and command byte
                           Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                           command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCA9538A. Two bits of this
                           data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers (Input, Output,
                           Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. Bit 6 in conjunction with the lower
                           three bits of the Command byte are used to point to the extended features of the device
                           (Agile I/O). This register is write only.

                6.4.1 Input port register (00h)
                       The Input port register (register 0) reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                       of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. The
                       Input port register is read only; writes to this register have no effect. The default value ‘X’
                       is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port register read operation is
                       performed as described in Section 7.2 “Read commands”.

                6.4.2 Output port register (01h)
                       The Output port register (register 1) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as
                       outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no effect on pins
                       defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that was written to this
                       register, not the actual pin value.

                       The Polarity inversion register (register 2) allows polarity inversion of pins defined as
                       inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in this register is set (written with ‘1’), the
                       corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a
                       ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s original polarity is retained.

                       The Configuration register (register 3) configures the direction of the I/O pins. If a bit in this
                       register is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a high-impedance input. If a
                       bit in this register is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an output.

                   6.5 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                                                                  Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and reset
                   6.6 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9538A
                       in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset condition is
                       released and the PCA9538A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine initialize to their
                       default states. After that, VDD must be lowered to below VPORF and back up to the
                       operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 8.3 “Power-on reset requirements”.
                   6.7 Reset input (RESET)
                       The RESET input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the VDD at its
                       operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a
                       minimum of tw(rst). The PCA9538A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are
                       changed to their default state once RESET is LOW (0). When RESET is HIGH (1), the I/O
                       levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input requires a
                       pull-up resistor to VDD if no active connection is used.
                   6.8 Interrupt output (INT)
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when
                       data on the port is changed to the original setting or when data is read from the port that
                       generated the interrupt (see Figure 10). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the
                       acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL
                       signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very
                       short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after
                       resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires a pull-up resistor to VDD. INT
                       should be connected to the voltage source of the device that requires the interrupt
                       information. When using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt
                       is reset only when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs
                       in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the
                       rising edge of the SCL signal.

                                                                                 Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and reset
7. Bus transactions
                                The PCA9538A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                                PCA9538A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                                lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                                connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                                of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                      7.1 Write commands
                                Data is transmitted to the PCA9538A by sending the device address and setting the Least
                                Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 for device address). The command byte is
                                sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows the
                                command byte. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write
                                transmission.

                         7.2 Read commands
                                    To read data from the PCA9538A, the bus master must first send the PCA9538A address
                                    with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 for device address). The
                                    command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is to be accessed.
                                    After a restart the device address is sent again, but this time the LSB is set to a logic 1.
                                    Data from the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the PCA9538A (see
                                    Figure 9 and Figure 10).
                                    Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no
                                    limit on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte
                                    received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

               Transfer of data can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge
               phase is valid (output mode). It is assumed that the command byte has previously been programmed with 00h (read Input port
               register).
               This figure eliminates the command byte transfer, a restart, and slave address call between the initial slave address call and

         (1) Resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor is not
               needed. Outputs (in the P port) do not need pull-up resistors.

                   8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                       When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                       resistor as shown in Figure 11. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the
                       I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes
                       lower than VDD.
                       Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                       should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                       Figure 12 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 13 shows VDD less
                       than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                       at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.
                                                                                                                             3.3 V     5V

                       The PCA9538A device SCR group reference diode can go up to 10 V before latch back to
                       8 V. The ESD gate oxide will protect the device, but not if used continually. Therefore, to
                       achieve 12 V tolerant I/Os, the external protection circuitry (diode) must be used as shown
                       in Figure 14.

                        8.3 Power-on reset requirements
                                In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCA9538A can be reset to its default conditions
                                by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a
                                power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is
                                powered on for the first time in an application.
                                The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

                   Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this
                   device. The glitch width (tw(gl)VDD) and glitch height (VDD(gl)) are dependent on each
                   other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and device impedance are factors that
                   affect power-on reset performance. Figure 17 and Table 10 provide more information on
                   how to measure these specifications.

                   VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                   is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                   their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                   0 V. Figure 18 and Table 10 provide more details on this specification.

                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 32) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 32.
