Please note: As part of the Fairchild Semiconductor integration, some of the Fairchild orderable part numbers
will need to change in order to meet ON Semiconductor’s system requirements. Since the ON Semiconductor
product management systems do not have the ability to manage part nomenclature that utilizes an underscore
(_), the underscore (_) in the Fairchild part numbers will be changed to a dash (-). This document may contain
device numbers with an underscore (_). Please check the ON Semiconductor website to verify the updated
device numbers. The most current and up-to-date ordering information can be found at www.onsemi.com. Please

     Absolute Maximum Ratings
     Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may damage the device. The device may not function or be
     operable above the recommended operating conditions and stressing the parts to these levels is not recommended.
     In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions may affect device reliability.
     The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only.

     Notes:
     4. The FXL6408 can accept clock signals with LOW as low as 1.1 µs, provided that the received SDA signal
         tHD;DAT+ tr/f<=1.1 µs. The FXL6408 features a 0 ns SDA input setup time and, therefore, this parameter is not
         included in the above equation.
     5. A Fast-Mode I2C-Bus® device can be used in a Standard-Mode I2C-Bus system, but the requirement tSU;DAT ≥
         250 ns must be met. This is automatically the case if the device does not stretch the LOW period of the SCL
         signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. It must output the next data bit to the
         SDA line tr_max + tSU;DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the Standard-Mode I2C bus specification) before
         the SCL line is released.
     6. Cb equals the total capacitance of one bus line in pF. If mixed with High-Speed Mode devices, faster fall times
                                          2
         are allowed, according to the I C specification.
     7. The FXL6408 ensures that the SDA signal out must coincide with SCL LOW for worst-case SCL tf maximum
         times of 300 ns. This requirement prevents data loss by preventing SDA out transitions during the undefined
         region of the falling edge of SCL. Consequently, the FXL6408 fulfils the following requirement from the I2C
         specification, note 2 on page 77: “A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA
         signal (referred to the VIHmin of the SCL signal) to bridge the undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.”

     The interrupt output /INT, once asserted, is held LOW
     until the interrupt is serviced by the processor. This
     means that the system uses level-sensitive interrupts.
     Interrupt signaling is asynchronous to the SCL signal.
