The MAX7310 provides 8-bit parallel input/output port                       ♦ 400kHz 2-Wire Interface
expansion for SMBus™-compatible and I2C-compatible
applications. The MAX7310 consists of an input port                         ♦ 2.3V to 5.5V Operation
register, an output port register, a polarity inversion reg-                ♦ Low Standby Current (1.7µA typ)

system master can enable or disable bus timeout by                          ♦ Polarity Inversion
writing to the bus timeout register.                                        ♦ Eight I/O Pins that Default to Inputs on Power-Up
Any of the eight I/O ports may be configured as input or
                                                                            ♦ 5V Tolerant Open-Drain Output on I/O0
output. An active-low reset input sets the eight I/Os as
inputs. Three address select pins configure one of 56                       ♦ 4mm x 4mm, 0.8mm Thin QFN Package

The MAX7310 is available in 16-pin thin QFN, TSSOP,
and QSOP packages and is specified over the -40°C to
+125°C automotive temperature range.

          Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
          operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
          absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Note 1: All parameters are 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: Minimum SCL clock frequency is limited by the MAX7310 bus timeout feature, which resets the serial bus interface if either
        SDA or SCL is held low for a 30ms minimum.
Note 3: A master device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIL of the SCL signal) in
        order to bridge the undefined region of SCL’s falling edge.
Note 4: tF measured between 90% to 10% of V+.
Note 5: Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50ns.

          The MAX7310 operates from a supply voltage of 2.3V to   PROCESS: BiCMOS
          5.5V. Bypass the power supply to GND with a 0.047µF
          capacitor as close to the device as possible. For the
          QFN version, connect the underside exposed pad to
          GND.
