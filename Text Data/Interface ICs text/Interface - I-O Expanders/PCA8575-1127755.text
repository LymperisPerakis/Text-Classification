1. General description
              The PCA8575 provides general purpose remote I/O expansion for most microcontroller
              families via the two-line bidirectional I2C-bus (serial clock (SCL), serial data (SDA)).
              The device consists of a 16-bit quasi-bidirectional port and an I2C-bus interface. The
              PCA8575 has a low current consumption and includes latched outputs with high current
              drive capability for directly driving LEDs.
              The PCA8575 also possesses an interrupt line (INT) which can be connected to the
              interrupt logic of the microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote
              I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without having to
              communicate via the I2C-bus. The internal Power-On Reset (POR) initializes the I/Os as
              inputs.

7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA8575”.
                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                       accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address of the
                       PCA8575 is shown in Figure 9. Slave address pins AD2, AD1, and AD0 choose 1 of
                       8 slave addresses. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on
                       AD2, AD1, and AD0. Address values depending on AD2, AD1, and AD0 can be found in
                       Table 3 “PCA8575 address map”.
                       Remark: The General Call address (0000 0000b) and the Device ID address
                       (1111 100Xb) are reserved and cannot be used as device address. Failure to follow this
                       requirement will cause the PCA8575 not to acknowledge.
                                                                 slave address

                                                                 programmable
                                                                                   002aab636
                         Fig 9. PCA8575 address
                       The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a
                       read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.
                       When AD2, AD1 and AD0 are held to VDD or VSS, the same address as the PCF8575 is
                       applied.

8. I/O programming
                   8.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/O architecture
                       The PCA8575’s 16 ports (see Figure 2) are entirely independent and can be used either
                       as input or output ports. Input data is transferred from the ports to the microcontroller in
                       the Read mode (see Figure 12). Output data is transmitted to the ports in the Write mode
                       (see Figure 11).
                       Every data transmission from the PCA8575 must consist of an even number of bytes, the
                       first byte will be referred to as P07 to P00, and the second byte as P17 to P10. The third
                       will be referred to as P07 to P00, and so on.
                       This quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control
                       signal for data directions. At power-on the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode only a current
                       source (IOH) to VDD is active. An additional strong pull-up to VDD (Itrt(pu)) allows fast rising
                       edges into heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH,
                       and are switched off by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being
                       used as inputs. After power-on, as all the I/Os are set HIGH, all of them can be used as
                       inputs. Any change in setting of the I/Os as either inputs or outputs can be done with the
                       Write mode.
                       Remark: If a HIGH is applied to an I/O which has been written earlier to LOW, a large
                       current (IOL) will flow to VSS.
                   8.2 Writing to the port (Output mode)
                       To write, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device. By setting the last
                       bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 0 the Write mode is entered. The
                       PCA8575 acknowledges and the master sends the first data byte for P07 to P00. After the
                       first data byte is acknowledged by the PCA8575, the second data byte P17 to P10 is sent
                       by the master. Once again, the PCA8575 acknowledges the receipt of the data. Each 8-bit
                       data is presented on the port lines after it has been acknowledged by the PCA8575.
                       The number of data bytes that can be sent successively is not limited. After every two
                       bytes, the previous data is overwritten.
                       The first data byte in every pair refers to Port 0 (P07 to P00), whereas the second data
                       byte in every pair refers to Port 1 (P17 to P10). See Figure 10.

                        8.3 Reading from a port (Input mode)
                                 All ports programmed as input should be set to logic 1. To read, the master
                                 (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device after it receives the interrupt. By setting
                                 the last bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 1 the Read mode is entered.
                                 The data bytes that follow on the SDA are the values on the ports.
                                 If the data on the input port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be
                                 lost.

                                                            Remote 16-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus with interrupt
                   8.4 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA8575 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA8575 registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine will initialize to their default
                       states. Thereafter VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                   8.5 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The PCA8575 provides an open-drain interrupt (INT) which can be fed to a corresponding
                       input of the microcontroller (see Figure 12, Figure 13, and Figure 14). This gives these
                       chips a kind of master function which can initiate an action elsewhere in the system.
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs. After time tv(D) the
                       signal INT is valid.
                       The interrupt disappears when data on the port is changed to the original setting or data is
                       read from or written to the device which has generated the interrupt.
                       In the Write mode, the interrupt may become deactivated (HIGH) on the rising edge of the
                       write to port pulse. On the falling edge of the write to port pulse the interrupt is definitely
                       deactivated (HIGH).
                       The interrupt is reset in the Read mode on the rising edge of the read from port pulse.
                       During the resetting of the interrupt itself, any changes on the I/Os may not generate an
                       interrupt. After the interrupt is reset any change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as
                       an INT.

9. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   9.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 15).

                9.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 16.)

                   9.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 17).

  Fig 17. System configuration
                   9.3 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                         acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                         whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                         LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold
                         times must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

10. Application design-in information
                10.1 Bidirectional I/O expander applications
                     In the 8-bit I/O expander application shown in Figure 19, P00 and P01 are inputs, and P02
                     to P07 are outputs. When used in this configuration, during a write, the input (P00 and
                     P01) must be written as HIGH so the external devices fully control the input ports. The
                     desired HIGH or LOW logic levels may be written to the I/Os used as outputs (P02 to
                     P07). During a read, the logic levels of the external devices driving the input ports (P00
                     and P01) and the previous written logic level to the output ports (P02 to P07) will be read.
                     The GPIO also has an interrupt line (INT) that can be connected to the interrupt logic of
                     the microprocessor. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O informs the
                     microprocessor that there is incoming data or a change of data on its ports without having
                     to communicate via the I2C-bus.
                                                                                                           VDD

                10.2 High current-drive load applications
                     The GPIO has a maximum sinking current of 25 mA per bit. In applications requiring
                     additional drive, two port pins in the same octal may be connected together to sink up to
                     50 mA current. Both bits must then always be turned on or off together. Up to 8 pins (one
                     octal) can be connected together to drive 200 mA.

                                                             Remote 16-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus with interrupt
                10.3 Differences between the PCA8575 and the PCF8575
                     The PCA8575 is a drop in replacement for the PCF8575 and can used without electrical
                     or software modifications, but there is a difference in interrupt output release timing during
                     the read operation.
                     Write operations are identical. At the completion of each 8-bit write sequence the data is
                     stored in its associated 8-bit write register at ACK or NACK. The first byte goes to P0n
                     while the second goes to P1n. Subsequent writes without a STOP wrap around to P0n
                     then P1n again. Any write will update both read registers and clear interrupts.
                     Read operations are identical. Both devices update the byte register with the pin data as
                     each 8-bit read is initiated, the very first read after an address cycle corresponds to ports
                     P0n while the second (even byte) corresponds to P1n and subsequent reads without a
                     STOP wrap around to P0n then P1n again.
                     During read operations, the PCA8575 interrupt output will be cleared in a byte-wise
                     fashion as each byte is read. Reading the first byte will clear any interrupts associated
                     with the P0n pins. This first byte read operation will have no effect on interrupts associated
                     with changes of state on the P1n pins. Interrupts associated with the P1n pins will be
                     cleared when the second byte is read. Reading the second byte has no effect on
                     interrupts associated with the changes of state on the P0x pins. The PCF8575 interrupt
                     output will clear after reading both bytes of data regardless of whether data was changed
                     in the first byte or the second byte or both bytes.

[1]    tVD;ACK = time for Acknowledgement signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
[2]    tVD;DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
[3]    A master device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to the VIL of the SCL signal) in order to
       bridge the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
[4]    The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at
       250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without
       exceeding the maximum specified tf.
[5]    Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
[6]    Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.

15. Handling information
                     Inputs and outputs are protected against electrostatic discharge in normal handling.
                     However, to be completely safe you must take normal precautions appropriate to handling
                     integrated circuits.
16. Soldering
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus PbSn soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 28) than a PbSn process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
