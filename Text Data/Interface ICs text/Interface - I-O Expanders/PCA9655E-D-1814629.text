PCA9655E
Remote 16-bit I/O Expander
for I2C Bus with Interrupt
  The PCA9655E provides 16 bits of General Purpose parallel Input /
Output (GPIO) expansion through the I2C−bus / SMBus.
  The PCA9655E consists of two 8−bit Configuration (Input or
Output selection); Input, Output and Polarity Inversion (active−HIGH                          www.onsemi.com
or active−LOW operation) registers. At power on, all I/Os default to
inputs. Each I/O may be configured as either input or output by writing                                             MARKING
                                                                                                                   DIAGRAMS
to its corresponding I/O configuration bit. The data for each Input or
Output is kept in its corresponding Input or Output register. The
Polarity Inversion register may be used to invert the polarity of the                                               PCA9655E
read register. All registers can be read by the system master.                    SOIC−24                          AWLYYWWG
  The PCA9655E provides an open−drain interrupt output which is                 DW SUFFIX
activated when any input state differs from its corresponding input              CASE 751E
port register state. The interrupt output is used to indicate to the system
master that an input state has changed. The power−on reset sets the
registers to their default values and initializes the device state
machine.

5. The power−on reset circuit resets the I2C bus logic with VDD < VPOR and set all I/Os to logic 1 upon power−up. Thereafter, VDD must be lower
    than 0.2 V to reset the part.
6. Each bit must be limited to a maximum of 25 mA and the total package limited to 400 mA due to internal bussing limits.
7. The value is not tested, but verified on sampling basis.

9. tVD:DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
10. Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
11. A master device must internally provide a hold time of al least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to VIL of the SCL signal) in order to bridge
    the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
12. The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at 250 ns.
    This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without exceeding
    the maximum specified tf.
13. Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.
