In its small 2 mm × 2 mm package, the ADP5587 contains                                                      row and column pins can be reconfigured to act as general-

REGISTERS
The general behavior of registers is as follows:                               •     Interrupt bits are cleared by writing 1 to the flag; writing 0
•    All registers are 0 on reset.                                                   or reading the flag has no effect, with the exception of the
                                                                                     key press, key release, and GPIO interrupt status registers,
•    All registers are read/write unless otherwise specified.
                                                                                     which are cleared on a read.
•    Unused bits are read as 0.

1
  The KE_INT, GPI_INT, and OVR_FLOW_INT bits reflect the status of the interrupts when the interrupt types are enabled even if the processor interrupt is masked.
2
  The K_LCK_INT bit is the interrupt to the processor when the keypad lock sequence is triggered.
3
  If there is a pending key event or GPI interrupt in their respective registers, KE_INT is not cleared until the FIFO is empty, and GPI_INT is not cleared until the cause of
  the interrupt is resolved. The host must write a 1 to the KE_INT and GPI_INT bits to clear them.

1
  The KEC field indicates the key event count of key event registers that have values in the bit (KEC(0000) = 0 events, KEC(0001) = 1 event, KEC(1010) = 10 events). As the
  key events are read and cleared, the state machine automatically reduces the event count in KEC.

  Data in key event registers is provided as a FIFO, where data is sequentially provided on each read, regardless of an event register read. The user can read the
  KEY_EVENTA register only for an event count or can read registers sequentially.
2
  KE[6:0] reflects the value 1 to 80 for key press events and the value 97 to 114 for GPI events. For KE[7:0], 0 = key released event, 1 = key pressed event. For GPIEM_CFG,
  0 reflects a change in the GPI from GPI_INT_LVL = true to GPI_INT_LVL = false; 1 reflects a change in the GPI in which the GPI_INT_LVL condition becomes true.

  When the keypad lock interrupt mask timer is enabled, the user must press two specific keys before a keylock interrupt is generated or keypad events are recorded.
  After the keypad is locked, the first time that the user presses any key, a key event interrupt is generated. No additional interrupt is generated unless both unlock key
  sequences are correct; then a keylock interrupt is generated. When the interrupt mask timer is disabled (0), an interrupt is generated only when the correct full unlock
  sequence is completed.
2
  The Unlock 1 timer and Unlock 2 timer keys can be either a key sequence or GPIEM_CFG sequence. The unlock timer keys can be programmed with any value of the
  keys in the keypad matrix or any GPI values that are part of the key event table. The keylock enable bit (Bit 6, Register 0x03) must be set to lock the keypad.
