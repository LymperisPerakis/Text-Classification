General Description                                            Features
The MAX7328/MAX7329 are 2-wire serial-interfaced               ●● 100kHz, 5.5V-Tolerant, I2C-Compatible Serial
peripherals with eight I/O ports. Any port can be used as          Interface
a logic input or an open-drain output.                         ●● 2.5V to 5.5V Operating Supply Voltage Range
All input ports are continuously monitored for state chang-    ●● Low-Standby-Current Consumption of 10μA (max)
es (transition detection). Transitions are alerted through     ●● I2C Bus-to-Parallel-Port Expander
the open-drain, 5.5V-tolerant INT output.                      ●● Open-Drain Interrupt Output INT
The MAX7328 and MAX7329 versions differ only by their          ●● 8-Bit Remote I/O Port for the I2C Bus
slave ID address ranges. The MAX7328 has a slave ID            ●● Latched Outputs with High-Current-Drive Capability
range of 0100xxx (0x20 to 0x27). The MAX7329 has a                 for Directly Driving LEDs
slave ID range of 0111xxx (0x38 to 0x3F).                      ●● Address by Three Hardware Address Pins for Use of

Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional operation of the device at these
or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.
