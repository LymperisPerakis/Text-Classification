1.6.3        INTERRUPT-ON-CHANGE
             CONTROL REGISTER
The GPINTEN register controls the interrupt-on-
change feature for each pin.
If a bit is set, the corresponding pin is enabled for
interrupt-on-change. The DEFVAL and INTCON
registers must also be configured if any pins are
enabled for interrupt-on-change.

1.6.4        DEFAULT COMPARE REGISTER

The default comparison value is configured in the
DEFVAL register. If enabled (via GPINTEN and INT-
CON) to compare against the DEFVAL register, an
opposite value on the associated pin will cause an
interrupt to occur.

1.6.5         INTERRUPT CONTROL REGISTER
The INTCON register controls how the associated pin
value is compared for the interrupt-on-change feature.
If a bit is set, the corresponding I/O pin is compared
against the associated bit in the DEFVAL register. If a
bit value is clear, the corresponding I/O pin is compared
against the previous value.

The INTF register reflects the interrupt condition on the
port pins of any pin that is enabled for interrupts via the
GPINTEN register. A ‘set’ bit indicates that the
associated pin caused the interrupt.
This register is ‘read only’. Writes to this register will be
ignored.

The INTCAP register captures the GPIO port value at
the time the interrupt occurred. The register is ‘read
only’ and is updated only when an interrupt occurs. The
register will remain unchanged until the interrupt is
cleared via a read of INTCAP or GPIO.

                Note:   In the event the full Microchip part number cannot be marked on one line, it will
                        be carried over to the next line, thus limiting the number of available
                        characters for customer-specific information.

 Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
 •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
 •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
       intended manner and under normal conditions.
 •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
       knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
       Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
 •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
 •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
       mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
 Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
 products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
 allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
