  In applications where high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance
  are present, the maximum ambient temperature may need to be derated.                        ESD CAUTION
  Maximum ambient temperature (TA (MAX)) is dependent on the maximum
  operating junction temperature (TJ (MAXOP) = 125°C), the maximum power
  dissipation of the device (PD (MAX)), and the junction-to-ambient thermal
  resistance of the device/package in the application (θJA), using the following
  equation: TA (MAX) = TJ (MAXOP) − (θJA × PD (MAX)).
Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings
may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress
rating only; functional operation of the device at these or any
other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute
maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.
Absolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in com-
bination. Unless otherwise specified, all other voltages are
referenced to GND.

                                             For key events, use the following settings:
                                             0 = inactive event used as a reset condition.
                                             1 = active event used as a reset condition.
                                             For GPIs and logic outputs configured for FIFO updates, use the following settings:
                                             0 = not applicable; releases not used for reset generation.
