                 Rev. 1 — 11 January 2019                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCAL6534 is a 34-bit general purpose I/O expander that provides remote I/O
             expansion for most microcontroller families via the Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) I2C-bus
             interface. The ultra low-voltage interface allows for direct connection to a microcontroller
             operating down to 0.8 V.
             NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while
             keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in battery-powered mobile
             applications for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, keypad, etc. In addition to providing
             a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of a processor running at one voltage
             level down to 0.8 V to I/O devices operating at a different voltage level 1.65 V to 5.5 V.
             The PCAL6534 has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely
             flexible in mixed power supply systems where communication between incompatible I/O
             voltages is required, allowing seamless communications with next-generation low voltage
             microprocessors and microcontrollers on the interface side (SDA/SCL) and peripherals at
             a higher voltage on the port side.
             There are two supply voltages for PCAL6534: VDD(I2C-bus) and VDD(P). VDD(I2C-bus) provides
             the supply voltage for the interface at the master side (for example, a microcontroller) and
             the VDD(P) provides the supply for core circuits and Port P. The bidirectional voltage level
             translation in the PCAL6534 is provided through VDD(I2C-bus). VDD(I2C-bus) should be
             connected to the VDD of the external SCL/SDA lines. This indicates the VDD level of the
             I2C-bus to the PCAL6534, while the voltage level on Port P of the PCAL6534 is
             determined by the VDD(P).
             The PCAL6534 fully meets the Fm+ I2C-bus specification at speeds to 1 MHz and
             implements Agile I/O, which are additional features specifically designed to enhance the
             I/O. These additional features are: programmable output drive strength, latchable inputs,
             programmable pull-up/pull-down resistors, maskable interrupt, interrupt status register,
             programmable open-drain or push-pull outputs.
             Additional Agile I/O Plus features include I2C software reset and Device ID. Interrupts can
             be specified by level or edge, and can be cleared individually without disturbing the other
             interrupt events. Also, switch debounce hardware is implemented.
             At power-on, the I/Os are configured as inputs. However, the system master can enable
             the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for
             each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of
             the Input Port register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register, saving external
             logic gates. Programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors eliminate the need for discrete
             components.

                                     Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   The power-on reset puts the registers in their default state and initializes the
                   I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The RESET pin causes the same reset/initialization to
                   occur without depowering the part. The system master can also accomplish a reset via an
                   I2C command and initialize all registers to their default state.
                   The PCAL6534 open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
                   from its corresponding Input Port register state. As well, the INT output can be specified to
                   activate on input pin edges. There are a large number of interrupt mask functions
                   available to maximize flexibility.
                   INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
                   signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
                   on its ports without communication via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCAL6534 can remain a
                   simple slave device. The input latch feature holds or latches the input pin state and keeps
                   the logic values that created the interrupt until the master can service the interrupt. This
                   minimizes the host’s interrupt service response for fast moving inputs.
                   The device Port P outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while
                   consuming low device current.
                   One hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C-bus address
                   and allow up to four devices to share the same I2C-bus or SMBus.

                     6.1 Device address
                            Following a START condition, the bus master must send the target slave address followed
                            by a read (R/W = 1) or write (R/W = 0) operation bit. The slave address of the PCAL6534
                            is shown in Figure 3. Slave address pin ADDR chooses one of four slave addresses.
                            Table 4 shows all four slave addresses by connecting the ADDR pin to SCL, SDA, VSS, or
                            VDD.

                       Two other different addresses can be sent to the device.
                          • General Call address: allows to reset the device through the I2C-bus upon reception
                             of the right I2C-bus sequence. See Section 6.3.1 “Software Reset” for more
                             information.
                          • Device ID address: allows to read ID information from the device (manufacturer, part
                             identification, revision). See Section 6.3.2 “Device ID (PCAL6534 ID field)” for more

                6.3.1 Software Reset
                       The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up
                       state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it
                       implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the bus.
                       The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
                         1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                         2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write)
                             is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                         3. The device acknowledges after seeing the General Call address ‘0000 0000’ (00h)
                             only. If the R/W bit is set to 1 (read), no acknowledge is returned to the I2C-bus
                             master.
                         4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
                             1 byte. The value of the byte must be equal to 06h.
                             a. The device acknowledges this value only. If the byte is not equal to 06h, the device
                                 does not acknowledge it.
                             If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the device does not acknowledge any more.

                       5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a
                           STOP command to end the Software Reset sequence: the device then resets to the
                           default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again within the specified
                           bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no reset is performed.
                      The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the device (at any time) as a
                      ‘Software Reset Abort’. The device does not initiate a reset of its registers.
                      The unique sequence that initiates a Software Reset is described in Figure 6.

                6.3.2 Device ID (PCAL6534 ID field)
                      The Device ID field is a 3-byte read-only (24 bits) word giving the following information:
                        • 12 bits with the manufacturer name, unique per manufacturer (for example, NXP).
                        • 9 bits with the part identification, assigned by manufacturer.
                        • 3 bits with the die revision, assigned by manufacturer (for example, Rev X).
                      The Device ID is read-only, hardwired in the device and can be accessed as follows:
                       1. START command
                       2. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address followed by the R/W bit
                           set to 0 (write): ‘1111 1000’.
                       3. The master sends the I2C-bus slave address of the slave device it needs to identify.
                           The LSB is a ‘Don’t care’ value. Only one device must acknowledge this byte (the one
                           that has the I2C-bus slave address).
                       4. The master sends a Re-START command.
                           Remark: A STOP command followed by a START command will reset the slave state
                           machine and the Device ID read cannot be performed. Also, a STOP command or a
                           Re-START command followed by an access to another slave device will reset the
                           slave state machine and the Device ID Read cannot be performed.
                       5. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address followed by the R/W bit
                           set to 1 (read): ‘1111 1001’.
                       6. The Device ID Read can be done, starting with the 12 manufacturer bits (first byte +
                           4 MSB of the second byte), followed by the 9 part identification bits (4 LSBs of the
                           second byte + 5 MSBs of the third byte), and then the 3 die revision bits (3 LSBs of
                           the third byte).
                       7. The master ends the reading sequence by NACKing the last byte, thus resetting the
                           slave device state machine and allowing the master to send the STOP command.

                                 Remark: The reading of the Device ID can be stopped anytime by sending a NACK
                                 command.
                                 If the master continues to ACK the bytes after the third byte, the slave rolls back to the
                                 first byte and keeps sending the Device ID sequence until a NACK has been
                                 detected.
                                 For the PCAL6534, the Device ID is as shown in Figure 7.

          If more than 3 bytes are read, the slave device loops back to the first byte (manufacturer byte) and keeps sending data until the

                   6.4 Pointer register and command byte
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address byte, the bus master
                       sends a command byte, which is write only and stored in the pointer register in the
                       PCAL6534. The lowest 7 bits (B[6:0] in Table 6) are used as a pointer to determine which
                       register is accessed and the highest bit is used as Auto-Increment (AI) as shown in
                       Figure 9. At power-up, hardware or software reset, the pointer register defaults to 00h,
                       with the AI bit set to ‘0’ and the lowest seven bits set to ‘000 0000’.
                       When the Auto-Increment bit is set (AI = 1), the seven low-order bits of the pointer register
                       are automatically incremented after a read or write until a STOP condition is encountered.
                       This allows the user to program the registers sequentially without modifying the pointer
                       register. The contents of these bits will roll over to ‘000 0000’ after the last register
                       (address = 6Fh) is accessed. Unimplemented register addresses (reserved registers) are
                       skipped. If more than 82 bytes are written, the address will loop back to the register which
                       is indicated by the seven low-order bits in the pointer register, and previously-written data
                       will be overwritten. A STOP condition will keep the pointer register value in the last read or
                       write location.
                       When the Auto-Increment bit is cleared (AI = 0), the content of pointer register bits are
                       automatically incremented after a read or write for 5-register group which allows the user
                       to program each of the 5-register group sequentially. If more than 5 bytes of data are read
                       or written when AI is 0, previous data in the selected registers will be overwritten. For
                       example: if input port 3 is read first, the next 2nd byte will be input port 4, and next 3nd
                       byte will be input port 0, there is no limit on the number of data bytes for this read
                       operation. There are two special 9-register groups: output drive strength (30h~38h) and
                       interrupt edge (54h~5Ch) registers will allow user to program each of the 9-register group
                       sequentially. There is one special 3-register group: switch debounce (6Dh ~ 6Fh) registers
                       will allow user to program each of the 3-register group sequentially. Only Output port
                       configuration register location (53h) remains in the same location after a successive read
                       or write.

                   6.5 Register descriptions
                6.5.1 Input port registers (00h, 01h, 02h, 03h, 04h)
                       The Input port registers (registers 00h, 01h, 02h, 03h, 04h) reflect the incoming logic
                       levels of the pins. The Input port registers are read only; writes to these registers have no
                       effect and the transaction will be acknowledged (ACK). The default value ‘X’ is determined
                       by the externally applied logic level. If a pin is configured as an output (registers 05h, 06h,
                       07h, 08h, 09h), the port value is equal to the actual voltage level on that pin. If the output
                       is configured as open-drain (register 53h and registers 68h, 69h, 6Ah, 6Bh, 6Ch), the
                       input port value is forced to 0. An Input port register group read operation is performed as
                       described in Section 7.2.
                       After reading input port registers, all interrupts will be cleared.

                6.5.2 Output port registers (05h, 06h, 07h, 08h, 09h)
                       The Output port registers (registers 05h, 06h, 07h, 08h, 09h) show the outgoing logic
                       levels of the pins defined as outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these
                       registers have no effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from these registers
                       reflect the value that was written to these registers, not the actual pin value. A register
                       group write is described in Section 7.1 and a register group read is described in
                       Section 7.2.

                      The Polarity inversion registers (registers 0Ah, 0Bh, 0Ch, 0Dh, 0Eh) allow polarity
                      inversion of pins defined as inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in these registers
                      is set (written with ‘1’), the corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted in the input register.
                      If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s polarity is
                      retained. A register group write is described in Section 7.1 and a register group read is
                      described in Section 7.2.

                      The Configuration registers (registers 0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h) configure the direction of
                      the I/O pins. If a bit in these registers is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as
                      a high-impedance input. If a bit in these registers is cleared to 0, the corresponding port
                      pin is enabled as an output. A register group write is described in Section 7.1 and a
                      register group read is described in Section 7.2.

                      The Output drive strength registers control the output drive level of the GPIO. Each GPIO
                      can be configured independently to a certain output current level by two register control
                      bits. For example Port 0.7 is controlled by register 31h CC0.7 (bits [7:6]), Port 0.6 is
                      controlled by register 31h CC0.6 (bits [5:4]). The output drive level of the GPIO is
                      programmed 00b = 0.25, 01b = 0.5, 10b = 0.75 or 11b = 1 of the drive capability of
                      the I/O. See Section 8.1 “Output drive strength control” for more details. A register group
                      write operation is described in Section 7.1. A register group read operation is described in
                      Section 7.2.

                                        Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                6.5.6 Input latch registers (3Ah, 3Bh, 3Ch, 3Dh, 3Eh)
                      The input latch registers (registers 3Ah, 3Bh, 3Ch, 3Dh, 3Eh) enable and disable the input
                      latch of the I/O pins. These registers are effective only when the pin is configured as an
                      input port. When an input latch register bit is 0, the corresponding input pin state is not
                      latched. A state change in the corresponding input pin generates an interrupt. A read of
                      the input register clears the interrupt. If the input goes back to its initial logic state before
                      the input port register is read, then the interrupt is cleared.
                      When an input latch register bit is 1, the corresponding input pin state is latched. A change
                      of state of the input generates an interrupt and the input logic value is loaded into the
                      corresponding bit of the input port register (registers 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4). A read of the input
                      port register clears the interrupt. If the input pin returns to its initial logic state before the
                      input port register is read, then the interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of the
                      input port register keeps the logic value that initiated the interrupt. See Figure 19.
                      For example, if the P0_4 input was as logic 0 and the input goes to logic 1 then back to
                      logic 0, the input port 0 register will capture this change and an interrupt is generated (if
                      unmasked). When the read is performed on the input port 0 register, the interrupt is
                      cleared, assuming there were no additional input(s) that have changed, and bit 4 of the
                      input port 0 register will read ‘1’. The next read of the input port register bit 4 register
                      should now read ‘0’.
                      An interrupt remains active when a non-latched input simultaneously switches state with a
                      latched input and then returns to its original state. A read of the input register reflects only
                      the change of state of the latched input and also clears the interrupt. The interrupt is
                      cleared if the input latch register changes from latched to non-latched configuration and
                      I/O pin returns to its original state.
                      If the input pin is changed from latched to non-latched input, a read from the input port
                      register reflects the current port logic level. If the input pin is changed from non-latched to
                      latched input, the read from the input register reflects the latched logic level. A register
                      group write operation is described in Section 7.1. A register group read operation is
                      described in Section 7.2.

                      The pull-up and pull-down enable registers allow the user to enable or disable
                      pull-up/pull-down resistors on the I/O pins. Setting the bit to logic 1 enables the selection
                      of pull-up/pull-down resistors. Setting the bit to logic 0 disconnects the pull-up/pull-down
                      resistors from the I/O pins. Also, the resistors will be disconnected when the outputs are
                      configured as open-drain outputs (see Section 6.5.11 and Section 6.5.15). Use the
                      pull-up/pull-down registers to select either a pull-up or pull-down resistor. A register group
                      write operation is described in Section 7.1. A register group read operation is described in
                      Section 7.2.

                6.5.8 Pull-up/pull-down selection registers (44h, 45h, 46h, 47h, 48h)
                      The I/O port can be configured to have pull-up or pull-down resistor by programming the
                      pull-up/pull-down selection register. Setting a bit to logic 1 selects a 100 k pull-up
                      resistor for that I/O pin. Setting a bit to logic 0 selects a 100 k pull-down resistor for that
                      I/O pin. If the pull-up/down feature is disconnected, writing to this register will have no
                      effect on I/O pin. Typical value is 100 k with minimum of 50 k and maximum of 150 k.

                6.5.9 Interrupt mask registers (49h, 4Ah, 4Bh, 4Ch, 4Dh)
                      Interrupt mask registers are set to logic 1 upon power-on, disabling interrupts during
                      system start-up. Interrupts may be enabled by setting corresponding mask bits to logic 0.
                      If an input changes state and the corresponding bit in the Interrupt mask register is set
                      to 1, the interrupt is masked and the interrupt pin will not be asserted. If the corresponding
                      bit in the Interrupt mask register is set to 0, the interrupt pin will be asserted.
                      When an input changes state and the resulting interrupt is masked (interrupt mask bit
                      is 1), setting the input mask register bit to 0 will cause the interrupt pin to be asserted. If
                      the interrupt mask bit of an input that is currently the source of an interrupt is set to 1, the
                      interrupt pin will be de-asserted. A register group write operation is described in
                      Section 7.1. A register group read operation is described in Section 7.2.

                      The read-only interrupt status registers are used to identify the source of an interrupt.
                      When read, a logic 1 indicates that the corresponding input pin was the source of the
                      interrupt. A logic 0 indicates that the input pin is not the source of an interrupt.
                      When a corresponding bit in the interrupt mask register is set to 1 (masked), the interrupt
                      status bit will return logic 0. A register group read operation is described in Section 7.2.

                      The output port configuration register selects port-wise push-pull or open-drain I/O stage.
                      A logic 0 configures the I/O as push-pull (Q1 and Q2 are active, see Figure 10). A logic 1
                      configures the I/O as open-drain (Q1 is disabled, Q2 is active) and the recommended
                      command sequence is to program this register (53h) before the Configuration register
                      (0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h) sets the port pins as outputs.
                      ODEN0 configures Port 0_x, ODEN1 configures Port 1_x, ODEN2 configures Port 2_x,
                      ODEN3 configures Port 3_x, and ODEN4 configures Port 4_x.
                      Individual pins may be programmed as open-drain or push-pull by programming Individual
                      Pin Output Configuration registers (68h, 69h, 6Ah, 6Bh, 6Ch). See Section 6.5.15 for
                      more information.
                      A register group read or write operation is not allowed on this register. Successive read or
                      write accesses will remain at this register address.

                      The interrupt edge registers determine what action on an input pin will cause an interrupt
                      along with the Interrupt Mask registers (49h, 4Ah, 4Bh, 4Ch and 4Dh). If the Interrupt is
                      enabled (set ‘0’ in the Mask register) and the action at the corresponding pin matches the
                      required activity, the INT output will become active. The default value for each pin is 00b
                      or level triggered, meaning a level change on the pin will cause an interrupt event. A level
                      triggered action means a change in logic state (HIGH-to-LOW or LOW-to-HIGH), since
                      the last read of the Input port (00h, 01h, 02h, 03h or 04h) which can be latched with a
                      corresponding ‘1’ set in the Input Latch register (3Ah, 3Bh, 3Ch, 3Dh, 3Eh). If the Interrupt
                      edge register entry is set to 11b, any edge, positive- or negative-going, causes an
                      interrupt event. If an entry is 01b, only a positive-going edge will cause an interrupt event,
                      while a 10b will require a negative-going edge to cause an interrupt event. These edge

                   interrupt events are latched, regardless of the status of the Input Latch register. These
                   edged interrupts can be cleared in a number of ways: Reading input port registers (00h,
                   01h, 02h, 03h, 04h); setting the Interrupt Mask register (49h, 4Ah, 4Bh, 4Ch, 4Dh) to 1
                   (masked); setting the Interrupt Clear register (5Eh, 5Fh, 60h, 61h, 62h) to 1 (this is a
                   write-only register); resetting the Interrupt Edge register (54h to 5Ch) back to 0. A register
                   group write operation is described in Section 7.1. A register group read operation is
                   described in Section 7.2.

               6.5.13 Interrupt clear registers (5Eh, 5Fh, 60h, 61h, 62h)
                      The write-only interrupt clear registers clear individual interrupt sources (status bit).
                      Setting an individual bit or any combination of bits to logic 1 will reset the corresponding
                      interrupt source, so if that source was the only event causing an interrupt, the INT will be
                      cleared. After writing a logic 1 the bit returns to logic 0. A register group write operation is
                      described in Section 7.1.

                      The read-only input status registers function exactly like Input Port 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (00h,
                      01h, 02h, 03h, 04h) without resetting the interrupt logic. This allows inspection of the
                      actual state of the input pins without upsetting internal logic. If the pin is configured as an
                      input, the port read is unaffected by input latch logic or other features, the state of the
                      register is simply a reflection of the current state of the input pins. If a pin is configured as
                      an output by the Configuration register (0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h), and is also configured
                      as open-drain (register 53h and 68h, 69h, 6Ah, 6Bh, 6Ch), the read for that pin will always
                      return 0, otherwise that state of that pin is returned. A register group read operation is
                      described in Section 7.2.

                      The individual pin output configuration registers modify output configuration (push-pull or
                      open-drain) set by the Output Port Configuration register (53h).
                      If the ODENx bit is set at logic 0 (push-pull), any bit set to logic 1 in the IOCRx register will
                      reverse the output state of that pin only to open-drain. When ODENx bit is set at
                      logic 1 (open-drain), a logic 1 in IOCRx will set that pin to push-pull.
                      The recommended command sequence to program the output pin is to program ODENx
                      (53h), the IOCRx, and finally the Configuration register (0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h) to set
                      the pins as outputs. A register group write operation is described in Section 7.1. A register
                      group read operation is described in Section 7.2.

               6.5.16 Switch debounce enable registers (6Dh, 6Eh)
                      The switch debounce enable registers enable the switch debounce function for Port 0 and
                      Port 1 pins. If a pin on Port 0 or Port 1 is designated as an input, a logic 1 in the Switch
                      debounce enable register will connect debounce logic to that pin. If a pin is assigned as an
                      output (via Configuration Port 0 or Port 1 register) the debounce logic is not connected to
                      that pin and it will function as a normal output. The switch debounce logic requires an
                      oscillator time base input and if this function is used, P2_0 is designated as the oscillator
                      input. If P2_0 is not configured as input, then switch debounce logic is not connected to
                      any pin. See Section 6.10 “Switch debounce circuitry” for additional information about
                      Switch debounce logic functionality.

               6.5.17 Switch debounce count register (6Fh)
                      The switch debounce count register is used to count the debounce time that the switch
                      debounce logic uses to determine if a switch connected to one of the Port 0 or Port 1 pins
                      finally stays open (logic 1) or closed (logic 0). This number, together with the oscillator
                      frequency supplied to P2_0, determines the debounce time (for example, the debounce
                      time will be 10 s if this register is set to 0Ah and external oscillator frequency is 1 MHz).
                      See Section 6.10 “Switch debounce circuitry” for further information.

                   6.6 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD(P) to a maximum of
                       5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD(P) or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation. To avoid internal noise generation when
                       multiple outputs switch simultaneously, a 0.22 uF bypass capacitor is required on the
                       VDD(P) pin as close to the package as practical.

                   6.7 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD(P), an internal power-on reset holds the
                       PCAL6534 in a reset condition until VDD(P) has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCAL6534 registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                       initializes to their default states. After that, VDD(P) must be lowered to below VPOR and
                       back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 8.2 “Power-on reset
                       requirements”.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                 PCAL6534
                                        Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   6.8 Reset input (RESET)
                       The RESET input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the VDD(P) at its
                       operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a
                       minimum of tw(rst). The PCAL6534 registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are
                       changed to their default state once RESET is LOW (0). When RESET is HIGH (1), the I/O
                       levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input requires a
                       pull-up resistor to VDD(I2C-bus) if no active connection is used.
                   6.9 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pull-up resistor to VDD(P) or
                       VDD(I2C-bus) depending on the application. When any current input port state differs from its
                       corresponding input port register state, the interrupt output pin is asserted (logic 0) to
                       indicate the system master (MCU) that one of input port states has changed. A pin
                       configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output to an
                       input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the input port register.
                       In order to enable the interrupt output, the following three conditions must be satisfied:
                         • The GPIO must be configured as an input port by writing "1" to configuration port
                            registers (0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h)
                         • The interrupt mask registers (49h, 4Ah, 4Bh, 4Ch, 4Dh) must set to "0" to unmask
                            interrupt sources.
                         • The interrupt edge registers (54h to 5Ch) select what action on each input pin will
                            cause an interrupt; there are four different interrupt trigger modes: level trigger,
                            rising-edge trigger, falling-edge trigger, or any edge trigger.
                       The input latch registers (3Ah, 3Bh, 3Ch, 3Dh, 3Eh) control each input pin either to enable
                       latched input state or non-latched input state. When input pin is set to latch state, it will
                       hold or latch the input pin state (keep the logic value) and generate an interrupt until the
                       master can service the interrupt. This minimizes the host's interrupt service response for
                       fast moving inputs.
                       Any interrupt status bit can be cleared and INT pin de-asserted by using one of the
                       following methods and conditions:
                         •  Power on reset (POR), hardware reset from RESET pin, or software reset call
                         •  Read input port registers (00h, 01h, 02h, 03h, 04h)
                         •  Write logic 1 to interrupt clear registers (5Eh, 5Fh, 60h, 61h, 62h)
                         •  Write logic 1 to interrupt mask registers (49h, 4Ah, 4Bh, 4Ch, 4Dh)
                         •  Write logic 0 to configuration registers (0Fh, 10h, 11h, 12h, 13h), set pin as output
                            port.
                         • Input pin goes back to its initial state in level trigger and non-latch mode
                         • Input pin goes back to its initial state in level trigger and change latch to non-latch
                            mode
                         • Change the interrupt trigger mode from level trigger to edge trigger or vice versa in
                            interrupt edge registers

                                       Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                     When using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt is
                     de-asserted only when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The
                     interrupt reset occurs in the read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge
                     (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or
                     NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during
                     this pulse. Any change of the inputs after resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                6.10 Switch debounce circuitry
                     Mechanical switches do not make clean make-or-break connections and the contacts can
                     ‘bounce’ for a significant period of time before settling into a steady-state condition. This
                     can confuse fast processors and make the physical interface difficult to design and the
                     software interface difficult to make reliable.
                     The PCAL6534 implements hardware to ease the hardware interface by debouncing
                     switch closures with dedicated circuitry. P0_0 to P0_7, P1_0 to P1_7 can connect to this
                     debounce hardware on a pin-by-pin basis. These switch debouncers remove bounce
                     when a switch opens or closes by requiring that sequentially clocked inputs remain in the
                     same state for a number of sampling periods. The output does not change until the input
                     is stable for a programmable duration. The circuit block diagram (Figure 12) shows the
                     functional blocks consisting of an external oscillator, counter, edge detector, and
                     D flip-flop. When the switch input state changes, the edge detector will reset the counter.
                     When the switch input state is stable for the full qualification period, the counter clocks the
                     flip-flop, updating the output. Figure 13 shows the typical opening and closing switch
                     debounce operation timing.
                     To use the debounce circuitry, set the port pins (P0_0 to P0_7, and P1_0 to P1_7) with
                     switches attached in the Switch Debounce Enable 0 and 1 registers (6Dh, 6Eh). Connect
                     an external oscillator signal on P2_0, which serves as a time base to the debounce timer.
                     Finally, set a delay time in the Switch Debounce Count register (6Fh). The combination of
                     time base of the external oscillator and the debounce count sets the qualification
                     debounce period or tDP in Figure 13. Note that all debounce counters will use the same
                     time base and count, but they all function independently.

                                         Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
7. Bus transactions
                       The PCAL6534 is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                       PCAL6534 through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   7.1 Write commands
                       Data is transmitted to the PCAL6534 by sending the device address with the Least
                       Significant Bit (LSB) set to a logic 0 (see Figure 3 for device address). The command byte
                       is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows the
                       command byte.
                       Many of the registers within the PCAL6534 are configured to operate as register quinary.
                       The 5-register groups are input ports, output ports, polarity inversion and configuration
                       registers, as well as Input latch, Pull-up/pull-down enable and selection registers, Interrupt
                       mask and Interrupt status, Interrupt clear, and Input port (status) without Interrupt clear
                       registers, Individual pin output port configuration registers. After sending data to one
                       register, the next data byte is sent to the next register in the group. For example, if the first
                       byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 06h), the next byte is stored in Output Port 2
                       (register 07h). The next byte sent is stored in Output Port 3 (register 08h) and the next
                       byte will Output Port 4 (register 09h). Since every new write access after a STOP
                       condition requires a Command byte, which sets the Pointer register, the next new write
                       access will be to an arbitrary register.
                       There is no limit on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way,
                       the host can continuously update a register group independently of the other registers or
                       the host can simply update a single register.
                       There is one 3-register group: switch debounce (6Dh ~ 6Fh) registers and two 9-register
                       groups: Output drive strength (30h to 38h) and interrupt edge (54h to 5Ch) registers which
                       can be programmed continuously in this group.
                       There is one register that is not part of a register group: Output port configuration (53h).
                       When this register is accessed multiple times, the register address remains fixed on the
                       same address.

                                                       Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                      7.2 Read commands
                                 To read data from the PCAL6534, the bus master must first send the PCAL6534 address
                                 with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 3 for device address).
                                 The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is to be
                                 accessed.
                                 After a restart or a STOP followed by a START condition, the device address is sent
                                 again, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1 to read data. Data from the
                                 register defined by the command byte is sent by the PCAL6534 (see Figure 16 to
                                 Figure 19). Additional bytes may be read after the first byte read is complete and will
                                 reflect the next register in the group. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the next byte
                                 read is Input Port 2. There is no limit on the number of data bytes received in one read
                                 transmission, but on the final byte received the bus master must not acknowledge the
                                 data.
                                 After a subsequent restart or a STOP followed by a START condition, the command byte
                                 contains the value of the next register to be read in the group. For example, if Input Port 1
                                 was read last before the restart, the register that is read after the restart is the
                                 Input Port 2.

             Device address configured as 0100 010x for this example.
             P2_0 and P0_1 through P0_7 are configured as inputs.
             P1_0 through P4_1(except P2_0) are configured as outputs.
         (1) External resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor
             is not needed with internal pull-up or pull-down resistor option. If an output in the P port is configured as an output, there is no
             need for external pull-up resistors.

                          8.1 Output drive strength control
                              The Output drive strength registers allow the user to control the output drive level of the
                              GPIO. Each GPIO can be configured independently to one of the four possible output
                              current levels. By programming these bits the user is changing the number of transistor
                              pairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad.
                              Figure 21 shows a simplified output stage. The behavior of the pad is affected by the
                              Configuration register, the output port data, and the current control register. When the
                              Current Control register bits are programmed to 01b, then only two of the fingers are
                              active, reducing the current drive capability by 50 %.

                              Reducing the current drive capability may be desirable to reduce system noise. When the
                              output switches (transitions from H/L), there is a peak current that is a function of the
                              output drive selection. This peak current runs through VDD and VSS package inductance
                              and will create noise (some radiated, but more critically Simultaneous Switching Noise
                              (SSN)). In other words, switching many outputs at the same time will create ground and
                              supply noise. The output drive strength control through the Output Drive Strength
                              registers allows the user to mitigate SSN issues without the need of additional external
                              components.
                              In any case, a 0.22 uF bypass capacitor is required on the VDD(P) pin, located as close to
                              the package as practical.

                        8.2 Power-on reset requirements
                                In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCAL6534 can be reset to its default conditions
                                by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a
                                power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is
                                powered on for the first time in an application.
                                The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 22 and Figure 23.

                       Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this
                       device. The glitch width (tw(gl)VDD) and glitch height (VDD(gl)) are dependent on each
                       other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and device impedance are factors that
                       affect power-on reset performance. Figure 24 and Table 90 provide more information on
                       how to measure these specifications.

                       VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                       is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                       their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                       0 V. Figure 25 and Table 90 provide more details on this specification.

                   8.3 Device current consumption with internal pull-up and pull-down
                       resistors
                       The PCAL6534 integrates programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors to eliminate
                       external components when pins are configured as inputs and pull-up or pull-down
                       resistors are required (for example, nothing is driving the inputs to the power supply rails.
                       Since these pull-up and pull-down resistors are internal to the device itself, they contribute
                       to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the overall system
                       design.
                       The pull-up or pull-down function is selected in registers 44h, 45h, 46h, 47h and 48h,
                       while the resistor is connected by the enable registers 3Fh, 40h, 41h, 42h and 43h. The
                       configuration of the resistors is shown in Figure 10.
                       If the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to VDD, a current will flow from
                       the VDD(P) pin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will
                       appear as additional IDD upsetting any current consumption measurements.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  PCAL6534
                                         Ultra low-voltage translating 34-bit Fm+ I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                       In the same manner, if the resistor is configured as a pull-down and the pin is held HIGH,
                       current will flow from the power supply through the pin to the VSS pin. While this current
                       will not be measured as part of IDD, one must be mindful of the 200 mA limiting value
                       through VSS.
                       The pull-up and pull-down resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with
                       voltage. The resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 k with a nominal
                       100 k value. Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins
                       held HIGH or LOW and the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 29 for a
                       graph of supply current vs the number of pull-up resistors.
                   8.4 I2C-bus error recovery techniques
                       There are a number of techniques to recover from error conditions on the I2C-bus. Slave
                       devices like the PCAL6534 use a state machine to implement the I2C protocol and expect
                       a certain sequence of events to occur to function properly. Unexpected events at the I2C
                       master can wreak havoc with the slaves connected on the bus. However, it is usually
                       possible to recover deterministically to a known bus state with careful protocol
                       manipulation.
                       A hard slave reset, either through power-on reset or by activating the RESET pin, will set
                       the device back into the default state. Of course, this means the input/output pins and
                       their configuration will be lost, which might cause some system issues.
                       A STOP condition, which is only initiated by the master, will reset the slave state machine
                       into a known condition where SDA is not driven LOW by the slave and logically, the slave
                       is waiting for a START condition. A STOP condition is defined as SDA transitioning from
                       LOW to HIGH while SCL is HIGH.
                       If the master is interrupted during a packet transmission, the slave may be sending data or
                       performing an Acknowledge, driving the I2C-bus SDA line LOW. Since SDA is LOW, it
                       effectively blocks any other I2C-bus transaction. A deterministic method to clear this
                       situation, once the master recognizes a ‘stuck bus’ state, is for the master to blindly
                       transmit nine clocks on SCL. If the slave was transmitting data or acknowledging, nine or
                       more clocks ensures the slave state machine returns to a known, idle state since the
                       protocol calls for eight data bits and one ACK bit. It does not matter when the slave state
                       machine finishes its transmission, extra clocks will be recognized as STOP conditions.
                       The PCAL6534 SCL pin is an input only. If SCL is stuck LOW, then only the bus master or
                       a slave performing a clock stretch operation can cause this condition.
                       With careful design of the bus master error recovery firmware, many I2C-bus protocol
                       problems can be avoided.

16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                16.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 39) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 98 and 99

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 39.
