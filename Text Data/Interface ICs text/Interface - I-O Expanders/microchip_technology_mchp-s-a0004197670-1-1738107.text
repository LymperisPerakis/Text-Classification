1.1       XNOR Chain Test Mode
An XNOR Chain test structure is in to the ECE1088 to allow users to confirm that all pins are in contact with the moth-
erboard during assembly and test operations (Figure 1-2, "XNOR Chain Test Structure").
The XNOR Chain test structure must be activated to perform these tests. When the XNOR Chain is activated, the
ECE1088 pin functions are disconnected from the device pins, which all become input pins except for one output pin at
the end of XNOR Chain.
The tests that are performed when the XNOR Chain test structure is activated require the board-level test hardware to
control the device pins and observe the results at the XNOR Chain output pin.
1.2       Pins in XNOR Chain Structure
All pins are inputs into the XNOR Chain with the exception of the following pins:
•  TEST_PIN (this is the XNOR Chain enable input)
•  RESERVED
•  SMB_ADDR
•  BC_INT#/SMB_INT#

1.3      Entering and Exiting the XNOR Chain
The XNOR Chain test is entered by setting TEST_PIN to 1 while SMB_ADDR is 0.
When activated, the test mode allows one single input pin, when switched, to toggle the BC_INT#/SMB_INT# output.
The XNOR Chain is exited by setting TEST_PIN to 0, independent of the value of SMB_ADDR.

ECE1088
2.0       PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
2.1       Summary
The ECE1088 is a 28-pin 3.3V GPIO Expansion device. The device is connected to a Master via the BC-Link interface
or via the SMBus.
2.2       Interrupt Generation
Interrupts can be generated by an edge detection on a GPIO pin or an edge detection on one of the bus interface pins.
The bus interrupt pin (BC_INT# or SMBUS_INT#) is asserted if any bit in one of the Interrupt Status registers is 1 and
the corresponding Interrupt Mask bit is also 1. Interrupt generation is illustrated in Figure 2-1, "ECE1088 Interrupt Gen-
eration".

ECE1088
In order for software to determine which device is the source of an interrupt, it should first read the Group Interrupt Status
Register to determine which Status register group is a source for the interrupt. Software should read both the Status
register and the associated Mask register, then AND the two values together. Bits that are 1 in the result of the AND are
active interrupts.
Software clears an interrupt by writing a 1 to the corresponding bit in the Status register.
   Note:     Although the ECE1088 can generate the SMBus interrupt signal SMBUS_INT# as described above, it will
             not respond to the SMBus Alert Response Address transaction unless Bit4 ARA in the Clock Control Reg-
             ister (Register FAh) is set to 1.
2.3       Integrated VCC1 Reset Generator
When VCC1 power is applied to the ECE1088, a VCC1 POR will be generated. This VCC1 POR will reset the device.

In order to enable oscillator wakeup from Low Power Mode for any GPIO pin, the GPIO Configuration Register for that
GPIO must be configured for Input in Bit 5). See Section 2.6.2, "Clock Control".
2.5.4.3        POL
When the POL bit is set to ‘1’’ the signal output is inverted when routed to its pin and the interrupt level sense is inverted
when a level-sensitive interrupt is selected by the DIR, TYPE fields. The state of the pin is always reported without inver-
sion in the GPIO Input Register.

A bit in a GPIOX Interrupt Status Register is set to 1 when the DIRECTION field for that bit in the corresponding GPIOXn
Configuration Register is set for Input and the bit in the corresponding GPIOX Input Register matches the conditions
defined by the TYPE field in the GPIOX Configuration Register. For example, if the TYPE field for GPIO Xn is set for
Level Sensitive Low, then bit n in the GPIOX Interrupt Status Register is set to 1 when bit n in the GPIOX Input Register
is 0. If the TYPE field specifies edge triggering, then the Status Register bit is set when the Input Register bit transitions
with the specified edge.
Writing a bit in a GPIOX Interrupt Status Register clears that bit. Writing a bit with a 0 has no effect.

2.6.2.1          Bit4 ARA
If this bit is 1b and the SMBus interface is enabled (either by setting the Interface Selection field to 11b or by setting the
Interface Selection field to 0xb and an SMBus transaction is detected), the ECE1088 will respond to an SMBus Alert
Response Address Read Byte command as defined in the SMBus specification. If this bit is 0b, the ECE1088 will ignore
the Alert Response Address at all times.

APPLICATION NOTE: Software must insure that the field Interface Selection in this register is ‘11b’ (SMBus
                           Interface enabled) before setting ARA to ‘1b’.
2.6.2.2        Bit2 OSC Control
0b Oscillator Enabled (Default)
1b Oscillator Low Power Enable.
The Oscillator may be stopped and once stopped may be restarted by activity on either the bus interface pins or on
inputs that are enabled for interrupts. See Section 2.6.3, "Wakeup Control" for conditions that restart the Oscillator
When OSC Control is set to Low Power Enable (1b) the Oscillator will stop only when the SMBus or BC-Link are idle.
This means:
     No Interrupts are pending
     No traffic is on the bus
     Transactions on the bus have completed
APPLICATION NOTE: When OSC Control is set to ‘1b’, the ring oscillator will be shut down after every BC-Link or
                           SMBus transaction completes and no interrupts are pending. The oscillator will restart when
                           a wakeup enabled by the Wakeup Control registers occurs. The Wakeup Control register
                           must be configured properly before setting OSC Control to ‘1b’.
2.6.2.3        Bit[1:0] Interface Selection
0Xb Autodetect Mode (default)
10b BC-Link interface enabled.
11b SMBus interface enabled
APPLICATION NOTE: The first access to the ECE1088 must be a write to the Clock Control register to configure
                           the Interface Selection field to the desired interface type (10b or 11b). This is required so
                           that Oscillator control works properly and so that the bus type does not inadvertently switch
                           during use.
2.6.3        WAKEUP CONTROL
The Wakeup Control Register determines which events restart the Oscillator when the Oscillator is in Low Power Mode.

2.7         SMBus / BC-Link Autodetect Circuit
2.7.1         OVERVIEW
For either the SMBus or the BC-Link, by detecting difference in start conditions, the Bus type is indicated. From an idle
condition, the device will sample the data line on the first falling edge of the clock. If it is low, a SMBus interface is
selected; if it is high, a BC-Link interface is selected. The idle condition is defined as a POR or no activity for 75 ms. To
safeguard against glitches selecting the wrong bus and locking the system, the device use time-outs that reload on a
start from the respective bus interface. For SMBus, the timeout is 75 ms. For BC-Link, the timeout is 75 s.
2.8         SMBus Slave Interface
The host processor communicates with the ECE1088 device through a series of read/write registers via the SMBus
interface. SMBus is a serial communication protocol between a computer host and its peripheral devices.
The SMBus data rate is 10KHz minimum to 400 KHz maximum.
2.8.1         CLOCKING
The SMBus Slave interface is driven by an internal Ring Oscillator. This oscillator runs at a nominal frequency of 32MHz.
The Ring Oscillator may be started and stopped through firmware interactions. The that controls the operation of the
Oscillator is described in Section 2.6.2, "Clock Control" and Section 2.6.3, "Wakeup Control".
2.8.2         SLAVE ADDRESS
Upon power up, the ECE1088 device will be placed into Address Select mode and assign itself an SMBus address
according to the Address Select input. The device will latch the address during the first valid SMBus transaction in which
the first five bits of the targeted address match those of the ECE1088 address. This feature eliminates the possibility of
a glitch on the SMBus interfering with address selection.

2.8.3         SLAVE BUS INTERFACE
The ECE1088 device SMBus implementation is a subset of the SMBus interface to the host. The device is a slave-only
SMBus device. The implementation in the device is a subset of SMBus since it only supports four protocols.
The Write Byte, Read Byte, Send Byte, and Receive Byte protocols are the only valid SMBus protocols for the device.
This part responds to other protocols as described in the Invalid Protocol Section. Reference the System Management
Bus Specification, Rev 2.0.
The SMBus interface is used to read and write the registers in the device. The register set is shown in Table 2-1, "Reg-
ister Summary".
2.8.4         WRITE BYTE
The Write Byte protocol is used to write data to the registers. The data will only be written if the protocol shown in
Table 2-18, "SMBus Write Byte Protocol" is performed correctly. Only one byte is transferred at time for a Write Byte
protocol.

2.8.5         READ BYTE
The Read Byte protocol is used to read data from the registers. The data will only be read if the protocol shown in
Table 2-19, "SMBus Read Byte Protocol" is performed correctly. Only one byte is transferred at time for a Read Byte
protocol.

2.8.6         SEND BYTE
The Send Byte protocol is used to set the Internal Address Register to the correct register in the ECE1088. No data is
transferred for a Send Byte protocol.The send byte protocol is shown in Table 2-20, "SMBus Send Byte Protocol".
TABLE 2-20:           SMBUS SEND BYTE PROTOCOL
       Field:             Start          Slave Addr           Wr       Ack        Reg. Addr            Ack        Stop

2.8.7         RECEIVE BYTE
The Receive Byte protocol is used to read data from the registers when the register address is known to be at the
desired address (using the Internal Address Register). Only one byte is transferred at time for a Receive Byte protocol.
TABLE 2-21:           SMBUS RECEIVE BYTE PROTOCOL
      Field:           Start        Slave Addr            Rd        Ack          Reg. Data          Nack          Stop

   Note:      Some simple devices do not contain a clock low drive circuit; this simple kind of device typically may reset
              its communications port after a start or stop condition.
2.8.8         STRETCHING THE SCLK SIGNAL
The ECE1088 supports stretching of the SCLK by other devices on the SMBus.
2.8.9         SMBUS TIMING
The SMBus Slave Interface complies with the SMBus AC Timing Specification. See the SMBus timing diagram shown
in Section 4.2, "SMBus Timing".
2.8.10        SMBUS ALERT RESPONSE ADDRESS
This device responds to protocols with the SMBus Alert Response Address of 0001_100 if the ARA bit in the Clock Con-
trol register is set.
2.8.11        SMBUS TIME-OUT
The ECE1088 includes an SMBus time-out feature. Following a 30 ms period of inactivity on the SMBus, the device
time-out and reset the SMBus interface.
2.9         BC-LinkInterface
The BC-Link is a proprietary bus that allows communication between a Master device and a Companion device. The
Master device uses this serial bus to read and write registers located on the Companion device.
The bus comprises three signals, BC_CLK, BC_DAT and BC_INT#. The Master device always provides the clock, BC_-
CLK, and the Companion device is the source for an independent asynchronous interrupt signal, BC_INT#.
The ECE1088 supports BC-Link speeds up to 24MHz.

   Note:    Stresses above those listed above and below could cause permanent damage to the device. This is a
            stress rating only and functional operation of the device at any other condition above those indicated in the
            operation sections of this specification is not implied. When powering this device from laboratory or system
            power supplies, it is important that the Absolute Maximum Ratings not be exceeded or device failure can
            result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage spikes on their outputs when the AC power is switched on or
            off. In addition, voltage transients on the AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility
            exists, it is suggested that a clamp circuit be used.

ECE1088
    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of Micro-
