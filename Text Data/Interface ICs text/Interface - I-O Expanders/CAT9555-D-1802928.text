CAT9555
16-bit I2C and SMBus I/O
Port with Interrupt
Description
  The CAT9555 is a CMOS device that provides 16−bit parallel
input/output port expansion for I2 C and SMBus compatible                                http://onsemi.com
applications. These I/O expanders provide a simple solution in
applications where additional I/Os are needed: sensors, power
switches, LEDs, pushbuttons, and fans.
  The CAT9555 consists of two 8−bit Configuration ports (input or
output), Input, Output and Polarity inversion registers, and an
I2C/SMBus−compatible serial interface.
  Any of the sixteen I/Os can be configured as an input or output by             SOIC−24                       TSSOP−24
writing to the configuration register. The system master can invert the         W SUFFIX                        Y SUFFIX
CAT9555 input data by writing to the active−high polarity inversion           CASE 751BK                      CASE 948AR
register.
  The CAT9555 features an active low interrupt output which
indicates to the system master that an input state has changed.
  The three address input pins provide the device’s extended                     TQFN−24                        TQFN−24
addressing capability and allow up to eight devices to share the same         HV6 SUFFIX                      HT6 SUFFIX
bus. The fixed part of the I2C slave address is the same as the               CASE 510AG                      CASE 510AN
CAT9554, allowing up to eight of these devices in any combination to
                                                                                       MARKING DIAGRAMS

Power-On Reset Operation
  When the power supply is applied to VCC pin, an internal power-on reset pulse holds the CAT9555 in a reset state until VCC
reaches VPOR level. At this point, the reset condition is released and the internal state machine and the CAT9555 registers are
initialized to their default state.
