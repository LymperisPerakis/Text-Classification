82C55A
Pin Description
   SYMBOL        TYPE                                                       DESCRIPTION
     VCC                 VCC: The +5V power supply pin. A 0.1F capacitor between VCC and GND is recommended for decoupling.
     GND                 GROUND
    D0-D7         I/O    DATA BUS: The Data Bus lines are bidirectional three-state pins connected to the system data bus.
    RESET           I    RESET: A high on this input clears the control register and all ports (A, B, C) are set to the input mode with the “Bus
                         Hold” circuitry turned on.
      CS            I    CHIP SELECT: Chip select is an active low input used to enable the 82C55A onto the Data Bus for CPU
                         communications.
      RD            I    READ: Read is an active low input control signal used by the CPU to read status information or data via the data bus.
     WR             I    WRITE: Write is an active low input control signal used by the CPU to load control words and data into the 82C55A.
    A0-A1           I    ADDRESS: These input signals, in conjunction with the RD and WR inputs, control the selection of one of the three
                         ports or the control word register. A0 and A1 are normally connected to the least significant bits of the Address Bus
                         A0, A1.
   PA0-PA7        I/O    PORT A: 8-bit input and output port. Both bus hold high and bus hold low circuitry are present on this port.
   PB0-PB7        I/O    PORT B: 8-bit input and output port. Bus hold high circuitry is present on this port.
   PC0-PC7        I/O    PORT C: 8-bit input and output port. Bus hold circuitry is present on this port.

signals, generated from port C, can be inhibited or enabled by
setting or resetting the associated INTE flip-flop, using the bit

This function allows the programmer to enable or disable a
CPU interrupt by a specific I/O device without affecting any
other device in the interrupt structure.
