1. General description
              The PCA9536 is an 8-pin CMOS device that provides 4 bits of General Purpose parallel
              Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was developed to
              enhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. I/O expanders
              provide a simple solution when additional I/O is needed for ACPI power switches,
              sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fans, etc.
              The PCA9536 consists of a 4-bit Configuration register (input or output selection), 4-bit
              Input Port register, 4-bit Output Port register and a 4-bit Polarity Inversion register
              (active HIGH or active LOW operation). The system master can enable the I/Os as either
              inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for each input or output
              is kept in the corresponding Input Port or Output Port register. The polarity of the read
              register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register. All registers can be read by
              the system master.
              The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
              machine.
              The I2C-bus address is fixed and allows only one device on the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       The command byte is the first byte to follow the address byte during a write transmission.
                       It is used as a pointer to determine which of the following registers will be written or read.
                6.1.2 Register 0 - Input Port register
                       This register is a read-only port. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                       of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by Register 3. Writes to this register
                       have no effect.
                       The default ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level, normally logic 1 when
                       no external signal externally applied because of the internal pull-up resistors.

                      This register reflects the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as outputs by Register 3.
                      Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined as inputs. Reads from this register
                      return the value that is in the flip-flop controlling the output selection, not the actual pin
                      value.
                      ‘Not used’ bits can be programmed with either logic 0 or logic 1.

                      This register allows the user to invert the polarity of the Input Port register data. If a bit in
                      this register is set (written with ‘1’), the corresponding Input Port data is inverted. If a bit in
                      this register is cleared (written with a ‘0’), the Input Port data polarity is retained.
                      ‘Not used’ bits can be programmed with either logic 0 or logic 1.

                       I/Os are configured as inputs with a weak pull-up to VDD.
                       ‘Not used’ bits can be programmed with either logic 0 or logic 1.

                   6.2 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9536 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA9536 registers and state machine will initialize to their default states.
                       Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                       For a power reset cycle, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V and then restored to the
                       operating voltage.
                   6.3 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a
                       high-impedance input with a weak pull-up (100 k typical) to VDD. The input voltage may
                       be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, then either Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the
                       state of the Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied
                       to an I/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance paths that exist between

                       Data is transmitted to the PCA9536 registers using the Write mode as shown in Figure 7
                       and Figure 8. Data is read from the PCA9536 registers using the Read mode as shown in
                       Figure 9 and Figure 10. These devices do not implement an auto-increment function, so
                       once a command byte has been sent, the register which was addressed will continue to
                       be accessed by reads until a new command byte has been sent.

13. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 13 and 14

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all

                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 19.
