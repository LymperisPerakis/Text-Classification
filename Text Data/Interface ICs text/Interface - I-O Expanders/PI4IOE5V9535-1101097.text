         ii. Register 0 and 1: input port registers
This register is a read-only port. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input
or an output by Register 3. Writes to this register have no effect.

        iii. Register 2 and 3:Output port registers
This register is an output-only port. It reflects the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as outputs by Registers 6 and 7. Bit
values in this register have no effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that is in the flip-
flop controlling the output selection, not the actual pin value.

This register allows the user to invert the polarity of the Input port register data. If a bit in this register is set (written with ‘1’), the
Input port data polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a ‘0’), the Input port data polarity is retained.

         v. Register 6 and 7: Configuration registers
This register configures the directions of the I/O pins. If a bit in this register is set (written with ‘1’), the corresponding port pin is
enabled as an input with high-impedance output driver. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with ‘0’), the corresponding port
pin is enabled as an output. Note that there is a high value resistor tied to VCC at each pin. At reset, the IOs are configured as
inputs with a pull-up to VCC.

    c. Power-on reset
When power is applied to VCC, an internal power-on reset holds the PI4IOE5V9535 in a reset condition until VCC has reached
VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released and thePI4IOE5V9535 registers and SMBus state machine will initialize to
their default states. The power-on reset typically completes the reset and enables the part by the time the power supply is above
VPOR. However, when it is required to reset the part by lowering the power supply, it is necessary to lower it below 0.2 V.
    d. I/O port
When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a high-impedance. . The input voltage may be raised
above VCC to a maximum of 5.5 V.
If the I/O is configured as an output, then on PI4IOE5V9535 either Q1 or Q2 is on, depending on the state of the Output Port
register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied to an I/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance
path that exists between the pin and either VCC or GND.

     e. Bus Transaction
         i. Writing to the port registers
Data is transmitted to the PI4IOE5V9535 by sending the device address and setting the least significant bit to a logic 0.
The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will receive the data following the command byte.
The eight registers within the PI4IOE5V9535 are configured to operate as four register pairs. The four pairs are Input Ports,
Output Ports, Polarity Inversion Ports, and Configuration Ports. After sending data to one register, the next data byte will be sent
to the other register in the pair. For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3), the next byte will be stored in
Output Port 0 (register 2). There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way, each 8-
bit register may be updated independently of the other registers.

Write to Output port register
 Figure 7: Write to configuration registers
          ii. Reading the port registers
In order to read data from the PI4IOE5V9535, the bus master must first send the PI4IOE5V9535 address with the least significant
bit set to a logic 0. The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will be accessed. After a restart, the
device address is sent again, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command
byte will then be sent by the PI4IOE5V9535. Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock pulse.
After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read but the data will now reflect the information in the other register in the
pair. For example, if you read Input Port 1, then the next byte read would be Input Port 0. There is no limitation on the number of
data bytes received in one read transmission but the final byte received, the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

   Note: Transfer can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition.

  Figure 9: Read Input port register
  Note: Transfer of data can be stopped at any moment by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest
  acknowledge phase is valid (output mode). It is assumed that the command byte has previously been set to ‘00’ (read Input
  Port register).
         iii.  Interrupt output
The open-drain interrupt output is activated when one of the port pins changes state and the pin is configured as an input.
The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to its previous state or the Input Port register is read. A pin configured as an
output cannot cause an interrupt. Since each 8-bit port is read independently, the interrupt caused by Port 0 will not be cleared by
a read of Port 1 or the other way around.
     Note: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur if the state of the pin does not match
the contents of the Input Port register.

Minimizing ICC when the I/Os are used to control LEDS
When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VCC through a resistor as shown in Figure 11. Since the
LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VCC. The supply current, ICC, increases as VI becomes
lower than VCC.
Designs need minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications, should consider maintaining the I/O pins
greater than or equal to VCC when the LED is off. Figure 11 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 12 shows
VCC less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI at or above VCC and prevent
additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.
