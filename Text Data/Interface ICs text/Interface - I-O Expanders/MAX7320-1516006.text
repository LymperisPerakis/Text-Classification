MAX7320                                       I2C Port Expander with Eight Push-Pull Outputs
General Description                                         Benefits and Features
The MAX7320 2-wire serial-interfaced peripheral features    ●● 400kHz, +5.5V-Tolerant I2C Serial Interface
eight push-pull outputs with selectable power-up logic      ●● +1.71V to +5.5V Operating Voltage
states.
                                                            ●● Eight Push-Pull Output Ports with Selectable Power-
The +5.5V tolerant RST input clears the serial inter-           Up Logic States
face, terminating any I2C communication to or from the
MAX7320.                                                    ●● RST Clears the Serial Interface, Terminating Any
                                                                Serial Transaction to or from the MAX7320
The MAX7320 uses two address inputs with four-level
logic to allow 16 I2C slave addresses. The slave address    ●● AD0 and AD2 Inputs Select from 16 Slave Addresses
also determines the power-up state level for the outputs    ●● Low 0.6μA (typ) Standby Current
in groups of four ports.                                    ●● -40°C to +125°C Temperature Range
The MAX7320 supports hot insertion. The serial interface
SDA, SCL, AD0, AD2, and RST remain high impedance in
power-down (V+ = 0V) with up to +6V asserted on them.

Note 1: All parameters tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: Guaranteed by design.
Note 3: A master device must provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to VIL of the SCL signal) to bridge
         the undefined region of SCL’s falling edge.
Note 4: Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF. tR and tF measured between 0.3 x V+ and 0.7 x V+, ISINK ≤ 6mA.
Note 5: Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50ns.

Each of the output ports, O0–O7, has a protection diode
to V+ and to GND (Figure 8). When a port output is driven
to a voltage higher than V+ or lower than GND, the appro-
priate protection diode clamps the output to a diode drop
above V+ or below GND. When the MAX7320 is powered
down (V+ = 0V), each output port appears as a diode con-
nected to GND (Figure 8).                                         Figure 8. Output Port Structure
Power-Supply Considerations
The MAX7320 operates with a supply voltage of +1.71V
to +5.5V over the -40°C to +125°C temperature range.
Bypass V+ to GND with a ceramic capacitor of at least
0.047μF as close to the device as possible. For the TQFN
version, additionally connect the exposed pad to GND.
