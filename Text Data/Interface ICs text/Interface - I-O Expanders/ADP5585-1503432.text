7 to 0     PWM_ONT_HIGH_BYTE[7:0]   Read/write Upper eight bits of PWM on time. Note that updated PWM times are not latched
                                               until this byte is written to. PWM count times are referenced from the internal
                                               oscillator. The fastest oscillator setting is 500 kHz (2 µs increments). Therefore, the
                                               maximum period is
                                                  2 µs × 216 = 131 ms
                                               This gives PWM frequencies from 500 kHz down to 7.6 Hz.
