1. General description
              The PCA9570 is a CMOS device that provides 4 bits of General Purpose parallel Output
              (GPO) expansion in low voltage processor and handheld battery powered mobile
              applications. It operates at 1 MHz I2C-bus speeds while maintaining backward
              compatibility to Fast-mode (400 kHz) and Standard-mode (100 kHz).
              The PCA9570 is a streamlined GPO that consists of 4-bit push-pull outputs that offer low
              current consumption, small packaging options and a low operating voltage range of 1.1 V
              to 3.6 V. The latched outputs are symmetrical 4 mA current drive capability at 3.3 V to
              drive various control logic. The PCA9570 output expander provides a simple solution
              when additional outputs are needed while keeping interconnections and floor space to a
              minimum, for example, in battery powered mobile applications where PCBs are crowded
              for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, etc.
              The PCA9570 contains an internal Power-On Reset (POR) and a Software Reset feature
              that initializes the device to its default state.

                       Two other different addresses can be sent to the device.
                        • General Call address: allows resetting the device through the I2C-bus upon reception
                           of the right I2C-bus sequence. See Section 7.2.1 “Software Reset” for more
                           information.
                        • Device ID address: allows reading ID information from the device (manufacturer, part
                           identification, revision). See Section 7.2.2 “Device ID (PCA9570 ID field)” for more

                                                                     Remote 4-bit general purpose outputs for 1 MHz I2C-bus
                7.2.1 Software Reset
                      The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up
                      state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it
                      implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the bus.
                      The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
                       1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                       2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write)
                           is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                       3. The device acknowledges after seeing the General Call address ‘0000 0000’ (00h)
                           only. If the R/W bit is set to 1 (read), no acknowledge is returned to the I2C-bus
                           master.
                       4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
                           1 byte. The value of the byte must be equal to 06h.
                           a. The device acknowledges this value only. If the byte is not equal to 06h, the device
                               does not acknowledge it.
                           If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the device does not acknowledge any more.
                       5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a
                           STOP command to end the Software Reset sequence: the device then resets to the
                           default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again within the specified
                           bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no reset is performed.
                      The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the device (at any time) as a
                      ‘Software Reset Abort’. The device does not initiate a reset of its registers.
                      The unique sequence that initiates a Software Reset is described in Figure 7.

                                                                               from slave(s)

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                 PCA9570
                                                                    Remote 4-bit general purpose outputs for 1 MHz I2C-bus
                7.2.2 Device ID (PCA9570 ID field)
                      The Device ID field is a 3 byte read-only (24 bits) word giving the following information:
                       • 12 bits with the manufacturer name, unique per manufacturer (for example, NXP).
                       • 9 bits with the part identification, assigned by manufacturer, the 7 MSBs with the
                          category ID and the 6 LSBs with the feature ID (for example PCA9570 4-bit I/O
                          expander).
                       • 3 bits with the die revision, assigned by manufacturer (for example, Rev X).
                      The Device ID is read-only, hardwired in the device and can be accessed as follows:
                       1. START command
                       2. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address followed by the R/W bit
                          set to 0 (write): ‘1111 1000’.
                       3. The master sends the I2C-bus slave address of the slave device it needs to identify.
                          The LSB is a ‘Don’t care’ value. Only one device must acknowledge this byte (the one
                          that has the I2C-bus slave address).
                       4. The master sends a Re-START command.
                          Remark: A STOP command followed by a START command resets the slave state
                          machine and the Device ID read cannot be performed. Also, a STOP command or a
                          Re-START command followed by an access to another slave device resets the slave
                          state machine and the Device ID Read cannot be performed.
                       5. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address followed by the R/W bit
                          set to 1 (read): ‘1111 1001’.
                       6. The Device ID Read can be done, starting with the 12 manufacturer bits (first byte +
                          4 MSB of the second byte), followed by the 9 part identification bits (4 LSBs of the
                          second byte + 5 MSBs of the third byte), and then the 3 die revision bits (3 LSBs of
                          the third byte).
                       7. The master ends the reading sequence by NACKing the last byte, thus resetting the
                          slave device state machine and allowing the master to send the STOP command.
                          Remark: The reading of the Device ID can be stopped anytime by sending a NACK
                          command.
                          If the master continues to ACK the bytes after the third byte, the slave rolls back to the
                          first byte and keeps sending the Device ID sequence until a NACK has been
                          detected.
                          For the PCA9570, the Device ID is as shown in Figure 8.

                    8.1 I/O architecture
                           The device ports (see Figure 2) are entirely independent and are output ports. The state
                           of the ports at the pin is transferred from the ports to the microcontroller in the Read mode
                           (see Figure 11). Output data is transmitted to the ports in the Write mode (see Figure 10).
                           At power-on all ports are HIGH. The state of the Output Port register determines if either
                           Q1 or Q2 is on, driving the line either HIGH or LOW. A bit set to 1 in the data byte drives
                           the line HIGH at the corresponding port. A bit set to 0 in the data byte drives the line LOW
                           at the corresponding port.
                           If an external voltage is applied to an output, care should be exercised because of the
                           low-impedance path that exists between the pin and either VDD or VSS.
                    8.2 Writing to the port (Output mode)
                           To write, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device. By setting the last
                           bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 0, the Write mode is entered. The
                           device acknowledges and the master sends the data byte for P7 to P0 and is
                           acknowledged by the device. Writes to P7 to P4 are ignored in the PCA9570 as only P3
                           through P0 are available. The 4-bit data is presented on the port lines after it has been
                           acknowledged by the device. The number of data bytes that can be sent successively is
                           not limited. The previous data is overwritten every time a data byte has been sent.

                       8.3 Reading from a port (Input mode)
                                All ports are outputs and cannot be used as inputs. When reading the device, the data
                                returned is the port state at the pin. To read, the master (microcontroller) first addresses
                                the slave device by setting the last bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 1.
                                The data byte that follows on the SDA is the value of the ports pins. There is no limit to the
                                number of bytes read, and the state of the output port pins is updated at each
                                acknowledge cycle. Logic 1 means that the port is HIGH. Logic 0 means that the port is
                                LOW. When the PCA9570 is read, P7 through P4 return logic ‘1’.
                                                                                                                                                           no acknowledge

                       8.4 Power-on reset
                                When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the device in a
                                reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                                and the device registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine initialize to their default states.
                                See Section 14 for DC and AC characteristics of the POR function.

                   9.1 I/O expander applications
                       Figure 12 shows a 4-bit output expander application. The desired HIGH or LOW logic
                       levels are controlled by the master with speeds of up to 1 MHz on a lightly loaded bus
                       (<100 pF). This allows the host processor to control various functions quickly and with
                       very low overhead. The port read function of the device enables the host processor to poll
                       the status of the output port pins. This is useful for system recovery operations or
                       debugging.

14. Power-on reset requirements
                               In the event of a glitch or data corruption, the device can be reset to its default conditions
                               by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a
                               power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is
                               powered on for the first time in an application.

                               Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this
                               device. The glitch width (tw(gl)VDD) and glitch height (VDD(gl)) are dependent on each
                               other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and device impedance are factors that
                               affect power-on reset performance. Figure 20 and Table 8 provide more information on
                               how to measure these specifications.

                   VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                   is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                   their default states. Figure 21 and Table 8 provide more details on this specification.
                                                                          VDD

17. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
18. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                18.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                18.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                18.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 25) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 25.
