Two registers provide access to the two GPIO ports:

A read from this register provides status on pins of
these ports. A write to these registers will modify the
output latch registers (OLAT0, OLAT1) and data output.

ister is set, the corresponding input port (GPn) data bit

Two registers control the direction of data I/O:
• IODIR0 (controls GP0)
• IODIR1 (controls GP1)
When a bit in these registers is set, the corresponding
pin becomes an input. Otherwise, it becomes an
output. At Power-on Reset, the device ports are
configured as inputs.

Two registers contain the value of the port that
generated the interrupt:
• INTCAP0 contains the value of GP0 at time of
   GP0 change interrupt

   GP1 change interrupt
These registers are ‘read-only’ registers (A write to

• IOCON0 controls the functionality of the
   MCP23016.
The IARES (Interrupt Activity Resolution) bit controls
the sampling frequency of the GP port pins. The higher
the sampling frequency, the higher the device current
requirements. If this bit is ‘0’ (default), the maximum
time to detect the activity on the port is 32 ms (max.),
which results in lower standby current. If this bit is ‘1’,
the maximum time to detect activity on the port is
200 µsec. (max.) and results in higher standby current.

If the input port value changes back to normal before a

INTCAP0/INTCAP1 will still contain the value of the
port at the interrupt change. If the port value changes
again, it will re-activate the interrupt and the new value
will be captured.
The first interrupt on change event following an
interrupt RESET will result in a capture event. Any fur-
ther change event that occurs before the interrupt is
reset will not result in a capture event.

 Note 1:  These parameters are characterized but not tested.
       2: As a transmitter, the device must provide this internal minimum delay time to bridge the undefined region
          (min. 300 ns) of the falling edge of SCL to avoid unintended generation of START or STOP conditions.
       3: A Fast mode (400 kHz) I2C bus device can be used in a Standard mode (100 kHz) I2C bus system, but the
          requirement TSU:DAT ≥ 250 ns must then be met. This will automatically be the case if the device does not
          stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal. If such a device does stretch the LOW period of the SCL signal,
          it must output the next data bit to the SDA line TR max.+TSU:DAT = 1000 + 250 = 1250 ns (according to the
          Standard mode I2C bus specification), before the SCL line is released.

NOTES:
DS20090B-page 36  2003 Microchip Technology Inc.


Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
•     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
•     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
      intended manner and under normal conditions.
•     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
      knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip's Data
      Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
•     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
•     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
      mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
