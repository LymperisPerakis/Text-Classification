6. The power−on reset circuit resets   the I2C bus logic with VDD < VPOR  and set all I/Os to logic 1 upon power−up. Thereafter, VDD must be lower
    than 0.2 V to reset the part.
7. Each bit must be limited to a maximum of 25 mA and the total package limited to 200 mA due to internal bussing limits.
8. The value is not tested, but verified on sampling basis.

9. tVD:ACK = time for Acknowledgment signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
10. tVD:DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
11. Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
12. A master device must internally provide a hold time of al least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to VIL of the SCL signal) in order to bridge
    the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
13. The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at 250 ns.
    This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without exceeding
    the maximum specified tf.
14. Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.
Product parametric performance is indicated in the Electrical Characteristics for the listed test conditions, unless otherwise noted. Product
performance may not be indicated by the Electrical Characteristics if operated under different conditions.

are incorporated on AD2, AD1, and AD0. Address values                  Figure 5. PCA9654E / PCA9654EA Device Address

A logic 1 on the last bit of the first byte selects a read operation while a logic 0 selects a write operation.

Interrupt Output
   The open−drain interrupt output is activated when one of
the port pins changes state and the pin is configured as an
input. The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to
its previous state or the Input Port register is read.
Note that changing an I/O from an output to an input may
cause a false interrupt to occur if the state of the pin does not
match the contents of the Input Port register.

System Configuration

receiving is the ‘receiver’. The device that controls the               by the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 13).
