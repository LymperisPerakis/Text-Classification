                  Remote 16-bit I/O expander for Fm+ I2C-bus with interrupt and
                  reset
                  Rev. 2 — 29 September 2011                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9673 provides general purpose remote I/O expansion for most microcontroller
              families via the two-line bidirectional bus (I2C-bus) and is a part of the Fast-mode Plus
              family.
              The PCA9673 is a drop in upgrade for the PCF8575 providing higher Fast-mode Plus
              (Fm+) I2C-bus speeds (1 MHz versus 400 kHz) so that the output can support PWM
              dimming of LEDs, higher I2C-bus drive (30 mA versus 3 mA) so that many more devices
              can be on the bus without the need for bus buffers, higher total package sink capacity
              (400 mA versus 100 mA) that supports having all 25 mA LEDs on at the same time and
              more device addresses (16 versus 8) are available to allow many more devices on the
              bus without address conflicts.
              The difference between the PCA9673 and the PCF8575 is that the A2 address pin is
              replaced by a RESET input on the PCA9673.
              The device consists of a 16-bit quasi-bidirectional port and an I2C-bus interface. The
              PCA9673 has a low current consumption and includes latched outputs with 25 mA high
              current drive capability for directly driving LEDs.
              It also possesses an interrupt line (INT) which can be connected to the interrupt logic of
              the microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform
              the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its ports without having to communicate via
              the I2C-bus.
              The internal Power-On Reset (POR), hardware reset pin (RESET) or software reset
              sequence initializes the I/Os as inputs.

7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9673”.
                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                       accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address of the
                       PCA9673 is shown in Figure 7. Slave address pins AD1 and AD0 choose 1 of 16 slave
                       addresses. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on AD1 and
                       AD0. Address values depending on AD1 and AD0 can be found in Table 3 “PCA9673
                       address map”.
                       Remark: The General Call address (0000 0000b) and the Device ID address
                       (1111 100Xb) are reserved and cannot be used as device address. Failure to follow this
                       requirement will cause the PCA9673 not to acknowledge.
                       Remark: Reserved I2C-bus addresses must be used with caution since they can interfere
                       with:
                         • “reserved for future use” I2C-bus addresses (0000 011, 1111 101, 1111 110, 1111 111)
                         • slave devices that use the 10-bit addressing scheme (1111 0xx)
                         • High speed mode (Hs-mode) master code (0000 1xx)
                                                                                       slave address
                                                                        A6     A5      A4      A3      A2      A1   A0 R/W
                                                                                      programmable
                                                                                                                    002aab636
                         Fig 7.  PCA9673 address
                       The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a
                       read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.
                       When AD1 and AD0 are held to VDD or VSS, the same address as the PCF8575 is applied.

                       Two other different addresses can be sent to the PCA9673.
                        • General Call address: allows to reset the PCA9673 through the I2C-bus upon
                           reception of the right I2C-bus sequence. See Section 7.2.1 “Software Reset” for more
                           information.
                        • Device ID address: allows to read ID information from the device (manufacturer, part
                           identification, revision). See Section 7.2.2 “Device ID (PCA9673 ID field)” for more
                           information.

                7.2.1 Software Reset
                      The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up
                      state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it
                      implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the bus.
                      The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
                       1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                       2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write)
                          is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                       3. The PCA9673 device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the General Call address
                          ‘0000 0000’ (00h) only. If the R/W bit is set to 1 (read), no acknowledge is returned to
                          the I2C-bus master.
                       4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
                          1 byte. The value of the byte must be equal to 06h.
                          a. The PCA9673 acknowledges this value only. If the byte is not equal to 06h, the
                              PCA9673 does not acknowledge it.
                          If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the PCA9673 does not acknowledge any more.
                       5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a
                          STOP command to end the Software Reset sequence: the PCA9673 then resets to
                          the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again within the
                          specified bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no reset is
                          performed.
                      The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9673 (at any time) as
                      a ‘Software Reset Abort’. The PCA9673 does not initiate a reset of its registers.
                      The unique sequence that initiates a Software Reset is described in Figure 10.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                 PCA9673
                                           Remote 16-bit I/O expander for Fm+ I2C-bus with interrupt and reset
                7.2.2 Device ID (PCA9673 ID field)
                      The Device ID field is a 3-byte read-only (24 bits) word giving the following information:
                       • 8 bits with the manufacturer name, unique per manufacturer (for example,
                          NXP Semiconductors).
                       • 13 bits with the part identification, assigned by manufacturer, the 7 MSBs with the
                          category ID and the 6 LSBs with the feature ID (for example, PCA9673 16-bit
                          quasi-output I/O expander).
                       • 3 bits with the die revision, assigned by manufacturer (for example, Rev X).
                      The Device ID is read-only, hardwired in the device and can be accessed as follows:
                       1. START command
                       2. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address ‘1111 100’ with the R/W
                          bit set to 0 (write).
                       3. The master sends the I2C-bus slave address of the slave device it needs to identify.
                          The LSB is a ‘Don’t care’ value. Only one device must acknowledge this byte (the one
                          that has the I2C-bus slave address).
                       4. The master sends a Re-START command.
                          Remark: A STOP command followed by a START command will reset the slave state
                          machine and the Device ID read cannot be performed.
                          Remark: A STOP command or a Re-START command followed by an access to
                          another slave device will reset the slave state machine and the Device ID read cannot
                          be performed.
                       5. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address ‘1111 100’ with the R/W
                          bit set to 1 (read).
                       6. The device ID read can be done, starting with the 8 manufacturer bits (first byte +
                          4 MSB of the second byte), followed by the 13 part identification bits and then the
                          3 die revision bits (3 LSB of the third byte).
                       7. The master ends the reading sequence by NACKing the last byte, thus resetting the
                          slave device state machine and allowing the master to send the STOP command.
                          Remark: The reading of the Device ID can be stopped anytime by sending a NACK
                          command.
                          Remark: If the master continues to ACK the bytes after the third byte, the PCA9673
                          rolls back to the first byte and keeps sending the Device ID sequence until a NACK
                          has been detected.
                          For the PCA9673, the Device ID is as shown in Figure 11.

                                             Remote 16-bit I/O expander for Fm+ I2C-bus with interrupt and reset
8. I/O programming
                   8.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/O architecture
                       The PCA9673’s 16 ports (see Figure 2) are entirely independent and can be used either
                       as input or output ports. Input data is transferred from the ports to the microcontroller in
                       the Read mode (see Figure 15). Output data is transmitted to the ports in the Write mode
                       (see Figure 14).
                       Every data transmission from the PCA9673 must consist of an even number of bytes, the
                       first byte will be referred to as P07 to P00, and the second byte as P17 to P10. The third
                       will be referred to as P07 to P00, and so on.
                       This quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control
                       signal for data directions. At power-on the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode only a current
                       source (IOH) to VDD is active. An additional strong pull-up to VDD (Itrt(pu)) allows fast rising
                       edges into heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH,
                       and are switched off by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being
                       used as inputs. After power-on, as all the I/Os are set HIGH, all of them can be used as
                       inputs. Any change in setting of the I/Os as either inputs or outputs can be done with the
                       write mode.
                       Remark: If a HIGH is applied to an I/O which has been written earlier to LOW, a large
                       current (IOL) will flow to VSS.
                   8.2 Writing to the port (Output mode)
                       To write, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device. By setting the last
                       bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 0 the Write mode is entered. The
                       PCA9673 acknowledges and the master sends the first data byte for P07 to P00. After the
                       first data byte is acknowledged by the PCA9673, the second data byte P17 to P10 is sent
                       by the master. Once again, the PCA9673 acknowledges the receipt of the data. Each 8-bit
                       data is presented on the port lines after it has been acknowledged by the PCA9673.
                       The number of data bytes that can be sent successively is not limited. After every two
                       bytes, the previous data is overwritten.
                       The first data byte in every pair refers to Port 0 (P07 to P00), whereas the second data
                       byte in every pair refers to Port 1 (P17 to P10). See Figure 13.
                                                         first byte                                                     second byte

                       8.3 Reading from a port (Input mode)
                                All ports programmed as input should be set to logic 1. To read, the master
                                (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device after it receives the interrupt. By setting
                                the last bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 1 the Read mode is entered.
                                The data bytes that follow on the SDA are the values on the ports. If the data on the input
                                port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be lost.

                   8.4 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9673 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA9673 registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine will initialize to their default
                       states. Thereafter VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                   8.5 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The PCA9673 provides an open-drain interrupt (INT) which can be fed to a corresponding
                       input of the microcontroller (see Figure 15, Figure 16, and Figure 17). This gives these
                       chips a kind of master function which can initiate an action elsewhere in the system.
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs. After time t(v)D the
                       signal INT is valid.
                       The interrupt disappears when data on the port is changed to the original setting or data is
                       read from or written to the device which has generated the interrupt.
                       In the write mode, the interrupt may become deactivated (HIGH) on the rising edge of the
                       write to port pulse. On the falling edge of the write to port pulse the interrupt is definitely
                       deactivated (HIGH).
                       The interrupt is reset in the read mode on the rising edge of the read from port pulse.
                       During the resetting of the interrupt itself, any changes on the I/Os may not generate an
                       interrupt. After the interrupt is reset any change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as
                       an INT.

                       A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The
                       PCA9673 registers and I2C-bus state machine will be held in their default state until the
                       RESET input is once again HIGH.

9. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   9.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 18).

                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S).
                       A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 19).

                   9.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 20).

                   9.3 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                         acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                         whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                         LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold
                         times must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

                                          Remote 16-bit I/O expander for Fm+ I2C-bus with interrupt and reset
10. Application design-in information
                10.1 Bidirectional I/O expander applications
                     In the 8-bit I/O expander application shown in Figure 22, P00 and P01 are inputs, and P02
                     to P07 are outputs. When used in this configuration, during a write, the input (P00 and
                     P01) must be written as HIGH so the external devices fully control the input ports. The
                     desired HIGH or LOW logic levels may be written to the I/Os used as outputs (P02 to
                     P07). During a read, the logic levels of the external devices driving the input ports (P00
                     and P01) and the previous written logic level to the output ports (P02 to P07) will be read.
                     The GPIO also has an interrupt line (INT) that can be connected to the interrupt logic of
                     the microprocessor. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O informs the
                     microprocessor that there is incoming data or a change of data on its ports without having
                     to communicate via the I2C-bus.
                                                                                                                                              VDD

                10.2 High current-drive load applications
                     The GPIO has a maximum sinking current of 25 mA per bit. In applications requiring
                     additional drive, two port pins in the same octal may be connected together to sink up to
                     50 mA current. Both bits must then always be turned on or off together. Up to 8 pins (one
                     octal) can be connected together to drive 200 mA.
                                                                       VDD

                     the read operation.
                     Write operations are identical. At the completion of each 8-bit write sequence the data is
                     stored in its associated 8-bit write register at ACK or NACK. The first byte goes to P0n
                     while the second goes to P1n. Subsequent writes without a STOP wrap around to P0n
                     then P1n again. Any write will update both read registers and clear interrupts.
                     Read operations are identical. Both devices update the byte register with the pin data as
                     each 8-bit read is initiated, the very first read after an address cycle corresponds to ports
                     P0n while the second (even byte) corresponds to P1n and subsequent reads without a
                     STOP wrap around to P0n then P1n again.
                     During read operations, the PCA9673 interrupt output will be cleared in a byte-wise
                     fashion as each byte is read. Reading the first byte will clear any interrupts associated
                     with the P0n pins. This first byte read operation will have no effect on interrupts associated
                     with changes of state on the P1n pins. Interrupts associated with the P1n pins will be
                     cleared when the second byte is read. Reading the second byte has no effect on
                     interrupts associated with the changes of state on the P0x pins. The PCF8575 interrupt
                     output will clear after reading both bytes of data regardless of whether data was changed
                     in the first byte or the second byte or both bytes.

[3]   Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
[4]   A master device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to the VIL of the SCL signal) in order to
      bridge the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
[5]   The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at
      250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without
      exceeding the maximum specified tf.
[6]   Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 30) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 7 and 8

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 30.
