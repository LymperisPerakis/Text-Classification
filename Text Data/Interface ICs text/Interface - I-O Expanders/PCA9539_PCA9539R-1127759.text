1. General description
              The PCA9539; PCA9539R is a 24-pin CMOS device that provides 16 bits of General
              Purpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion with interrupt and reset for
              I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was developed to enhance the NXP Semiconductors
              family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional
              I/O is needed for ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fans, etc.
              The PCA9539; PCA9539R consists of two 8-bit configuration (input or output selection),
              input, output and polarity inversion (active HIGH or active LOW operation) registers. The
              system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O
              configuration bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding Input or
              Output register. The polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity inversion
              register. All registers can be read by the system master.
              The PCA9539; PCA9539R is identical to the PCA9555 except for the removal of the
              internal I/O pull-up resistor which greatly reduces power consumption when the I/Os are
              held LOW, replacement of A2 with RESET and a different address range.
              The PCA9539; PCA9539R open-drain interrupt output is activated when any input state
              differs from its corresponding input port register state and is used to indicate to the system
              master that an input state has changed.
              The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
              machine. In the PCA9539, the RESET pin causes the same reset/default I/O input
              configuration to occur without de-powering the device, holding the registers and I2C-bus
              state machine in their default state until the RESET input is once again HIGH. This input
              requires a pull-up to VDD. In the PCA9539R however, only the device state machine is
              initialized by the RESET pin and the internal general-purpose registers remain
              unchanged. Using the PCA9539R RESET pin will only reset the I2C-bus interface should
              it be stuck LOW to regain access to the I2C-bus. This allows the I/O pins to retain their last
              configured state so that they can keep any lines in their previously defined state and not
              cause system errors while the I2C-bus is being restored.
              Two hardware pins (A0, A1) vary the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to four devices to
              share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       [1]  HVQFN24 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must
                            be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board
                            level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad
                            on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the

                   6.3 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9539; PCA9539R
                       in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is
                       released and the PCA9539; PCA9539R registers and SMBus state machine will initialize
                       to their default states. Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                       For a power reset cycle, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V and then restored to the
                       operating voltage.
                   6.4 RESET input
                       A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). In
                       the PCA9539 the registers and SMBus/I2C-bus state machine will be held in their default
                       state until the RESET input is once again HIGH. This input typically requires a pull-up to
                       VDD. In the PCA9539R, only the device state machine is initialized. The internal
                       general-purpose registers remain unchanged. Using the PCA9539R hardware reset pin
                       will only reset the I2C-bus interface should it be stuck LOW to regain access to the
                       I2C-bus. This allows the I/O pins to retain their last configured state so that they can keep
                       any lines in their previously defined state and not cause system errors while the I2C-bus is
                       being restored.
                   6.5 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, then either Q1 or Q2 is on, depending on the state of
                       the Output port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied to an

                 6.6.1 Writing to the port registers
                       Data is transmitted to the PCA9539; PCA9539R by sending the device address and
                       setting the least significant bit to a logic 0 (see Figure 8 “PCA9539; PCA9539R device
                       address”). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will
                       receive the data following the command byte.
                       The eight registers within the PCA9539; PCA9539R are configured to operate as four
                       register pairs. The four pairs are Input ports, Output ports, Polarity inversion ports, and
                       Configuration ports. After sending data to one register, the next data byte will be sent to
                       the other register in the pair (see Figure 10 and Figure 11). For example, if the first byte is
                       sent to Output port 1 (register 3), then the next byte will be stored in Output port 0
                       (register 2). There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write
                       transmission. In this way, each 8-bit register may be updated independently of the other
                       registers.

                                                       16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus low power I/O port with interrupt and reset
                     6.6.2 Reading the port registers
                                  In order to read data from the PCA9539; PCA9539R, the bus master must first send the
                                  PCA9539; PCA9539R address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 8
                                  “PCA9539; PCA9539R device address”). The command byte is sent after the address and
                                  determines which register will be accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent
                                  again, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register
                                  defined by the command byte will then be sent by the PCA9539; PCA9539R (see
                                  Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14). Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of
                                  the acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read but
                                  the data will now reflect the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if you
                                  read Input port 1, then the next byte read would be Input port 0. There is no limitation on
                                  the number of data bytes received in one read transmission but the final byte received, the
                                  bus master must not acknowledge the data.

                                         16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus low power I/O port with interrupt and reset
                 6.6.3 Interrupt output
                       The open-drain interrupt output is activated when one of the port pins changes state and
                       the pin is configured as an input. The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to its
                       previous state or the Input port register is read (see Figure 13). A pin configured as an
                       output cannot cause an interrupt. Since each 8-bit port is read independently, the interrupt
                       caused by Port 0 will not be cleared by a read of Port 1 or the other way around.
                       Remark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input port register.
7. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   7.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 15).

                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 16).

                          A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                          device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                          the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 17).

                    7.3 Acknowledge
                          The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                          transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                          acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                          whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                          A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                          each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                          that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                          pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                          LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
                          time must be taken into account.
                          A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                          acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                          transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                          condition.

                      8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                             When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                             resistor as shown in Figure 19. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O
                             VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes lower
                             than VDD.
                             Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                             should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                             Figure 20 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 21 shows VDD less
                             than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                             at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.
                                                                                                                           3.3 V            5V

14. Handling information
                      All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                      normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                      described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                      This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                      of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                      soldering description”.
                 15.1 Introduction to soldering
                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                 15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                        • Through-hole components
                        • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                      Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                      packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                      leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                      due to an increased probability of bridging.
                      The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                      component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                      packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                      Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                        •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                        •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                        •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                        •  Package placement
                        •  Inspection and repair
                        •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                        • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                           transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are

                        • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                 15.4 Reflow soldering
                      Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                        • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                           higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 33) than a SnPb process, thus
                           reducing the process window
                        • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                           window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                        • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                           heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                           temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                           characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                           packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                           depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                           Table 18 and 19

                      Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                      times.
                      Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                      soldering, see Figure 33.
