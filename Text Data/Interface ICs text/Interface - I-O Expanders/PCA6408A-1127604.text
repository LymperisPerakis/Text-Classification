1. General description
             The PCA6408A is an 8-bit general purpose I/O expander that provides remote I/O
             expansion for most microcontroller families via the I2C-bus interface.
             NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while
             keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in battery-powered mobile
             applications for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, keypad, etc. In addition to providing
             a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of a processor running at one voltage
             level to I/O devices operating at a different (usually higher) voltage level. The PCA6408A
             has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely flexible in mixed
             signal environments where communication between incompatible I/O voltages is required.
             Its wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V on the dual power rail allows seamless
             communications with next-generation low voltage microprocessors and microcontrollers
             on the interface side (SDA/SCL) and peripherals at a higher voltage on the port side.
             There are two supply voltages for PCA6408A: VDD(I2C-bus) and VDD(P). VDD(I2C-bus)
             provides the supply voltage for the interface at the master side (for example, a
             microcontroller) and the VDD(P) provides the supply for core circuits and Port P. The
             bidirectional voltage level translation in the PCA6408A is provided through VDD(I2C-bus).
             VDD(I2C-bus) should be connected to the VDD of the external SCL/SDA lines. This indicates
             the VDD level of the I2C-bus to the PCA6408A. The voltage level on Port P of the
             PCA6408A is determined by the VDD(P).
             The PCA6408A consists of one 8-bit Configuration (input or output selection), Input,
             Output, and Polarity Inversion (active HIGH) register. At power-on, the I/Os are configured
             as inputs. However, the system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by
             writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the
             corresponding Input or Output register. The polarity of the Input port register can be
             inverted with the Polarity Inversion register, saving interrupts.
             The system master can reset the PCA6408A in the event of a time-out or other improper
             operation by asserting a LOW in the RESET input. The power-on reset puts the registers
             in their default state and initializes the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The RESET pin
             causes the same reset/initialization to occur without de-powering the part.
             The PCA6408A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
             from its corresponding Input port register state and is used to indicate to the system
             master that an input state has changed.
             INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
             signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
             on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCA6408A can
             remain a simple slave device.

                                                                         Low-voltage, 8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O expander
                   The device Port P outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while
                   consuming low device current.
                   One hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C-bus address
                   and allow up to two devices to share the same I2C-bus or SMBus.

                       ADDR is the hardware address package pin and is held to either HIGH (logic 1) or LOW
                       (logic 0) to assign one of the two possible slave addresses. The last bit of the slave
                       address defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH (logic 1) selects a
                       read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.

                          Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                          command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCA6408A. Two bits of this
                          data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers (Input, Output,
                          Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. This register is write only.

                7.4.1 Input port register (00h)
                       The Input port register (register 0) reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                       of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. The
                       Input port register is read only; writes to this register have no effect. The default value ‘X’
                       is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port register read operation is
                       performed as described in Section 8.2 “Read commands”.

                7.4.2 Output port register (01h)
                       The Output port register (register 1) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as
                       outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no effect on pins
                       defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that was written to this
                       register, not the actual pin value.

                7.4.3 Polarity inversion register (02h)
                       The Polarity inversion register (register 2) allows polarity inversion of pins defined as
                       inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in this register is set (written with ‘1’), the
                       corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a
                       ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s original polarity is retained.

                7.4.4 Configuration register (03h)
                       The Configuration register (register 3) configures the direction of the I/O pins. If a bit in this
                       register is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a high-impedance input. If a

                   7.5 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD(P) or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                                                                                Low-voltage, 8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O expander
                   7.6 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD(P), an internal power-on reset holds the
                       PCA6408A in a reset condition until VDD(P) has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCA6408A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                       initialize to their default states. After that, VDD(P) must be lowered to below VPORF and
                       back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 9.2 “Power-on reset
                       requirements”.
                   7.7 Reset input (RESET)
                       The RESET input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the VDD(P) at its
                       operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a
                       minimum of tw(rst). The PCA6408A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are
                       changed to their default state once RESET is LOW (0). When RESET is HIGH (1), the I/O
                       levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input requires a
                       pull-up resistor to VDD(I2C-bus) if no active connection is used.
                   7.8 Interrupt output (INT)
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when
                       data on the port is changed to the original setting or when data is read from the port that
                       generated the interrupt (see Figure 11). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the
                       acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL
                       signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very
                       short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after
                       resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires a pull-up resistor to VDD(P) or
                       VDD(I2C-bus) depending on the application. INT should be connected to the voltage source
                       of the device that requires the interrupt information.

8. Bus transactions
                                 The PCA6408A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                                 PCA6408A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                                 lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                                 connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                                 of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                      8.1 Write commands
                                 Data is transmitted to the PCA6408A by sending the device address and setting the Least
                                 Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 5 for device address). The command byte is
                                 sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows the
                                 command byte. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write
                                 transmission.

                         8.2 Read commands
                                    To read data from the PCA6408A, the bus master must first send the PCA6408A address
                                    with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 5 for device address). The
                                    command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is to be accessed.
                                    After a restart the device address is sent again, but this time the LSB is set to a logic 1.
                                    Data from the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the PCA6408A (see
                                    Figure 10 and Figure 11).
                                    Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no
                                    limit on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte
                                    received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

               Transfer of data can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge
               phase is valid (output mode). It is assumed that the command byte has previously been programmed with 00h (read Input port
               register).
               This figure eliminates the command byte transfer, a restart, and slave address call between the initial slave address call and
               actual data transfer from P port (see Figure 10).

                                   Device address configured as 0100 000x for this example.
                                   P0 and P2 through P4 are configured as inputs.

                               (1) Resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. If a driver to an input will never let the
                                   input float, a resistor is not needed. Outputs (in the P port) do not need pull-up resistors.

                   9.1 Minimizing IDD when I/Os control LEDs
                       When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, normally they are connected to VDD(P) through a
                       resistor as shown in Figure 12. The LED acts as a diode, so when the LED is off, the I/O
                       VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD(P). The IDD parameter in Table 15 “Static characteristics”
                       shows how IDD(P) increases as VI becomes lower than VDD(P). Designs that must minimize
                       current consumption, such as battery power applications, should consider maintaining the
                       I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD(P) when the LED is off.
                       Figure 13 shows a high-value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 14 shows VDD(P)
                       less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O
                       VI at or above VDD(P) and prevent additional supply current consumption when the LED
                       is off.

                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCA6408A can be reset to its default conditions
                       by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a
                       power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is
                       powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

                                Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this
                                device. The glitch width (tw(gl)VDD) and glitch height (VDD(gl)) are dependent on each
                                other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and device impedance are factors that
                                affect power-on reset performance. Figure 17 and Table 11 provide more information on
                                how to measure these specifications.

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD(P) being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 18 and Table 11 provide more details on this specification.

17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                17.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 33) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 19 and 20
