 24-bit remote I/O pins that default to inputs at power-up       expansion for most microcontroller families via the two-line
                                                                  bidirectional bus (I2C-bus) and is a part of the Fast-mode Plus
 1MHz I2C-bus interface
                                                                  family.
 Compliant with the I2C-bus Fast and Standard modes              The PI4IOE5V96224 supports high I2C-bus drive (25 mA) so
 5.0V tolerant I/Os                                              that many more devices can be on the bus without the need
 SDA with 30 mA sink capability for 4000 pF buses                for bus buffers, high total package sink capacity (600 mA) that
 Latched outputs with 25 mA sink capability for directly         supports having all 25 mA LEDs on at the same time and more
    driving LEDs                                                  device addresses (64) are available to allow many more devices
                                                                  on the bus without address conflicts.
 Total package sink capability of 600 mA
                                                                  The device consists of a 24-bit quasi-bidirectional port and an
 Active LOW open-drain interrupt output                          I2C-bus interface. The PI4IOE5V96224 has a low current
 Low standby current                                             consumption and includes latched outputs with high current
 64 programmable slave addresses using 3 address pins            drive capability for directly driving LEDs.
                                                                  It also possesses an interrupt line (INT) which can be
 ESD protection (4KV HBM and 1KV CDM)
                                                                  connected to the interrupt logic of the microcontroller. By
 Latch-up tested (exceeds 100mA)                                 sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O can
 Offered in TQFN-32 3mm x 6mm ( ZL32 ) package                   inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data on its
                                                                  ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. The
                                                                  internal Power-On Reset (POR) or software reset sequence
                                                                  initializes the I/Os as inputs.

Note:
[1]:VCC must be lowered to 0.2 V for at least 20us in order to reset part.
[2]:Each I/O must be externally limited to a maximum of 25 mA and the total package limited to 600 mA due to internal busing limits.
[3]: The value is not tested, but verified on sampling basis.

Details Description
    a.   Device address
Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is accessing and the operation it wants to
perform (read or write). The address of the PI4IOE5V96224 is shown in below. Slave address pins AD2, AD1, and AD0 choose 1 of
64 slave addresses. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on AD2, AD1, and AD0. Address values
depending on AD2, AD1, and AD0 can be found in Table 4 “PI4IOE5V96224 address map”.
    PI4IOE5V96224 Address

The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a
write operation.

                                                                                                               PI4IOE5V96224
Quasi-bidirectional I/O Architecture
The PI4IOE5V96224’s 24 ports (see Figure 3) are entirely independent and can be used either as input or output ports. Input data
is transferred from the ports to the microcontroller in the Read mode. Output data is transmitted to the ports in the Write mode.
Every data transmission from the PI4IOE5V96224 must consist of a multiple of three bytes, the first byte will be referred to as
IO1_7 to IO1_0, and the second byte as IO2_7 to IO2_0. The third will be referred to as P2_7 to IO_0.
This quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control signal for data directions. At power-on
the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode only a current source (IOH) to VCC is active. An additional strong pull-up to VCC (Itrt(pu))
allows fast rising edges into heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH, and are switched off
by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being used as inputs. After power-on, as all the I/Os are set HIGH,
all of them can be used as inputs. Any change in setting of the I/Os as either inputs or outputs can be done with the write mode.
Remark: If a HIGH is applied to an I/O which has been written earlier to LOW, a large current (IOL) will flow to GND.

Writing to the Port (Output mode)
To write, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device. By setting the last bit of the byte containing the slave address
to logic 0 the Write mode is entered. The PI4IOE5V96224 acknowledges and the master sends the first data byte for IO0_7 to
IO0_0. After the first data byte is acknowledged by the PI4IOE5V96224, the second data byte IO1_7 to IO1_0 is sent by the master.
After the second data byte is acknowledged by the PI4IOE5V96224, the three data byte IO2_7 to IO2_0 is sent by the master. Once
again, the PI4IOE5V96224 acknowledges the receipt of the data. Each 8-bit data is presented on the port lines after it has been
acknowledged by the PI4IOE5V96224.
The number of data bytes that can be sent successively is not limited. After every three bytes, the previous data is overwritten.
                                                                                                                                       …

Reading from a Port (Input Mode)
All ports programmed as input should be set to logic 1. To read, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device after it
receives the interrupt. By setting the last bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 1 the Read mode is entered.
The data bytes that follow on the SDA are the values on the ports.
If the data on the input port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be lost. Transfer of data can be stopped at any
moment by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge phase is valid.
                                                         Fig 5.Read input port register
Power-On Reset
When power is applied to VCC, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PI4IOE5V96224 in a reset condition until VCC has
reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PI4IOE5V96224 registers and I2C-bus state machine will
initialize to their default states. Thereafter VCC must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
Interrupt Output (INT)
The PI4IOE5V96224 provides an open-drain interrupt (INT) which can be fed to a corresponding input of the microcontroller.
This gives these chips a kind of master function which can initiate an action elsewhere in the system.
An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs. After time t(V)D the signal INT is valid.
The interrupt disappears when data on the port is changed to the original setting or data is read from or written to the device
which has generated the interrupt.
In the write mode, the interrupt may become deactivated (HIGH) on the rising edge of the write to port pulse. On the falling edge
of the write to port pulse the interrupt is definitely deactivated (HIGH).
The interrupt is reset in the read mode on the rising edge of the read from port pulse.
During the resetting of the interrupt itself, any changes on the I/Os may not generate an interrupt. After the interrupt is reset any
change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as an INT.
 RESET Input
A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The PI4IOE5V96224 registers and I2C-bus
state machine will be held in their default state until the RESET input is once again HIGH.
