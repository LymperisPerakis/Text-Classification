1. General description
              The PCA9557 is a silicon CMOS circuit which provides parallel input/output expansion for
              SMBus and I2C-bus applications. The PCA9557 consists of an 8-bit input port register,
              8-bit output port register, and an I2C-bus/SMBus interface. It has low current consumption
              and a high-impedance open-drain output pin, IO0.
              The system master can enable the PCA9557’s I/O as either input or output by writing to
              the configuration register. The system master can also invert the PCA9557 inputs by
              writing to the active HIGH polarity inversion register. Finally, the system master can reset
              the PCA9557 in the event of a time-out by asserting a LOW in the reset input.
              The power-on reset puts the registers in their default state and initializes the
              I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The RESET pin causes the same reset/initialization to
              occur without de-powering the part.

7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9557”.
                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition the bus master must output the address of the slave it is
                       accessing. The address of the PCA9557 is shown in Figure 8. To conserve power, no
                       internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins and
                       they must be pulled HIGH or LOW.
                                                                                       slave address
                                                                         0     0        1       1       A2     A1     A0 R/W
                                                                                fixed                  programmable
                                                                                                                      002aad279
                         Fig 8.   PCA9557 device address
                       The last bit of the slave address defines the operation to be performed. When set to
                       logic 1 a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.
                   7.2 Control register
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address, the bus master will send
                       a byte to the PCA9557, which will be stored in the control register. This register can be
                       written and read via the I2C-bus.

                   7.3 Register descriptions
                7.3.1 Register 0 - Input port register
                       This register is a read-only port. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                       of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. Writes
                       to this register have no effect.

                7.3.2 Register 1 - Output port register
                       This register reflects the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as outputs by the
                       Configuration register. Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined as inputs.
                       In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that is in the flip-flop controlling the output
                       selection, not the actual pin value.

                7.3.3 Register 2 - Polarity inversion register
                       This register enables polarity inversion of pins defined as inputs by the Configuration
                       register. If a bit in this register is set (written with logic 1), the corresponding port pin’s
                       polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with logic 0), the
                       corresponding port pin’s original polarity is retained.

                7.3.4 Register 3 - Configuration register
                       This register configures the directions of the I/O pins. If a bit in this register is set, the
                       corresponding port pin is enabled as an input with high-impedance output driver. If a bit in
                       this register is cleared, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an output.

                                                                                                  8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus I/O port with reset
                   7.4 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9557 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA9557 registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine will initialize to their default
                       states. Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                   7.5 RESET input
                       A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The
                       PCA9557 registers and SMBus/I2C-bus state machine will be held in their default state
                       until the RESET input is once again HIGH. This input requires a pull-up resistor to VDD if
                       no active connection is used.
8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 10).

                8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 11).

                   8.2 System configuration
                         A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                         device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                         the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 12).

  Fig 12. System configuration
                   8.3 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                         acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                         whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable

                         times must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

                      9.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                             When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                             resistor as shown in Figure 18. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the
                             I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes
                             lower than VDD.
                             Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                             should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                             Figure 19 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 20 shows VDD less
                             than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                             at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.

14. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 26) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 12 and 13

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 26.
