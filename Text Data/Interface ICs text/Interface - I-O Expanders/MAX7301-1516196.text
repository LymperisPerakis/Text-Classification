General Description                                             Benefits and Features
The MAX7301 compact, serial-interfaced I/O expander             ●● Industry-Standard 4-Wire Interface Simplifies
(or general-purpose I/O (GPIO) peripheral) provides                Expansion of I/O Ports to Up to 28 I/Os Independent
microprocessors with up to 28 ports. Each port is individu-        of Microprocessor Architecture
ally user configurable to either a logic input or logic output.    • High-Speed, 26MHz, SPI-/QSPI™-/MICROWIRE®-
Each port can be configured either as a push-pull logic               Compatible Serial Interface
output capable of sinking 10mA and sourcing 4.5mA, or              • 2.25V to 5.5V Operation
a Schmitt logic input with optional internal pullup. Seven         • 20 or 28 I/O Ports Configurable as Push-Pull Logic
ports feature configurable transition detection logic, which          Output, Schmitt Logic Input or Schmitt Logic Input
generates an interrupt upon change of port logic level.               with Internal Pullup
The MAX7301 is controlled through an SPI-compatible                • Logic Transition Detection for Seven I/O Ports
4-wire serial interface.                                        ●● Low Power Consumption Reduces Power-Supply
The MAX7301AAX and MAX7301ATL have 28 ports and                    Requirements
are available in 36-pin SSOP and 40-pin TQFN packages,             • 11μA (max) Shutdown Current
respectively. The MAX7301AAI has 20 ports and is avail-
able in a 28-pin SSOP package.                                  Typical Operating Circuit
