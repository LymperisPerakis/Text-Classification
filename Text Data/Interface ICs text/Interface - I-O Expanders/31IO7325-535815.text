                                                                                                                   January 2014
GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                                     FEATURES
The IS31IO7325 2-wire serial-interfaced peripheral                            400kHz I2C serial interface
features 16 I/O ports. Ports are divided into eight push                      2.4V to 5.5V operation
pull I/Os and eight open-drain I/Os and transition                            8 push-pull I/O ports
detection.                                                                    8 open-drain I/O ports, rated to 20mA sink current
Any of the 16 I/O ports can be configured as an input                          at 0.22V headroom
or an output. All I/O ports configured as inputs are                          Selectable I/O port power-up default logic states
continuously monitored for state changes (transition                          INTB output alerts change on inputs
detection). State changes are indicated by the INTB                           Low 0.3μA (Typ.) standby current
output. The interrupt is latched, allowing detection of                       -40°C ~ +125°C temperature range
transient changes. When the IS31IO7325 is
subsequently read through the serial interface, any
pending interrupt is cleared.                                           APPLICATIONS
The open-drain outputs are rated to sink 20mA at                              Cell phones
0.22V headroom, and are capable of driving LEDs.                              Notebooks
The RSTB input clears the serial interface, terminating
                                                                              SAN/NAS
any I2C communication to or from the IS31IO7325. The
IS31IO7325 uses two address inputs to allow 4 I2C                             Satellite radio
slave addresses. The slave address also determines                            Servers
the power-up logic state for the I/O ports.                                   Automotive

Note:
VBattery: 2.4V~5.5V, 2.8V is recommended.
VDD: 1.4V~5.5V, VDD ≤ VBattery, 2.8V is recommended.
VDD should be turned off when system power off because OD ports are open default.
VDD = VBattery is forbidden.
