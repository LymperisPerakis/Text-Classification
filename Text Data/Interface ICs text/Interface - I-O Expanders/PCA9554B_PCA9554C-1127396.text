                 Rev. 2 — 4 August 2015                                             Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCA9554B and PCA9554C are low-voltage 8-bit General Purpose Input/Output
             (GPIO) expanders with interrupt and weak pull-up resistors for I2C-bus/SMBus
             applications. The only difference between the PCA9554B and PCA9554C is their I2C fixed
             address allowing a larger number of the same device on the I2C-bus with no chance of
             address conflict. NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are
             needed while keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in ACPI power
             switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fan control, etc.
             In addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, the wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V allow
             the PCA9554B/PCA9554C to interface with next-generation microprocessors and
             microcontrollers where supply levels are dropping down to conserve power.
             The PCA9554B/PCA9554C contain a register set of 8-bit Configuration, Input, Output,
             and Polarity Inversion registers.
             The PCA9554B is a pin-to-pin replacement for the PCA9554, while the PCA9554C
             replaces the PCA9554A. Both of these devices replace other industry-standard part
             numbers. More fully-featured parts PCAL9554B and PCAL9554C are also available with
             Agile I/O features. See the respective data sheet for more details.
             The PCA9554B/PCA9554C open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input
             state differs from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the
             system master that an input state has changed.
             INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
             signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
             on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the
             PCA9554B/PCA9554C can remain a simple slave device.
             The device outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while consuming
             low device current.
             The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
             machine.
             All input/output pins have weak pull-up resistors connected to them to eliminate external
             components.
             Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) select the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
             devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The PCA9554B and PCA9554C differ only in
             their base I2C-bus addresses permitting a total of 16 devices on the I2C-bus, minimizing
             the chance for address conflict, even in the most complex system.

                         [2]   HVQFN16 package die supply ground is connected to both the VSS pin and the exposed center pad. The
                               VSS pin must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical,
                               and board-level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding
                               thermal pad on the board, and for proper heat conduction through the board thermal vias need to be
                               incorporated in the printed-circuit board in the thermal pad region.

                            A2, A1 and A0 are the hardware address package pins and are held to either HIGH
                            (logic 1) or LOW (logic 0) to assign one of the eight possible slave addresses. The last bit
                            of the slave address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH
                            (logic 1) selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.
                     6.2 Pointer register and command byte
                            Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                            command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCA9554B/PCA9554C. The
                            lower two bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers
                            (Input, Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. This register is
                            write only.

                  6.4.1 Input port register (00h)
                        The Input port register (register 0) reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                        of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. The
                        Input port register is read only; writes to this register have no effect. The default value ‘X’
                        is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port register read operation is
                        performed as described in Section 7.2 “Read commands”.

                  6.4.2 Output port register (01h)
                        The Output port register (register 1) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as
                        outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no effect on pins
                        defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that was written to this
                        register, not the actual pin value.

                  6.4.3 Polarity inversion register (02h)
                        The Polarity inversion register (register 2) allows polarity inversion of pins defined as
                        inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in this register is set (written with ‘1’), the
                        corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a
                        ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s original polarity is retained.

                                   The Configuration register (register 3) configures the direction of the I/O pins. If a bit in this
                                   register is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a high-impedance input. If a
                                   bit in this register is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an output.

                         6.5 I/O port
                                   When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                                   high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                                   If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                                   Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                                   either VDD or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                                   recommended levels for proper operation.

                       reset condition is released and the PCA9554B/PCA9554C registers and I2C-bus/SMBus
                       state machine initialize to their default states. After that, VDD must be lowered to below
                       VPORF and back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 8.2
                       “Power-on reset requirements”.
                   6.7 Interrupt output (INT)
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when
                       data on the port is changed to the original setting or when data is read from the port that
                       generated the interrupt (see Figure 10). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the
                       acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL
                       signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very
                       short) due to the reset of the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after
                       resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires a pull-up resistor to VDD. INT
                       should be connected to the voltage source of the device that requires the interrupt
                       information. When using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt
                       is reset only when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs
                       in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the
                       rising edge of the SCL signal.

                                                                                               Low-voltage 8-bit I2C-bus/SMBus low power I/O port
7. Bus transactions
                                    The PCA9554B/PCA9554C is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the
                                    master and PCA9554B/PCA9554C through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The
                                    two communication lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both
                                    lines must be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the
                                    output stages of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                         7.1 Write commands
                                    Data is transmitted to the PCA9554B/PCA9554C by sending the device address and
                                    setting the Least Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 for device address). The
                                    command byte is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data
                                    that follows the command byte. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in
                                    one write transmission.

                         7.2 Read commands
                                    To read data from the PCA9554B/PCA9554C, the bus master must first send the
                                    PCA9554B/PCA9554C address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 4
                                    for device address). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which
                                    register is to be accessed.
                                    After a restart the device address is sent again, but this time the LSB is set to a logic 1.
                                    Data from the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the
                                    PCA9554B/PCA9554C (see Figure 9 and Figure 10).
                                    Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no
                                    limit on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte
                                    received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

               Transfer of data can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge
               phase is valid (output mode). It is assumed that the command byte has previously been programmed with 00h (read Input port
               register).
               This figure eliminates the command byte transfer, a restart, and slave address call between the initial slave address call and
               actual data transfer from P port (see Figure 9).

  Fig 11. Typical application
                       8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                              When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                              resistor as shown in Figure 11. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the
                              I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes
                              lower than VDD.
                              Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                              should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                              Figure 12 and Figure 13 show typical solutions to minimizing current consumption.
                              Figure 12 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 13 shows VDD less
                              than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. However, the PCA9554B/PCA9554C needs
                              no external resistors due to the integrated 100 k pull-up resistors.

                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCA9554B/PCA9554C can be reset to its
                       default conditions by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the
                       device go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the
                       device is powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15.

                                Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this
                                device. The glitch width (tw(gl)VDD) and glitch height (VDD(gl)) are dependent on each

                                how to measure these specifications.

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 17 and Table 10 provide more details on this specification.

                   8.3 Device current consumption with internal pull-up resistors
                       The PCA9554B/PCA9554C integrates pull-up resistors to eliminate external components
                       when pins are configured as inputs and pull-up resistors are required (for example,
                       nothing is driving the inputs to the power supply rails). Since these pull-up resistors are
                       internal to the device itself, they contribute to the current consumption of the device and
                       must be considered in the overall system design.
                       The internal pull-up resistor is connected to VDD, a current will flow from the VDD pin
                       through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will appear as
                       additional IDD upsetting any current consumption measurements.
                       The pull-up resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with voltage. The
                       resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 k with a nominal 100 k value.
                       Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins held LOW and
                       the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 21 for a graph of supply current
                       versus the number of pull-up resistors.

                       All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                       normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                       described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                       This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                       of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                       soldering description”.
                  17.1 Introduction to soldering
                       Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                       Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                       the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                       ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                       Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                       suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                       densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                  17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                       Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                       a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                         • Through-hole components
                         • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                       Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                       packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                       leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                       due to an increased probability of bridging.
                       The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                       component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                       packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                       Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                         •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                         •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                         •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                         •  Package placement
                         •  Inspection and repair
                         •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                         • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                            transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                            exposed to the wave
                         • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                  17.4 Reflow soldering
                       Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                         • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                            higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 31) than a SnPb process, thus
                            reducing the process window
                         • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                            window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                         • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                            heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                            temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                            characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                            packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                            depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                            Table 17 and 18

                       Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all

                       Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                       soldering, see Figure 31.
