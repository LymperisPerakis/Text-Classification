GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                      FEATURES
The XRA1404 is an 8-bit GPIO expander with an SPI        • 1.65V to 3.6V operating voltage
interface. After power-up, the XRA1404 has internal      • Integrated level shifters
100K ohm pull-up resistors on each I/O pin that can
be individually enabled.                                 • 8 General Purpose I/Os (GPIOs)
In addition, the GPIOs on the XRA1404 can                • 5V tolerant inputs
individually be controlled and configured. As outputs,   • Maximum stand-by current of 1uA at +1.8V
the GPIOs can be outputs that are high, low or in
three-state mode. The three-state mode feature is        • SPI bus interface
useful for applications where the power is removed            ■ SPI Clock Frequency up to 26MHz
from the remote devices, but they may still be
connected to the GPIO expander.                          • Individually programmable inputs
                                                              ■ Internal pull-up resistors
As inputs, the internal pull-up resistors can be
enabled or disabled and the input polarity can be             ■ Polarity inversion
inverted. The interrupt can be programmed for                 ■ Individual interrupt enable

                                       PCB. The center pad is recommended to be solder masked defined with open-
                                       ing size less than or equal to the exposed thermal pad on the package bottom to
                                       prevent solder bridging to the outer leads of the device. Thermal vias must be
                                       connected to GND plane as the thermal pad of package is at GND potential.

 1.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
 1.1     SPI bus Interface
The SPI interface consists of four lines: serial clock (SCL), chip select (CS#), slave output (SO) and slave input
(SI). The serial clock, slave output and slave input can be as fast as 26 MHz. To access the device in the SPI
mode, the CS# signal is asserted by the SPI master, then the SPI master starts toggling the SCL signal with
the appropriate transaction information. The first bit sent by the SPI master includes whether it is a read or
write transaction and the register being accessed. See Table 1 below.

After the last read or write transaction, the SPI master will set the SCL signal back to its idle state (LOW).

 1.1.1      SPI Command Byte
An SPI command byte is sent by the SPI master following the slave address. The command byte indicates the
address offset of the register that will be accessed. Table 2 below lists the command bytes for each register.

8-BIT SPI GPIO EXPANDER WITH INTEGRATED LEVEL SHIFTERS                                                       REV. 1.0.0
 2.0 REGISTER DESCRIPTION
 2.1      GPIO State Register (GSR) - Read-Only
The status of P7 - P0 can be read via this register. A read will show the current state of these pins (or the
inverted state of these pins if enabled via the PIR Register). Reading this register will clear an input interrupt
(see Table 3 for complete details). Reading this register will also return the last value written to the OCR
register for any pins that are configured as outputs (ie. this is not the same as the state of the actual output pin
since the output pin can be in three-state mode). A write to this register has no effect. The MSB of this register
corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.2      Output Control Register (OCR) - Read/Write
When P7 - P0 are defined as outputs, they can be controlled by writing to this register. Reading this register
will return the last value written to it, however, this value may not be the actual state of the output pin since
these pins can be in three-state mode. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this
register corresponds with P0.
 2.3      Input Polarity Inversion Register (PIR) - Read/Write
When P7 - P0 are defined as inputs, this register inverts the polarity of the input value read from the Input Port
Register. If the corresponding bit in this register is set to ’1’, the value of this bit in the GSR Register will be the
inverted value of the input pin. If the corresponding bit in this register is set to ’0’, the value of this bit in the
GSR Register will be the actual value of the input pin. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the
LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.4      GPIO Configuration Register (GCR) - Read/Write
This register configures the GPIOs as inputs or outputs. After power-up and reset, the GPIOs are inputs.
Setting these bits to ’0’ will enable the GPIOs as outputs. Setting these bits to ’1’ will enable the GPIOs as
inputs. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.5      Input Internal Pull-up Enable/Disable Register (PUR) - Read/Write
This register enables/disables the internal pull-up resistors for an input. After power-up and reset, the internal
pull-up resistors are disabled for the XRA1404. Writing a ’1’ to these bits will enable the internal pull-up
resistors. Writing a ’0’ to these bits will disable the internal pull-up resistors. The MSB of this register
corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.6      Input Interrupt Enable Register (IER) - Read/Write
This register enables/disables the interrupts for an input. After power-up and reset, the interrupts are disabled.
Writing a ’1’ to these bits will enable the interrupt for the corresponding input pins. See Table 3 for complete
details of the interrupt behavior for various register settings. No interrupts are generated for outputs when GCR
bit is 0. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.7      Output Three-State Control Register (TSCR) - Read/Write
This register can enable/disable the three-state mode of an output. Writing a ’1’ to these bits will enable the
three-state mode for the corresponding output pins. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the LSB
of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.8      Input Interrupt Status Register (ISR) - Read-Only
This register reports the input pins that have generated an interrupt. See Table 3 for complete details of the
interrupt behavior for various register settings. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the LSB of
this register corresponds with P0.

 2.9      Input Rising Edge Interrupt Enable Register (REIR) - Read/Write
Writing a ’1’ to these bits will enable the corresponding input to generate an interrupt on the rising edge. See
Table 3 for complete details of the interrupt behavior for various register settings. The MSB of this register
corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.10     Input Falling Edge Interrupt Enable Register (FEIR) - Read/Write
Writing a ’1’ to these bits will enable the corresponding input to generate an interrupt on the falling edge.
Writing a ’1’ to these bits will make that input generate an interrupt on the rising edge only. See Table 3 for
complete details of the interrupt behavior for various register settings. The MSB of this register corresponds
with P7 and the LSB of this register corresponds with P0.
 2.11     Input Filter Enable Register (IFR) - Read/Write
By default, the input filters are enabled (IFR = 0xFF). When the input filters are enabled, any pulse that is
greater than 1075ns will generate an interrupt (if enabled). Pulses that are less than 225ns will be filtered and
will not generate an interrupt. Pulses in between this range may or may not generate an interrupt. Writing a ’0’
to these bits will disable the input filter for the corresponding inputs. With the input filters disabled, any change
on the inputs will generate an interrupt (if enabled). See Table 3 for complete details of the interrupt behavior
for various register settings. The MSB of this register corresponds with P7 and the LSB of this register
corresponds with P0.
