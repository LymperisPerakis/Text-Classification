PI4IOE5V9538
8-bit I2C-bus and SMBus low power I/O port with interrupt and reset
The PI4IOE5V9538 provides 8 bits of General Purpose parallel        Features
Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/ SMBus applications.
It includes the features such as higher driving capability, 5V      ÎÎOperation power supply voltage from 2.3V to 5.5V
tolerance, lower power supply, individual I/O configuration, and    ÎÎ8-bit I2C-bus GPIO with interrupt and reset
smaller packaging. It provides a simple solution when additional
                                                                    ÎÎ5V tolerant I/Os
I/O is needed for ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons,
LEDs, fans, etc.                                                    ÎÎActive Low interrupt output
                                                                    ÎÎActive Low reset input
The PI4IOE5V9538 consists of an 8-bit register to configure
the I/Os as either inputs or outputs, and two 8-bit polarity        ÎÎPolarity inversion register
registers to change the polarity of the input port register data.   ÎÎLow current consumption
The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding      ÎÎ0Hz to 400KHz clock frequency
Input port or Output port register. All registers can be read by
                                                                    ÎÎNoise filter on SCL/SDA inputs
the system master.
                                                                    ÎÎPower-on reset
The PI4IOE5V9538 open-drain interrupt output (INT) is activated
                                                                    ÎÎESD protection (4KV HBM and 1KV CDM)
when any input state and is used to indicate the system master
that an input state has changed.                                    ÎÎOffered in three different packages:
The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and     - SOIC-16, TSSOP-16, TQFN 4x4-16
initializes the device state machine. The Reset pin causes the
same reset/initialization to occur without de-powering the device.
Two hardware pins (A0 and A1) vary the fixed I2C-bus address
and allow up to four devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.
