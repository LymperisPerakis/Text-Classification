                           Low Voltage 16-Bit I2C-bus I/O Expander
 Features                                                   Brief Description
• I2C to 16-bit I/O ports expander                        KTS1621 is a 16-bit general-purpose I/O expander via the
• 1MHz Fast-mode Plus I2C bus                             I2C bus for microcontrollers when additional I/Os are
• Operating voltage range of 1.65V to 5.5V for            needed while keeping interconnections to the minimum.
  both I2C bus and I/O ports                              KTS1621 has separate power rails (VDD_I2C and VDD_P)
• Four adjustable I2C slave addresses via ADDR            for I2C bus and I/O ports, both ranging from 1.65V to 5.5V,
• I2C multiple-register group programming with            allowing mixed power system where I2C bus power is not
  global loop or local loop                               compatible with I/O port power.

• Active low reset input (RESET
• Active low open-drain interrupt output (INT̅̅̅̅̅)       KTS1621 meets the I2C Fast-mode Plus spec up to 1MHz.
• Internal power-on reset and I2C software reset          External reset input, internal power-on reset and I2C
• Noise filter on SCL/SDA inputs                          software reset provide flexible ways to reset the IC. Four
                                                          adjustable I2C slave addresses allow multiple KTS1621s in
• Input/Output port configurable
                                                          one I2C bus system.
• Input with polarity/latch/pull-up/pull-down/
  interrupt functions                                     KTS1621 provides multiple ways to program the 16-bit I/O
• Allowing port input voltage above supply                ports. When the port works as input, it can program the
• Interrupt with trigger/mask/clear/status features       polarity, latch, pull-up, pull-down and interrupt functions.
• Programmable input debounce enable/time                 The interrupt function includes the level/edge trigger,
• Output with bank/pin selectable push-pull or            mask, clear, status features. For system with noisy input,
  open-drain                                              KTS1621 also provides debounce function with
• Bit-wise programmable output drive strength             programmable debounce time. When the port works as
• Low standby current of 4µA typical at 3.3V              output, it can program output stage with bank/pin
• Maximum 25mA driving capability for each port           selectable push-pull or open-drain options, it can also
                                                          program four drive strengths of the output stage to optimize
