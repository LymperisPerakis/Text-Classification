1. General description
             The PCAL6416A is a 16-bit general-purpose I/O expander that provides remote I/O
             expansion for most microcontroller families via the I2C-bus interface.
             NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while
             keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in battery-powered mobile
             applications for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, keypad, etc. In addition to providing
             a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of a processor running at one voltage
             level to I/O devices operating at a different (usually higher) voltage level. The PCAL6416A
             has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely flexible in mixed
             signal environments where communication between incompatible I/O voltages is required.
             Its wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V on the dual power rail allows seamless
             communications with next-generation low voltage microprocessors and microcontrollers
             on the interface side (SDA/SCL) and peripherals at a higher voltage on the port side.
             There are two supply voltages for PCAL6416A: VDD(I2C-bus) and VDD(P). VDD(I2C-bus)
             provides the supply voltage for the interface at the master side (for example, a
             microcontroller) and the VDD(P) provides the supply for core circuits and Port P. The
             bidirectional voltage level translation in the PCAL6416A is provided through VDD(I2C-bus).
             VDD(I2C-bus) should be connected to the VDD of the external SCL/SDA lines. This indicates
             the VDD level of the I2C-bus to the PCAL6416A, while the voltage level on Port P of the
             PCAL6416A is determined by the VDD(P).
             The PCAL6416A contains the PCA6416A register set of four pairs of 8-bit Configuration,
             Input, Output, and Polarity Inversion registers and additionally, the PCAL6416A has
             Agile I/O, which are additional features specifically designed to enhance the I/O. These
             additional features are: programmable output drive strength, latchable inputs,
             programmable pull-up/pull-down resistors, maskable interrupt, interrupt status register,
             programmable open-drain or push-pull outputs. The PCAL6416A is a pin-to-pin
             replacement to the PCA6416A, however, the PCAL6416A powers up with all I/O interrupts
             masked. This mask default allows for a board bring-up free of spurious interrupts at
             power-up.
             At power-on, the I/Os are configured as inputs. However, the system master can enable
             the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for
             each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of
             the Input Port register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register, saving external
             logic gates. Programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors eliminate the need for discrete
             components.

                                                           Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   The system master can reset the PCAL6416A in the event of a time-out or other improper
                   operation by asserting a LOW in the RESET input. The power-on reset puts the registers
                   in their default state and initializes the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The RESET pin
                   causes the same reset/initialization to occur without depowering the part.
                   The PCAL6416A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
                   from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system
                   master that an input state has changed.
                   INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
                   signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
                   on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCAL6416A can
                   remain a simple slave device. The input latch feature holds or latches the input pin state
                   and keeps the logic values that created the interrupt until the master can service the
                   interrupt. This minimizes the host’s interrupt service response for fast moving inputs.
                   The device Port P outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while
                   consuming low device current.
                   One hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C-bus address
                   and allow up to two devices to share the same I2C-bus or SMBus.

                       ADDR is the hardware address package pin and is held to either HIGH (logic 1) or LOW
                       (logic 0) to assign one of the two possible slave addresses. The last bit of the slave
                       address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH (logic 1)
                       selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.

                   7.3 Pointer register and command byte
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                       command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCAL6416A. The lower three
                       bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers (Input,
                       Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. Bit 6 in conjunction with
                       the lower three bits of the Command byte are used to point to the extended features of the
                       device (Agile IO). This register is write only.
                                                                        B7     B6      B5      B4       B3     B2     B1    B0

                7.4.1 Input port register pair (00h, 01h)
                       The Input port registers (registers 0 and 1) reflect the incoming logic levels of the pins,
                       regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration
                       register. The Input port registers are read only; writes to these registers have no effect.
                       The default value ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port
                       register read operation is performed as described in Section 8.2.

                7.4.2 Output port register pair (02h, 03h)
                       The Output port registers (registers 2 and 3) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins
                       defined as outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no
                       effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from these registers reflect the value that
                       was written to these registers, not the actual pin value. A register pair write operation is
                       described in Section 8.1. A register pair read operation is described in Section 8.2.

                      The Polarity inversion registers (registers 4 and 5) allow polarity inversion of pins defined
                      as inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in these registers is set (written with ‘1’), the
                      corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted in the input register. If a bit in this register is
                      cleared (written with a ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s polarity is retained. A register pair
                      write operation is described in Section 8.1. A register pair read operation is described in
                      Section 8.2.

                      high-impedance input. If a bit in these registers is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin
                      is enabled as an output. A register pair write operation is described in Section 8.1. A

                      The Output drive strength registers control the output drive level of the GPIO. Each GPIO
                      can be configured independently to a certain output current level by two register control
                      bits. For example Port 0.7 is controlled by register 41 CC0.7 (bits [7:6]), Port 0.6 is
                      controlled by register 41 CC0.6 (bits [5:4]). The output drive level of the GPIO is
                      programmed 00b = 0.25, 01b = 0.5, 10b = 0.75 or 11b = 1 of the drive capability of
                      the I/O. See Section 9.2 “Output drive strength control” for more details. A register pair
                      write operation is described in Section 8.1. A register pair read operation is described in
                      Section 8.2.

                7.4.6 Input latch register pair (44h, 45h)
                      The input latch registers (registers 44 and 45) enable and disable the input latch of the I/O
                      pins. These registers are effective only when the pin is configured as an input port. When
                      an input latch register bit is 0, the corresponding input pin state is not latched. A state
                      change in the corresponding input pin generates an interrupt. A read of the input register
                      clears the interrupt. If the input goes back to its initial logic state before the input port
                      register is read, then the interrupt is cleared.
                      When an input latch register bit is 1, the corresponding input pin state is latched. A change
                      of state of the input generates an interrupt and the input logic value is loaded into the
                      corresponding bit of the input port register (registers 0 and 1). A read of the input port
                      register clears the interrupt. If the input pin returns to its initial logic state before the input
                      port register is read, then the interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of the input
                      port register keeps the logic value that initiated the interrupt. See Figure 18.
                      For example, if the P0_4 input was as logic 0 and the input goes to logic 1 then back to
                      logic 0, the input port 0 register will capture this change and an interrupt is generated (if
                      unmasked). When the read is performed on the input port 0 register, the interrupt is

                      cleared, assuming there were no additional input(s) that have changed, and bit 4 of the
                      input port 0 register will read ‘1’. The next read of the input port register bit 4 register
                      should now read ‘0’.
                      An interrupt remains active when a non-latched input simultaneously switches state with a
                      latched input and then returns to its original state. A read of the input register reflects only
                      the change of state of the latched input and also clears the interrupt. The interrupt is not
                      cleared if the input latch register changes from latched to non-latched configuration.
                      If the input pin is changed from latched to non-latched input, a read from the input port
                      register reflects the current port logic level. If the input pin is changed from non-latched to
                      latched input, the read from the input register reflects the latched logic level. A register
                      pair write operation is described in Section 8.1. A register pair read operation is described
                      in Section 8.2.

                7.4.8 Pull-up/pull-down selection register pair (48h, 49h)
                      The I/O port can be configured to have pull-up or pull-down resistor by programming the
                      pull-up/pull-down selection register. Setting a bit to logic 1 selects a 100 k pull-up
                      resistor for that I/O pin. Setting a bit to logic 0 selects a 100 k pull-down resistor for that
                      I/O pin. If the pull-up/down feature is disconnected, writing to this register will have no
                      effect on I/O pin. Typical value is 100 k with minimum of 50 k and maximum of 150 k.
                      A register pair write operation is described in Section 8.1. A register pair read operation is
                      described in Section 8.2.

                7.4.9 Interrupt mask register pair (4Ah, 4Bh)
                      Interrupt mask registers are set to logic 1 upon power-on, disabling interrupts during
                      system start-up. Interrupts may be enabled by setting corresponding mask bits to logic 0.
                      If an input changes state and the corresponding bit in the Interrupt mask register is set
                      to 1, the interrupt is masked and the interrupt pin will not be asserted. If the corresponding
                      bit in the Interrupt mask register is set to 0, the interrupt pin will be asserted.
                      When an input changes state and the resulting interrupt is masked (interrupt mask bit
                      is 1), setting the input mask register bit to 0 will cause the interrupt pin to be asserted. If
                      the interrupt mask bit of an input that is currently the source of an interrupt is set to 1, the
                      interrupt pin will be de-asserted. A register pair write operation is described in Section 8.1.
                      A register pair read operation is described in Section 8.2.

               7.4.10 Interrupt status register pair (4Ch, 4Dh)
                       These read-only registers are used to identify the source of an interrupt. When read, a
                       logic 1 indicates that the corresponding input pin was the source of the interrupt. A logic 0
                       indicates that the input pin is not the source of an interrupt.
                       When a corresponding bit in the interrupt mask register is set to 1 (masked), the interrupt
                       status bit will return logic 0. A register pair write operation is described in Section 8.1. A
                       register pair read operation is described in Section 8.2.

                       The output port configuration register selects port-wise push-pull or open-drain I/O stage.
                       A logic 0 configures the I/O as push-pull (Q1 and Q2 are active, see Figure 12). A logic 1
                       configures the I/O as open-drain (Q1 is disabled, Q2 is active) and the recommended
                       command sequence is to program this register (4Fh) before the configuration register
                       (06h and 07h) sets the port pins as outputs.
                       ODEN0 configures Port 0_x and ODEN1 configures Port 1_x.

                   7.5 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD(P) to a maximum of
                       5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD(P) or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                   7.6 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD(P), an internal power-on reset holds the
                       PCAL6416A in a reset condition until VDD(P) has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCAL6416A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                       initializes to their default states. After that, VDD(P) must be lowered to below VPOR and
                       back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 9.3 “Power-on reset
                       requirements”.
                   7.7 Reset input (RESET)
                       The RESET input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the VDD(P) at its
                       operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a
                       minimum of tw(rst). The PCAL6416A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are
                       changed to their default state once RESET is LOW (0). When RESET is HIGH (1), the I/O
                       levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input requires a
                       pull-up resistor to VDD(I2C-bus) if no active connection is used.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                    PCAL6416A
                                                               Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   7.8 Interrupt output (INT)
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. The interrupt is reset when data on the port
                       changes back to the original value or when data is read from the port that generated the
                       interrupt (see Figure 18). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK)
                       or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that
                       occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the
                       resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Any change of the I/Os after resetting is
                       detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input Port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pull-up resistor to VDD(P) or
                       VDD(I2C-bus), depending on the application. INT should be connected to the voltage source
                       of the device that requires the interrupt information.
                       When using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt is reset only
                       when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs in the
                       Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising
                       edge of the SCL signal.
8. Bus transactions
                       The PCAL6416A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                       PCAL6416A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Write commands
                       Data is transmitted to the PCAL6416A by sending the device address and setting the
                       Least Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 10 for device address). The command
                       byte is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows
                       the command byte.
                       Twenty-two registers within the PCAL6416A are configured to operate as eleven register
                       pairs. The eleven pairs are input port, output port, polarity inversion, configuration, output
                       drive strength (two 16-bit registers), input latch, pull-up/pull-down enable,
                       pull-up/pull-down selection, interrupt mask, and interrupt status registers. After sending
                       data to one register, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see
                       Figure 13 and Figure 14). For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3),
                       the next byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).
                       There is no limit on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this way,
                       the host can continuously update a register pair independently of the other registers.

                                                                              Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                       8.2 Read commands
                                  To read data from the PCAL6416A, the bus master must first send the PCAL6416A
                                  address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 10 for device address).
                                  The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is to be
                                  accessed.
                                  After a restart, the device address is sent again, but this time the least significant bit is set
                                  to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte is sent by the
                                  PCAL6416A (see Figure 15 and Figure 18). Data is clocked into the register on the rising
                                  edge of the ACK clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read, but
                                  the data now reflects the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if
                                  Input Port 1 is read, the next byte read is Input Port 0.There is no limit on the number of
                                  data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte received the bus
                                  master must not acknowledge the data.
                                  After a subsequent restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register to be
                                  read in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 was read last before the restart, the register
                                  that is read after the restart is the Input Port 0.

        (1) External resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. Also, internal pull-up or pull-down may be used to eliminate
            the need for external components. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor is not needed. If an output in the
            P port is configured as a push-pull output there is no need for external pull-up resistors. If an output in the P port is configured
            as an open-drain output, external pull-up resistors are required.
  Fig 19. Typical application
                       9.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                               When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                               resistor as shown in Figure 19. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O
                               VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD(P). The supply current, IDD(P), increases as VI becomes
                               lower than VDD(P).
                               Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                               should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                               Figure 20 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 21 shows VDD(P)
                               less than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O
                               VI at or above VDD(P) and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is

                             The Output drive strength registers allow the user to control the output drive level of the
                             GPIO. Each GPIO can be configured independently to one of the four possible output
                             current levels. By programming these bits the user is changing the number of transistor
                             pairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad.
                             Figure 22 shows a simplified output stage. The behavior of the pad is affected by the
                             Configuration register, the output port data, and the current control register. When the
                             Current Control register bits are programmed to 10b, then only two of the fingers are
                             active, reducing the current drive capability by 50 %.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                 PCAL6416A
                                                                Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                       Reducing the current drive capability may be desirable to reduce system noise. When the
                       output switches (transitions from H/L), there is a peak current that is a function of the
                       output drive selection. This peak current runs through VDD and VSS package inductance
                       and will create noise (some radiated, but more critically Simultaneous Switching Noise
                       (SSN)). In other words, switching many outputs at the same time will create ground and
                       supply noise. The output drive strength control through the Output Drive Strength
                       registers allows the user to mitigate SSN issues without the need of additional external
                       components.
                   9.3 Power-on reset requirements
                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCAL6416A can be reset to its default
                       conditions by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device
                       go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device
                       is powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24.

                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD(P) being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 26 and Table 30 provide more details on this specification.

                                                               Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   9.4 Device current consumption with internal pull-up and pull-down
                       resistors
                       The PCAL6416A integrates programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors to eliminate
                       external components when pins are configured as inputs and pull-up or pull-down
                       resistors are required (for example, nothing is driving the inputs to the power supply rails.
                       Since these pull-up and pull-down resistors are internal to the device itself, they contribute
                       to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the overall system
                       design.
                       The pull-up or pull-down function is selected in registers 48h and 49h, while the resistor is
                       connected by the enable registers 46h and 47h. The configuration of the resistors is
                       shown in Figure 12.
                       If the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to VDD, a current will flow from
                       the VDD(P) pin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will
                       appear as additional IDD upsetting any current consumption measurements.
                       In the same manner, if the resistor is configured as a pull-down and the pin is held HIGH,
                       current will flow from the power supply through the pin to the VSS pin. While this current
                       will not be measured as part of IDD, one must be mindful of the 200 mA limiting value
                       through VSS.
                       The pull-up and pull-down resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with
                       voltage. The resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 k with a nominal
                       100 k value. Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins
                       held HIGH or LOW and the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 30 for a
                       graph of supply current versus the number of pull-up resistors.
                   9.5 I2C-bus error recovery techniques
                       There are a number of techniques to recover from error conditions on the I2C-bus. Slave
                       devices like the PCAL6416A use a state machine to implement the I2C protocol and
                       expect a certain sequence of events to occur to function properly. Unexpected events at
                       the I2C master can wreak havoc with the slaves connected on the bus. However, it is
                       usually possible to recover deterministically to a known bus state with careful protocol
                       manipulation.
                       A hard slave reset, either through power-on reset or by activating the RESET pin, will set
                       the device back into the default state. Of course, this means the input/output pins and
                       their configuration will be lost, which might cause some system issues.
                       A STOP condition, which is only initiated by the master, will reset the slave state machine
                       into a known condition where SDA is not driven LOW by the slave and logically, the slave
                       is waiting for a START condition. A STOP condition is defined as SDA transitioning from
                       LOW to HIGH while SCL is HIGH.
                       If the master is interrupted during a packet transmission, the slave may be sending data or
                       performing an Acknowledge, driving the I2C-bus SDA line LOW. Since SDA is LOW, it
                       effectively blocks any other I2C-bus transaction. A deterministic method to clear this
                       situation, once the master recognizes a ‘stuck bus’ state, is for the master to blindly
                       transmit nine clocks on SCL. If the slave was transmitting data or acknowledging, nine or

                                                                      Low-voltage translating 16-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                             more clocks ensures the slave state machine returns to a known, idle state since the
                             protocol calls for eight data bits and one ACK bit. It does not matter when the slave state
                             machine finishes its transmission, extra clocks will be recognized as STOP conditions.
                             The PCAL6416A SCL pin is an input only. If SCL is stuck LOW, then only the bus master
                             or a slave performing a clock stretch operation can cause this condition.
                             With careful design of the bus master error recovery firmware, many I2C-bus protocol
                             problems can be avoided.

[1]   For IDD, all typical values are at nominal supply voltage (1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V, 3.6 V or 5 V VDD) and Tamb = 25 C. Except for IDD, the
      typical values are at VDD(P) = VDD(I2C-bus) = 3.3 V and Tamb = 25 C.
[2]   The total current sourced by all I/Os must be limited to 160 mA.
[3]   Each I/O must be externally limited to a maximum of 25 mA and each octal (P0_0 to P0_7 and P1_0 to P1_7) must be limited to a
      maximum current of 100 mA, for a device total of 200 mA.
[4]   Typical value for Tamb = 25 C. VOL = 0.4 V and VDD(I2C-bus) = VDD(P) = 3.3 V. Typical value for VDD(I2C-bus) = VDD(P) < 2.5 V, VOL = 0.6 V.

17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                17.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 45) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 38 and 39

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 45.
