1. General description
                          The PCA9518 is a BiCMOS integrated circuit intended for application in I2C-bus and
                          SMBus systems.
                          While retaining all the operating modes and features of the I2C-bus system, it permits
                          extension of the I2C-bus by buffering both the data (SDA) and the clock (SCL) lines, thus
                          enabling virtually an unlimited number of buses of 400 pF.
                          The I2C-bus capacitance limit of 400 pF restricts the number of devices and bus length.
                          Using the PCA9518 enables the system designer to divide the bus into an unlimited
                          number of segments off of a hub where any segment to segment transition sees only one
                          repeater delay and is multiple master capable on each segment.
                          Using multiple PCA9518 parts, any width hub (in multiples of five)1 can be implemented
                          using the expansion pins.
                          The PCA9518 is a wider voltage range (2.3 V to 3.6 V) version of the PCA9518 and also
                          improves partial power-down performance, keeping I2C-bus I/O pins in high-impedance
                          state when VDD is below 2.0 V.
                          A PCA9518 cluster cannot be put in series with a PCA9515/16 or with another
                          PCA9518 cluster. Multiple PCA9518 devices can be grouped with other PCA9518
                          devices into any size cluster thanks to the EXPxxxn pins that allow the I2C-bus signals to
                          be sent/received from/to one PCA9518 to/from another PCA9518 within the cluster. Since
                          there is no direction pin, slightly different ‘legal’ low voltage levels are used to avoid
                          lock-up conditions between the input and the output of individual repeaters in the cluster.
                          A ‘regular LOW’ applied at the input of any of the PCA9518 devices will then be
                          propagated as a ‘buffered LOW’ with a slightly higher value to all enabled outputs in the
                          PCA9518 cluster. When this ‘buffered LOW’ is applied to a PCA9515 and PCA9516 or
                          separate PCA9518 cluster (not connected via the EXPxxxn pins) in series, the second
                          PCA9515 and PCA9516 or PCA9518 cluster will not recognize it as a ‘regular LOW’ and
                          will not propagate it as a ‘buffered LOW’ again. The PCA9510/9511/9513/9514 and
                          PCA9512 cannot be used in series with the PCA9515 and PCA9516 or PCA9518, but can
                          be used in series with themselves since they use shifting instead of static offsets to avoid
                          lock-up conditions.

                          The output pull-down voltage of each internal buffer is set for approximately 0.5 V, while
                          the input threshold of each internal buffer is set about 0.07 V lower, when the output is
                          internally driven LOW. This prevents a lock-up condition from occurring.

                                                                                    Expandable 5-channel I2C-bus hub
6. Functional description
                            The PCA9518 BiCMOS integrated circuit is a five-way hub repeater, which enables
                            I2C-bus and similar bus systems to be expanded in increments of five with only one
                            repeater delay and no functional degradation of system performance.
                            The PCA9518 BiCMOS integrated circuit contains five multi-directional, open-drain buffers
                            specifically designed to support the standard low-level contention arbitration of the
                            I2C-bus. Except during arbitration or clock stretching, the PCA9518 acts like a pair of
                            non-inverting, open-drain buffers, one for SDA and one for SCL.
                            Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram of PCA9518”.
                      6.1 Enable
                            The enable pins EN1 through EN4 are active HIGH and have internal pull-up resistors.
                            Each enable pin ENn controls its associated SDAn and SCLn ports. When LOW, the ENn
                            pin blocks the inputs from SDAn and SCLn, as well as disabling the output drivers on the
                            SDAn and SCLn pins. The enable pins should only change state when both the global bus
                            and the local port are in an idle state to prevent system failures.
                            The active HIGH enable pins allow the use of open-drain drivers which can be wire-ORed
                            to create a distributed enable where either centralized control signal (master) or spoke
                            signal (sub-master) can enable the channel when it is idle.
                            Unused channels must have pull-up resistors unless their enable pin (ENn) is always
                            LOW. Port 0 must always have pull-up resistors since it is always present in the bus and
                            cannot be disabled.
                      6.2 Expansion
                            The PCA9518 includes 4 open-drain I/O pins used for expansion. Two expansion pins,
                            EXPSDA1 and EXPSDA2 are used to communicate the internal state of the serial data
                            within each hub to the other hubs. The EXPSDA1 pins of all hubs are connected together
                            to form an open-drain bus. Similarly, all EXPSDA2 pins, EXPSCL1 pins, and all EXPSCL2
                            pins are connected together forming a 4-wire bus between hubs.
                            When it is necessary to be able to deselect every port, each expansion device only
                            contributes 4 ports which can be enabled or disables because the fifth does not have an
                            enable pin.
                            Pull-up resistors are required on the EXPxxxn3 pins even if only one PCA9518 is used.
                      6.3 I2C-bus systems
                            As with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the logic
                            HIGH levels on the buffered bus. (Standard open-collector or open-drain configuration of
                            the I2C-bus). The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system, but each side of
                            the repeater must have a pull-up resistor. This part is designed to work with
                            Standard-mode (0 Hz to 100 kHz) and Fast-mode (0 Hz to 400 kHz) I2C-bus devices in
                            addition to SMBus devices. Standard-mode I2C-bus devices only specify 3 mA output
                            drive; this limits the termination current to 3 mA in a generic I2C-bus system where
3.    ‘xxxn’ is SDA1, SDA2, SCL1 or SCL2. ‘xxx’ is SDA or SCL.

                                                                            Expandable 5-channel I2C-bus hub
                   Standard-mode devices and multiple masters are possible. Please see application note
                   AN255, I2C/SMBus Repeaters, Hubs and Expanders for additional information on sizing
                   resistors.
7. Application design-in information
                   A typical application is shown in Figure 5. In this example, the system master is running
                   on a 3.3 V I2C-bus while the slaves are connected to a 3.3 V or 5 V bus. All buses run at
                   100 kHz unless slave 3, slave 4 and slave 5 are isolated from the bus. Then the master
                   bus and slave 1, slave 2 and slave 6 can run at 400 kHz.
                   Any segment of the hub can talk to any other segment of the hub. Bus masters and slaves
                   can be located on any segment with 400 pF load allowed on each segment.
                   The PCA9518 is 5 V tolerant, so it does not require any additional circuitry to translate
                   between the different bus voltages.
                   When one port of the PCA9518 is pulled LOW by a device on the I2C-bus, a CMOS
                   hysteresis type input detects the falling edge and drives the EXPxxx1 line LOW, when the
                   EXPxxx1 voltage is less than 0.5VCC, the other ports are pulled down to the VOL of the
                   PCA9518 which is typically 0.5 V.
                   In order to illustrate what would be seen in a typical application, refer to Figure 6. If the
                   bus master in Figure 5 were to write to the slave through the PCA9518, we would see the
                   waveform shown in Figure 6. This looks like a normal I2C-bus transmission except for the
                   small foot preceding each clock LOW-to-HIGH transition and proceeding each data
                   LOW-to-HIGH transition for the master. The foot height is the difference between the LOW
                   level driven by the master and the higher voltage LOW level driven by the PCA9518
                   repeater. Its width corresponds to an effective clock stretching coming from the PCA9518
                   that delays the rising edge of the clock. That same magnitude of delay is seen on the
                   rising edge of the data. The foot on the rising edge of the data is extended through the 9th
                   clock pulse as the PCA9518 repeats the acknowledge from the slave to the master. The
                   clock of the slave looks normal except the VOL is the ~0.5 V level generated by the
                   PCA9518. The SDA at the slave has a particularly interesting shape during the 9th clock
                   cycle where the slave pulls the line below the value driven by the PCA9518 during the
                   acknowledge and then returns to the PCA9518 level creating a foot before it completes
                   the LOW-to-HIGH transition. SDA lines other than the one with the master and the one
                   with the slave have a uniform LOW level driven by the PCA9518 repeater.
                   The other four waveforms are the expansion bus signals and are included primarily for
                   timing reference points. All timing on the expansion bus is with respect to 0.5VCC.
                   EXPSDA1 is the expansion bus that is driven LOW whenever any SDA pin falls below
                   0.3VCC. EXPSDA2 is the expansion bus that is driven LOW whenever any pin is ≤0.4 V.
                   EXPSCL1 is the expansion bus that is driven LOW whenever any SCL pin falls below
                   0.3VCC. EXPSCL2 is the expansion bus that is driven LOW whenever any SCL pin is
                   ≤0.4 V. The EXPSDA2 returns HIGH after the SDA pin that was the last one being held
                   below 0.4 V by an external driver starts to rise. The last SDA to rise above 0.4 V is held
                   down by the PCA9518 to ~0.5 V until after the delay of the circuit which determines that it
                   was the last to rise, then it is allowed to rise above the ~0.5 V level driven by the
                   PCA9518. Considering the bus 0 SDA to be the last one to go above 0.4 V, then the
                   EXPSDA1 returns to HIGH after the EXPSDA2 is HIGH and either the bus 0 SDA rise time

             Only two of the five channels on the PCA9518 Device 2 are being used. EN3 and EN4 are connected to GND to disable
             channels 3 and 4 and/or SDA3/SCL3 and SDA4/SCL4 are pulled up to VCC. SDA0 and SCL0 can be used as a normal I2C-bus
             port, but if unused then it must be pulled up to VCC since there is no enable pin.
             The pull-ups shown on Device 2 channels 3 and 4 are not required if their enable pins (ENn) are permanently held LOW.

                             It is important to note that any arbitration or clock stretching events on Bus 1 require that
                             the VOL of the devices on Bus 1 be 70 mV below the VOL of the PCA9518 (see VOL−VILc in
                             Section 9 “Static characteristics”) to be recognized by the PCA9518 and then transmitted
                             to Bus 0.

[1]   The SDA and SCL propagation delays are dominated by rise times or fall times. The fall times are mostly internally controlled and are
      only sensitive to load capacitance. The rise times are RC time constant controlled and therefore a specific numerical value can only be
      given for fixed RC time constants.
[2]   The SDA HIGH to LOW propagation delay includes the fall time from VCC to 0.5VCC of the EXPSDA1 or EXPSCL1 pins and the SDA or
      SCL fall time from the quiescent HIGH (usually VCC) to below 0.3VCC. The SDA and SCL outputs have edge rate control circuits
      included which make the fall time almost independent of load capacitance.
[3]   The SDA or SCL LOW to HIGH propagation delay includes the rise time constant from the quiescent LOW to 0.5VCC for the EXPSDA1
      or EXPSCL2, the rise time constant for the quiescent LOW to 0.5VCC for the EXPSDA1 or EXPSCL1, and the rise time constant from
      the quiescent external driven LOW to 0.7VCC for the SDA or SCL output. All of these rise times are RC time constants determined by the
      external resistance and total capacitance for the various nodes.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 6 and 7

                                                    Volume (mm3)
                                                    < 350               350 to 2000          > 2000
                      < 1.6                         260                 260                  260
                      1.6 to 2.5                    260                 250                  245
                      > 2.5                         250                 245                  245
                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
