1.1       XNOR Chain Test Mode
An XNOR Chain test structure is in to the ECE1105 to allow users to confirm that all pins are in contact with the moth-
erboard during assembly and test operations (Figure 1-2, "XNOR Chain Test Structure").
The XNOR Chain test structure must be activated to perform these tests. When the XNOR Chain is activated, the
ECE1105 pin functions are disconnected from the device pins, which all become input pins except for one output pin at
the end of XNOR Chain.
The tests that are performed when the XNOR Chain test structure is activated require the board-level test hardware to
control the device pins and observe the results at the XNOR Chain output pin.
1.2       Pins in XNOR Chain Structure
All pins are inputs into the XNOR Chain with the exception of the following pins:
•  TEST_PIN (this is the XNOR Chain enable input)
•  RESERVED
•  SMB_ADDR
•  BC_INT#/SMB_INT#
1.3       Entering and Exiting the XNOR Chain
The XNOR Chain test is entered by setting TEST_PIN to 1 while SMB_ADDR is 0.
When activated, the test mode allows one single input pin, when switched, to toggle the BC_INT#/SMB_INT# output.
The XNOR Chain is exited by setting TEST_PIN to 0, independent of the value of SMB_ADDR.

2.0       PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
2.1       Summary
The ECE1105 is a 48-pin 3.3V GPIO and Keyboard Scan Expansion device.The device supports a keyboard scan
matrix of 23x8 and has two PS/2 ports for touchpad and/or pointer stick support. The device is connected to a Master
via the BC-Link interface or via the SMBus.
KSI and KSO signals are multiplexed with GPIOs.
2.2       Interrupt Generation
Interrupts can be generated by an edge detection on a GPIO pin or an edge detection on one of the bus interface pins.
and the two PS/2 ports. The bus interrupt pin (BC_INT# or SMBUS_INT#) is asserted if any bit in one of the Interrupt
Status registers is 1 and the corresponding Interrupt Mask bit is also 1. Interrupt generation is illustrated in Figure 2-1,
"Interrupt Generation".

ECE1105
In order for software to determine which device is the source of an interrupt, it should first read the Group Interrupt Status
Register to determine which Status register group is a source for the interrupt. Software should read both the Status
register and the associated Mask register, then AND the two values together. Bits that are 1 in the result of the AND are
active interrupts.
Software clears an interrupt by writing a 1 to the corresponding bit in the Status register.
   Note:     Although the ECE1105 can generate the SMBus interrupt signal SMBUS_INT# as described above, it will
             not respond to the SMBus Alert Response Address transaction unless Bit4 ARA in the Clock Control Reg-
             ister (Register FAh) is set to 1.
2.3       Integrated VCC1 Reset Generator
When VCC1 power is applied to the ECE1105, a VCC1 POR will be generated. This VCC1 POR will reset the device.

In order to enable oscillator wakeup from Low Power Mode for any GPIO pin, the GPIO Configuration Register for that
GPIO must be configured for Input in Bit 5). To enable oscillator wakeup from Low Power Mode for any pin that is an
alternate function, the GPIO Configuration Register must still be configured for input. This applies to Keyscan pin func-
tions and also PS/2 pin functions. PS/2 pin functions should be configured for edge triggering (TYPE field 01, 10 or 11).
See Section 2.6.4, "Clock Control".
2.5.4.3        POL
When the POL bit is set to ‘1’’ the signal output is inverted when routed to its pin and the interrupt level sense is inverted
when a level-sensitive interrupt is selected by the DIR, TYPE fields. POL does not affect any output when the ALT bit
is “1”.The state of the pin is always reported without inversion in the GPIO Input Register.
2.5.4.4        PU
When this bit is 1, an internal pull-up resistor is connected to the pin. When this bit is 0, the pullup is disabled.

A bit in a GPIOX Interrupt Status Register is set to 1 when the DIRECTION field for that bit in the corresponding GPIOXn
Configuration Register is set for Input and the bit in the corresponding GPIOX Input Register matches the conditions
defined by the TYPE field in the GPIOX Configuration Register. For example, if the TYPE field for GPIO Xn is set for
Level Sensitive Low, then bit n in the GPIOX Interrupt Status Register is set to 1 when bit n in the GPIOX Input Register
is 0. If the TYPE field specifies edge triggering, then the Status Register bit is set when the Input Register bit transitions
with the specified edge.
Writing a bit in a GPIOX Interrupt Status Register clears that bit. Writing a bit with a 0 has no effect.

This bit is set to 1 if there is a TP Wakeup event, which occurs when there is TP activity and the TP bit is set in the
Wakeup Control register. It is cleared when written with a 1.
    Note:     An interrupt triggered by TP activity will automatically set the OSC Control bit in the Clock Control register

2.6.4.1          Bit4 ARA
If this bit is 1b and the SMBus interface is enabled (either by setting the Interface Selection field to 11b or by setting the
Interface Selection field to 0xb and an SMBus transaction is detected), the ECE1105 will respond to an SMBus Alert
Response Address Read Byte command as defined in the SMBus specification. If this bit is 0b, the ECE1105 will ignore
the Alert Response Address at all times.
APPLICATION NOTE: Software must insure that the field Interface Selection in this register is ‘11b’ (SMBus
                            Interface enabled) before setting ARA to ‘1b’.
2.6.4.2          Bit2 OSC Control
0b Oscillator Enabled (Default)
1b Oscillator Low Power Enable.
The Oscillator may be stopped and once stopped may be restarted by activity on either the bus interface pins or on
inputs that are enabled for interrupts. See Section 2.6.5, "Wakeup Control" for conditions that restart the Oscillator
When OSC Control is set to Low Power Enable (1b) the Oscillator will stop only when the SMBus or BC-Link and PS/2
are idle. This means:
      No Interrupts are pending
      No traffic is on the bus
      Transactions on the bus have completed
APPLICATION NOTE: When OSC Control is set to ‘1b’, the ring oscillator will be shut down after every BC-Link or
                            SMBus transaction completes and no interrupts are pending. The oscillator will restart when
                            a wakeup enabled by the Wakeup Control registers occurs. The Wakeup Control register
                            must be configured properly before setting OSC Control to ‘1b’.
2.6.4.3          Bit[1:0] Interface Selection
0Xb Autodetect Mode (default)
10b BC-Link interface enabled.
11b SMBus interface enabled
APPLICATION NOTE: The first access to the ECE1088ECE1105 must be a write to the Clock Control register to
                            configure the Interface Selection field to the desired interface type (10b or 11b). This is
                            required so that Oscillator control works properly and so that the bus type does not
                            inadvertently switch during use.

0 TP START bit detection wakeup events do not affect the Oscillator
1 A TP START bit detection wakeup event will restart the Oscillator when the Oscillator is stopped in Low Power mode.
For edge detection on any TP pin the direction and edge configuration must be set in the GPIO Configuration registers
for the GPIO pins that correspond to the TP pins.
   Note:      If the TP bit is 1 and TP interrupts are not enabled, an edge on the TP pins may cause the internal Oscillator
              to start without an interrupt informing the Master device that the Oscillator is operating.
2.6.5.2          Bit4 PS/2
0 PS/2 START bit detection wakeup events do not affect the Oscillator
1 A PS/2 START bit detection wakeup event will restart the Oscillator when the Oscillator is stopped in Low Power mode.
For edge detection on any PS/2 pin the direction and edge configuration must be set in the GPIO Configuration registers
for the GPIO pins that correspond to the PS/2 pins.
   Note:      If the PS/2 bit is 1 and PS/2 interrupts are not enabled, an edge on the PS/2 pins may cause the internal
              Oscillator to start without an interrupt informing the Master device that the Oscillator is operating.
A Keyscan interrupt that is requested on any Keyscan pin for which Keyscan interrupts are enabled will restart the Oscil-
lator when the Oscillator is stopped in Low Power mode.
For edge detection on any Keyscan pin the direction and edge configuration must be set in the GPIO Configuration reg-
isters for the GPIO pins that correspond to each Keyscan pin.
2.6.5.3          Bit2 GPIO
0 GPIO Interrupts do not affect the Oscillator
1 A GPIO interrupt that is requested on any GPIO pin for which GPIO function is selected and a GPIO interrupt is
enabled will restart the Oscillator when the Oscillator is stopped in Low Power mode.
In order for edge detection to work on any GPIO pin the pin must be selected for input and the desired edges configured,
as described in Table 2-5, "Direction, Level/Edge, Output Type Bit Definition", in the GPIO configuration register.
2.6.5.4          Bit1 BUS_DAT
0 The BUS_DAT signal (BC_DAT or SMB_DAT) does not affect the Oscillator
1 Either a rising edge or a falling edge on the BUS_DAT signal will restart the Oscillator when the Oscillator is stopped
in Low Power mode.

2.6.7         PS/2 INTERFACE
The PS/2 Device Interface has two independent Hardware Driven PS/2 ports. Each PS/2 serial channels use a synchro-
nous serial protocol to communicate with an auxiliary device. Each PS/2 channel has Clock and Data signal lines. The
signal lines are bi-directional and employ open drain outputs capable of sinking 16mA. A pull-up resistor, typically 10K,
is connected to both lines. This allows either the ECE1105 PS/2 logic or the auxiliary device to drive the lines. Regard-
less of the drive source, the auxiliary device always provides the clock for transmit and receive operations. The serial
packet is made up of eleven bits, listed in the order they appear on the data line: start bit, eight data bits (least significant
bit first), odd parity, and stop bit. Each bit cell is from 60S to 100S long.
All PS/2 Serial Channel signals (CLK and DAT) are driven by open drain drivers which can be pulled to VCC1 or VCC2
(+3.3V nominal) through 10K-ohm resistors.
The ECE1105 supports a PS/2 Wake Interface The Wake interface restarts the internal Oscillator, which is used to con-
trol the PS/2 state machine.
The PS/2 Wake Interface is only active when the PS/2 signals and external pull-up resisters are powered by the VCC1
supply. The external pull-up resister must always be powered by the same source as the PS/2 signals.

2.6.7.2       PS/2 Port Physical Layer Byte Transmission Protocol
The PS/2 physical layer transfers a byte of data via an eleven bit serial stream as shown in Table 3.13. A logic 1 is sent
at an active high level. Data sent from a Keyboard or mouse device to the host is read on the falling edge of the clock
signal. The Keyboard or mouse device always generates the signal. The Host may inhibit communication by pulling the
Clock line low. The Clock line must be continuously high for at least 50 microseconds before the Keyboard or mouse
device can begin to transmit its data. See Table 3.14, "PS/2 Port Physical Layer Bus States".

2.6.7.3          Interrupts
Each of the two PS/2 Channels has both a PS/2 activity interrupt event and a START Bit detection Wake-up event. The
activity interrupt event is routed to the Other Interrupt Status Register. The START Bit detection wakeup event is routed
to the Wakeup Control Register.
APPLICATION NOTE: The GPIO Configuration registers for the pins that correspond to the PS/2 and the TP ports
                            should be programmed to Input, Falling Edge Triggered, non-inverted polarity detection in
                            order to enable PS/2 or TP START Bit detection wakeup events.
2.6.7.4          Registers
2.6.7.4.1           PS/2 TX/RX
The byte written to this register, when PS/2_T/R, PS/2_EN, and XMIT_IDLE are set, is transmitted automatically by the
PS/2 channel control logic. If any of these three bits (PS/2_T/R, PS/2_EN, and XMIT_IDLE) are not set, then writes to
this register are ignored. On successful completion of this transmission or upon a Transmit Time-out condition, the
PS/2_T/R bit is automatically cleared and the XMIT_IDLE bit is automatically set. The PS/2_T/R bit must be written to
a ‘1’ before initiating another transmission to the remote device.

Even if PS/2_T/R, PS/2_EN, and XMIT_IDLE are all set, writing the Transmit Register will not kick off a transmission if
RDATA_RDY is set. The automatic PS/2 logic forces data to be read from the Receive Register before allowing a trans-
mission.
An interrupt is generated on the low to high transition of XMIT_IDLE.
All bits of this register are write only.
2.6.7.6          Receive Buffer
When PS/2_EN=1 and PS/2_T/R=0, the PS/2 Channel is configured to automatically receive data on that channel (both
the CLK and DATA lines will float waiting for the peripheral to initiate a reception by sending a start bit followed by the
data bits). After a successful reception, data is placed in this register and the RDATA_RDY bit is set and the CLK line is
forced low by the PS/2 channel logic. RDATA_RDY is cleared and the CLK line is released to hi-z following a read of
this register. This automatically holds off further receive transfers until the Master has had a chance to get the data.

The Receive Register is initialized to FFh after a read or after a Time-out has occurred.
The channel can be enabled to automatically transmit data (PS/2_EN=1) by setting PS/2_T/R while RDATA_RDY is set,
however a transmission can not be kicked off until the data has been read from the Receive Register.
An interrupt is generated on the low to high transition of RDATA_RDY.
If a receive time-out (REC_TIMEOUT=1) or a transmit time-out (XMIT_TIMEOUT=1) occurs the channel is busied (CLK
held low) for 300us (Hold Time) to ensure that the peripheral aborts. Writing to the Transmit Register will be allowed,
however the data written will not be transmitted until the Hold Time expires.
All bits in this register are read only.
   Note 2-3        In receive mode the RX_BUSY bit for a particular channel is set in the PS/2 Status Register.

when PS/2_EN is set.

This register should be read to determine the status of Bits[1:0] prior to clearing by writing a 1 to that bit.
2.6.7.7.3           PS/2_EN
PS/2 Channel ENable (default = 0). When PS/2_EN is set, the PS/2 State machine is enabled allowing the channel to
perform automatic reception or transmission depending on the bit value of PS/2_T/R. When PS/2_EN is cleared, the
channel’s automatic PS/2 state machine is disabled and the PW/2 channel’s CLK pin driven low and DATA pin not
driven.
   Note:      If the PS/2_EN bit is cleared prior to the leading edge (falling edge) of the 10th (parity bit) clock edge the
              receive data is discarded (RDATA_RDY remains low). If the PS/2_EN bit is cleared following the leading
              edge of the 10th clock signal, then the receive data is saved in the Receive Register (RDATA_RDY goes
              high) assuming no parity error.
2.6.7.7.4           PS/2_T/R
PS/2 Channel Transmit/Receive (default = 0). Configures the PS/2 logic for automatic transmission when set or recep-
tion when cleared. This bit is only valid when PS/2_EN is set.
When set the PS/2 channel is enabled to transmit data. To properly initiate a transmit operation, this bit must be set prior
to writing to the Transmit Register. Writes to the Transmit Register are blocked when this bit is cleared. Upon setting the
PS/2_T/R bit, the channel will drive its CLK line low and then float the DATA line and hold this state until a write occurs
to the Transmit Register or until the PS/2_T/R bit is cleared. Writing to the Transmit Register initiates the transmit oper-
ation. ECE1105 drives the data line low and, within 80ns, floats the clock line (externally pulled high by the pull-up resis-
tor) to signal to the external PS/2 device that data is now available. The PS/2_T/R bit is cleared on the 11th clock edge
of the transmission or if a Transmit Time-out error condition occurs.
   Note:      If the PS/2_T/R bit is set while the channel is actively receiving data prior to the leading edge of the 10th
              (parity bit) clock edge, the receive data is discarded. If this bit is not set prior to the 10th clock signal, then
              the receive data is saved in the Receive Register.
When the PS/2_T/R bit is cleared, the PS/2 channel is enabled to receive data. Upon clearing this bit, if RDATA_RDY
is also cleared, the channel’s CLK and DATA will float waiting for the external PS/2 device to signal the start of a trans-
mission. If the PS/2_T/R bit is set while RDATA_RDY is set, then the channel’s DATA line will float but its CLK line will
be held low, holding off the peripheral, until the Receive Register is read.

2.6.7.8.1           XMIT_START_TIMEOUT
When the XMIT_START_TIMEOUT bit is set, a start bit was not received within 25 ms following the transmit start event.
Writing a ‘1’ to the bit clears the XMIT_START_TIMEOUT bit. The XMIT_START_TIMEOUT bit is a ‘sticky’ bit and is
intended to uniquely indicate the status of the transmit start bit time-out condition. These bit affect no other logic. Note
that the transmit start bit time-out condition is also indicated by the XMIT_TIMEOUT bit.
 PROGRAMMER’S NOTE: Always check that a PS/2 channel is idle, i.e. the RX_BUSY bit is clear, before
                                 attempting to transmit on that channel. Receive data may be lost by setting a PS/2
                                 channel to transmit while the RX_BUSY bit is set depending where in the message
                                 frame the transmit mode change occurs.
This bit is cleared when written with a 1.
2.6.7.8.2           RX_BUSY
When a RX_BUSY bit is set, the associated channel is actively receiving PS/2 data; when a RX_BUSY bit is clear, the
channel is idle. See Note 2-3 on page 28.
   Note 2-4        The Busy bit is set upon detection of a Start bit.
2.6.7.8.3           XMIT_TIMEOUT
When the XMIT_TIMEOUT bit is set, the PS/2_T/R bit is held clear, the PS/2 channel’s CLK line is pulled low for a min-
imum of 300us until the PS/2 Status register is read. The XMIT_TIMEOUT bit is set on one of three transmit conditions:
when the transmitter bit time (time between falling edges) exceeds 300us, when the transmitter start bit is not received
within 25ms from signaling a transmit start event or if the time from the first bit (start) to the 10th bit (parity) exceeds 2ms.
This bit is cleared when written with a 1.
2.6.7.8.4           XMIT_IDLE
Transmitter Idle: When low, the XMIT_IDLE bit is a status bit indicating that the PS/2 channel is actively transmitting
data to the PS/2 peripheral device. Writing to the Transmit Register when the channel is ready to transmit will cause the
XMIT_IDLE bit to clear and remain clear until one of the following conditions occur: the falling edge of the 11th CLK,
XMIT_TIMEOUT is set; the PS/2_T/R bit is cleared or the PS/2_EN bit is cleared.
   Note 2-5        An interrupt is generated on the low-to-high transition of XMIT_IDLE.
2.6.7.8.5           FE
Framing Error: When receiving data, the stop bit is clocked in on the falling edge of the 11th CLK edge. If the channel
is configured to expect either a high or low stop bit and the 11th bit is contrary to the expected stop polarity, then the FE
and REC_TIMEOUT bits are set following the falling edge of the 11th CLK edge and an interrupt is generated.
This bit is cleared when written with a 1.
2.6.7.8.6           PE
Parity Error: When receiving data, the parity bit is clocked in on the falling edge of the 10th CLK edge. If the channel is
configured to expect either even or odd parity and the 10th bit is contrary to the expected parity, then the PE and REC_-
TIMEOUT bits are set following the falling edge of the 10th CLK edge and an interrupt is generated.
This bit is cleared when written with a 1.
2.6.7.8.7           REC_TIMEOUT
Following assertion of the REC_TIMEOUT bit, the channel’s CLK line is automatically pulled low for a minimum of 300us
until the PS/2 status register is read. Under PS/2 automatic operation, PS/2_EN is set, this bit is set on one of three
receive error conditions:
      When the receiver bit time (time between falling edges) exceeds 300us.
      If the time from the first bit (start) to the 10th bit (parity) exceeds 2ms.
      On a receive parity error along with the Parity Error (PE) bit.
      On a receive framing error due to an incorrect STOP bit along with the framing error (FE) bit.
This bit is cleared when written with a 1.

  Note 2-6       An Interrupt is generated on the low-to-high transition of the REC_TIMEOUT bit.
2.6.7.8.8        RDATA_RDY
Receive Data Ready: Under normal operating conditions, this bit is set following the falling edge of the 11th clock given
successful reception of a data byte from the PS/2 peripheral (i.e., no parity, framing, or receive time-out errors) and indi-
cates that the received data byte is available to be read from the Receive Register. This bit may also be set in the event
that the PS/2_EN bit is cleared following the 10th CLK edge. Reading the Receive Register clears this bit.
  Note 2-7       An Interrupt is generated on the low-to-high transition of the RDATA_RDY bit.

2.7         SMBus / BC-Link Autodetect Circuit
2.7.1         OVERVIEW
For either the SMBus or the BC-Link, by detecting difference in start conditions, the Bus type is indicated. From an idle
condition, the device will sample the data line on the first falling edge of the clock. If it is low, a SMBus interface is
selected; if it is high, a BC-Link interface is selected. The idle condition is defined as a POR or no activity for 75 ms. To
safeguard against glitches selecting the wrong bus and locking the system, the device use time-outs that reload on a
start from the respective bus interface. For SMBus, the timeout is 75 ms. For BC-Link, the timeout is 75 s.
2.8         SMBus Slave Interface
The host processor communicates with the ECE1105 device through a series of read/write registers via the SMBus
interface. SMBus is a serial communication protocol between a computer host and its peripheral devices.
The SMBus data rate is 10KHz minimum to 400 KHz maximum.
2.8.1         CLOCKING
The SMBus Slave interface is driven by an internal Ring Oscillator. This oscillator runs at a nominal frequency of 32MHz.
The oscillator is also used to drive the PS/2 state machine used in the PS/2 and TP ports.
The Ring Oscillator may be started and stopped through firmware interactions. The that controls the operation of the
Oscillator is described in Section 2.6.4, "Clock Control" and Section 2.6.5, "Wakeup Control".
2.8.2         SLAVE ADDRESS
Upon power up, the ECE1105 device will be placed into Address Select mode and assign itself an SMBus address
according to the Address Select input. The device will latch the address during the first valid SMBus transaction in which
the first five bits of the targeted address match those of the ECE1105 address. This feature eliminates the possibility of
a glitch on the SMBus interfering with address selection.

2.8.3         SLAVE BUS INTERFACE
The ECE1105 device SMBus implementation is a subset of the SMBus interface to the host. The device is a slave-only
SMBus device. The implementation in the device is a subset of SMBus since it only supports four protocols.
The Write Byte, Read Byte, Send Byte, and Receive Byte protocols are the only valid SMBus protocols for the device.
This part responds to other protocols as described in the Invalid Protocol Section. Reference the System Management
Bus Specification, Rev 2.0.
The SMBus interface is used to read and write the registers in the device. The register set is shown in Table 2-1, "Reg-
ister Summary".
2.8.4         WRITE BYTE
The Write Byte protocol is used to write data to the registers. The data will only be written if the protocol shown in
Table 2-32, "SMBus Write Byte Protocol" is performed correctly. Only one byte is transferred at time for a Write Byte
protocol.

2.8.5         READ BYTE
The Read Byte protocol is used to read data from the registers. The data will only be read if the protocol shown in
Table 2-33, "SMBus Read Byte Protocol" is performed correctly. Only one byte is transferred at time for a Read Byte
protocol.
TABLE 2-33:           SMBUS READ BYTE PROTOCOL

2.8.6         SEND BYTE
The Send Byte protocol is used to set the Internal Address Register to the correct register in the ECE1105. No data is
transferred for a Send Byte protocol.The send byte protocol is shown in Table 2-34, "SMBus Send Byte Protocol".
TABLE 2-34:           SMBUS SEND BYTE PROTOCOL
       Field:             Start          Slave Addr           Wr       Ack        Reg. Addr            Ack         Stop

2.8.7         RECEIVE BYTE
The Receive Byte protocol is used to read data from the registers when the register address is known to be at the
desired address (using the Internal Address Register). Only one byte is transferred at time for a Receive Byte protocol.
TABLE 2-35:           SMBUS RECEIVE BYTE PROTOCOL
      Field:           Start        Slave Addr            Rd       Ack           Reg. Data          Nack           Stop
      Bits:             1                7                1          1              8                  1            1
   Note:      Some simple devices do not contain a clock low drive circuit; this simple kind of device typically may reset
              its communications port after a start or stop condition.
2.8.8         STRETCHING THE SCLK SIGNAL
The ECE1105 supports stretching of the SCLK by other devices on the SMBus.
2.8.9         SMBUS TIMING
The SMBus Slave Interface complies with the SMBus AC Timing Specification. See the SMBus timing diagram shown
in Section 4.2, "SMBus Timing".
2.8.10        SMBUS ALERT RESPONSE ADDRESS
This device responds to protocols with the SMBus Alert Response Address of 0001_100 if the ARA bit in the Clock Con-
trol register is set.
2.8.11        SMBUS TIME-OUT
The ECE1105 includes an SMBus time-out feature. Following a 30 ms period of inactivity on the SMBus, the device
time-out and reset the SMBus interface.
2.9         BC-LinkInterface
The BC-Link is a proprietary bus that allows communication between a Master device and a Companion device. The
Master device uses this serial bus to read and write registers located on the Companion device.
The bus comprises three signals, BC_CLK, BC_DAT and BC_INT#. The Master device always provides the clock, BC_-
CLK, and the Companion device is the source for an independent asynchronous interrupt signal, BC_INT#.
The ECE1105 supports BC-Link speeds up to 24MHz.

   Note:    Stresses above those listed above and below could cause permanent damage to the device. This is a
            stress rating only and functional operation of the device at any other condition above those indicated in the
            operation sections of this specification is not implied. When powering this device from laboratory or system
            power supplies, it is important that the Absolute Maximum Ratings not be exceeded or device failure can
            result. Some power supplies exhibit voltage spikes on their outputs when the AC power is switched on or
            off. In addition, voltage transients on the AC power line may appear on the DC output. If this possibility
            exists, it is suggested that a clamp circuit be used.

    Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
    •     Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
    •     Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the market today, when used in the
          intended manner and under normal conditions.
    •     There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of these methods, to our
          knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data
          Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is engaged in theft of intellectual property.
    •     Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
    •     Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their code. Code protection does not
          mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
    Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the code protection features of our
    products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts
    allow unauthorized access to your software or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
    Information contained in this publication regarding device applications and the like is provided only for your convenience and may be
    superseded by updates. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application meets with your specifications. MICROCHIP MAKES NO
    REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WRITTEN OR ORAL, STATUTORY OR
    OTHERWISE, RELATED TO THE INFORMATION, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS CONDITION, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE,
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR PURPOSE. Microchip disclaims all liability arising from this information and its use. Use of Micro-
    chip devices in life support and/or safety applications is entirely at the buyer’s risk, and the buyer agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
    harmless Microchip from any and all damages, claims, suits, or expenses resulting from such use. No licenses are conveyed, implicitly or
