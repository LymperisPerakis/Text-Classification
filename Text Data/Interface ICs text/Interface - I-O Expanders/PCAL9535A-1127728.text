                 Rev. 2 — 23 January 2015                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
             The PCAL9535A is a low-voltage 16-bit General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) expander
             with interrupt and reset for I2C-bus/SMBus applications. NXP I/O expanders provide a
             simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while keeping interconnections to a
             minimum, for example, in ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fan control,
             etc.
             In addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, the wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V
             allows the PCAL9535A to interface with next-generation microprocessors and
             microcontrollers where supply levels are dropping down to conserve power.
             The PCAL9535A contains the PCA9535 register set of four pairs of 8-bit Configuration,
             Input, Output, and Polarity Inversion registers, and additionally, the PCAL9535A has
             Agile I/O, which are additional features specifically designed to enhance the I/O. These
             additional features are: programmable output drive strength, latchable inputs,
             programmable pull-up/pull-down resistors, maskable interrupt, interrupt status register,
             programmable open-drain or push-pull outputs.
             The PCAL9535A is a pin-to-pin replacement to the PCA9535 and PCA9535A, however,
             the PCAL9535A powers up with all I/O interrupts masked. This mask default allows for a
             board bring-up free of spurious interrupts at power-up.
             The PCAL9535A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
             from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system
             master that an input state has changed.
             INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
             signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
             on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCAL9535A can
             remain a simple slave device.
             The device outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while consuming
             low device current.
             The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
             machine.
             Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) select the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
             devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       [1]  HWQFN24 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must
                            be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board
                            level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad
                            on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the
                            PCB in the thermal pad region.

                       A2, A1 and A0 are the hardware address package pins and are held to either HIGH
                       (logic 1) or LOW (logic 0) to assign one of the eight possible slave addresses. The last bit
                       of the slave address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH
                       (logic 1) selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.
                   6.2 Registers
                6.2.1 Pointer register and command byte
                       Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                       command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCAL9535A. The lower
                       three bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers
                       (Input, Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. Bit 6 in
                       conjunction with the lower four bits of the Command byte are used to point to the
                       extended features of the device (Agile I/O). This register is write only.

                6.2.2 Input port register pair (00h, 01h)
                      The Input port registers (registers 0 and 1) reflect the incoming logic levels of the pins,
                      regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration
                      register. The Input port registers are read only; writes to these registers have no effect.
                      The default value ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port
                      register read operation is performed as described in Section 7.2 “Reading the port

                      The Output port registers (registers 2 and 3) show the outgoing logic levels of the pins
                      defined as outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no
                      effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from these registers reflect the value that
                      was written to these registers, not the actual pin value. A register pair write is described in
                      Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      The Polarity inversion registers (registers 4 and 5) allow polarity inversion of pins defined
                      as inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in these registers is set (written with ‘1’), the
                      corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted in the Input register. If a bit in this register is
                      cleared (written with a ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s polarity is retained. A register pair
                      write is described in Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      bit in these registers is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a
                      high-impedance input. If a bit in these registers is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin
                      is enabled as an output. A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and a register pair
                      read is described in Section 7.2.

                      The Output drive strength registers control the output drive level of the GPIO. Each GPIO
                      can be configured independently to a certain output current level by two register control
                      bits. For example, Port 0.7 is controlled by register 41 bits CC0.7 (bits [7:6]), Port 0.6 is
                      controlled by register 41 CC0.6(bits [5:4]). The output drive level of the GPIO is
                      programmed 00b = 0.25, 01b = 0.50, 10b = 0.75, or 11b = 1 of the maximum drive
                      capability of the I/O. See Section 8.2 “Output drive strength control”. A register pair write is
                      described in Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      an input latch register bit is 0, the corresponding input pin state is not latched. A state
                      change of the corresponding input pin generates an interrupt. A read of the input register
                      clears the interrupt. If the input goes back to its initial logic state before the input port
                      register is read, then the interrupt is cleared.
                      When an input latch register bit is 1, the corresponding input pin state is latched. A change
                      of state in the input generates an interrupt and the input logic value is loaded into the
                      corresponding bit of the input port register (registers 0 and 1). A read of the input port
                      register clears the interrupt. If the input pin returns to its initial logic state before the input
                      port register is read, then the interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of the input
                      port register keeps the logic value that initiated the interrupt. See Figure 12 “Read input
                      port register (latch enabled), scenario 3”.
                      For example, if the P0_4 input was as logic 0 and the input goes to logic 1 then back to
                      logic 0, the input port 0 register will capture this change and an interrupt is generated (if
                      unmasked). When the read is performed on the input port 0 register, the interrupt is

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                          PCAL9535A
                                                       Low-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and Agile I/O
                      cleared, assuming there were no additional input(s) that have changed, and bit 4 of the
                      input port 0 register will read ‘1’. The next read of the input port 0 register bit 4 register
                      should now read ‘0’.
                      An interrupt remains active when a non-latched input simultaneously switches state with a
                      latched input and then returns to its original state. A read of the input register reflects only
                      the change of state of the latched input and also clears the interrupt. The interrupt is not
                      cleared if the input latch register changes from latched to non-latched configuration. If the
                      input pin is changed from latched to non-latched input, a read from the input port register
                      reflects the current port logic level. If the input pin is changed from non-latched to latched
                      input, the read from the input register reflects the latched logic level. A register pair write is
                      described in Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      These registers allow the user to enable or disable pull-up/pull-down resistors on the I/O
                      pins. Setting the bit to logic 1 enables the selection of pull-up/pull-down resistors. Setting
                      the bit to logic 0 disconnects the pull-up/pull-down resistors from the I/O pins. Also, the
                      resistors will be disconnected when the outputs are configured as open-drain outputs (see
                      Section 6.2.12). Use the pull-up/pull-down registers to select either a pull-up or pull-down
                      resistor. A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and a register pair read is

                6.2.9 Pull-up/pull-down selection register pair (48h, 49h)
                      The I/O port can be configured to have a pull-up or pull-down resistor by programming the
                      pull-up/pull-down selection register. Setting a bit to logic 1 selects a 100 k pull-up
                      resistor for that I/O pin. Setting a bit to logic 0 selects a 100 k pull-down resistor for that
                      I/O pin. If the pull-up/pull-down feature is disconnected, writing to this register will have no
                      effect on I/O pin. Typical value is 100 k with minimum of 50 k and maximum of 150 k.
                      A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in

               6.2.10 Interrupt mask register pair (4Ah, 4Bh)
                      Interrupt mask registers are set to logic 1 upon power-on, disabling interrupts during
                      system start-up. Interrupts may be enabled by setting corresponding mask bits to logic 0.
                      If an input changes state and the corresponding bit in the Interrupt mask register is set
                      to 1, the interrupt is masked and the interrupt pin will not be asserted. If the corresponding
                      bit in the Interrupt mask register is set to 0, the interrupt pin will be asserted.
                      When an input changes state and the resulting interrupt is masked (interrupt mask bit
                      is 1), setting the input mask register bit to 0 will cause the interrupt pin to be asserted.
                      If the interrupt mask bit of an input that is currently the source of an interrupt is set to 1,
                      the interrupt pin will be de-asserted. A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and a
                      register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      These read-only registers are used to identify the source of an interrupt. When read, a
                      logic 1 indicates that the corresponding input pin was the source of the interrupt. A logic 0
                      indicates that the input pin is not the source of an interrupt.
                      When a corresponding bit in the interrupt mask register is set to 1 (masked), the interrupt
                      status bit will return logic 0. A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and a register
                      pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      The output port configuration register selects port-wise push-pull or open-drain I/O stage.
                      A logic 0 configures the I/O as push-pull (Q1 and Q2 are active, see Figure 6). A logic 1
                      configures the I/O as open-drain (Q1 is disabled, Q2 is active) and the recommended
                      command sequence to program this register (4Fh) before the configuration registers (06h,
                      07h) sets the port pins as outputs.
                      ODEN0 configures Port 0_x and ODEN1 configures Port 1_x.

                   6.3 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                   6.4 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the
                       PCAL9535A in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCAL9535A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                       initializes to their default states. After that, VDD must be lowered to below VPORF and back
                       up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 8.3 “Power-on reset
                       requirements”.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                    PCAL9535A
                                                        Low-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and Agile I/O
                   6.5 Interrupt output
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. The interrupt is reset when data on the port
                       changes back to the original value or when data is read form the port that generated the
                       interrupt (see Figure 10). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the acknowledge (ACK)
                       or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal. Interrupts that
                       occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very short) due to the
                       resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Any change of the I/Os after resetting is
                       detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input Port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires pull-up resistor to VDD.
                       When using the input latch feature, the input pin state is latched. The interrupt is reset only
                       when data is read from the port that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs in the Read
                       mode at the acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of
                       the SCL signal.
7. Bus transactions
                       The PCAL9535A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                       PCAL9535A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   7.1 Writing to the port registers
                       Data is transmitted to the PCAL9535A by sending the device address and setting the least
                       significant bit to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 “PCAL9535A device address”). The command
                       byte is sent after the address and determines which register will receive the data following
                       the command byte.
                       Twenty-two registers within the PCAL9535A are configured to operate as eleven register
                       pairs. The eleven pairs are input port, output port, polarity inversion, configuration,
                       output drive strength (two 16-bit registers), input latch, pull-up/pull-down enable,
                       pull-up/pull-down selection, interrupt mask, and interrupt status registers. After sending
                       data to one register, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see Figure 7
                       and Figure 8). For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3), the next
                       byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).
                       There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this
                       way, the host can continuously update a register pair independently of the other registers,
                       or the host can simply update a single register.

                                                                      Low-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and Agile I/O
                       7.2 Reading the port registers
                                 In order to read data from the PCAL9535A, the bus master must first send the
                                 PCAL9535A address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 4
                                 “PCAL9535A device address”). The command byte is sent after the address and
                                 determines which register will be accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent
                                 again, but this time the least significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register
                                 defined by the command byte is sent by the PCAL9535A (see Figure 9, Figure 10 and
                                 Figure 11). Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock
                                 pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read but the data now reflects
                                 the information in the other register in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the
                                 next byte read is Input Port 0. There is no limit on the number of data bytes received in
                                 one read transmission, but on the final byte received the bus master must not
                                 acknowledge the data.
                                 After a subsequent restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register to be
                                 read in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 was read last before the restart, the register
                                 that is read after the restart is the Input Port 0.

              P0_1, P0_4, P0_5 configured as inputs.
              P0_6, P0_7 and (P1_0 to P1_7) configured as inputs.
         (1) External resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. Also, internal pull-up or pull-down may be used to eliminate
              the need for external components. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor is not needed. If an output in the
              P port is configured as a push-pull output there is no need for external pull-up resistors. If an output in the P port is configured
              as an open-drain output, external pull-up resistors are required.

                        8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                                When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                                resistor as shown in Figure 13. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O
                                VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes lower
                                than VDD.
                                Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                                should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                                Figure 14 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 15 shows VDD less
                                than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                                at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.

                         8.2 Output drive strength control
                             The Output drive strength registers allow the user to control the output drive level of the
                             GPIO. Each GPIO can be configured independently to one of the four possible output
                             current levels. By programming these bits the user is changing the number of transistor
                             pairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad.
                             Figure 16 shows a simplified output stage. The behavior of the pad is affected by the
                             Configuration register, the output port data, and the current control register. When the
                             Current Control register bits are programmed to 10b, then only two of the fingers are
                             active, reducing the current drive capability by 50 %.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                PCAL9535A
                                                        Low-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and Agile I/O
                       Reducing the current drive capability may be desirable to reduce system noise. When the
                       output switches (transitions from H/L), there is a peak current that is a function of the
                       output drive selection. This peak current runs through VDD and VSS package inductance
                       and will create noise (some radiated, but more critically Simultaneous Switching Noise
                       (SSN)). In other words, switching many outputs at the same time will create ground and
                       supply noise. The output drive strength control through the Current Control registers
                       allows the user to mitigate SSN issues without the need of additional external
                       components.
                   8.3 Power-on reset requirements
                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCAL9535A can be reset to its default
                       conditions by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device
                       go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device
                       is powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 17 and Figure 18.

                                Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this
                                device. The glitch width (tw(gl)VDD) and glitch height (VDD(gl)) are dependent on each
                                other. The bypass capacitance, source impedance, and device impedance are factors that

                                how to measure these specifications.

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 20 and Table 28 provide more details on this specification.

                                                        Low-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt and Agile I/O
                   8.4 Device current consumption with internal pull-up and pull-down
                       resistors
                       The PCAL9535A integrates programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors to eliminate
                       external components when pins are configured as inputs and pull-up or pull-down
                       resistors are required (for example, nothing is driving the inputs to the power supply rails.
                       Since these pull-up and pull-down resistors are internal to the device itself, they contribute
                       to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the overall system
                       design.
                       The pull-up or pull-down function is selected in registers 48h and 49h, while the resistor is
                       connected by the enable registers 46h and 47h. The configuration of the resistors is
                       shown in Figure 6.
                       If the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to VDD, a current will flow from
                       the VDD pin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current will
                       appear as additional IDD upsetting any current consumption measurements.
                       In the same manner, if the resistor is configured as a pull-down and the pin is held HIGH,
                       current will flow from the power supply through the pin to the VSS pin. While this current
                       will not be measured as part of IDD, one must be mindful of the 200 mA limiting value
                       through VSS.
                       The pull-up and pull-down resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with
                       voltage. The resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 k with a nominal
                       100 k value. Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins
                       held HIGH or LOW and the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 24 for a
                       graph of supply current versus the number of pull-up resistors.

16. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 34) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 35 and 36

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 34.
