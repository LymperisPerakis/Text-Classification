*Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through hole wave solder processing only. They are not intended for use in Reflow solder processing applications.
NOTE: Pb-free plus anneal products employ special Pb-free material sets; molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte tin plate
termination finish, which are RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations. Pb-free products are MSL classified
at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

82C59A
Pin Description
    SYMBOL         TYPE                                                      DESCRIPTION
      VCC             I    VCC: The +5V power supply pin. A 0.1F capacitor between pins 28 and 14 is recommended for decoupling.
      GND             I    GROUND
       CS             I    CHIP SELECT: A low on this pin enables RD and WR communications between the CPU and the 82C59A. INTA
                           functions are independent of CS.
       WR              I   WRITE: A low on this pin when CS is low enables the 82C59A to accept command words from the CPU.
       RD             I    READ: A low on this pin when CS is low enables the 82C59A to release status onto the data bus for the CPU.
     D7 - D0        I/O    BIDIRECTIONAL DATA BUS: Control, status, and interrupt-vector information is transferred via this bus.
  CAS0 - CAS2       I/O    CASCADE LINES: The CAS lines form a private 82C59A bus to control a multiple 82C59A structure. These
                           pins are outputs for a master 82C59A and inputs for a slave 82C59A.
     SP/EN          I/O    SLAVE PROGRAM/ENABLE BUFFER: This is a dual function pin. When in the Buffered Mode it can be used
                           as an output to control buffer transceivers (EN). When not in the Buffered Mode it is used as an input to
                           designate a master (SP = 1) or slave (SP = 0).
       INT           O     INTERRUPT: This pin goes high whenever a valid interrupt request is asserted. It is used to interrupt the CPU,
                           thus, it is connected to the CPU's interrupt pin.
    IR0 - IR7         I    INTERRUPT REQUESTS: Asynchronous inputs. An interrupt request is executed by raising an IR input (low to
                           high), and holding it high until it is acknowledged (Edge Triggered Mode), or just by a high level on an IR input
                           (Level Triggered Mode). Internal pull-up resistors are implemented on IR0 - 7.
      INTA            I    INTERRUPT ACKNOWLEDGE: This pin is used to enable 82C59A interrupt-vector data onto the data bus by
                           a sequence of interrupt acknowledge pulses issued by the CPU.
        A0            I    ADDRESS LINE: This pin acts in conjunction with the CS, WR, and RD pins. It is used by the 82C59A to
                           decipher various Command Words the CPU writes and status the CPU wishes to read. It is typically connected
                           to the CPU A0 address line (A1 for 80C86/88/286).

The function of this block is to accept output commands from
the CPU. It contains the Initialization Command Word (lCW)

which store the various control formats for device operation.
This function block also allows the status of the 82C59A to

A LOW on this input enables the 82C59A. No reading or

A LOW on this input enables the CPU to write control words

the three least significant bits according to the interrupt level.
A10 - A5 are ignored and ADI (Address interval) has no effect.

Operation Command Word 1 (OCW1)
OCW1 sets and clears the mask bits in the Interrupt Mask
Register (lMR) M7 - M0 represent the eight mask bits. M = 1
indicates the channel is masked (inhibited), M = 0 indicates
the channel is enabled.
Operation Command Word 2 (OCW2)
R, SL, EOI - These three bits control the Rotate and End of
Interrupt modes and combinations of the two. A chart of
these combinations can be found on the Operation
Command Word Format.
L2, L1, L0 - These bits determine the interrupt level acted
upon when the SL bit is active.
Operation Command Word 3 (OCW3)
ESMM - Enable Special Mask Mode. When this bit is set to 1
it enables the SMM bit to set or reset the Special Mask
Mode. When ESMM = 0, the SMM bit becomes a “don’t
care”.
SMM - Special Mask Mode. If ESMM = 1 and SMM = 1, the
82C59A will enter Special Mask Mode. If ESMM = 1 and
SMM = 0, the 82C59A will revert to normal mask mode.
When ESMM = 0, SMM has no effect.
Fully Nested Mode
This mode is entered after initialization unless another mode
is programmed. The interrupt requests are ordered in priority
from 0 through 7 (0 highest). When an interrupt is
acknowledged the highest priority request is determined and
its vector placed on the bus. Additionally, a bit of the Interrupt
Service register (IS0 - 7) is set. This bit remains set until the
microprocessor issues an End of Interrupt (EOI) command
immediately before returning from the service routine, or if
the AEOI (Automatic End of Interrupt) bit is set, until the
