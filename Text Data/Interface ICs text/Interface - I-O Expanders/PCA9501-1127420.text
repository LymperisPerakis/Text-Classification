1. General description
             The PCA9501 is an 8-bit I/O expander with an on-board 2-kbit EEPROM.
             The I/O expandable eight quasi-bidirectional data pins can be independently assigned as
             inputs or outputs to monitor board level status or activate indicator devices such as LEDs.
             The system master writes to the I/O configuration bits in the same way as for the
             PCF8574. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output
             register. The system master can read all registers.
             The EEPROM can be used to store error codes or board manufacturing data for
             read-back by application software for diagnostic purposes and are included in the I/O
             expander package.
             The PCA9501 active LOW open-drain interrupt output is activated when any input state
             differs from its corresponding input port register state. It is used to indicate to the system
             master that an input state has changed and the device needs to be interrogated.
             The PCA9501 has six address pins with internal pull-up resistors allowing up to
             64 devices to share the common two-wire I2C-bus software protocol serial data bus. The
             fixed GPIO address starts with ‘0’ and the fixed EEPROM I2C-bus address starts with ‘1’,
             so the PCA9501 appears as two separate devices to the bus master.
             The PCA9501 supports hot insertion to facilitate usage in removable cards on backplane
             systems.

                   7.1 Device addressing
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is
                       accessing. The address of the PCA9501 is shown in Figure 6. Internal pull-up resistors
                       are incorporated on the hardware-selectable address pins.
                       The last bit of the address byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1
                       a read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.

                          7.2 Control register
                                   The PCA9501 contains a single 8-bit register called the Control register, which can be
                                   written and read via the I2C-bus. This register is sent after a successful acknowledgment
                                   of the slave address.
                                   It contains the I/O operation information.

                                   (Refer also to Figure 5.)
                                   Each of the PCA9501's eight I/Os can be independently used as an input or output.
                                   Output data is transmitted to the port by the I/O Write mode (see Figure 7). Input I/O data
                                   is transferred from the port to the microcontroller by the Read mode (see Figure 8).

                 7.3.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/Os
                             A quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control
                             signal for data direction. At power-on the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode, only a current
                             source to VDD is active. An additional strong pull-up to VDD allows fast rising edges into
                             heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH, and are
                             switched off by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being used as
                             inputs. See Figure 9.

                 7.3.2 Interrupt
                             The PCA9501 provides an open-drain output (INT) which can be fed to a corresponding
                             input of the microcontroller. This gives these chips a type of master function which can
                             initiate an action elsewhere in the system. See Figure 10.
                             An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the input mode.
                             After time tv(INT) the signal INT is valid. See Figure 11.
                             Resetting and reactivating the interrupt circuit is achieved when data on the port is
                             changed to the original setting or data is read from or written to the port which has
                             generated the interrupt.
                             Resetting occurs as follows:
                                • In the Read mode at the acknowledge bit after the rising edge of the SCL signal
                                • In the Write mode at the acknowledge bit after the HIGH-to-LOW transition of the SCL
                                   signal
                                • Returning of the port data to its original setting
                                • Interrupts which occur during the acknowledge clock pulse may be lost (or very short)
                                   due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse.
                             Each change of the I/Os after resetting will be detected and, after the next rising clock
                             edge, will be transmitted as INT. Reading from or writing to another device does not affect
                             the interrupt circuit.

                   7.4 Memory operations
                7.4.1 Write operations
                       Write operations require an additional address field to indicate the memory address
                       location to be written. The address field is eight bits long providing access to any one of
                       the 256 words of memory. There are two types of write operations, ‘byte write’ and ‘page
                       write’.
                       Write operation is possible when the Write Control pin (WC) is put at a LOW logic level (0).
                       When this control signal is set at 1, write operation is not possible and data in the memory
                       is protected.
                       ‘Byte write’ and ‘page write’ explained below assume that WC is set to 0.
               7.4.1.1 Byte write
                       To perform a byte write, the START condition is followed by the memory slave address and
                       the R/W bit set to 0. The PCA9501 will respond with an acknowledge and then consider
                       the next eight bits sent as the word address and the eight bits after the word address as
                       the data. The PCA9501 will issue an acknowledge after the receipt of both the word
                       address and the data. To terminate the data transfer the master issues the STOP
                       condition, initiating the internal write cycle to the non-volatile memory. Only write and read
                       operations to the quasi-bidirectional I/Os are allowed during the internal write cycle.

                7.4.1.2      Page write
                             A page write is initiated in the same way as the byte write, if after sending the first word of
                             data the STOP condition is not received, the PCA9501 considers subsequent words as
                             data. After each data word the PCA9501 responds with an acknowledge and the four least
                             significant bits of the memory address field are incremented. Should the master not send
                             a STOP condition after 16 data words, the address counter will return to its initial value

                  7.4.2 Read operations
                             PCA9501 read operations are initiated in an identical manner to write operations with the
                             exception that the memory slave address R/W bit is set to ‘1’. There are three types of
                             read operations: current address read, random read and sequential read.
                7.4.2.1      Current address read
                             The PCA9501 contains an internal address counter that increments after each read or
                             write access and as a result, if the last word accessed was at address ‘n’ then the address
                             counter contains the address ‘n + 1’.
                             When the PCA9501 receives its memory slave address with the R/W bit set to one it
                             issues an acknowledge and uses the next eight clocks to transmit the data contained at
                             the address stored in the address counter. The master ceases the transmission by issuing
                             the STOP condition after the eighth bit. There is no ninth clock cycle for the acknowledge.

               7.4.2.2      Random read
                            The PCA9501’s random read mode allows the address to be read from to be specified by
                            the master. This is done by performing a dummy write to set the address counter to the
                            location to be read. The master must perform a byte write to the address location to be
                            read, but instead of transmitting the data after receiving the acknowledge from the
                            PCA9501, the master re-issues the START condition and memory slave address with the
                            R/W bit set to one. The PCA9501 will then transmit an acknowledge and use the next
                            eight clock cycles to transmit the data contained in the addressed location. The master
                            ceases the transmission by issuing the STOP condition after the eighth bit, omitting the
                            ninth clock cycle acknowledge.

                            The PCA9501 sequential read is an extension of either the current address read or
                            random read. If the master does not issue a STOP condition after it has received the
                            eighth data bit, but instead issues an acknowledge, the PCA9501 will increment the
                            address counter and use the next eight cycles to transmit the data from that location. The
                            master can continue this process to read the contents of the entire memory. Upon
                            reaching address 255 the counter will return to address 0 and continue transmitting data
                            until a STOP condition is received. The master ceases the transmission by issuing the
                            STOP condition after the eighth bit, omitting the ninth clock cycle acknowledge.

8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 17).
                                          SDA
                                          SCL

                         Fig 17. Bit transfer
                8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 18).

                   8.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 19).

                   8.3 Acknowledge
                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                         acknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter,
                         whereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                         A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                         each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                         that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                         pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                         LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up and hold
                         times must be taken into account.
                         A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                         acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                         transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                         condition.

9. Application design-in information
                       A central processor/controller typically located on the system main board can use the
                       400 kHz I2C-bus/SMBus to poll the PCA9501 devices located on the system cards for
                       status or version control type of information. The PCA9501 may be programmed at
                       manufacturing to store information regarding board build, firmware version, manufacturer
                       identification, configuration option data, and so on. Alternately, these devices can be used
                       as convenient interface for board configuration, thereby utilizing the I2C-bus/SMBus as an
                       intra-system communication bus

  Fig 23. VOH versus IOH
                              Remark: Rapid fall-off in VOH at current inception is due to a diode that provides 5 V
                              overvoltage protection for the GPIO I/O pins. When the GPIO I/Os are being used as
                              inputs, the internal current source VOH should be evaluated to determine if external pull-up
                              resistors are required to provide sufficient VIH threshold noise margin.

[1]    All the timing values are valid within the operating supply voltage and ambient temperature range and refer to VIL and VIH with an input
       voltage swing of VSS to VDD.
[2]    tpu(R) and tpu(W) are the delays required from the time VDD is stable until the specified operation can be initiated. These parameters are
       guaranteed by design.
[3]    Tcy(W) is the maximum time that the device requires to perform the internal write operation.

14. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 29) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 8 and 9

                      < 1.6                         260                 260                  260

                      > 2.5                         250                 245                  245
                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 29.
