                  Rev. 7 — 30 May 2013                                                  Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9674/74A provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion via the two-wire
              bidirectional I2C-bus (serial clock (SCL), serial data (SDA)).
              The devices consist of eight quasi-bidirectional ports, 1 MHz I2C-bus Fast-mode Plus
              (Fm+) family interface, with high speed data transfer it can support PWM dimming of
              LEDs, and higher I2C-bus drive 30 mA for more devices can be on the bus without the
              need for bus buffers. Three hardware address inputs and interrupt output operating
              between 2.3 V and 5.5 V. The quasi-bidirectional port can be independently assigned as
              an input to monitor interrupt status or keypads, or as an output to activate indicator
              devices such as LEDs. The system master can read from the input port or write to the
              output port through a single register.
              The low current consumption of 4.5 A (typical, static) is great for mobile applications and
              the latched output ports have 25 mA high current sink drive capability for directly driving
              LEDs.
              The PCA9674 and PCA9674A are identical except for the different, non-overlapping slave
              address. The three hardware selectable address pins can be decode to 64 addresses for
              the PCA9674 and 62 addresses for the PCA9674A, so there can be up to 126 of these I/O
              expanders PCA9674/74A together on the same I2C-bus without the need for bus buffers,
              supporting up to 1008 I/Os (for example, 1008 LEDs).
              The active LOW open-drain interrupt output (INT) can be connected to the interrupt logic
              of the microcontroller and is activated when any input state differs from its corresponding
              input port register state. It is used to indicate to the microcontroller that an input state has
              changed and the device needs to be interrogated without the microcontroller continuously
              polling the input register via the I2C-bus.
              The internal Power-On Reset (POR) initializes the I/Os as inputs with a weak internal
              pull-up 100 A current source.

                       [1]  HVQFN16 package die supply ground is connected to both the VSS pin and the exposed center pad. The
                            VSS pin must be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical,
                            and board-level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding
                            thermal pad on the board, and for proper heat conduction through the board thermal vias need to be
                            incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                       accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address format of the
                       PCA9674/PCA9674A is shown in Figure 6. Slave address pins AD2, AD1, and AD0 are
                       used to choose 1 of 64 slave addresses. These devices can monitor the change in SDA or
                       SCL in addition to the static levels of VDD or VSS to decode four states allowing a larger
                       address range. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors are incorporated on AD2,
                       AD1 or AD0 so they must be externally connected to VDD, VSS directly or through
                       resistors, or directly to SCL or SDA. The address values depending on AD2, AD1 and
                       AD0 can be found in Table 4 “PCA9674 address map” and Table 5 “PCA9674A address
                       map”.
                       Remark: When using the PCA9674A, the General Call address (0000 0000b) and the
                       Device ID address (1111 100Xb) are reserved and cannot be used as device address.
                       Failure to follow this requirement will cause the PCA9674A not to acknowledge.
                       Remark: When using the PCA9674 or the PCA9674A, reserved I2C-bus addresses must
                       be used with caution since they can interfere with:
                         • “reserved for future use” I2C-bus addresses (0000 011, 1111 101, 1111 110, 1111 111)
                         • slave devices that use the 10-bit addressing scheme (1111 0xx)
                         • High speed mode (Hs-mode) master code (0000 1xx)

                       The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a
                       read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation.
                       When AD2, AD1 and AD0 are held to VDD or VSS, the same address as the PCF8574 or
                       PCF8574A or the newer PCA8574 or PCA8574A is applied.
                 7.1.1 Address maps
                       The PCA9674 and PCA9674A are functionally the same, but have non-overlapping
                       address ranges. This allows 64 of the PCA9674 devices and 62 of the PCA9674A devices
                       to be on the same I2C-bus without address conflict.

                         • General Call address: allows to reset the PCA9674; PCA9674A through the I2C-bus
                           upon reception of the right I2C-bus sequence. See Section 7.2.1 “Software Reset” for

                 7.2.1 Software Reset
                       The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up
                       state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it
                       implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the bus.
                       The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
                        1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                        2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write)
                           is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                        3. The PCA9674; PCA9674A device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the General Call
                           address ‘0000 0000’ (00h) only. If the R/W bit is set to 1 (read), no acknowledge is
                           returned to the I2C-bus master.
                        4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
                           1 byte. The value of the byte must be equal to 06h.
                           a. The PCA9674; PCA9674A acknowledges this value only. If the byte is not equal to
                               06h, the PCA9674; PCA9674A does not acknowledge it.
                           If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the PCA9674; PCA9674A does not acknowledge
                           any more.
                        5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a
                           STOP command to end the Software Reset sequence: the PCA9674; PCA9674A
                           then resets to the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again
                           within the specified bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no
                           reset is performed.

                       The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9674; PCA9674A (at
                       any time) as a ‘Software Reset Abort’. The PCA9674; PCA9674A does not initiate a reset
                       of its registers.
                       The unique sequence that initiates a Software Reset is described in Figure 9.

                        Fig 9.    Software Reset sequence
                       Simple code for Software Reset:

                 7.2.2 Device ID (PCA9674; PCA9674A ID field)
                       The Device ID field is a 3-byte read-only (24 bits) word giving the following information:
                        • 12 bits with the manufacturer name, unique per manufacturer (for example, NXP).
                        • 9 bits with the part identification, assigned by manufacturer.
                        • 3 bits with the die revision, assigned by manufacturer (for example, Rev X).
                       The Device ID is read-only, hardwired in the device and can be accessed as follows:
                        1. START command
                        2. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address ‘1111 100’ with the R/W
                            bit set to 0 (write).
                        3. The master sends the I2C-bus slave address of the slave device it needs to identify.
                            The LSB is a ‘Don’t care’ value. Only one device must acknowledge this byte (the one
                            that has the I2C-bus slave address).
                        4. The master sends a Re-START command.
                            Remark: A STOP command followed by a START command will reset the slave state
                            machine and the Device ID read cannot be performed.
                            Remark: A STOP command or a Re-START command followed by an access to
                            another slave device will reset the slave state machine and the Device ID read cannot
                            be performed.
                        5. The master sends the Reserved Device ID I2C-bus address ‘1111 100’ with the R/W
                            bit set to 1 (read).
                        6. The device ID read can be done, starting with the 12 manufacturer bits (first byte +
                            4 MSB of the second byte), followed by the 9 part identification bits and then the
                            3 die revision bits (3 LSB of the third byte).
                        7. The master ends the reading sequence by NACKing the last byte, thus resetting the
                            slave device state machine and allowing the master to send the STOP command.

                                     Remark: The reading of the Device ID can be stopped anytime by sending a NACK
                                     command.
                                     Remark: If the master continues to ACK the bytes after the third byte, the PCA9674;
                                     PCA9674A rolls back to the first byte and keeps sending the Device ID sequence until
                                     a NACK has been detected.
                                     For the PCA9674; PCA9674A, the Device ID is as shown in Figure 10.

8. I/O programming
                   8.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/Os
                       A quasi-bidirectional I/O is an input or output port without using a direction control register.
                       Whenever the master reads the register, the value returned to master depends on the
                       actual voltage or status of the pin. At power-on, all the ports are HIGH with a weak 100 A
                       internal pull-up to VDD, but can be driven LOW by an internal transistor, or an external
                       signal. The I/O ports are entirely independent of each other, but each I/O octal is
                       controlled by the same read or write data byte.
                       Advantages of the quasi-bidirectional I/O over totem pole I/O include:
                         • Better for driving LEDs since the p-channel (transistor to VDD) is small, which saves
                             die size and therefore cost. LED drive only requires an internal transistor to ground,
                             while the LED is connected to VDD through a current-limiting resistor. Totem pole I/O
                             have both n-channel and p-channel transistors, which allow solid HIGH and LOW
                             output levels without a pull-up resistor — good for logic levels.
                         • Simpler architecture — only a single register and the I/O can be both input and output
                             at the same time. Totem pole I/O have a direction register that specifies the port pin
                             direction and it is always in that configuration unless the direction is explicitly
                             changed.
                         • Does not require a command byte. The simplicity of one register (no need for the
                             pointer register or, technically, the command byte) is an advantage in some
                             embedded systems where every byte counts because of memory or bandwidth
                             limitations.
                       There is only one register to control four possibilities of the port pin: Input HIGH, input
                       LOW, output HIGH, or output LOW.
                          Input HIGH: The master needs to write 1 to the register to set the port as an input mode
                          if the device is not in the default power-on condition. The master reads the register to
                          check the input status. If the external source pulls the port pin up to VDD or drives
                          logic 1, then the master will read the value of 1.
                          Input LOW: The master needs to write 1 to the register to set the port to input mode if
                          the device is not in the default power-on condition. The master reads the register to
                          check the input status. If the external source pulls the port pin down to VSS or drives
                          logic 0, which sinks the weak 100 A current source, then the master will read the value
                          of 0.
                          Output HIGH: The master writes 1 to the register. There is an additional ‘accelerator’ or
                          strong pull-up current when the master sets the port HIGH. The additional strong pull-up
                          is only active during the HIGH time of the acknowledge clock cycle. This accelerator
                          current helps the port’s 100 A current source make a faster rising edge into a heavily
                          loaded output, but only at the start of the acknowledge clock cycle to avoid bus
                          contention if an external signal is pulling the port LOW to VSS/driving the port with
                          logic 0 at the same time. After the half clock cycle there is only the 100 A current
                         source to hold the port HIGH.
                         Output LOW: The master writes 0 to the register. There is a strong current sink
                         transistor that holds the port pin LOW. A large current may flow into the port, which
                         could potentially damage the part if the master writes a 0 to the register and an external
                         source is pulling the port HIGH at the same time.

                         8.2 Writing to the port (Output mode)
                                  The master (microcontroller) sends the START condition and slave address setting the
                                  last bit of the address byte to logic 0 for the write mode. The PCA9674/74A acknowledges
                                  and the master then sends the data byte for P7 to P0 to the port register. As the clock line
                                  goes HIGH, the 8-bit data is presented on the port lines after it has been acknowledged by
                                  the PCA9674/74A. If a LOW is written, the strong pull-down turns on and stays on. If a
                                  HIGH is written, the strong pull-up turns on for 1⁄2 of the clock cycle, then the line is held
                                  HIGH by the weak current source. The master can then send a STOP or ReSTART
                                  condition or continue sending data. The number of data bytes that can be sent
                                  successively is not limited and the previous data is overwritten every time a data byte has
                                  been sent and acknowledged.
                                  Ensure a logic 1 is written for any port that is being used as an input to ensure the strong
                                  external pull-down is turned off.

                        8.3 Reading from a port (Input mode)
                                  The port must have been previously written to logic 1, which is the condition after
                                  power-on reset or software reset. To enter the Read mode the master (microcontroller)
                                  addresses the slave device and sets the last bit of the address byte to logic 1 (address
                                  byte read). The slave will acknowledge and then send the data byte to the master. The
                                  master will NACK and then send the STOP condition or ACK and read the input register
                                  again.
                                  The read of any pin being used as an output will indicate HIGH or LOW depending on the
                                  actual state of the pin.
                                  If the data on the input port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be
                                  lost. The DATA 2 and DATA 3 are lost because these data did not meet the set-up time
                                  and hold time (see Figure 14).
                                                                                                                                                          no acknowledge

              A LOW-to-HIGH transition of SDA while SCL is HIGH is defined as the STOP condition (P). Transfer of data can be stopped at
              any moment by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the last acknowledge phase is valid (Output mode). Input
              data is lost.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 PCA9674; PCA9674A
                                                                    Remote 8-bit I/O expander for Fm+ I2C-bus with interrupt
                   8.4 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9674;
                       PCA9674A in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCA9674; PCA9674A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state
                       machine will initialize to their default states of all I/O inputs with weak current source to
                       VDD. Thereafter VDD must be lowered below VPOR and back up to the operation voltage for
                       power-on reset cycle.
                   8.5 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The PCA9674/74A provides an open-drain output (INT) which can be fed to a
                       corresponding input of the microcontroller (see Figure 15). As soon as a port input is
                       changed, the INT will be active (LOW) and notify the microcontroller.
                       An interrupt is generated at any rising or falling edge of the port inputs. After time tv(Q), the
                       signal INT is valid.
                       The interrupt will reset to HIGH when data on the port is changed to the original setting or
                       data is read or written by the master.
                       In the Write mode, the interrupt may become de-activated (HIGH) on the rising edge of
                       the acknowledge bit of the data byte and also on the rising edge of the write to port pulse.
                       The interrupt will always be reset (HIGH) on the falling edge of the write to port pulse (see
                       Figure 13).
                       The interrupt is reset (HIGH) in the Read mode on the rising edge of the acknowledge of
                       slave address byte and on the rising edge of the read from port pulse (see Figure 14).
                       During the interrupt reset, any I/O change close to the read or write pulse may not
                       generate an interrupt, or the interrupt will have a very short pulse. After the interrupt is
                       reset, any change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as an INT.
                       At power-on reset all ports are in Input mode and the initial state of the ports is HIGH,
                       therefore, for any port pin that is pulled LOW or driven LOW by external source, the
                       interrupt output will be active (output LOW).

9. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   9.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 16).

                 9.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S).
                       A LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 17).

                   9.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 18).

                          by the receiving device) that indicates to the transmitter that the data transfer was
                          successful.
                          A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                          each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                          that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that wants to issue an
                          acknowledge bit has to pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so
                          that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge bit related
                          clock pulse; set-up and hold times must be taken into account.
                          A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                          acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                          transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                          condition.

10. Application design-in information
                 10.1 Bidirectional I/O expander applications
                      In the 8-bit I/O expander application shown in Figure 20, P0 and P1 are inputs, and
                      P2 to P7 are outputs. When used in this configuration, during a write, the input (P0 and
                      P1) must be written as HIGH so the external devices fully control the input ports.
                      The desired HIGH or LOW logic levels may be written to the ports used as outputs (P2 to
                      P7). If 10 A internal output HIGH is not enough current source, the port needs external
                      pull-up resistor. During a read, the logic levels of the external devices driving the input
                      ports (P0 and P1) and the previous written logic level to the output ports (P2 to P7) will be
                      read.
                      The GPIO also has an interrupt line (INT) that can be connected to the interrupt logic of
                      the microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O informs the
                      microprocessor that there has been a change of data on its ports without having to
                      communicate via the I2C-bus.
                                                                                                                                         VDD

                 10.2 How to read and write to I/O expander (example)
                      In the application example of PCA9674 shown in Figure 20, the microcontroller wants to
                      control the P3 switch ON and the P7 LED ON when the temperature sensor P0 changes.
                       1. When the system powers on:
                           Core Processor needs to issue an initial command to set P0 and P1 as inputs and
                           P[7:2] as outputs with value 1010 00 (LED off, MP3 off, camera on, audio off,
                           switch off and latch off).
                       2. Operation:
                           When the temperature changes above the threshold, the temperature sensor signal
                           will toggle from HIGH to LOW. The INT will be activated and notifies the ‘core
                           processor’ that there have been changes on the input pins. Read the input register.
                           If P0 = 0 (temperature sensor has changed), then turn on LED and turn on switch.
                       3. Software code:
                           //System Power on
                           // write to PCA9674 with data 1010 0011b to set P[7:2] outputs and P[1:0] inputs

                                      and keep P[1:0] as input ports.

                    10.3 High current-drive load applications
                            The GPIO has a minimum guaranteed sinking current of 25 mA per bit at 5 V. In
                            applications requiring additional drive, two port pins may be connected together to sink up
                            to 50 mA current. Both bits must then always be turned on or off together. Up to 8 pins can
                            be connected together to drive 200 mA, which is the device recommended total limit.
                            Each pin needs its own limiting resistor as shown in Figure 21 to prevent damage to the
                            device should all ports not be turned on at the same time.
                                                                            VDD

[1]    tVD;ACK = time for Acknowledgement signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
[2]    tVD;DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
[3]    Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
[4]    A master device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to the VIL of the SCL signal) in order to
       bridge the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
[5]    The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at
       250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without
       exceeding the maximum specified tf.
[6]    Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.

                      All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                      normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                      described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                      This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                      of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                      soldering description”.
                 17.1 Introduction to soldering
                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                 17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                        • Through-hole components
                        • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                      Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                      packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                      leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                      due to an increased probability of bridging.
                      The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                      component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                      packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                      Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                        •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                        •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                        •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                        •  Package placement
                        •  Inspection and repair
                        •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                           transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                           exposed to the wave
                        • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                 17.4 Reflow soldering
                      Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                        • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                           higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 26) than a SnPb process, thus
                           reducing the process window
                        • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                           window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                        • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is

                           temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                           characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                           packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                           depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
