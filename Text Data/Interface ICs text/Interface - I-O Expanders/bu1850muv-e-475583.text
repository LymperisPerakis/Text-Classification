●Functional Description
    1. Power Modes
        The device enters the state of Power Down when XRST=”Low” or enters the operation state when XRST=High after
        powered.
        Refer to “Electrical Specification” section 5 for a detailed startup sequence.
        1-1 Power supply
             A single supply to Core power supply (VDD) and IO power supply (VDDIO) is prohibited.
             Supply the power supply to the Core power supply and the IO power supply at the same time.
        1-2 Power On Reset
             A Power On Reset logic is implemented in this device. Therefore, it will operate correctly even if the XRST port is
            not used. In this case, the XRST port must be connected to high(VDD).
        1-3 State of Power Down
                                                                                                                  2
            The device enters the state of Power Down by XRST=”Low”. An internal circuit is initialized and I C interface is
            invalid is input. Power On Reset becomes inactive during this state.
        1-4 State of operation
             The device enters the operation state by setting XRST to "High". The I2C interface starts communication is
             the START condition. It becomes standby by the STOP condition. Power On Reset is active in this state.

    2.  I C Bus Interface
         Each function of GPIO is controlled by an internal register. The I2C Slave interface is used to write or read this internal
         register. The device supports up to 400kHz Fast-mode data transfer rate.
         2-1 Slave address
              Two device addresses (Slave address) can be selected by ADR port.

         2-2    Data transfer
              One bit of data is transferred during SCL = “1”. During the bit transfer SCL = “1” cycle, the signal SDA should
              keep the value. If SDA changes during SCL = “1”, a START condition or STOP condition occur and it is interpreted
              as a control signal.

         2-3 START-STOP-Repeated START conditions
              When SDA and SCL are “1”, the data isn’t transferred on the 2-wire bus. If SCL remains “1” and SDA transfers
              from “1” to “0”, it means a “Start condition” is occurred and access is started.
              If SCL remains “1” and SDA transfers from “0” to “1”, it means a “Stop condition” is occurred and access is
              stopped.
              It becomes repeated START condition (Sr) the START condition enters again although the STOP condition is not
              done.

        2-4 Acknowledge
            After start condition is occurred, 8 bits data will be transferred. SDA is latched by the rising edge of SCL.
            Then the “Master” opens SDA to “1” and “Slave” de-asserts SDA to “0” as an “Acknowledge” returned.
                                                                   Fig.7 Acknowledge
        2-5 Writing protocol
            Register address is transferred after one byte of slave address with R/W bit. The 3rd byte data is written to internal
            register which defined by the 2nd byte. However, when the register address increased to the final address (13h), it
            will be reset to (00h) after the byte transfer.

        2-6 Reading protocol
            After Writing the slave address and Read/Write commend bits, the next byte is read. The reading register address
            is next of previous accessed address. Therefore, the data is read with address increment. When the address in
            increased to the last, the following read address will be reset to (00h).

        2-7 Complex reading protocol
            After the specifying the internal register address, a repeated START condition occurs and the direction of data
            transfer is changed then reading access is done. Therefore, the data is read followed by address increment. If the
            address is increased to the last, it will be reset to (00h).

    4. GPIO-Interrupt
          4-1 GPIO configuration
                   As the default value, GPIO[7:0] ports are input and Pull-down.
                   At this time, WRSELn is "0" and XPDn is "0". (n is the number of GPIO[7:0] ports.)
                Refer to the following for the configuration of GPIO.
                                                                                                         Register

                      Make external Pull-up the terminal potential which is the potential of VVDDIO or more.
                      About GPIO port not used
                        When making it to the output, open it.
                        When making it to the input, do not open it. It is forced by "0" or Pull-down on.
                        When interrupt is enabled, mask INTEN register in which the port is not used to "0".
          4-2 Interrupt configuration
                   When interrupt is generated, L is output from XINT port. The default value is Hi-Z. Make it Pull-up.
                   For the default value, interrupt is masked with INTEN register "0".
                   The bit to be used is made "1", and the mask is released. WRSEL register should be "0"(input).
          4-3 Write to GPIO port
                   After setting the internal register address, the data from master is written from MSB.
                   After Acknowledge is returned, the value of each GPIO port will be changed.
                   When the register is written, Write Configuration Pulse is generated according to the timing of Acknowledge.

        4-4 Read from GPIO port
            After writing of the Slave address and R/W bits, reading GPIO port is begun from the following byte.
            The data that had been being fixed between the following Acknowledge after Acknowledge is taken into the GPI
            register, and it is transmitted to Master.
            All ports that are the input by WRSEL register are read to the GPI register according to the timing of Read
            Configuration Pulse. Therefore, the data of each bit that SDA transmits is the GPI register value taken immediately
            before that.

            If GPIO port becomes different from the GPIn register (default is "0"), XINT port is changed from "1" into "0".
            It becomes "1" to release "0" of XINT port after acknowledge by reading GPI register. Because the value of GPIO
            port is reflected in the output as it is and is not latched, XINT becomes "1" again if the port returns to the same
            value.
            If the ports with INTEN register "1" are different even by one, XINT becomes "0".
            If it is distinguished which GPIO port changes, it is necessary to keep the GPI register value on the master side
            and compare with the value that is read after XINT is asserted.

           In this case, connect XRST port with VDD on the set PCB.
    Note) At VDD=0V, when SCL port is changed from 0V to 0.5V or more, SCL port pulls the current. It is same in SDA, XINT,
            and GPIO[7:0] ports of 3V tolerant I/O. (VDDIO=0V in case of GPIO[7:0] ports)

              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (even if you use no-clean type fluxes, cleaning residue of
                 flux is recommended); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble cleaning agents for cleaning
                 residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse. is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation (Pd) depending on Ambient temperature (Ta). When used in sealed area, confirm the actual
        ambient temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
