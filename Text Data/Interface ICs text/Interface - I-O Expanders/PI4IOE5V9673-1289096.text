Details Description
      a. Device address
       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is accessing and the
operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address of the PI4IOE5V9673 is shown in bellow. Slave
address pins AD1, and AD0 choose 1 of 16 slave addresses. To conserve power, no internal pull-up resistors
are incorporated on AD2, AD1, and AD0. Address values depending on AD1, and AD0 can be found in
Table “PI4IOE5V9673 address map”.
       Remark: The General Call address (0000 0000b) and the Device ID address (1111 100Xb) are reserved
and cannot be used as device address. Failure to follow this requirement will cause the PI4IOE5V9673 not to
acknowledge.
       Remark: Reserved I2C-bus addresses must be used with caution since they can interfere with:
      • “reserved for future use” I2C-bus addresses (0000 011, 1111 101, 1111 110, 1111 111)
      • slave devices that use the 10-bit addressing scheme (1111 0xx)

         Address
Software Reset
      The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up state value through a specific
formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it implies that the I 2C-bus is functional and that there is no device
hanging the bus.
      The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
      1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
      2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write) is sent by the I2C-bus master.
      3. The device acknowledges after seeing the General Call address ‘0000 0000’ (00h) only. If the R/W bit is set to 1 (read), no
acknowledge is returned to the I2C-bus master.
      4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends 1 byte. The value of the byte must be
equal to 06h.
       a. The device acknowledges this value only. If the byte is not equal to 06h, the device does not acknowledge it.
       b. If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the device does not acknowledge any more.
      5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a STOP command to end the Software
Reset sequence: the device then resets to the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again within the specified
bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no reset is performed.
      The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the device (at any time) as a ‘Software Reset Abort’. The device
does not initiate a reset of its registers.
      The unique sequence that initiates a Software Reset is described in Figure 5.

Quasi-bidirectional I/O architecture
      The PI4IOE5V9673’s 16 ports (see Figure 6) are entirely independent and can be used either as input or output ports. Input
data is transferred from the ports to the microcontroller in the Read mode. Output data is transmitted to the ports in the Write mode.
      Every data transmission from the PI4IOE5V9673 must consist of an even number of bytes, the first byte will be referred to as
P07 to P00, and the second byte as P17 to P10. The third will be referred to as P07 to P00, and so on.
      This quasi-bidirectional I/O can be used as an input or output without the use of a control signal for data directions. At power-
on the I/Os are HIGH. In this mode only a current source (I OH) to VCC is active. An additional strong pull-up to VCC (Itrt(pu))
allows fast rising edges into heavily loaded outputs. These devices turn on when an output is written HIGH, and are switched off
by the negative edge of SCL. The I/Os should be HIGH before being used as inputs. After power-on, as all the I/Os are set HIGH,
all of them can be used as inputs. Any change in setting of the I/Os as either inputs or outputs can be done with the write mode.
      Remark: If a HIGH is applied to an I/O which has been written earlier to LOW, a large current (I OL) will flow to GND.
                                              Figure 6.Simplified schematic diagram of P00 to P17
Writing to the port (Output mode)
      To write, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device. By setting the last bit of the byte containing the slave
address to logic 0 the Write mode is entered. The PI4IOE5V9673 acknowledges and the master sends the first data byte for P07 to
P00. After the first data byte is acknowledged by the PI4IOE5V9673, the second data byte P17 to P10 is sent by the master. Once
again, the PI4IOE5V9673 acknowledges the receipt of the data. Each 8-bit data is presented on the port lines after it has been
acknowledged by the PI4IOE5V9673.
      The number of data bytes that can be sent successively is not limited. After every two bytes, the previous data is overwritten.
      The first data byte in every pair refers to Port 0 (P07 to P00), whereas the second data byte in every pair refers to Port 1 (P17
to P10).

Reading from a port (Input mode)
      All ports programmed as input should be set to logic 1. To read, the master (microcontroller) first addresses the slave device
after it receives the interrupt. By setting the last bit of the byte containing the slave address to logic 1 the Read mode is entered.
      The data bytes that follow on the SDA are the values on the ports.
      If the data on the input port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be lost. Transfer of data can be stopped at
any moment by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge phase is valid.
                                                         Figure 9.Read input port register
Power-on reset
      When power is applied to VCC, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PI4IOE5V9673 in a reset condition until VCC
has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the PI4IOE5V9673 registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state
machine will initialize to their default states. Thereafter VCC must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
Interrupt output (INT)
      The PI4IOE5V9673 provides an open-drain interrupt (INT) which can be fed to a corresponding input of the microcontroller.
This gives these chips a kind of master function which can initiate an action elsewhere in the system.
      An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs. After time t (V)D the signal INT is valid.
      The interrupt disappears when data on the port is changed to the original setting or data is read from or written to the device
which has generated the interrupt.
      In the write mode, the interrupt may become deactivated (HIGH) on the rising edge of the write to port pulse. On the falling
edge of the write to port pulse the interrupt is definitely deactivated (HIGH).
      The interrupt is reset in the read mode on the rising edge of the read from port pulse.
      During the resetting of the interrupt itself, any changes on the I/Os may not generate an interrupt. After the interrupt is reset
any change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as an INT.

RESET input
      A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The PI4IOE5V9673 registers and
I2C-bus state machine will be held in their default state until the RESET input is once again HIGH. The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-
line communication between different ICs or modules. The two lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL).
Both lines must be connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages of a device. Data
transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
Bidirectional I/O expander applications
      In the 8-bit I/O expander application shown in Figure 11, P00 and P01 are inputs, and P02 to P07 are outputs. When used in
this configuration, during a write, the input (P00 and P01) must be written as HIGH so the external devices fully control the input
ports. The desired HIGH or LOW logic levels may be written to the I/Os used as outputs (P02 to P07). During a read, the logic
levels of the external devices driving the input ports (P00 and P01) and the previous written logic level to the output ports (P02 to
P07) will be read. The GPIO also has an interrupt line (INT) that can be connected to the interrupt logic of the microprocessor. By
sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O informs the microprocessor that there is incoming data or a change of data
on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus.

High current-drive load applications
      The GPIO has a maximum sinking current of 25 mA per bit. In applications requiring additional drive, two port pins in the
same octal may be connected together to sink up to 50 mA current. Both bits must then always be turned on or off together. Up to
8 pins (one octal) can be connected together to drive 200 mA.
