 Setup Time
Note 1: All parameters are tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
Note 2: A master device must provide a hold time of at least 300ns for the SDA signal (referred to VIL of the SCL signal) in order to
          bridge the undefined region of SCL’s falling edge.
Note 3: Guaranteed by design.
Note 4: Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF. tR and tF measured between 0.3 x V+ and 0.7 x V+ with ISINK ≤ 6mA.
Note 5: Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50ns.
