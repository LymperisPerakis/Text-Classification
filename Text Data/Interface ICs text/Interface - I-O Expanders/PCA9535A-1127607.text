1. General description
              The PCA9535A is a low-voltage 16-bit General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) expander
              with interrupt and reset for I2C-bus/SMBus applications. NXP I/O expanders provide a
              simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while keeping interconnections to a
              minimum, for example, in ACPI power switches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fan control,
              etc.
              In addition to providing a flexible set of GPIOs, the wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V
              allows the PCA9535A to interface with next-generation microprocessors and
              microcontrollers where supply levels are dropping down to conserve power.
              The PCA9535A contains the PCA9535 register set of four pairs of 8-bit Configuration,
              Input, Output, and Polarity Inversion registers.
              The PCA9535A is a pin-to-pin replacement to the PCA9535 and other industry-standard
              devices. A more fully featured device, the PCAL9535A, is available with Agile I/O
              features. See the respective data sheet for more details.
              The PCA9535A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
              from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system
              master that an input state has changed.
              INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
              signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
              on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCA9535A can
              remain a simple slave device.
              The device outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while consuming
              low device current.
              The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
              machine.
              Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) select the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
              devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       [1]  HWQFN24 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must
                            be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board
                            level performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad

                          A2, A1 and A0 are the hardware address package pins and are held to either HIGH
                          (logic 1) or LOW (logic 0) to assign one of the eight possible slave addresses. The last bit
                          of the slave address (R/W) defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH
                          (logic 1) selects a read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.
                   6.2 Registers
                 6.2.1 Pointer register and command byte
                          Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                          command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCA9535A. The lower
                          three bits of this data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers
                          (Input, Output, Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that will be affected. This register is
                          write only.

                      The Input port registers (registers 0 and 1) reflect the incoming logic levels of the pins,
                      regardless of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration
                      register. The Input port registers are read only; writes to these registers have no effect.
                      The default value ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port
                      register read operation is performed as described in Section 7.2 “Reading the port
                      registers”.

                      The Output port registers (registers 2 and 3) show the outgoing logic levels of the pins
                      defined as outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no
                      effect on pins defined as inputs. In turn, reads from these registers reflect the value that
                      was written to these registers, not the actual pin value. A register pair write is described in
                      Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      The Polarity inversion registers (registers 4 and 5) allow polarity inversion of pins defined
                      as inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in these registers is set (written with ‘1’), the
                      corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted in the Input register. If a bit in this register is
                      cleared (written with a ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s polarity is retained. A register pair
                      write is described in Section 7.1 and a register pair read is described in Section 7.2.

                      bit in these registers is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a
                      high-impedance input. If a bit in these registers is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin
                      is enabled as an output. A register pair write is described in Section 7.1 and a register pair
                      read is described in Section 7.2.

                   6.3 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                                                                                      Low-voltage 16-bit I2C-bus I/O port with interrupt
                   6.4 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9535A
                       in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset condition is
                       released and the PCA9535A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine initializes to
                       their default states. After that, VDD must be lowered to below VPORF and back up to the
                       operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 8.2 “Power-on reset requirements”.
                   6.5 Interrupt output
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. The interrupt is reset when data on the port
                       changes back to the original value or when data is read form the port that generated the
                       interrupt (see Figure 10 and Figure 11). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the
                       acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL
                       signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very
                       short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Any change of the I/Os after
                       resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input Port register.
7. Bus transactions
                       The PCA9535A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                       PCA9535A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   7.1 Writing to the port registers
                       Data is transmitted to the PCA9535A by sending the device address and setting the least
                       significant bit to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 “PCA9535A device address”). The command byte
                       is sent after the address and determines which register will receive the data following the
                       command byte.
                       Eight registers within the PCA9535A are configured to operate as four register pairs. The
                       four pairs are input port, output port, polarity inversion, configuration registers. After
                       sending data to one register, the next data byte is sent to the other register in the pair (see
                       Figure 7 and Figure 8). For example, if the first byte is sent to Output Port 1 (register 3),
                       the next byte is stored in Output Port 0 (register 2).
                       There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this
                       way, the host can continuously update a register pair independently of the other registers,
                       or the host can simply update a single register.

                                In order to read data from the PCA9535A, the bus master must first send the PCA9535A
                                address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 4 “PCA9535A device
                                address”). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will
                                be accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent again, but this time the least
                                significant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte is
                                sent by the PCA9535A (see Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11). Data is clocked into the
                                register on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is read,
                                additional bytes may be read but the data now reflects the information in the other register
                                in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 is read, the next byte read is Input Port 0. There is
                                no limit on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final
                                byte received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.
                                After a subsequent restart, the command byte contains the value of the next register to be
                                read in the pair. For example, if Input Port 1 was read last before the restart, the register
                                that is read after the restart is the Input Port 0.

         (1) External resistors are required for high impedance inputs (on P port) that may float. If external driver is totem pole or push-pull
              to an input port, then external resistor is not needed. The output in the P port is designed as a push-pull output; there is no need
              for external pull-up resistors.

                       8.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/Os are used to control LEDs
                                 When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                                 resistor as shown in Figure 12. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the I/O
                                 VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes lower
                                 than VDD.
                                 Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                                 should consider maintaining the I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                                 Figure 13 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 14 shows VDD less
                                 than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                                 at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.

                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCA9535A can be reset to its default conditions
                       by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device go through a
                       power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device is
                       powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 15 and Figure 16.

                                Glitches in the power supply can also affect the power-on reset performance of this

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 18 and Table 13 provide more details on this specification.

16. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 31) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 20 and 21

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 31.
