  In applications where high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance
  are present, the maximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.
  Maximum ambient temperature (TA(MAX)) is dependent on the maximum
  operating junction temperature (TJ(MAXOP) = 125°C), the maximum power
  dissipation of the device (PD(MAX)), and the junction-to-ambient thermal
  resistance of the part/package in the application (θJA), using the following
  equation: TA(MAX) = TJ(MAXOP) − (θJA × PD(MAX)).
Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings
may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress
rating only; functional operation of the device at these or any
other conditions above those indicated in the operational
section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute
maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect
device reliability.
Absolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in
combination. Unless otherwise specified, all other voltages are
referenced to ground.

such as key press and key release. However, it is possible to                                                             EC = 2

The FIFO is composed of 16 eight-bit sections that the user
accesses by reading the FIFO_x registers. The actual FIFO
is not in user accessible registers until a read occurs. The

FIFO can be thought of as a “first in, first out” buffer used
to fill Register 0x03 to Register 0x12.

5             LOGIC2_INT           R/W    0 = no interrupt.
                                          1 = interrupt due to a general Logic 2 condition.
                                          Write a 1 to this bit to clear it.
4             LOGIC1_INT           R/W    0 = no interrupt.
                                          1 = interrupt due to a general Logic 1 condition.
                                          Write a 1 to this bit to clear it.
3             LOCK_INT             R/W    0 = no interrupt.
                                          1 = interrupt due to a lock/unlock condition.
                                          The user can read LOCK_STAT (0x02[5]) to determine if LOCK_INT is due to a lock or unlock event.
                                          If LOCK_STAT = 1, LOCK_INT is due to a lock event.
                                          If LOCK_STAT = 0, LOCK_INT is due to an unlock event.
                                          Write a 1 to this bit to clear it.
                                          If lock mode is enabled via the software bit LOCK_EN (0x37[0]), a LOCK_INT is not generated
                                          because the processor knows it just enabled lock mode.
                                          If lock mode is disabled (while locked) via the software bit LOCK_EN, a LOCK_INT is not generated
                                          because the processor knows it just disabled lock mode.
2             OVRFLOW_INT          R/W    0 = no interrupt.
                                          1 = interrupt due to an overflow condition.
                                          Write a 1 to this bit to clear it.
1             GPI_INT              R/W    0 = no interrupt.
                                          1 = interrupt due to a general GPI condition.
                                          This bit is not set by a GPI that has been configured to update the FIFO and event count.
                                          Write a 1 to this bit to clear it.
                                          This bit cannot be cleared until all GPI_x_INT bits are cleared.
0             EVENT_INT            R/W    0 = no interrupt.
                                          1 = interrupt due to key event (press/release), GPI event (GPI programmed for FIFO updates), or
                                          Logic 1/Logic 2 event (programmed for FIFO updates).Write a 1 to this bit to clear it.

                                         Table 11 outlines each event number, what it represents, and the I/O pins associated with it.
                                         Bit 7 is the Event 1 state.
[6:0]      EVENT1_IDENTIFIER[6:0]        This bit represents the state of the event that is recorded in EVENT1_IDENTIFIER[6:0].
                                         For key events (Event 1 to Event 96).
                                         1 = key is pressed.
                                         0 = key is released.
                                         For GPI and logic events (Event 97 to Event 117).
                                         1 = GPI/logic is active.
                                         0 = GPI/logic is inactive.
                                         Active and inactive states are programmable.

[7: 3]     INT_MASK_TIMER[4:0]      R/W   If the keypad is locked and this timer is set, any key event (or GPI/logic event
                                          programmed to FIFO update) is allowed to generate an EVENT_INT interrupt. This timer
                                          then begins counting, and no further events generate an interrupt until this timer has
                                          expired (or both unlock events have occurred).

                                          byte is written to. PWM count times are referenced from the internal oscillator. The fastest
