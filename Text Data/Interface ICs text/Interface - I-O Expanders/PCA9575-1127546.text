1. General description
             The PCA9575 is a CMOS device that provides 16 bits of General Purpose parallel
             Input/Output (GPIO) expansion in low voltage processor and handheld battery powered
             mobile applications and was developed to enhance the NXP family of I2C-bus I/O
             expanders. The improvements include lower supply current, lower operating voltage of
             1.1 V to 3.6 V, separate supply rails to allow voltage level translation anywhere between
             1.1 V and 3.6 V, 400 kHz clock frequency, and smaller packaging. Any of the 16 I/O ports
             can be configured as an input or output independent of each other and default on start-up
             to inputs.
             I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while keeping
             interconnections to a minimum; for example in battery powered mobile applications and
             clamshell devices for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, keypad, etc. In addition to
             providing a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of a processor running at
             one voltage level to I/O devices operating at a different (usually higher) voltage level.
             PCA9575 has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely flexible in
             mixed signal environments where communication between incompatible I/Os is required.
             The core of PCA9575 can operate at a voltage as low as 1.1 V while each I/O bank can
             operate in the range 1.1 V to 3.6 V. Bus hold with programmable on-chip pull-up or
             pull-down feature for I/Os is also provided.
             The output stage consists of two banks each of 8-bit configuration registers, input
             registers, interrupt mask registers, output registers, bus-hold and pull-up/pull-down
             registers and polarity inversion registers. These registers allow the system master to
             program and configure 16 GPIOs through the I2C-bus.
             The system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O
             configuration register bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding
             Input or Output register. The polarity of the read registers can be inverted with the Polarity
             Inversion register (active HIGH or active LOW operation). Either a bus-hold function or
             pull-up/pull-down feature can be selected by programming corresponding registers. The
             bus-hold provides a valid logic level when the I/O bus is not actively driven. When
             bus-hold feature is not selected, the I/O ports can be configured to have pull-up or
             pull-down by programming the pull-up/pull-down configuration register.
             An open-drain interrupt output pin (INT) allows monitoring of the input pins and is asserted
             each time a change occurs on an input port unless that port is masked
             (default = masked). A ‘GPIO All Call’ command allows programming multiple PCA9575s
             at the same time even if they have different individual I2C-bus addresses. This command
             allows optimal code programming when more than one device must be programmed with
             the same instruction or if all outputs must be turned on or off at the same time. The

                                                      16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, level translating, low voltage GPIO
                   internal Power-On Reset (POR) or hardware reset pin (RESET) initializes the two banks
                   of 8 I/Os as inputs, sets the registers to their default values and initializes the device state
                   machine. The I/O banks are held in its default state when the logic supply (VDD) is off.
                   The PCA9575 is available in 24-pin TSSOP, 28-pin TSSOP and HWQFN24 packages,
                   and is specified over the 40 C to +85 C industrial temperature range, with HWQFN24
                   up to +105 C.
                   The 28-pin package provides four address select pins, allowing up to 16 PCA9575
                   devices to be connected with 16 different addresses on the same I2C-bus.

                            be connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board
                            level performance, the exposed pad must be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on
                            the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias must be incorporated in the PCB

                                                          16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, level translating, low voltage GPIO
7. Functional description
                   7.1 I/O ports
                       The 16 I/O ports are organized as two banks of 8 ports each. The system master can
                       enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration register bits.
                       The data for each input or output is kept in the corresponding Input or Output register. The
                       polarity of the read register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register. Either a
                       bus-hold function or pull-up/pull-down feature can be selected by programming
                       corresponding registers. A bus-hold provides a valid logic level when the I/O bus is not
                       actively driven. It consists of a pair of buffers, one being weak (low drive-strength), that
                       latch the input at the last driven value. This prevents the input from floating while it is
                       being driven by a 3-state output. Latching the last valid logic state of input prevents it from
                       settling at a midpoint between VDD and ground that in turn consumes power. An active bus
                       driver can easily override the logic level set by the bus-keeper.
                       When bus-hold feature is not selected, the I/O ports can be configured to have pull-up or
                       pull-down by programming the pull-up/pull-down configuration register.
                   7.2 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                       accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). Address configuration for
                       the device depends on the package type chosen. The device offered in a 24-pin package
                       has a fixed slave address for the PCA9575 as shown in Figure 6.
                                                                                       slave address
                                                                         0      1       0       0        0      0    0  R/W
                                                                                              fixed                 002aad567

                       The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a
                       read is selected, while logic 0 selects a write operation.
                       The slave address for the 28-pin version of the PCA9575 is shown in Figure 7.

                                                            16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, level translating, low voltage GPIO
                   7.3 Command register
                         Following the successful acknowledgement of the slave address + R/W bit, the bus
                         master sends a byte to the PCA9575, which is stored in the Command register.
                                                                               AI      0       0       0       D3     D2   D1   D0

                                                                                                                           002aad568
                                    Reset state = 00h
                                    Remark: The Command register does not apply to Software Reset I2C-bus address.
                           Fig 8.   Command register
                         The lowest 4 bits are used as a pointer to determine which register is accessed. Only a
                         Command register code with the 4 least significant bits equal to the 16 allowable values
                         as defined in Table 4 “Register summary” is acknowledged. Reserved or undefined
                         command codes are not acknowledged. At power-up, this register defaults to 00h, with
                         the AI bit set to logic 0, and the lowest 4 bits set to logic 0.
                         If the Auto-Increment flag is set (AI = 1), the 4 least significant bits of the Command
                         register are automatically incremented after a read or write. This allows the user to
                         program and/or read the 16 command registers (listed in Table 4) sequentially. It will then
                         roll over to register 00h after the last register is accessed and the selected registers are
                         overwritten or re-read.
                         If the Auto-Increment flag is cleared (AI = 0), the 4 least significant bits are not
                         incremented after data is read or written, only one register will be repeatedly read or
                         written.

                   7.5 Writing to port registers
                         Data is transmitted to the PCA9575 by sending the device address and setting the least
                         significant bit to logic 0 (see Figure 6 or Figure 7 for device address). The command byte
                         is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data following the
                         command byte. Each 8-bit register may be updated independently of the other registers.
                   7.6 Reading the port registers
                         In order to read data from the PCA9575, the bus master must first send the PCA9575
                         address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 6 or Figure 7 for device
                         address). The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is
                         accessed. After a restart, the device address is sent again but this time, the least
                         significant bit is set to logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte will
                         then be sent by the PCA9575. Data is clocked into the register on the falling edge of the
                         acknowledge clock pulse. After the first byte is read, additional bytes may be read using
                         the auto-increment feature.
                7.6.1 Register 0 - Input port 0 register
                         This register is read-only. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless of
                         whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. Writes to
                         this register are acknowledged but have no effect.
                         The default ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level.

                   7.7 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9575 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA9575 registers and state machine initialize to their default states. The
                       power-on reset typically completes the reset and enables the part by the time the power
                       supply is above VPOR. However, when it is required to reset the part by lowering the power
                       supply, it is necessary to lower it below 0.2 V.
                   7.8 RESET input
                       A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a minimum of tw(rst). The
                       PCA9575 registers and I2C-bus state machine are held in their default state until the
                       RESET input is once again HIGH.

                                                          16-bit I2C-bus and SMBus, level translating, low voltage GPIO
                   7.9 Software reset
                       The Software Reset Call allows all the devices in the I2C-bus to be reset to the power-up
                       state value through a specific formatted I2C-bus command. To be performed correctly, it
                       implies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the bus.
                       The Software Reset sequence is defined as following:
                         1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                         2. The reserved General Call I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W bit set to 0 (write)
                            is sent by the I2C-bus master.
                         3. The PCA9575 device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the General Call address
                            ‘0000 0000’ (00h) only. If the R/W bit is set to logic 1 (read), no acknowledge is
                            returned to the I2C-bus master.
                         4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends
                            1 byte. The value of the byte must be equal to 06h (1000 0011).The PCA9575
                            acknowledges this value only. If the byte is not equal to 06h, the PCA9575 does not
                            acknowledge it. If more than 1 byte of data is sent, the PCA9575 does not
                            acknowledge anymore.
                         5. Once the right byte has been sent and correctly acknowledged, the master sends a
                            STOP command to end the Software Reset sequence: the PCA9575 then resets to
                            the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be addressed again within the
                            specified bus free time. If the master sends a Repeated START instead, no reset is
                            performed. The I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9575
                            (at any time) as a ‘Software Reset Abort’. The PCA9575 does not initiate a software
                            reset.
                7.10 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The open-drain active LOW interrupt is activated when one of the port pins changes state
                       and the port pin is configured as an input and the interrupt on it is not masked. The
                       interrupt is deactivated when the port pin input returns to its previous state or the Input
                       Port register is read. It is highly recommended to program the MSK register, and the CFG
                       registers during the initialization sequence after power-up, since any change to them
                       during Normal mode operation may cause undesirable interrupt events to happen.
                       Remark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register. Only a Read of
                       the Input Port register that contains the bit(s) image of the input(s) that generated the
                       interrupt clears the interrupt condition.
                 7.11 Standby
                       The PCA9575 goes into standby when the I2C-bus is idle. Standby supply current is lower
                       than 2.0 A (typical).

8. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two
                       lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   8.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       are interpreted as control signals (see Figure 9).
                                              SDA
                                               SCL
                                                                                data line                change
                                                                                 stable;                 of data
                                                                               data valid               allowed            mba607

                8.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 10).

                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 11).

                   8.3 Acknowledge
                        The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                        transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of 8 bits is followed by one acknowledge
                        bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, whereas the
                        master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.
                        A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                        each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                        that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that acknowledges has to
                        pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable
                        LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold
                        time must be taken into account.
                        A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                        acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                        transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                        condition.

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 28) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 24 and 25
