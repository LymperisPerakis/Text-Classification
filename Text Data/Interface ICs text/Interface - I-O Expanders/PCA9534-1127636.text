1. General description
              The PCA9534 is a 16-pin CMOS device that provide 8 bits of General Purpose parallel
              Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was developed to
              enhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. The improvements
              include higher drive capability, 5 V I/O tolerance, lower supply current, individual I/O
              configuration, 400 kHz clock frequency, and smaller packaging. I/O expanders provide a
              simple solution when additional I/O is needed for ACPI power switches, sensors,
              push buttons, LEDs, fans, etc.
              The PCA9534 consists of an 8-bit Configuration register (Input or Output selection); 8-bit
              Input register, 8-bit Output register and an 8-bit Polarity Inversion register (active HIGH or
              active LOW operation). The system master can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs
              by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for each input or output is kept in the
              corresponding Input or Output register. The polarity of the Input Port register can be
              inverted with the Polarity Inversion register. All registers can be read by the system
              master. Although pin-to-pin and I2C-bus address compatible with the PCF8574 series,
              software changes are required due to the enhancements and are discussed in Application
              Note AN469.
              The PCA9534 is identical to the PCA9554 except for the removal of the internal I/O
              pull-up resistor which greatly reduces power consumption when the I/Os are held LOW.
              The PCA9534 open-drain interrupt output is activated when any input state differs from its
              corresponding input port register state and is used to indicate to the system master that
              an input state has changed. The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values
              and initializes the device state machine.
              Three hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) vary the fixed I2C-bus address and allow up to eight
              devices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus.

                       [1]   HVQFN package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pin and exposed center pad. VSS pin must be
                             connected to supply ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level
                             performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the
                             board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the PCB in
                             the thermal pad region.

                       The command byte is the first byte to follow the address byte during a write transmission.
                       It is used as a pointer to determine which of the following registers will be written or read.
                6.1.2 Register 0 - Input Port register
                       This register is a read-only port. It reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                       of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by Register 3. Writes to this register
                       have no effect.
                       The default ‘X’ is determined by the externally applied logic level.

                      This register reflects the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as outputs by Register 3.
                      Bit values in this register have no effect on pins defined as inputs. Reads from this register
                      return the value that is in the flip-flop controlling the output selection, not the actual pin
                      value.

                   6.2 Power-on reset
                       When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the PCA9534 in
                       a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset condition is released
                       and the PCA9534 registers and state machine will initialize to their default states.
                       Thereafter, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.
                       For a power reset cycle, VDD must be lowered below 0.2 V and then restored to the
                       operating voltage.
                   6.3 Interrupt output
                       The open-drain interrupt output is activated when one of the port pins change state and
                       the pin is configured as an input. The interrupt is deactivated when the input returns to its
                       previous state or the Input Port register is read.
                       Note that changing an I/O from and output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur
                       if the state of the pin does not match the contents of the Input Port register.
                   6.4 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, then either Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the
                       state of the Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied
                       to an I/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance paths that exist between
                       the pin and either VDD or VSS.

                               Data is transmitted to the PCA9534 registers using the Write mode as shown in Figure 8
                               and Figure 9. Data is read from the PCA9534 registers using the Read mode as shown in
                               Figure 10 and Figure 11. These devices do not implement an auto-increment function, so
                               once a command byte has been sent, the register which was addressed will continue to
                               be accessed by reads until a new command byte has been sent.

                     7.1 Minimizing IDD when the I/O us used to control LEDs
                            When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, they are normally connected to VDD through a
                            resistor as shown in Figure 12. Since the LED acts as a diode, when the LED is off the
                            I/O VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The supply current, IDD, increases as VI becomes
                            lower than VDD.
                            Designs needing to minimize current consumption, such as battery power applications,
                            should consider maintaining the IOn pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                            Figure 13 shows a high value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 14 shows VDD less
                            than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                            at or above VDD and prevents additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.

13. Handling information
                     Inputs and outputs are protected against electrostatic discharge in normal handling.
                     However, to be completely safe you must take normal precautions appropriate to handling
                     integrated circuits.
14. Soldering
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus PbSn soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 23) than a PbSn process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 13 and 14

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 23.
