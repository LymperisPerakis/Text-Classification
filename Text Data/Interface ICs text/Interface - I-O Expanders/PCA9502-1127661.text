                  Rev. 4 — 23 February 2016                                       Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCA9502 is an 8-bit I/O expander with I2C-bus/SPI host interface. The device comes
              in a very small HVQFN24 package, which makes it ideally suitable for hand-held, battery
              operated applications.
              The device also supports software reset, which allows the host to reset the device at any
              time, independent of the hardware reset signal.

                             This register is used to program the I/O pins direction. Bit 0 to bit 7 control GPIO0 to
                             GPIO7.

                             Remark: If there is a pending input (GPIO) interrupt and IODir is written, this pending
                             interrupt will be cleared, that is, the interrupt signal will be negated.

                       When ‘read’, this register returns the actual state of all I/O pins. When ‘write’, each
                       register bit will be transferred to the corresponding IO pin programmed as output.

                                                                 then the interrupt is cleared.

                                                             Example: If GPIO4 input was as logic 0 and the input goes to logic 1
                                                             then back to logic 0, the IOState register will capture this change and
                                                             an interrupt is generated (if enabled). When the read is performed on

                                                             no additional input(s) that changed, and bit 4 of the IOState register
                                                             will read ‘1’. The next read of the IOState register should now read ‘0’.

                                                                                                 8-bit I/O expander with I2C-bus/SPI interface
9. I2C-bus operation
                       The two lines of the I2C-bus are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both
                       lines are connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor, and remain HIGH when the
                       bus is not busy. Each device is recognized by a unique address whether it is a
                       microcomputer, LCD driver, memory or keyboard interface and can operate as either a
                       transmitter or receiver, depending on the function of the device. A device generating a
                       message or data is a transmitter, and a device receiving the message or data is a
                       receiver. Obviously, a passive function like an LCD driver could only be a receiver, while a
                       microcontroller or a memory can both transmit and receive data.
                   9.1 Data transfers
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse (see Figure 4). The data on the SDA
                       line must remain stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse in order to be valid.
                       Changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line (SDA) while the clock signal (SCL) is HIGH indicates a START
                       condition, and a LOW-to-HIGH transition of the SDA while SCL is HIGH defines a STOP
                       condition (see Figure 5). The bus is considered to be busy after the START condition and
                       free again at a certain time interval after the STOP condition. The START and STOP
                       conditions are always generated by the master.

                         Fig 5.    START and STOP conditions
                       The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP condition from
                       transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte, which must be eight bits long, is
                       transferred serially with the most significant bit first, and is followed by an acknowledge
                       bit. (see Figure 6). The clock pulse related to the acknowledge bit is generated by the
                       master. The device that acknowledges has to pull down the SDA line during the
                       acknowledge clock pulse, while the transmitting device releases this pulse (see Figure 7).

  Fig 7.  Acknowledge on the I2C-bus
                             A slave receiver must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte, and a
                             master must generate one after the reception of each byte clocked out of the slave
                             transmitter.
                             There is an exception to the ‘acknowledge after every byte’ rule. It occurs when a master
                             is a receiver: it must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not signalling an
                             acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. The acknowledge
                             related clock, generated by the master should still take place, but the SDA line will not be
                             pulled down. In order to indicate that this is an active and intentional lack of
                             acknowledgement, we shall term this special condition as a ‘negative acknowledge’.
                    9.2 Addressing and transfer formats
                             Each device on the bus has its own unique address. Before any data is transmitted on the
                             bus, the master transmits on the bus the address of the slave to be accessed for this
                             transaction. A well-behaved slave with a matching address, if it exists on the network,
                             should of course acknowledge the master's addressing. The addressing is done by the
                             first byte transmitted by the master after the START condition.
                             An address on the network is seven bits long, appearing as the most significant bits of the
                             address byte. The last bit is a direction (R/W) bit. A ‘0’ indicates that the master is
                             transmitting (write) and a ‘1’ indicates that the master requests data (read). A complete
                             data transfer, comprised of an address byte indicating a ‘write’ and two data bytes is
                             shown in Figure 8.

  Fig 8.    A complete data transfer
                         When an address is sent, each device in the system compares the first seven bits after
                         the START with its own address. If there is a match, the device will consider itself
                         addressed by the master, and will send an acknowledge. The device could also determine
                         if in this transaction it is assigned the role of a slave receiver or slave transmitter,
                         depending on the R/W bit.
                         Each node of the I2C-bus network has a unique seven-bit address. The address of a
                         microcontroller is of course fully programmable, while peripheral devices usually have
                         fixed and programmable address portions.
                         When the master is communicating with one device only, data transfers follow the format
                         of Figure 8, where the R/W bit could indicate either direction. After completing the transfer
                         and issuing a STOP condition, if a master would like to address some other device on the
                         network, it could start another transaction by issuing a new START.
                         Another way for a master to communicate with several different devices would be by using
                         a ‘repeated START’. After the last byte of the transaction was transferred, including its
                         acknowledge (or negative acknowledge), the master issues another START, followed by
                         address byte and data, without effecting a STOP. The master may communicate with a
                         number of different devices, combining ‘reads’ and ‘writes’. After the last transfer takes
                         place, the master issues a STOP and releases the bus. Possible data formats are
                         demonstrated in Figure 9. Note that the repeated START allows for both change of a
                         slave and a change of direction, without releasing the bus. We shall see later on that the
                         change of direction feature can come in handy even when dealing with a single device.
                         In a single master system, the repeated START mechanism may be more efficient than
                         terminating each transfer with a STOP and starting again. In a multimaster environment,
                         the determination of which format is more efficient could be more complicated, as when a
                         master is using repeated STARTs it occupies the bus for a long time and thus preventing
                         other devices from initiating transfers.

                   9.3 Addressing
                       Before any data is transmitted or received, the master must send the address of the
                       receiver via the SDA line. The first byte after the START condition carries the address of
                       the slave device and the read/write bit. Table 11 shows how the PCA9502’s address can
                       be selected by using A1 and A0 pins. For example, if these 2 pins are connected to VDD,
                       then the PCA9502’s address is set to 0x90, and the master communicates with it through
                       this address.

                   9.4 Use of sub-addresses
                       When a master communicates with the PCA9502 it must send a sub-address in the byte
                       following the slave address byte. This sub-address is the internal address of the word the
                       master wants to access for a single byte transfer, or the beginning of a sequence of
                       locations for a multi-byte transfer. A sub-address is an 8-bit byte. Unlike the device
                       address, it does not contain a direction (R/W) bit, and like any byte transferred on the bus
                       it must be followed by an acknowledge.
                       A register write cycle is shown in Figure 10. The START is followed by a slave address
                       byte with the direction bit set to ‘write’, a sub-address byte, a number of data bytes, and a
                       STOP signal. The sub-address indicates which register the master wants to access. and
                       the data bytes which follow will be written one after the other to the sub-address location.

  Fig 10. Master writes to slave
                          The register read cycle (see Figure 11) commences in a similar manner, with the master
                          sending a slave address with the direction bit set to ‘write’ with a following sub-address.
                          Then, in order to reverse the direction of the transfer, the master issues a repeated
                          START followed again by the device address, but this time with the direction bit set to
                          ‘read’. The data bytes starting at the internal sub-address will be clocked out of the device,
                          each followed by a master-generated acknowledge. The last byte of the read cycle will be
                          followed by a negative acknowledge, signalling the end of transfer. The cycle is
                          terminated by a STOP signal.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 20) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 18 and 19

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 20.
