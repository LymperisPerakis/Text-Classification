                  Remote 8-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus with interrupt
                  Rev. 5 — 27 May 2013                                                  Product data sheet
1. General description
              The PCF8574/74A provides general-purpose remote I/O expansion via the two-wire
              bidirectional I2C-bus (serial clock (SCL), serial data (SDA)).
              The devices consist of eight quasi-bidirectional ports, 100 kHz I2C-bus interface, three
              hardware address inputs and interrupt output operating between 2.5 V and 6 V. The
              quasi-bidirectional port can be independently assigned as an input to monitor interrupt
              status or keypads, or as an output to activate indicator devices such as LEDs. System
              master can read from the input port or write to the output port through a single register.
              The low current consumption of 2.5 A (typical, static) is great for mobile applications and
              the latched output ports directly drive LEDs.
              The PCF8574 and PCF8574A are identical, except for the different fixed portion of the
              slave address. The three hardware address pins allow eight of each device to be on the
              same I2C-bus, so there can be up to 16 of these I/O expanders PCF8574/74A together on
              the same I2C-bus, supporting up to 128 I/Os (for example, 128 LEDs).
              The active LOW open-drain interrupt output (INT) can be connected to the interrupt logic
              of the microcontroller and is activated when any input state differs from its corresponding
              input port register state. It is used to indicate to the microcontroller that an input state has
              changed and the device needs to be interrogated without the microcontroller continuously
              polling the input register via the I2C-bus.
              The internal Power-On Reset (POR) initializes the I/Os as inputs with a weak internal
              pull-up 100 A current source.

7. Functional description
                       Refer to Figure 1 “Block diagram”.
                   7.1 Device address
                       Following a START condition, the bus master must send the address of the slave it is
                       accessing and the operation it wants to perform (read or write). The address format of the
                       PCF8574/74A is shown in Figure 6. Slave address pins A2, A1 and A0 are held HIGH or
                       LOW to choose one of eight slave addresses. To conserve power, no internal pull-up
                       resistors are incorporated on A2, A1 or A0, so they must be externally held HIGH or LOW.
                       The address pins (A2, A1, A0) can connect to VDD or VSS directly or through resistors.

                       The last bit of the first byte defines the operation to be performed. When set to logic 1 a
                       read is selected, while a logic 0 selects a write operation (write operation is shown in
                       Figure 6).

                       The PCF8574 and PCF8574A are functionally the same, but have a different fixed portion
                       (A6 to A3) of the slave address. This allows eight of the PCF8574 and eight of the
                       PCF8574A to be on the same I2C-bus without address conflict.

8. I/O programming
                   8.1 Quasi-bidirectional I/Os
                       A quasi-bidirectional I/O is an input or output port without using a direction control register.
                       Whenever the master reads the register, the value returned to master depends on the
                       actual voltage or status of the pin. At power on, all the ports are HIGH with a weak 100 A
                       internal pull-up to VDD, but can be driven LOW by an internal transistor, or an external
                       signal. The I/O ports are entirely independent of each other, but each I/O octal is
                       controlled by the same read or write data byte.
                       Advantages of the quasi-bidirectional I/O over totem pole I/O include:
                         • Better for driving LEDs since the p-channel (transistor to VDD) is small, which saves
                            die size and therefore cost. LED drive only requires an internal transistor to ground,
                            while the LED is connected to VDD through a current-limiting resistor. Totem pole I/O
                            have both n-channel and p-channel transistors, which allow solid HIGH and LOW
                            output levels without a pull-up resistor — good for logic levels.
                         • Simpler architecture — only a single register and the I/O can be both input and output
                            at the same time. Totem pole I/O have a direction register that specifies the port pin
                            direction and it is always in that configuration unless the direction is explicitly
                            changed.
                         • Does not require a command byte. The simplicity of one register (no need for the
                            pointer register or, technically, the command byte) is an advantage in some
                            embedded systems where every byte counts because of memory or bandwidth
                            limitations.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                PCF8574; PCF8574A
                                                                          Remote 8-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus with interrupt
                   There is only one register to control four possibilities of the port pin: Input HIGH, input
                   LOW, output HIGH, or output LOW.
                     Input HIGH: The master needs to write 1 to the register to set the port as an input mode
                     if the device is not in the default power-on condition. The master reads the register to
                     check the input status. If the external source pulls the port pin up to VDD or drives
                     logic 1, then the master will read the value of 1.
                     Input LOW: The master needs to write 1 to the register to set the port to input mode if
                     the device is not in the default power-on condition. The master reads the register to
                     check the input status. If the external source pulls the port pin down to VSS or drives
                     logic 0, which sinks the weak 100 A current source, then the master will read the value
                     of 0.
                     Output HIGH: The master writes 1 to the register. There is an additional ‘accelerator’ or
                     strong pull-up current when the master sets the port HIGH. The additional strong pull-up
                     is only active during the HIGH time of the acknowledge clock cycle. This accelerator
                     current helps the port’s 100 A current source make a faster rising edge into a heavily
                     loaded output, but only at the start of the acknowledge clock cycle to avoid bus
                     contention if an external signal is pulling the port LOW to VSS/driving the port with
                     logic 0 at the same time. After the half clock cycle there is only the 100 A current
                     source to hold the port HIGH.
                     Output LOW: The master writes 0 to the register. There is a strong current sink
                     transistor that holds the port pin LOW. A large current may flow into the port, which
                     could potentially damage the part if the master writes a 0 to the register and an external
                     source is pulling the port HIGH at the same time.
                                                                                                                 VDD

                                                                                             Remote 8-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus with interrupt
                         8.2 Writing to the port (Output mode)
                                  The master (microcontroller) sends the START condition and slave address setting the
                                  last bit of the address byte to logic 0 for the write mode. The PCF8574/74A acknowledges
                                  and the master then sends the data byte for P7 to P0 to the port register. As the clock line
                                  goes HIGH, the 8-bit data is presented on the port lines after it has been acknowledged by
                                  the PCF8574/74A. If a LOW is written, the strong pull-down turns on and stays on. If a
                                  HIGH is written, the strong pull-up turns on for 1⁄2 of the clock cycle, then the line is held
                                  HIGH by the weak current source. The master can then send a STOP or ReSTART
                                  condition or continue sending data. The number of data bytes that can be sent
                                  successively is not limited and the previous data is overwritten every time a data byte has
                                  been sent and acknowledged.
                                  Ensure a logic 1 is written for any port that is being used as an input to ensure the strong
                                  external pull-down is turned off.

                        8.3 Reading from a port (Input mode)
                                  The port must have been previously written to logic 1, which is the condition after
                                  power-on reset. To enter the Read mode the master (microcontroller) addresses the slave
                                  device and sets the last bit of the address byte to logic 1 (address byte read). The slave
                                  will acknowledge and then send the data byte to the master. The master will NACK and
                                  then send the STOP condition or ACK and read the input register again.
                                  The read of any pin being used as an output will indicate HIGH or LOW depending on the
                                  actual state of the pin.
                                  If the data on the input port changes faster than the master can read, this data may be
                                  lost. The DATA 2 and DATA3 are lost because these data did not meet the setup time and
                                  hold time (see Figure 9).

                        8.4 Power-on reset
                                  When power is applied to VDD, an internal Power-On Reset (POR) holds the
                                  PCF8574/74A in a reset condition until VDD has reached VPOR. At that point, the reset
                                  condition is released and the PCF8574/74A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                                  will initialize to their default states of all I/Os to inputs with weak current source to VDD.
                                  Thereafter VDD must be lowered below VPOR and back up to the operation voltage for
                                  power-on reset cycle.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                    PCF8574; PCF8574A
                                                                              Remote 8-bit I/O expander for I2C-bus with interrupt
                   8.5 Interrupt output (INT)
                       The PCF8574/74A provides an open-drain output (INT) which can be fed to a
                       corresponding input of the microcontroller (see Figure 10). As soon as a port input is
                       changed, the INT will be active (LOW) and notify the microcontroller.
                       An interrupt is generated at any rising or falling edge of the port inputs. After time tv(Q), the
                       signal INT is valid.
                       The interrupt will reset to HIGH when data on the port is changed to the original setting or
                       data is read or written by the master.
                       In the Write mode, the interrupt may be reset (HIGH) on the rising edge of the
                       acknowledge bit of the address byte and also on the rising edge of the write to port pulse.
                       The interrupt will always be reset (HIGH) on the falling edge of the write to port pulse (see
                       Figure 8).
                       The interrupt is reset (HIGH) in the Read mode on the rising edge of the read from port
                       pulse (see Figure 9).
                       During the interrupt reset, any I/O change close to the read or write pulse may not
                       generate an interrupt, or the interrupt will have a very short pulse. After the interrupt is
                       reset, any change in I/Os will be detected and transmitted as an INT.
                       At power-on reset all ports are in Input mode and the initial state of the ports is HIGH,
                       therefore, for any port pin that is pulled LOW or driven LOW by external source, the
                       interrupt output will be active (output LOW).

9. Characteristics of the I2C-bus
                       The I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-wire communication between different ICs or modules. The
                       two wires are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                       connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                       of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                   9.1 Bit transfer
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain
                       stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time
                       will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 11).

                                             SCL
                                                                              data line                change
                                                                                stable;                 of data
                                                                              data valid               allowed       mba607

                 9.1.1 START and STOP conditions
                       Both data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the START condition (S). A
                       LOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP
                       condition (P) (see Figure 12).

                   9.2 System configuration
                       A device generating a message is a ‘transmitter’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The
                       device that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by
                       the master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 13).

                    9.3 Acknowledge
                          The number of data bytes transferred between the START and the STOP conditions from
                          transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte of eight bits is followed by one
                          acknowledge bit (see Figure 14). The acknowledge bit is an active LOW level (generated
                          by the receiving device) that indicates to the transmitter that the data transfer was
                          successful.
                          A slave receiver which is addressed must generate an acknowledge after the reception of
                          each byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte
                          that has been clocked out of the slave transmitter. The device that wants to issue an
                          acknowledge bit has to pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so
                          that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge bit related
                          clock pulse; set-up and hold times must be taken into account.
                          A master receiver must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not generating an
                          acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this event, the
                          transmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP
                          condition.

10. Application design-in information
                 10.1 Bidirectional I/O expander applications
                      In the 8-bit I/O expander application shown in Figure 15, P0 and P1 are inputs, and
                      P2 to P7 are outputs. When used in this configuration, during a write, the input (P0 and
                      P1) must be written as HIGH so the external devices fully control the input ports.
                      The desired HIGH or LOW logic levels may be written to the ports used as outputs (P2 to
                      P7). If 10 A internal output HIGH is not enough current source, the port needs external
                      pull-up resistor. During a read, the logic levels of the external devices driving the input
                      ports (P0 and P1) and the previous written logic level to the output ports (P2 to P7) will be
                      read.
                      The GPIO also has an interrupt line (INT) that can be connected to the interrupt logic of
                      the microcontroller. By sending an interrupt signal on this line, the remote I/O informs the
                      microprocessor that there has been a change of data on its ports without having to
                      communicate via the I2C-bus.
                                                                                                                                         VDD

                 10.2 How to read and write to I/O expander (example)
                      In the application example of PCF8574 shown in Figure 15, the microcontroller wants to
                      control the P3 switch ON and the P7 LED ON when the temperature sensor P0 changes.
                       1. When the system power on:
                           Core Processor needs to issue an initial command to set P0 and P1 as inputs and
                           P[7:2] as outputs with value 1010 00 (LED off, MP3 off, camera on, audio off,
                           switch off and latch off).
                       2. Operation:
                           When the temperature changes above the threshold, the temperature sensor signal
                           will toggle from HIGH to LOW. The INT will be activated and notifies the ‘core
                           processor’ that there have been changes on the input pins. Read the input register.
                           If P0 = 0 (temperature sensor has changed), then turn on LED and turn on switch.
                       3. Software code:
                           //System Power on
                           // write to PCF8574 with data 1010 0011b to set P[7:2] outputs and P[1:0] inputs

                    10.3 High current-drive load applications
                            The GPIO has a minimum guaranteed sinking current of 10 mA per bit at 5 V. In
                            applications requiring additional drive, two port pins may be connected together to sink up
                            to 20 mA current. Both bits must then always be turned on or off together. Up to five pins
                            can be connected together to drive 80 mA, which is the device recommended total limit.
                            Each pin needs its own limiting resistor as shown in Figure 16 to prevent damage to the
                            device should all ports not be turned on at the same time.
                                                                            VDD

16. Handling information
                      All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                      normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                      described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                      This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                      of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                      soldering description”.
                 17.1 Introduction to soldering
                      Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                      Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                      the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                      ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                      Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                      suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                      densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                 17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                      Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                      a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                        • Through-hole components
                        • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                      Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                      packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                      leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                      due to an increased probability of bridging.
                      The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                      component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                      packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                      Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                        •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                        •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                        •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                        •  Package placement
                        •  Inspection and repair
                        •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                        • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                           transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                           exposed to the wave
                        • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                 17.4 Reflow soldering
                      Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                        • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                           higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 21) than a SnPb process, thus
                           reducing the process window
                        • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                           window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                        • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                           heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                           temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                           characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                           packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                           depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                           Table 11 and 12

                      Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                      times.
                      Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                      soldering, see Figure 21.

18. Soldering of through-hole mount packages
                 18.1 Introduction to soldering through-hole mount packages
                      This text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.
                      Wave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages
                      on a printed-circuit board.
                 18.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave
                      Driven by legislation and environmental forces the worldwide use of lead-free solder
                      pastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from
                      3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 C or 265 C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb
                      or Pb-free respectively.
                      The total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.
                      The device may be mounted up to the seating plane, but the temperature of the plastic
                      body must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (Tstg(max)). If the
                      printed-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately
                      after soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.
                 18.3 Manual soldering
                      Apply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the
                      seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If the temperature of the soldering iron bit is
                      less than 300 C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is
                      between 300 C and 400 C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.
