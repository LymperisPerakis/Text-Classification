PCA9535E, PCA9535EC
   The PCA9535E and PCA9535EC devices provide 16 bits of
General Purpose parallel Input / Output (GPIO) expansion through the                              www.onsemi.com

6. The device is in standby mode after an I2C stop command.
7. The power−on reset circuit resets the I2C bus logic with VDD < VPOR and set all I/Os to logic 1 upon power−up. Thereafter, VDD must
    be lower than 0.2 V to reset the part.
8. Each bit must be limited to a maximum of 25 mA and the total package limited to 400 mA due to internal busing limits.
9. The value is not tested, but verified on sampling basis.

10. tVD:ACK = time for Acknowledgment signal from SCL LOW to SDA (out) LOW.
11. tVD:DAT = minimum time for SDA data out to be valid following SCL LOW.
12. Cb = total capacitance of one bus line in pF.
13. A master device must internally provide a hold time of al least 300 ns for the SDA signal (refer to VIL of the SCL signal) in order to bridge
     the undefined region SCL’s falling edge.
14. The maximum tf for the SDA and SCL bus lines is specified at 300 ns. The maximum fall time for the SDA output stage tf is specified at
     250 ns. This allows series protection resistors to be connected between the SDA and the SCL pins and the SDA/SCL bus lines without
     exceeding the maximum specified tf.
15. Input filters on the SDA and SCL inputs suppress noise spikes less than 50 ns.

   Before the bus master can access a slave device, it must
send the address of the slave it is accessing and the operation

   A logic 1 on the last bit of the first byte selects a read

   During a write transmission, the address byte is followed
by the command byte. The command byte determines which
of the following registers will be written or read.
