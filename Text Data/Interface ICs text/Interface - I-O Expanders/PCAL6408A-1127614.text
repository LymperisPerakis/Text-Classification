1. General description
             The PCAL6408A is an 8-bit general-purpose I/O expander that provides remote I/O
             expansion for most microcontroller families via the I2C-bus interface.
             NXP I/O expanders provide a simple solution when additional I/Os are needed while
             keeping interconnections to a minimum, for example, in battery-powered mobile
             applications for interfacing to sensors, push buttons, keypad, etc. In addition to providing
             a flexible set of GPIOs, it simplifies interconnection of a processor running at one voltage
             level to I/O devices operating at a different (usually higher) voltage level. The PCAL6408A
             has built-in level shifting feature that makes these devices extremely flexible in mixed
             signal environments where communication between incompatible I/O voltages is required.
             Its wide VDD range of 1.65 V to 5.5 V on the dual power rail allows seamless
             communications with next-generation low voltage microprocessors and microcontrollers
             on the interface side (SDA/SCL) and peripherals at a higher voltage on the port side.
             There are two supply voltages for PCAL6408A: VDD(I2C-bus) and VDD(P). VDD(I2C-bus)
             provides the supply voltage for the interface at the master side (for example, a
             microcontroller) and the VDD(P) provides the supply for core circuits and Port P. The
             bidirectional voltage level translation in the PCAL6408A is provided through VDD(I2C-bus).
             VDD(I2C-bus) should be connected to the VDD of the external SCL/SDA lines. This indicates
             the VDD level of the I2C-bus to the PCAL6408A, while the voltage level on Port P of the
             PCAL6408A is determined by the VDD(P).
             The PCAL6408A contains the PCA6408A register set of 8-bit Configuration, Input, Output,
             and Polarity Inversion registers and additionally, the PCAL6408A has Agile I/O, which are
             additional features specifically designed to enhance the I/O. These additional features
             are: programmable output drive strength, latchable inputs, programmable
             pull-up/pull-down resistors, maskable interrupt, interrupt status register, programmable
             open-drain or push-pull outputs. The PCAL6408A is a pin-to-pin replacement to the
             PCA6408A, however, the PCAL6408A powers up with all I/O interrupts masked. This
             mask default allows for a board bring-up free of spurious interrupts at power-up.
             At power-on, the I/Os are configured as inputs. However, the system master can enable
             the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration bits. The data for
             each input or output is kept in the corresponding input or output register. The polarity of
             the Input Port register can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion register, saving external
             logic gates. Programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors eliminate the need for discrete
             components.

                                                            Low-voltage translating, 8-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   The system master can reset the PCAL6408A in the event of a time-out or other improper
                   operation by asserting a LOW in the RESET input. The power-on reset puts the registers
                   in their default state and initializes the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine. The RESET pin
                   causes the same reset/initialization to occur without de-powering the part.
                   The PCAL6408A open-drain interrupt (INT) output is activated when any input state differs
                   from its corresponding Input Port register state and is used to indicate to the system
                   master that an input state has changed.
                   INT can be connected to the interrupt input of a microcontroller. By sending an interrupt
                   signal on this line, the remote I/O can inform the microcontroller if there is incoming data
                   on its ports without having to communicate via the I2C-bus. Thus, the PCAL6408A can
                   remain a simple slave device. The input latch feature holds or latches the input pin state
                   and keeps the logic values that created the interrupt until the master can service the
                   interrupt. This minimizes the host’s interrupt service response for fast moving inputs.
                   The device Port P outputs have 25 mA sink capabilities for directly driving LEDs while
                   consuming low device current.
                   One hardware pin (ADDR) can be used to program and vary the fixed I2C-bus address
                   and allow up to two devices to share the same I2C-bus or SMBus.

                       ADDR is the hardware address package pin and is held to either HIGH (logic 1) or LOW
                       (logic 0) to assign one of the two possible slave addresses. The last bit of the slave
                       address defines the operation (read or write) to be performed. A HIGH (logic 1) selects a
                       read operation, while a LOW (logic 0) selects a write operation.

                           Following the successful acknowledgement of the address byte, the bus master sends a
                           command byte, which is stored in the Pointer register in the PCAL6408A. 2 bits of this
                           data byte state the operation (read or write) and the internal registers (Input, Output,
                           Polarity Inversion, or Configuration) that are affected. Bit 6 in conjunction with the lower
                           3 bits of the Command byte are used to point to the extended features of the device
                           (Agile I/O). This register is ‘write only’.

                7.4.1 Input port register (00h)
                       The Input port register (register 0) reflects the incoming logic levels of the pins, regardless
                       of whether the pin is defined as an input or an output by the Configuration register. The
                       Input port register is read only; writes to this register have no effect. The default value ‘X’
                       is determined by the externally applied logic level. An Input port register read operation is
                       performed as described in Section 8.2 “Read commands”.

                7.4.2 Output port register (01h)
                       The Output port register (register 1) shows the outgoing logic levels of the pins defined as
                       outputs by the Configuration register. Bit values in these registers have no effect on pins
                       defined as inputs. In turn, reads from this register reflect the value that was written to this
                       register, not the actual pin value.

                7.4.3 Polarity inversion register (02h)
                       The Polarity inversion register (register 2) allows polarity inversion of pins defined as
                       inputs by the Configuration register. If a bit in this register is set (written with ‘1’), the
                       corresponding port pin’s polarity is inverted. If a bit in this register is cleared (written with a
                       ‘0’), the corresponding port pin’s original polarity is retained.

                7.4.4 Configuration register (03h)
                       The Configuration register (register 3) configures the direction of the I/O pins. If a bit in this
                       register is set to 1, the corresponding port pin is enabled as a high-impedance input. If a
                       bit in this register is cleared to 0, the corresponding port pin is enabled as an output.

                7.4.5 Output drive strength registers (40h, 41h)
                      The Output drive strength registers control the output drive level of the GPIO. Each GPIO
                      can be configured independently to a certain output current level by two register control
                      bits. For example, Port 7 is controlled by register 41 CC7 (bits [7:6]), Port 6 is controlled
                      by register 41 CC6 (bits [5:4]). The output drive level of the GPIO is programmed
                      00b = 0.25, 01b = 0.5, 10b = 0.75 or 11b = 1 of the drive capability of the I/O.

                7.4.6 Input latch register (42h)
                      The Input latch register enables and disables the input latch of the I/O pins. These
                      registers are effective only when the pin is configured as an input port. When an input
                      latch register bit is 0, the corresponding input pin state is not latched. A state change in
                      the corresponding input pin generates an interrupt. A read of the input port register clears
                      the interrupt. If the input goes back to its initial logic state before the input port register is
                      read, then the interrupt is cleared. See Figure 14.
                      When an input latch register bit is 1, the corresponding input pin state is latched. A change
                      of state of the input generates an interrupt and the input logic value is loaded into the
                      corresponding bit of the input port register (registers 0). A read of the input port register
                      clears the interrupt. If the input pin returns to its initial logic state before the input port
                      register is read, then the interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of the input port
                      register keeps the logic value that initiated the interrupt. See Figure 15. For example, if the
                      P4 input was as logic 0 and the input goes to logic 1 then back to logic 0, the input port
                      register captures this change and an interrupt is generated (if unmasked). When the read
                      is performed on the input port register, the interrupt is cleared, assuming there were no
                      additional input(s) that have changed, and bit 4 of the input port register reads ‘1’. The
                      next read of the input port register bit 4 should now read ‘0’.
                      An interrupt remains active when a non-latched input simultaneously switches state with a
                      latched input and then returns to its original state. A read of the input port register reflects
                      only the change of state of the latched input and also clears the interrupt. The interrupt is
                      not cleared if the input latch register changes from latched to non-latched configuration.
                      If the input pin is changed from latched to non-latched input, a read from the input port
                      register reflects the current port logic level. If the input pin is changed from non-latched to
                      latched input, the read from the input port register reflects the latched logic level.

                      This register allows the user to enable or disable pull-up/pull-down resistors on the I/O
                      pins. Setting the bit to logic 1 enables the selection of pull-up/pull-down resistors. Setting
                      the bit to logic 0 disconnects the pull-up/pull-down resistors from the I/O pins. Also, the
                      resistors are disconnected when the outputs are configured as open-drain outputs (see
                      Section 7.4.11). Use the pull-up/pull-down selection registers to select either a pull-up or
                      pull-down resistor.

                7.4.8 Pull-up/pull-down selection register (44h)
                      The I/O port can be configured to have pull-up or pull-down resistor by programming the
                      pull-up/pull-down selection register. Setting a bit to logic 1 selects a 100 k pull-up
                      resistor for that I/O pin. Setting a bit to logic 0 selects a 100 k pull-down resistor for that
                      I/O pin. If the pull-up/down feature is disconnected, writing to this register has no effect on
                      I/O pin. Typical value is 100 k with minimum of 50 k and maximum of 150 k.

                7.4.9 Interrupt mask register (45h)
                      Interrupt mask register is set to logic 1 upon power-on, disabling interrupts during system
                      start-up. Interrupts may be enabled by setting corresponding mask bits to logic 0. If an
                      input changes state and the corresponding bit in the Interrupt mask register is set to 1, the
                      interrupt is masked and the interrupt pin (INT) is not asserted. If the corresponding bit in
                      the Interrupt mask register is set to 0, the interrupt pin is asserted.
                      When an input changes state and the resulting interrupt is masked (interrupt mask bit
                      is 1), setting the input mask register bit to 0 causes the interrupt pin to be asserted. If the
                      interrupt mask bit of an input that is currently the source of an interrupt is set to 1, the
                      interrupt pin is de-asserted.

                      This read-only register is used to identify the source of an interrupt. When read, a logic 1
                      indicates that the corresponding input pin was the source of the interrupt. A logic 0
                      indicates that the input pin is not the source of an interrupt.
                      When a corresponding bit in the interrupt mask register is set to 1 (masked), the interrupt
                      status bit returns logic 0.

                      A logic 0 configures the I/O as push-pull (Q1 and Q2 are active, see Figure 10). A logic 1
                      configures the I/O as open-drain (Q1 is disabled, Q2 is active) and the recommended

                   7.5 I/O port
                       When an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, which creates a
                       high-impedance input. The input voltage may be raised above VDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.
                       If the I/O is configured as an output, Q1 or Q2 is enabled, depending on the state of the
                       Output port register. In this case, there are low-impedance paths between the I/O pin and
                       either VDD(P) or VSS. The external voltage applied to this I/O pin should not exceed the
                       recommended levels for proper operation.

                                                                 Low-voltage translating, 8-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                   7.6 Power-on reset
                       When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD(P), an internal power-on reset holds the
                       PCAL6408A in a reset condition until VDD(P) has reached VPOR. At that time, the reset
                       condition is released and the PCAL6408A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine
                       initialize to their default states. After that, VDD(P) must be lowered to below VPOR and back
                       up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle. See Section 9.3 “Power-on reset
                       requirements”.
                   7.7 Reset input (RESET)
                       The RESET input can be asserted to initialize the system while keeping the VDD(P) at its
                       operating level. A reset can be accomplished by holding the RESET pin LOW for a
                       minimum of tw(rst). The PCAL6408A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are
                       changed to their default state once RESET is LOW (0). When RESET is HIGH (1), the I/O
                       levels at the P port can be changed externally or through the master. This input requires a
                       pull-up resistor to VDD(I2C-bus) if no active connection is used.
                   7.8 Interrupt output (INT)
                       An interrupt is generated by any rising or falling edge of the port inputs in the Input mode.
                       After time tv(INT), the signal INT is valid. Resetting the interrupt circuit is achieved when
                       data on the port is changed to the original setting or when data is read from the port that
                       generated the interrupt (see Figure 14). Resetting occurs in the Read mode at the
                       acknowledge (ACK) or not acknowledge (NACK) bit after the rising edge of the SCL
                       signal. Interrupts that occur during the ACK or NACK clock pulse can be lost (or be very
                       short) due to the resetting of the interrupt during this pulse. Each change of the I/Os after
                       resetting is detected and is transmitted as INT.
                       A pin configured as an output cannot cause an interrupt. Changing an I/O from an output
                       to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur, if the state of the pin does not match the
                       contents of the Input port register.
                       The INT output has an open-drain structure and requires a pull-up resistor to VDD(P) or
                       VDD(I2C-bus) depending on the application. INT should be connected to the voltage source
                       of the device that requires the interrupt information. When using the input latch feature,
                       the input pin state is latched. The interrupt is reset only when data is read from the port
                       that generated the interrupt. The reset occurs in the Read mode at the acknowledge

8. Bus transactions
                                  The PCAL6408A is an I2C-bus slave device. Data is exchanged between the master and
                                  PCAL6408A through write and read commands using I2C-bus. The two communication
                                  lines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be
                                  connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor when connected to the output stages
                                  of a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.
                       8.1 Write commands
                                  Data is transmitted to the PCAL6408A by sending the device address and setting the
                                  Least Significant Bit (LSB) to a logic 0 (see Figure 8 for device address). The command
                                  byte is sent after the address and determines which register receives the data that follows
                                  the command byte. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write
                                  transmission.

                         8.2 Read commands
                                    To read data from the PCAL6408A, the bus master must first send the PCAL6408A
                                    address with the least significant bit set to a logic 0 (see Figure 8 for device address). The
                                    command byte is sent after the address and determines which register is to be accessed.
                                    After a restart the device address is sent again, but this time the LSB is set to a logic 1.
                                    Data from the register defined by the command byte then is sent by the PCAL6408A (see
                                    Figure 13 and Figure 14).
                                    Data is clocked into the register on the rising edge of the ACK clock pulse. There is no
                                    limit on the number of data bytes received in one read transmission, but on the final byte
                                    received the bus master must not acknowledge the data.

               Transfer of data can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition. When this occurs, data present at the latest acknowledge
               phase is valid (output mode). It is assumed that the command byte has previously been programmed with 00h (read Input port
               register).
               This figure eliminates the command byte transfer, a restart, and slave address call between the initial slave address call and
               actual data transfer from P port (see Figure 13).

        (1) Resistors are required for inputs (on P port) that may float. If a driver to an input will never let the input float, a resistor is not
            needed. Outputs (in the P port) do not need pull-up resistors.
  Fig 16. Typical application
                     9.1 Minimizing IDD when I/Os control LEDs
                              When the I/Os are used to control LEDs, normally they are connected to VDD through a
                              resistor as shown in Figure 16. The LED acts as a diode, so when the LED is off, the I/O
                              VI is about 1.2 V less than VDD. The IDD parameter in Table 23 “Static characteristics”
                              shows how IDD increases as VI becomes lower than VDD. Designs that must minimize
                              current consumption, such as battery power applications, should consider maintaining the
                              I/O pins greater than or equal to VDD when the LED is off.
                              Figure 17 shows a high-value resistor in parallel with the LED. Figure 18 shows VDD less
                              than the LED supply voltage by at least 1.2 V. Both of these methods maintain the I/O VI
                              at or above VDD and prevent additional supply current consumption when the LED is off.

                             The Output drive strength registers allow the user to control the output drive level of the
                             GPIO. Each GPIO can be configured independently to one of the four possible output
                             current levels. By programming these bits the user is changing the number of transistor
                             pairs or ‘fingers’ that drive the I/O pad.
                             Figure 19 shows a simplified output stage. The behavior of the pad is affected by the
                             Configuration register, the output port data, and the current control register. When the
                             Current Control register bits are programmed to 10b, then only two of the fingers are
                             active, reducing the current drive capability by 50 %.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                 PCAL6408A
                                                                 Low-voltage translating, 8-bit I2C-bus/SMBus I/O expander
                       Reducing the current drive capability may be desirable to reduce system noise. When the
                       output switches (transitions from H/L), there is a peak current that is a function of the
                       output drive selection. This peak current runs through VDD and VSS package inductance
                       and creates noise (some radiated, but more critically Simultaneous Switching Noise
                       (SSN)). In other words, switching many outputs at the same time creates ground and
                       supply noise. The output drive strength control through the Output Drive Strength
                       registers allows the user to mitigate SSN issues without the need of additional external
                       components.
                   9.3 Power-on reset requirements
                       In the event of a glitch or data corruption, PCAL6408A can be reset to its default
                       conditions by using the power-on reset feature. Power-on reset requires that the device
                       go through a power cycle to be completely reset. This reset also happens when the device
                       is powered on for the first time in an application.
                       The two types of power-on reset are shown in Figure 20 and Figure 21.

                                VPOR is critical to the power-on reset. VPOR is the voltage level at which the reset condition
                                is released and all the registers and the I2C-bus/SMBus state machine are initialized to
                                their default states. The value of VPOR differs based on the VDD being lowered to or from
                                0 V. Figure 23 and Table 19 provide more details on this specification.

                   9.4 Device current consumption with internal pull-up and pull-down
                       resistors
                       The PCAL6408A integrates programmable pull-up and pull-down resistors to eliminate
                       external components when pins are configured as inputs and pull-up or pull-down
                       resistors are required (for example, nothing is driving the inputs to the power supply rails.
                       Since these pull-up and pull-down resistors are internal to the device itself, they contribute
                       to the current consumption of the device and must be considered in the overall system
                       design.
                       The pull-up or pull-down function is selected in register 44h, while the resistor is
                       connected by the enable register 43h. The configuration of the resistors is shown in
                       Figure 10.
                       If the resistor is configured as a pull-up, that is, connected to VDD, a current flows from the
                       VDD(P) pin through the resistor to ground when the pin is held LOW. This current appears
                       as additional IDD upsetting any current consumption measurements.
                       In the same manner, if the resistor is configured as a pull-down and the pin is held HIGH,
                       current flows from the power supply through the pin to the VSS pin. While this current is
                       not measured as part of IDD, one must be mindful of the 200 mA limiting value through
                       VSS.
                       The pull-up and pull-down resistors are simple resistors and the current is linear with
                       voltage. The resistance specification for these devices spans from 50 k with a nominal
                       100 k value. Any current flow through these resistors is additive by the number of pins
                       held HIGH or LOW and the current can be calculated by Ohm’s law. See Figure 27 for a
                       graph of supply current versus the number of pull-up resistors.

[1]   All typical values are at nominal supply voltage (1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V VDD) and Tamb = 25 C.
[2]   When power (from 0 V) is applied to VDD(P), an internal power-on reset holds the PCAL6408A in a reset condition until VDD(P) has
      reached VPOR. At that time, the reset condition is released, and the PCAL6408A registers and I2C-bus/SMBus state machine initialize to
      their default states. After that, VDD(P) must be lowered to below 0.2 V and back up to the operating voltage for a power-reset cycle.
[3]   The total current sourced by all I/Os must be limited to 80 mA.
[4]   Each I/O must be externally limited to a maximum of 25 mA, for a device total of 200 mA.
[5]   Typical value for Tamb = 25 C. VOL = 0.4 V and VDD = 3.3 V. Typical value for VDD < 2.5 V, VOL = 0.6 V.
[6]   Internal pull-up/pull-down resistor disabled.

                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                17.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 41) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 27 and 28

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 41.
