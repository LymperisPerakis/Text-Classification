The HC5503PRC is a low cost SLIC optimized for large                 Features
Telecom switches. It combines a flexible voltage feed
architecture with the Intersil latch-free DI bonded wafer            • Wide Operating Battery Range (-40V to -58V)
process, to provide a low component count, carrier class             • Single Additional +5V Supply
solution at very low cost. The re-configurable design permits
                                                                     • 30mA Short Loop Current Limit
simple, economical solutions for campus-wide call center
and PBX applications. External components can be used in             • Ring Relay Driver
conjunction with the high battery voltage capability to meet         • Switch Hook and Ring Trip Detect
the complex impedance and long loop drive requirements of
Central Office switches, worldwide.                                  • Low On-Hook Power Consumption

NOTE: Intersil Pb-free products employ special Pb-free material
sets; molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte tin
plate termination finish, which is compatible with both SnPb and
Pb-free soldering operations. Intersil Pb-free products are MSL
classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed
the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J Std-020B.

CAUTION: Stresses above those listed in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress only rating and operation of the
device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational sections of this specification is not implied.
NOTES:
 1. Absolute maximum ratings are limiting values, applied individually, beyond which the serviceability of the circuit may be impaired. Functional
     operability under any of these conditions is not necessarily implied.
 2. JA is measured with the component mounted on an evaluation PC board in free air.
 3. JA for the QFN package is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with direct
     attach features including conductive thermal vias. See Tech Brief TB379 and TB389 for additional information and board layout consideration

        1            28          TIP      An analog input connected to the TIP (more positive) side of the subscriber loop through a sense resistor
                                          (RS) and a ring relay contact. Functions with the Ring terminal to receive voice signals from the telephone
                                          and for loop monitoring purposes.
        2            31         RING      An analog input connected to the RING (more negative) side of the subscriber loop through a sense
                                          resistor (RS) and a ring relay contact. Functions with the Tip terminal to receive voice signals from the
                                          telephone and for loop monitoring purposes.
        3            32          RFS      Senses ring side of loop for ground key and ring trip detection. During ringing, the ring signal is inserted
                                          into the line at this node and RF is isolated from RFS via a relay.
        4             1          VB+      Positive Voltage Source - Most positive supply. VB+ is typically.
        5             3           C1      Capacitor #1 - An external capacitor to be connected between this terminal and analog ground. Required
                                          for proper operation of the loop current limiting function, and for filtering VB-. Typical value is 0.3F, 30V.
        6             4          DG       Digital Ground - To be connected to zero potential and serves as a reference for all digital inputs and
                                          outputs on the SLIC microcircuit.
        7             5           RS      Ring Synchronization Input - A TTL - compatible clock input. The clock should be arranged such that a
                                          positive pulse transition occurs on the zero crossing of the ring voltage source, as it appears at the RFS
                                          terminal. For Tip side injected systems, the RS pulse should occur on the negative going zero crossing
                                          and for Ring injected systems, on the positive going zero crossing. This ensures that the ring relay
                                          activates and deactivates when the instantaneous ring voltage is near zero. If synchronization is not
                                          required, the pin should be tied to 5V.
        8             6           RD      Relay Driver - A low active open collector logic output. When enabled, the external ring relay is energized.
        9            7, 8         TF      Tip Feed - A low impedance analog output connected to the TIP terminal through a sense resistor (RS).

   DIP/SOIC        QFN        SYMBOL                                                      DESCRIPTION
       15           15            PD       Power Denial - A low active TTL - Compatible logic input. When enabled, the ring feed voltage collapses
                                           to the tip feed voltage (~4V). The DC feed is disabled, but the AC transmission is maintained. The switch
                                           hook detect (SHD) is not necessarily valid, and the relay driver (RD) output is disabled.
       16           16            RC       Ring Command - A low active TTL - Compatible logic input. When enabled, the relay driver (RD) output
                                           goes low on the next high level of the ring sync (RS) input, as long as the SLIC is not in the power denial
                                           state (PD = 0) or the subscriber is not already off- hook (SHD = 0).

       18           20           OUT       The analog output of the spare operational amplifier.
       19           21            -IN      The inverting analog input of the spare operational amplifier.
       20           22           +IN       The non-inverting analog input of the spare operational amplifier.
       21           23            RX       Receive Input, Four Wire Side - A high impedance analog input which is internally biased. Capacitive
                                           coupling to this input is required. AC signals appearing at this input differentially drive the Tip feed and
                                           Ring feed terminals.
       22           25            C2       Capacitor #2 - An external capacitor to be connected between this terminal and analog ground. This
                                           capacitor is required for the proper operation of ring trip detection. Recommended value 0.82F 10%
                                           10V non-polarized.
       23           26            AG       Analog Ground - To be connected to zero potential and serves as a reference for the transmit output (TX)
                                           and receive input (RX) terminals.
       24           27            TX       Transmit Output, Four Wire Side - A low impedance analog output proportional to the loop current.
                                           Transhybrid balancing must be performed beyond this output to completely implement two to four wire
                                           conversion. This output is unbalanced and referenced to analog ground. Since the DC level of this output
                                           varies with loop current, capacitive coupling to the next stage is essential.
                   2, 17,         NC       No internal connection.

                    30,
NOTE: All grounds (AG, BG, and DG) must be applied before VB+ or VB-. Failure to do so may result in premature failure of the part. If a user wishes
to run separate grounds off a line card, the AG must be applied first.
