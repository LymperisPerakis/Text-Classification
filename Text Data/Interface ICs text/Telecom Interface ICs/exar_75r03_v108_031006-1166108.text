   38       TxON_0         I     Transmitter ON Input - Channel 0:
   1        TxON_1               Transmitter ON Input - Channel 1:
  125       TxON_2               Transmitter ON Input - Channel 2:
                                 These input pins are used to either enable or disable the Transmit Output
                                 Driver corresponding to Channel_n.
                                 "Low" - Disables the Transmit Output Driver of the corresponding Channel.
                                 In this setting, the corresponding TTIP_n and TRING_n output pins will be
                                 tri-stated.
                                 "High" - Enables the Transmit Output Driver of the corresponding Channel.
                                 In this setting, the corresponding TTIP_n and TRING_n output pins will be
                                 enabled.
                                 NOTES:
                                       1.   Even when the XRT75R03 is configured in HOST mode, these
                                            pins will be active. To enable software control of the Transmit
                                            Output Driver outputs, pull these pins "High".
                                       2.   When Transmitters are turned off either in Host or Hardware
                                            mode, the TTIP and TRing outputs are Tri-stated.
                                       3.   These pins are internally pulled "High"

                                 These input pins have two functions:
                                 • They function as the timing source for the Transmit Section of the
                                    corresponding channel within the XRT75R03.
                                 • They also are used by the Transmit Section of the LIU IC to sample the
                                    corresponding TPDATA_n and TNDATA_n input pin.
                                 NOTE: The user is expected to supply a 44.736MHz ± 20ppm clock signal
                                           (for DS3 applications), 34.368MHz ± 20 ppm clock signal (for E3
                                           applications) or a 51.84MHz ± 4.6ppm clock signal (for STS-1,
                                           Stratum 3E or better applications).

                                   The function of these input pins depends upon whether the corresponding
                                   channel has been configured to operate in the Single-Rail or Dual-Rail
                                   Mode.
                                   Single Rail Mode - Transmit Data Input - Channel n:
                                   If the Channel has been configured to operate in the Single-Rail Mode,
                                   then all transmit output data will be serially applied to this input pin. This
                                   signal will latched into the Transmit Section circuitry upon either the rising
                                   or falling edge of the TxCLK_n signal, depending upon user configuration.
                                   In the Single-Rail Mode, the Transmit Section of the LIU IC will then encode
                                   this data into either the B3ZS line code (for DS3 and STS-1 applications) or
                                   the HDB3 line code (for E3 applications).
                                   Dual Rail Mode - Transmit Positive Data Input - Channel n:
                                   If the Channel has been configured to operate in the Dual-Rail Mode, then
                                   the user should apply a pulse to this input pin, anytime the Transmit Sec-
                                   tion of the LIU IC is suppose to generate and transmit a positive-polarity
                                   pulse onto the line. This signal will be latched into the Transmit Section cir-
                                   cuitry upon either the rising or falling edge of the TxCLK_n signal, depend-
                                   ing upon user configuration.
                                   In the Dual-Rail Mode, the Transmit Section of the LIU IC will NOT encode
                                   this data into either the B3ZS or HDB3 line codes. If the user configures
                                   the LIU IC to operate in the Dual-Rail Mode, then B3ZS/HDB3 encoding
                                   must have already been done prior to providing the transmit output data to
                                   this input pin.

                                       1.  These guidelines must be followed in order to insure that the
                                           Transmit Section of Channel_n will always generate a DS3 pulse
                                           that complies with the Isolated Pulse Template requirements per
                                           Bellcore GR-499-CORE, or an STS-1 pulse that complies with the
                                           Pulse Template requirements per Telcordia GR-253-CORE.
                                       2.  This input pin is inactive if the XRT75R03 has been configured to
                                           operate in the Host Mode, or if the corresponding channel has
                                           been configured to operate in the E3 Mode. If either of these
                                           cases are true, then tie this input pin to GND.

            INT              This input pin is used to configure the Receive Section, in each of the three
                             channels within the chip, to automatically pull their corresponding Recovered
                             Data Output pins (e.g. RPOS_n and RNEG_n) to GND anytime and for the
                             duration that the Receive Section declares the LOS defect condition. In other
                             words, this feature if enabled will cause the Receive Channel to automatically
                             mute the Recovered data anytime and for the duration that the Receive Section
                             declares the LOS defect condition.
                             "Low" - Disables the Muting upon LOS feature. In this setting the Receive Sec-
                             tion will NOT automatically mute the Recovered Data whenever it is declaring
                             the LOS defect condition.

                                 1. The Analog LOS Defect Declaration Threshold (e.g., the maximum signal
                                    level that the Receive Section of a given channel must detect before
                                    declaring the LOS Defect condition), and
                                 2. The Analog LOS Defect Clearance Threshold (e.g., the minimum signal
                                    level that the Receive Section of a given channel must detect before
                                    clearing the LOS Defect condition)
                             Setting this input pin "High" selects one set of Analog LOS Defect Declaration
                             and Clearance thresholds. Setting this input pin "Low" selects the other set of
                             Analog LOS Defect Declaration and Clearance thresholds.

                                tions of each channel, then all three channels will begin to receive the incoming
                                DS3, E3 or STS-1 data-streams via the RTIP_n and RRING_n input pins.
                                Conversely, if the user turns off the Receive Section, then the entire Receive

                             RPOS_n or RNEG_n/LCV_n output pins upon either the rising or falling edge of
                             the RCLK_n clock output signal.
                             "Low" - Configures each of the Receive Sections to output the recovered data
                             via the RPOS_n and RNEG_n/LCV_n output pins upon the rising edge of the
                             RCLK_n output clock signal.
                             "High" - Configures each of the Receive Sections to output the recovered data
                             via the RPOS_n and RNEG_n/LCV_n output pins upon the falling edge of the

                             NOTES:
                                   1.  This input pin will function as the CS (Chip Select Input pin) of the
                                       Microprocessor Serial Interface when the XRT75R03 has been
                                       configured to operate in the Host Mode.
                                   2.  This configuration setting applies globally to all three (3) of the
                                       channels within the XRT75R03.
                                   3.  If the Receive Sections are configured to operate in the Single-Rail
                                       Mode, then the LCV_n output pin will be updated on the user-selected
                                       edge of the RCLK_n signal, per this configuration selection.
  106     SFM_EN        I    Single Frequency Mode Enable:
                             This input pin is used to configure the XRT75R03 to operate in the SFM (Single
                             Frequency) Mode.
                             When this feature is invoked the Single-Frequency Mode Synthesizer will
                             become active. By applying a 12.288MHz clock signal to pin 109, STS-1CLK/
                             12M the XRT75R03 will, depending upon which mode the user has configured
                             each of the three channels, generate all of the appropriate clock signals (e.g.,
                             34.368MHz, 44.736MHz or 51.84. Further, the XRT75R03 internal circuitry will
                             route each of these synthesized clock signals to the appropriate nodes of the
                             corresponding three channels in the XRT75R03.
                             "Low" - Disables the Single Frequency Mode. In this configuration setting, the
                             user is required to supply to the E3CLK, DS3CLK or STS-1CLK input pins all of
                             the relevant clock signals that are to be used within the chip.
                             "High" - Enables the Single-Frequency Mode. A 12.288MHz clock signal MUST
                             be applied to pin 109 (STS-1CLK/12M).
                             NOTE: This input pin is internally pulled low.

                                     then the XRT75R03 will request an interrupt from the Microprocessor by tog-
                                     gling this output pin "Low".
                                     NOTES:
                                           1.  If the XRT75R03 device is configured to operate in the Hardware
                                               Mode, then this pin functions as the LOSMUT input pin.
                                           2.  This pin will remain "Low" until the Interrupt has been served.
 101         RESET           I       Microprocessor Serial Interface - H/W RESET Input:
                                     Pulsing this input "Low" causes the XRT75R03 to reset the contents of the on-
                                     chip Command Registers to their default values. As a consequence, the
                                     XRT75R03 will then also be operating in its default condition.
                                     For normal operation pull this input pin to a logic "High".
                                     NOTE: This input pin is internally pulled high.

  1.0 R3 TECHNOLOGY (RECONFIGURABLE, RELAYLESS REDUNDANCY)
Redundancy is used to introduce reliability and protection into network card design. The redundant card in
many cases is an exact replicate of the primary card, such that when a failure occurs the network processor
can automatically switch to the backup card. EXAR’s R3 technology has re-defined E3/DS-3/STS-1 LIU design
for 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy applications. Without relays and one Bill of Materials, EXAR offers multi-port,
integrated LIU solutions to assist high density agregate applications and framing requirements with reliability.
The following section can be used as a reference for implementing R3 Technology with EXAR’s world leading
line interface units.
  1.1     Network Architecture
A common network design that supports 1:1 or 1+1 redundancy consists of N primary cards along with N
backup cards that connect into a mid-plane or back-plane architecture without transformers installed on the
network cards. In addition to the network cards, the design has a line interface card with one source of
transformers, connectors, and protection components that are common to both network cards. Wtih this
design, the bill of materials is reduced to the fewest amount of components. See Figure 3 for a simplified block

  1.2     Power Failure Protection
EXAR’s "High" impedance circuits protect the LIU and preserve the line impedance characteristics when a
power failure occurs. As the power supply decreases to a pre-determined voltage, the I/O pads are
automatically switched to "High" impedance. This effectively removes the LIU, preventing a line impedance
mismatch or system degradation. Power failures or network card hot swapping change the network circuit. It
is critical that under these circumstances, that the primary card still behaves according to network standards.
The three sensitive specifications are pulse mask conformance, receive sensitivity and return loss. Each must
be carefully characterized to ensure network integrity and reliability.
  1.3     Software vs Hardware Automatic Protection Switching
The implementation of R3 technology can be controlled through programming the internal registers or through
the use of the TxON hardware pin available within the LIU. To use software to tri-state the transmitters, first
the TxON pin must be pulled "High". Once the pin is pulled "High", the individual register bits can be used to
control the output activity of the transmit path. To use the TxON pin, the individual register bits can be set
"High", and the control of the transmitters is handled by setting the state of the TxON pin.

THREE CHANNEL E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH JITTER ATTENUATOR                                  REV. 1.0.8
FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION:
Figure 1 shows the functional block diagram of the device. Each channel can be independently configured
either by Hardware Mode or by Host Mode to support E3, DS3 or STS-1 modes. A detailed operation of each
section is described below.
Each channel consists of the following functional blocks:
 5.0 THE TRANSMITTER SECTION:
The Transmitter Section, within each Channel, accepts TTL/CMOS level signals from the Terminal Equipment
in selectable data formats.
• Convert the CMOS level B3ZS or HDB3 encoded data into pulses with shapes that are compliant with the
  various industry standard pulse template requirements. Figures 7, 8 and 9 illustrate the pulse template
  requirements.
• Encode the un-encoded NRZ data into either B3ZS format for (DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3) and
  convert to pulses with shapes and width that are compliant with industry standard pulse template
  requirements. Figures 7, 8 and 9 illustrate the pulse template requirements.
• In Single-Rail or un-encoded Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) mode, data is input via TPData_n pins while
  TNData_n pins must be grounded. The NRZ or Single-Rail mode is selected when the SR/DR input pin is
  “High” (in Hardware Mode) or bit 0 of channel control register is “1” (in Host Mode). Figure 12 illustrates the
  Single-Rail or NRZ format.

          TxClk
• In Dual-Rail mode, data is input via TPData_n and TNData_n pins. TPData_n contains positive data and
  TNData_n contains negative data. The SR/DR input pin = “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or bit 0 of channel
  register = “0” (in Host Mode) enables the Dual-Rail mode. Figure 13 illustrates the Dual-Rail data format.

 5.1     TRANSMIT CLOCK:
The Transmit Clock applied via TxClk_n pins, for the selected data rate (for E3 = 34.368 MHz, DS3 = 44.736
MHz or STS-1 = 51.84 MHz), is duty cycle corrected by the internal PLL circuit to provide a 50% duty cycle
clock to the pulse shaping circuit. This allows a 30% to 70% duty cycle Transmit Clock to be supplied.
 5.2     B3ZS/HDB3 ENCODER:
When the Single-Rail (NRZ) data format is selected, the Encoder Block encodes the data into either B3ZS
format (for either DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3).
 5.2.1      B3ZS Encoding:
An example of B3ZS encoding is shown in Figure 14. If the encoder detects an occurrence of three
consecutive zeros in the data stream, it is replaced with either B0V or 00V, where ‘B’ refers to Bipolar pulse
that is compliant with the Alternating polarity requirement of the AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion) line code and
‘V’ refers to a Bipolar Violation (e.g., a bipolar pulse that violates the AMI line code). The substitution of B0V or
00V is made so that an odd number of bipolar pulses exist between any two consecutive violation (V) pulses.
This avoids the introduction of a DC component into the line signal.

 5.2.2      HDB3 Encoding:
An example of the HDB3 encoding is shown in Figure 15. If the HDB3 encoder detects an occurrence of four
consecutive zeros in the data stream, then the four zeros are substituted with either 000V or B00V pattern. The
substitution code is made in such a way that an odd number of pulses exist between any consecutive V pulses.
This avoids the introduction of DC component into the analog signal.

THREE CHANNEL E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH JITTER ATTENUATOR                                               REV. 1.0.8
NOTES:
      1.  When Dual-Rail data format is selected, the B3ZS/HDB3 Encoder is automatically disabled.
      2.  In Single-Rail format, the Bipolar Violations in the incoming data stream is converted to valid data pulses.
      3.  Encoder and Decoder is enabled only in Single-Rail mode.
 5.3      TRANSMIT PULSE SHAPER:
The Transmit Pulse Shaper converts the B3ZS encoded digital pulses into a single analog Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI) pulse that meet the industry standard mask template requirements for STS-1 and DS3. See
Figures 8 and 9.
For E3 mode, the pulse shaper converts the HDB3 encoded pulses into a single full amplitude square shaped
pulse with very little slope. This is illustrated in Figure 7.
The Pulse Shaper Block also includes a Transmit Build Out Circuit, which can either be disabled or enabled by
setting the TxLEV_n input pin “High” or “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the TxLEV_n bit to “1” or “0” in the
control register (in Host Mode).
For DS3/STS-1 rates, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is used to shape the transmit waveform that ensures that
transmit pulse template requirements are met at the Cross-Connect system. The distance between the
transmitter output and the Cross-Connect system can be between 0 to 450 feet.
For E3 rate, since the output pulse template is measured at the secondary of the transformer and since there is
no Cross-Connect system pulse template requirements, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is always disabled.
  5.3.1      Guidelines for using Transmit Build Out Circuit:
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1, Cross-Connect system, is less than 225 feet,
enable the Transmit Build Out Circuit by setting the TxLEV_n input pin “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the
TxLEV_n control bit to “0” (in Host Mode).
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1 is greater than 225 feet, disable the Transmit
Build Out Circuit.
  5.3.2      Interfacing to the line:
The differential line driver increases the transmit waveform to appropriate level and drives into the 75Ω load as
shown in Figure 6.
                                                                42

 5.4     Transmit Drive Monitor:
This feature is used for monitoring the transmit line for occurrence of fault conditions such as a short circuit on
the line or a defective line driver.
To activate this function, connect MTIP_n pins to the TTIP_n lines via a 270 Ω resistor and MRing_n pins to
TRing_n lines via 270 Ω resistor as shown in Figure 16.

When the MTIP_n and MRing_n are connected to the TTIP_n and TRing_n lines, the drive monitor circuit
monitors the line for transitions. The DMO_n (Drive Monitor Output) will be asserted “Low” as long as the
transitions on the line are detected via MTIP_n and MRing_n.
If no transitions on the line are detected for 128 ± 32 TxClk_n periods, the DMO_n output toggles “High” and
when the transitions are detected again, DMO_n toggles “Low”.
NOTE: The Drive Monitor Circuit is only for diagnostic purpose and does not have to be used to operate the transmitter.
 5.5     Transmitter Section On/Off:
The transmitter section of each channel can either be turned on or off. To turn on the transmitter, set the input
pin TxON_n to “High” (in Hardware Mode) or write a “1” to the TxON_n control bits (in Host Mode) and TxON_n
pins tied “High”.
When the transmitter is turned off, TTIP_n and TRing_n are tri-stated.
NOTES:
     1.   This feature provides support for Redundancy.
     2.    If the XRT75R03 is configured in Host mode, to permit a system designed for redundancy to quickly shut-off the
         defective line card and turn on the back-up line card, writing a “1” to the TxON_n control bits transfers the control
         to TxON_n pins.
 6.0 THE RECEIVER SECTION:
This section describes the detailed operation of the various blocks in the receiver. The receiver recovers the
TTL/CMOS level data from the incoming bipolar B3ZS or HDB3 encoded input pulses.
 6.1     AGC/Equalizer:
The Adaptive Gain Control circuit amplifies the incoming analog signal and compensates for the various flat
losses and also for the loss at one-half symbol rate. The AGC has a dynamic range of 30 dB.
The Equalizer restores the integrity of the signal and compensates for the frequency dependent attenuation of
up to 900 feet of coaxial cable (1300 feet for E3). The Equalizer also boosts the high frequency content of the
                                                             43

THREE CHANNEL E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH JITTER ATTENUATOR                                            REV. 1.0.8
signal to reduce Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) so that the slicer slices the signal at 50% of peak voltage to
generate Positive and Negative data.
The Equalizer can either be “IN” or “OUT” by setting the REQEN_n pin “High” or “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or
setting the REQEN_n control bit to “1” or “0” (in Host Mode).
 Recommendations for Equalizer Settings:
The Equalizer has two gain settings to provide optimum equalization. In the case of normally shaped DS3/
STS-1 pulses (pulses that meet the template requirements) that has been driven through 0 to 900 feet of cable,
the Equalizer can be left “IN” by setting the REQEN_n pin to “High” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the
REQEN_n control bit to “1” (in Host Mode).
However, for square-shaped pulses such as E3 or for DS3/STS-1 high pulses (that does not meet the pulse
template requirements), it is recommended that the Equalizer be left “OUT” for cable length less than 300 feet
by setting the REQEN_n pin “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or by setting the REQEN_n control bit to “0” (in Host
Mode).This would help to prevent over-equalization of the signal and thus optimize the performance in terms of
better jitter transfer characteristics.
NOTE:      The results of extensive testing indicates that even when the Equalizer was left “IN” (REQEN_n = “HIGH”),
         regardless of the cable length, the integrity of the E3 signal was restored properly over 0 to 12 dB cable loss at
         Industrial Temperature.
The Equalizer also contain an additional 20 dB gain stage to provide the line monitoring capability of the
resistively attenuated signals which may have 20dB flat loss. This capability can be turned on by writing a “1” to
the RxMON_n bits in the control register or by setting the RxMON pin (pin 69) “High”. However, asserting or
enabling RxMON suppresses the internal LOS circuitry and LOS will never assert nor LOS be declared when
operating with RxMON enabled.
 6.1.1        Interference Tolerance:
For E3 mode, ITU-T G.703 Recommendation specifies that the receiver be able to recover error-free clock and
data in the presence of a sinusoidal interfering tone signal. For DS3 and STS-1 modes, the same
recommendation is being used. Figure 17 shows the configuration to test the interference margin for DS3/
STS1. Figure 18 shows the set up for E3.

 6.2     Clock and Data Recovery:
The Clock and Data Recovery Circuit extracts the embedded clock, RxClk_n from the sliced digital data stream
and provides the retimed data to the B3ZS (HDB3) decoder.
The Clock Recovery PLL can be in one of the following two modes:
Training Mode:
In the absence of input signals at RTIP_n and RRing_n pins, or when the frequency difference between the
recovered line clock signal and the reference clock applied on the ExClk_n input pins exceed 0.5%, a Loss of
Lock condition is declared by toggling RLOL_n output pin “High” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the RLOL_n bit
to “1” in the control registers (in Host Mode). Also, the clock output on the RxClk_n pins are the same as the
reference clock channel.

THREE CHANNEL E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH JITTER ATTENUATOR                                   REV. 1.0.8
Data/Clock Recovery Mode:
In the presence of input line signals on the RTIP_n and RRing_n input pins and when the frequency difference
between the recovered clock signal and the reference clock signal is less than 0.5%, the clock that is output on
the RxClk_n out pins is the Recovered Clock signal.
  6.3     B3ZS/HDB3 Decoder:
The decoder block takes the output from clock and data recovery block and decodes the B3ZS (for DS3 or
STS-1) or HDB3 (for E3) encoded line signal and detects any coding errors or excessive zeros in the data
stream.
Whenever the input signal violates the B3ZS or HDB3 coding sequence for bipolar violation or contains three
(for B3ZS) or four (for HDB3) or more consecutive zeros, an active “High” pulse is generated on the RLCV_n
output pins to indicate line code violation.
NOTE: In Dual- Rail mode, the decoder is bypassed.
  6.4     LOS (Loss of Signal) Detector:
  6.4.1      DS3/STS-1 LOS Condition:
A Digital Loss of SIgnal (DLOS) condition occurs when a string of 175 ± 75 consecutive zeros occur on the line.
When the DLOS condition occurs, the DLOS_n bit is set to “1” in the status control register. DLOS condition is
cleared when the detected average pulse density is greater than 33% for 175 ± 75 pulses.
Analog Loss of Signal (ALOS) condition occurs when the amplitude of the incoming line signal is below the
threshold as shown in the Table 10.The status of the ALOS condition is reflected in the ALOS_n status control
register.
RLOS is the logical OR of the DLOS and ALOS states. When the RLOS condition occurs the RLOS_n output
pin is toggled “High” and the RLOS_n bit is set to “1” in the status control register.

DISABLING ALOS/DLOS DETECTION:
For debugging purposes it is useful to disable the ALOS and/or DLOS detection. Writing a “1” to both
ALOSDIS_n and DLOSDIS_n bits disables the LOS detection on a per channel basis.
  6.4.2      E3 LOS Condition:
If the level of incoming line signal drops below the threshold as described in the ITU-T G.775 standard, the
LOS condition is detected. Loss of signal level is defined to be between 15 and 35 dB below the normal level.
If the signal drops below 35 dB for 10 to 225 consecutive pulse periods, LOS condition is declared. This is
illustrated in Figure 19.

locks into the rate clock generated and output this clock on the RxClk_n pins. The data on the RPOS_n and
RNEG_n pins can be forced to zero by pulling the LOSMUT pin “High” (in Hardware Mode) or by setting the
LOSMUT_n bits in the individual channel control register to “1” (in Host Mode).
NOTE: When the LOS condition is cleared, the recovered data is output on RPOS_n and RNEG_n pins.
  7.0 JITTER:
There are three fundamental parameters that describe circuit performance relative to jitter:
• Jitter Tolerance (Receiver)
• Jitter Transfer (Receiver/Transmitter)
• Jitter Generation
  7.1     JITTER TOLERANCE - RECEIVER:
Jitter tolerance is a measure of how well a Clock and Data Recovery unit can successfully recover data in the
presence of various forms of jitter. It is characterized by the amount of jitter required to produce a specified bit
error rate. The tolerance depends on the frequency content of the jitter. Jitter Tolerance is measured as the
jitter amplitude over a jitter spectrum for which the clock and data recovery unit achieves a specified bit error
rate (BER). To measure the jitter tolerance as shown in Figure 21, jitter is introduced by the sinusoidal
modulation of the serial data bit sequence.

Input jitter tolerance requirements are specified in terms of compliance with jitter mask which is represented as
a combination of points.Each point corresponds to a minimum amplitude of sinusoidal jitter at a given jitter
frequency.
  7.1.1      DS3/STS-1 Jitter Tolerance Requirements:
Bellcore GR-499 CORE, Issue 1, December 1995 specifies the minimum requirement of jitter tolerance for
Category I and Category II. The jitter tolerance requirement for Category II is the most stringent. Figure 22
shows the jitter tolerance curve as per GR-499 specification.

 7.2      JITTER TRANSFER - RECEIVER/TRANSMITTER:
Jitter Transfer function is defined as the ratio of jitter on the output relative to the jitter applied on the input
versus frequency.
There are two distinct characteristics in jitter transfer: jitter gain (jitter peaking) defined as the highest ratio
above 0dB; and jitter transfer bandwidth.The overall jitter transfer bandwidth is controlled by a low bandwidth
loop, typically using a voltage-controller crystal oscillator (VCXO).
The jitter transfer function is a ratio between the jitter output and jitter input for a component, or system often
expressed in dB. A negative dB jitter transfer indicates the element removed jitter. A positive dB jitter transfer
indicates the element added jitter.A zero dB jitter transfer indicates the element had no effect on jitter.
Table 12 shows the jitter transfer characteristics and/or jitter attenuation specifications for various data rates:
                                 TABLE 12: JITTER TRANSFER SPECIFICATION/REFERENCES

                                                       Category I and Category II
The above specifications can be met only with a jitter attenuator that supports E3/DS3/STS-1 rates.
 7.3      Jitter Attenuator:
An advanced crystal-less jitter attenuator per channel is included in the XRT75R03. The jitter attenuator
requires no external crystal nor high-frequency reference clock.
In Host mode, by clearing or setting the JATx/Rx_n bits in the channel control registers selects the jitter
attenuator either in the Receive or Transmit path on per channel basis. In Hardware mode, JATx/Rx pin selects
globally all three channels either in Receive or Transmit path.
The FIFO size can be either 16-bit or 32-bit. In HOST mode, the bits JA0_n and JA1_n can be set to
appropriate combination to select the different FIFO sizes or to disable the Jitter Attenuator on a per channel
basis. In Hardware mode, appropriate setting of the pins JA0 and JA1 selects the different FIFO sizes or
disables the Jitter Attenuator for all three channels. Data is clocked into the FIFO with the associated clock
signal (TxClk or RxClk) and clocked out of the FIFO with the dejittered clock. When the FIFO is within two bits
of overflowing or underflowing, the FIFO limit status bit, FL_n is set to “1” in the Alarm status register. Reading
this bit clears the FIFO and resets the bit into default state.
NOTE: It is recommended to select the 16-bit FIFO for delay-sensitive applications as well as for removing smaller amounts
         of jitter. Table 13 specifies the jitter transfer mask requirements for various data rates:

 7.3.1       JITTER GENERATION:
Jitter Generation is defined as the process whereby jitter appears at the output port of the digital equipment in
the absence of applied input jitter. Jitter Generation is measured by sending jitter free data to the clock and
data recovery circuit and measuring the amount of jitter on the output clock or the re-timed data. Since this is
essentially a noise measurement, it requires a definition of bandwidth to be meaningful. The bandwidth is set
according to the data rate. In general, the jitter is measured over a band of frequencies.
8.0 SERIAL HOST INTERFACE:
 A serial microprocessor interface is included in the XRT75R03. The interface is generic and is designed to
support the common microprocessors/microcontrollers. The XRT75R03 operates in Host mode when the
HOST/HW pin is tied “High”. The serial interface includes a serial clock (SClk), serial data input (SDI), serial
data output (SDO), chip select (CS) and interrupt output (INT). The serial interface timing is shown in Figure
11.
The active low interrupt output signal (INT pin) indicates alarm conditions like LOS, DMO and FL to the
processor.

NOTE: While configured in Host mode, the TxON_n input pins will be active if the TxON_n bits in the control register are set
       to “1”, and can be used to turn on and off the transmit output drivers. This permits a system designed for
       redundancy to quickly switch out a defective line card and switch-in the backup line card.

 9.0 DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES:
 9.1     PRBS Generator and Detector:
The XRT75R03 contains an on-chip Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator and detector for
diagnostic purpose. This feature is only available in Host mode. With the PRBSEN_n bit = “1”, the transmitter
will send out PRBS of 223-1 in E3 rate or 215-1 in STS-1/DS3 rate. At the same time, the receiver PRBS
detector is also enabled. When the correct PRBS pattern is detected by the receiver, the RNEG/LCV pin will go
“Low” to indicate PRBS synchronization has been achieved. When the PRBS detector is not in sync the
PRBSLS bit will be set to “1” and RNEG/LCV pin will go “High”.
With the PRBS mode enabled, the user can also insert a single bit error by toggling “INSPRBS” bit. This is
done by writing a “1” to INSPRBS bit. The receiver at RNEG/LCV pin will pulse “High” for one RxClk cycle for
every bit error detected. Any subsequent single bit error insertion must be done by first writing a “0” to
INSPRBS bit and followed by a “1”.
Figure 25 shows the status of RNEG/LCV pin when the XRT75R03 is configured in PRBS mode.
NOTE: In PRBS mode, the device is forced to operate in Single-Rail Mode.

 9.2     LOOPBACKS:
The XRT75R03 offers three loopback modes for diagnostic purposes. In Hardware mode, the loopback modes
are selected via the RLB_n and LLB_n pins. In Host mode, the RLB_n and LLB_n bits n the Channel control
registers select the loopback modes.

In this mode, the transmitter outputs (TTIP_n and TRING_n) are connected internally to the receiver inputs
(RTIP_n and RRING_n) as shown in Figure 26. Data and clock are output at RCLK_n, RPOS_n and RNEG_n
pins for the corresponding transceiver. Analog loopback exercises most of the functional blocks of the device
including the jitter attenuator which can be selected in either the transmit or receive path.
XRT75R03 can be configured in Analog Loopback either in Hardware mode via the LLB_n and RLB_n pins or
in Host mode via LLB_n and RLB_n bits in the channel control registers.
NOTES:
     1.   In the Analog loopback mode, data is also output via TTIP_n and TRING_n pins.
     2.   Signals on the RTIP_n and RRING_n pins are ignored during analog loopback.

 9.2.2      DIGITAL LOOPBACK:
The Digital Loopback function is available either in Hardware mode or Host mode. When the Digital Loopback
is selected, the transmit clock (TxClk_n) and transmit data inputs (TPDATA_n & TNDATA_n) are looped back
and output onto the RxClk_n, RPOS_n and RNEG_n pins as shown in Figure 27.

 9.2.3      REMOTE LOOPBACK:
With Remote loopback activated as shown in Figure 28, the receive data on RTIP and RRING is looped back
after the jitter attenuator (if selected in receive or transmit path) to the transmit path using RxClk as transmit
timing. The receive data is also output via the RPOS and RNEG pins.
During the remote loopback mode, if the jitter attenuator is selected in the transmit path, the receive data after
the Clock and Data Recovery Block is looped back to the transmit path and passed through the jitter attenuator
using RxClk as the transmit timing.
NOTE: Input signals on TxClk, TPDATA and TNDATA are ignored during Remote loopback.

9.3      TRANSMIT ALL ONES (TAOS):
Transmit All Ones (TAOS) can be set either in Hardware mode by pulling the TAOS_n pins “High” or in Host
mode by setting the TAOS_n control bits to “1” in the Channel control registers. When the TAOS is set, the
Transmit Section generates and transmits a continuous AMI all “1’s” pattern on TTIP_n and TRING_n pins.
The frequency of this “1’s” pattern is determined by TClk_n.TAOS data path is shown in Figure 29. TAOS does
not operate in Analog loopback or Remote loopback modes. It will function in Digital loopback mode.
