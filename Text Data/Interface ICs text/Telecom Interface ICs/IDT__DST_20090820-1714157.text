      TSIG[2]                     66    The signaling bits are input on these pins. They are located in the lower nibble (b5 ~ b8) and are channel/timeslot-
                                        aligned with the data input on the corresponding TSDn pin.
                                        In Transmit Clock Master mode, TSIGn is sampled on the active edge of the corresponding TSCKn.
                                        In Transmit Clock Slave mode, selected by the TSLVCK bit (b1, T1/J1-010H / b1, E1-010H), TSIGn is sampled on the

Intrusive Monitoring per T1.102 can be performed between two devices.

and Figure 5&Figure 6 (COAX).
    After the high resistance bridging circuit, the signal arriving at RTIPn/
RRINGn of the monitoring link is dramatically attenuated. To compen-
sate this bridge resistive attenuation, Monitor Gain can be used to boost
the signal by 22 dB, as selected by the MG[1:0] bits (b1~0, T1/J1-
02AH,...). For normal operation, the Monitor Gain should be set to 0 dB,
i.e., the Monitor Gain of the monitored link should be 0 dB.
    The monitoring link can be configured to any of the External or
Partially Internal Impedance Matching mode. Here the external r or
internal IM is used for voltage division, not for impedance matching. That
is, the r (IM) and the R make up of a resistance bridge. The resistive

3.5        CLOCK AND DATA RECOVERY
      The Clock and Data Recovery is used to recover the clock signal
from the received data. It is accomplished by Digital Phase Locked Loop
(DPLL). The recovered clock tracks the jitter in the data output from the
Data Slicer and keeps the phase relationship between data and clock
during the absence of the incoming pulse.
      SJET provides two reference clock outputs REFA_OUT and
REFB_OUT. These pins output a recovered clock from the Clock and
Data Recovery function block of one of the two links. The link is selected
by the RO1[0] for REFA_OUT and with RO2[0] for REFB_OUT.
      When Loss of Signal (LOS) is detected (Chapter 3.7.3 LOS Detec-
tion) on the link selected for REFA_OUT/REFB_OUT, this pin outputs
MCLK (delivered from OSCI input) or a high level signal as selected by
the REFH_LOS bit.

whose frequency is above Corner Frequency (CF). The jitter whose fre-
quency is lower than the CF passes through the DPLL without any atten-
uation. In T1/J1 applications, the CF of the DPLL can be 5 Hz or 1.26
Hz, as selected by the RJA_BW bit. In E1 applications, the CF of the
DPLL can be 6.77 Hz or 0.87 Hz, as selected by the RJA_BW bit. The
lower the CF is, the longer time is needed to achieve synchronization.
       If the incoming data moves faster than the outgoing data, the FIFO
will overflow. If the incoming data moves slower than the outgoing data,
the FIFO will underflow. The overflow or underflow is captured by the
RJA_IS bit. When the RJA_IS bit is ‘1’, an interrupt will be reported on
the INT pin if enabled by the RJA_IE bit.
       To avoid overflow or underflow, the JA-Limit function can be
enabled by setting the RJA_LIMT bit. When the JA-Limit function is
enabled, the speed of the outgoing data will be adjusted automatically if
the FIFO is close to its full or emptiness. The criteria of speed adjust-
ment start are listed in Table 6. Though the JA-Limit function can reduce
the possibility of FIFO overflow and underflow, the quality of jitter attenu-
ation is deteriorated.

3.8.2        E1 MODE
      In E1 mode, the Frame Processor searches for Basic Frame syn-
chronization, CRC Multi-frame synchronization, and Channel Associated
Signaling (CAS) Multi-frame synchronization in the received data
stream. Figure 11 shows the searching process.
      Once the frame is synchronized, the Frame Processor keeps on
monitoring the received data stream. If there are any framing bit errors,
CAS Multi-Frame alignment pattern errors, CRC Multi-Frame alignment
pattern errors or CRC errors, the Frame Processor will indicate these
errors. The status of loss of frame, loss of Signaling Multi-Frame and
loss of CRC Multi-Frame can also be detected and declared based on
user-selectable criteria. A software reset can also make the Frame Pro-
cessor reframe.
      The Frame Processor can extract the data stream in TS16, and
output the extracted data on a separate pin. The Frame Processor also
extracts the contents of the International bits (from both the FAS and the
NFAS frames), the National bits and the Extra bits (from TS16 in the
frame 0 of the Signaling Multi-Frame), and stores these data in registers.
The CRC Sub Multi-Frame alignment 4 bit codeword in the National bit
positions Sa4 to Sa8 can also be extracted and stored in registers, and
updated every CRC Sub Multi-Frame.
      The Framer Processor identifies the Remote Alarm bit (bit 3 of TS0
of NFAS frames) and Remote Signaling Multi-Frame Alarm (bit 6 of
TS16 of the frame 0 of the Signaling Multi-Frame). The ‘de-bounced’
Remote Alarm and Remote Signaling Multi-Frame Alarm can be indi-
cated if the corresponding bit has been a certain logic for 1 or 4 consec-
utive times. The AIS (Alarm Indication Signal) Alarm can also be
detected. The Frame Processor can also declare a Red Alarm if the out-
of-frame condition has persisted for at least 100 ms.
      An interrupt output is provided to indicate status changes and the
occurrence of some events. The interrupts may be generated every
Basic Frame, CRC Sub Multi-Frame, CRC Multi-Frame or Signaling
Multi-Frame.
      The Frame Processor can also be bypassed by setting the UNFM
bit.

      The algorithm used to search for the E1 Basic Frame alignment
pattern (as shown in Figure 12) meets the ITU-T Recommendation
G.706 4.1.2 and 4.2.
      Generally, it is performed by detecting a successive FAS/NFAS/
FAS sequence. If STEP 2 is not met, a new searching will start after the
following frame is skipped. If STEP 3 is not met, a new searching will
start immediately in the next frame. Once the Basic Frame alignment
pattern is detected in the received PCM data stream, the Basic Frame
synchronization is found and the OOFV bit will be set to ‘0’ for indication.

nization is declared with a ‘0’ in the OOCMFV bit only if at least two CRC
Multi-Frame alignment patterns are found within 8 ms, with the interval
time of each pattern being a multiple of 2 ms. Then if the received CRC
Multi-Frame alignment signal does not meet its pattern, it will be indi-
cated by the CMFERI bit.
      If the 2 CRC Multi-Frame alignment patterns can not be found
within 8ms with the interval time being a multiple of 2 ms, an offline
search for the Basic Frame alignment pattern will start which is indicated
in the OOOFV bit. The process is the same as shown in Figure 12. This
offline operation searches in parallel with the pre-found Basic Frame
synchronization searching process. After the new Basic Frame synchro-
nization is found by this offline search, the 8 ms timer is restarted to
check whether the two CRC Multi-Frame alignment patterns are found
within 8 ms, with the interval time of each pattern being a multiple of 2
ms again. If the condition can not be met, the procedure will go on until
the 400 ms timer ends. If the condition still can not be met at that time
and the Basic Frame is still synchronized, the device declares by the
C2NCIWV bit to run under the CRC to non-CRC interworking process. In

3.17.2.3        Receive Multiplexed Mode
      In the Receive Multiplexed mode, one multiplexed bus is used to
output the data from both two links. The data of Link 1 to Link 2 is byte-
interleaved output on the multiplexed bus. When the data from the two
links is output on one multiplexed bus, the sequence of the data is
arranged by setting the timeslot offset. The data from different links on
one multiplexed bus must be shifted at a different timeslot offset to avoid
data mixing.
      In the Receive Multiplexed mode, the timing signal on the MRSCK
pin and the framing pulse on the MRSFS pin are provided by the system
side and common to both two links. The signaling bits on the MRSIG pin
are per-timeslot aligned with the corresponding data on the MRSD pin.
      In the Receive Multiplexed mode, the data on the system interface
is clocked by the MRSCK. The active edge of the MRSCK used to sam-
ple the pulse on the MRSFS is determined by the FE bit. The active
edge of the MRSCK used to update the data on the MRSD and MRSIG
is determined by the DE bit. The FE bit and the DE bit of the two links
should be set to the same value respectively. If the FE bit and the DE bit
are not equal, the pulse on the MRSFS is ahead. The MRSCK can be
selected by the CMS bit to be the same rate as the data rate on the sys-
tem side (8.192 MHz) or double the data rate (16.384 MHz). The CMS
bit of the two links should be set to the same value. If the speed of the
MRSCK is double the data rate, there will be two active edges in one bit
duration. In this case, the EDGE bit determines the active edge to
update the data on the MRSD and MRSIG pins. The pulse on the
MRSFS pin is always sampled on its first active edge.
      In the Receive Multiplexed mode, the MRSFS asserts at a rate of
integer multiple of 125 µs to indicate the start of a frame. The active
polarity of the MRSFS is selected by the FSINV bit. The FSINV bit of the
two links should be set to the same value. If the pulse on the MRSFS pin
is not an integer multiple of 125 µs, this detection will be indicated by the

is always sampled on its first active edge.
      In the Transmit Multiplexed mode, the MTSFS can indicate the
Basic frame, CRC Multi-frame and/or Signaling Multi-frame of the first
link. The indications are selected by the FSTYP bit. The active polarity of
the MTSFS is selected by the FSINV bit. The FSTYP bit and the FSINV
bit of the two links should be set to the same value. If the pulse on the
MTSFS pin is not an integer multiple of 125 µs, this detection will be
indicated by the TCOFAI bit. If the TCOFAE bit is enabled, an interrupt
will be reported by the INT pin when the TCOFAI bit is ‘1’.
3.18.2.4        Offset
      Bit offset and timeslot offset are both supported in all the operating
modes. The offset is between the framing pulse on the TSFSn/MTSFS
pin and the start of the corresponding frame input on the TSDn/MTSD
pin. The signaling bits on the TSIGn/MTSIG pin are always per-timeslot
aligned with the data on the TSDn/MTSD pin.
      Refer to Chapter 3.18.1.4 Offset for the base line without offset in
different operating modes and the configuration of the offset.
      In Non-multiplexed mode, the timeslot offset can be configured
from 0 to 31 timeslots (0 & 31 are included). In Multiplexed mode, the
timeslot offset can be configured from 0 to 127 timeslots (0 & 127 are
included).

      The Yellow alarm signal will be manually inserted in the data
stream to be transmitted when the XYEL bit is set, or the Yellow alarm
signal will be inserted automatically by setting the AUTOYELLOW bit
when Red alarm is declared in the received data stream. The Yellow
alarm signal is logic 0 on the 2nd bit of each channel.
3.20.1.1.5         Interrupt Summary
      At the first bit of each basic frame, the BFI bit will be set. In this con-
dition, if the BFE bit is enabled, an interrupt will be reported by the INT
pin.
      At the first bit of each SF/ESF/T1 DM/SLC-96 multiframe, the MFI
bit will be set. In this condition, if the MFE bit is enabled, an interrupt will
be reported by the INT pin.

3.20.4         BIT-ORIENTED MESSAGE TRANSMITTER (T1/J1 ONLY)
       The Bit Oriented Message (BOM) can only be transmitted in the
ESF format in T1/J1 mode.
       The BOM pattern is ‘111111110XXXXXX0’ which occupies the DL of
the F-bit in the ESF format. The six ‘X’s represent the code that is pro-
grammed in the XBOC[5:0] bits. The BOM is transmitted only if the
XBOC[5:0] bits are not all ’One’s.
3.20.5         INBAND LOOPBACK CODE GENERATOR (T1/J1 ONLY)
       The Inband Loopback Code Generator can only transmit inband
loopback code in a framed or unframed T1/J1 data stream.
       The length and the content of the inband loopback code are pro-
grammed in the CL[1:0] bits and the IBC[7:0] bits respectively. The code
can only be transmitted when the IBCDEN bit is enabled. In framed
mode, which is configured by the IBCDUNFM bit, the bits in all 24 chan-
nels are overwritten with the inband loopback code and the F-bit is not
changed. In unframed mode, which is configured by the IBCDUNFM bit,
all the bits in 24 channels and the F-bit are overwritten with the inband
loopback code.

3.23        TRANSMIT JITTER ATTENUATOR
      The Transmit Jitter Attenuator of each link can be chosen to be
used or not. This selection is made by the TJA_E bit.                            Table 59: Related Bit / Register In Chapter 3.23
      The Jitter Attenuator consists of a FIFO and a DPLL, as shown in                 Bit                       Register                  Address (Hex)

data stored in the FIFO. The DPLL can only attenuate the incoming jitter
whose frequency is above Corner Frequency (CF). The jitter which fre-
quency is lower than the CF passes through the DPLL without any atten-
uation. In T1/J1 applications, the CF of the DPLL can be 5 Hz or 1.26
Hz, as selected by the TJA_BW bit. In E1 applications, the CF of the
DPLL can be 6.77 Hz or 0.87 Hz, as selected by the TJA_BW bit. The
lower the CF is, the longer time is needed to achieve synchronization.
      If the incoming data moves faster than the outgoing data, the FIFO
will overflow. If the incoming data moves slower than the outgoing data,
the FIFO will underflow. The overflow or underflow is captured by the
TJA_IS bit. When the TJA_IS bit is ‘1’, an interrupt will be reported on
the INT pin if enabled by the TJA_IE bit.
      To avoid overflowing or underflowing, the JA-Limit function can be
enabled by setting the TJA_LIMT bit. When the JA-Limit function is
enabled, the speed of the outgoing data will be adjusted automatically if
the FIFO is close to its full or emptiness. The criteria of speed adjust-
ment start are listed in Table 6. Though the LA-Limit function can reduce
the possibility of FIFO overflow and underflow, the quality of jitter attenu-
ation is deteriorated.
      Selected by the TJITT_TEST bit, the real time interval between the
read and write pointer of the FIFO or the peak-peak interval between the
read and write pointer of the FIFO can be indicated in the TJITT[6:0]
bits. When the TJITT_TEST bit is ‘0’, the current interval between the
read and write pointer of the FIFO will be written into the TJITT[6:0] bits.
When the TJITT_TEST bit is ‘1’, the current interval is compared with
the old one in the TJITT[6:0] bits and the larger one will be indicated by
the TJITT[6:0] bits.

by the SAMP[3:0] bits. The pulse amplitude of each phase is repre-
sented by a binary byte, within the range from +63 to -63, stored in the
WDAT[6:0] bits in signed magnitude form. The maximum number +63
(D) represents the positive maximum amplitude of the transmit pulse
while the most negative number -63 (D) represents the maximum nega-
tive amplitude of the transmit pulse. Thus, up to 64 bytes are used. For
each channel, a 64 bytes RAM is available.
      There are twelve standard templates which are stored in a local
ROM. One of them can be selected as reference and made some
changes to get the desired waveform.
      To do this, the first step is to choose a set of waveform value, which
is the most similar to the desired pulse shape, from the following 12
tables (Table 62 to Table 73), and set the SCAL[5:0] bits to the corre-
sponding standard value. Table 62 to Table 73 list the sample data and
the standard scaling value of each of the 12 templates.
      Modifying the corresponding sample data can get the desired
transmit pulse shape. By increasing or decreasing by ‘1’ from the stan-
dard value in the SCAL[5:0] bits, the pulse amplitude can be scaled up
or down at the percentage ratio against the standard pulse amplitude if
necessary. For different pulse shapes, the value of the SCAL[5:0] bits

3.25        LINE DRIVER
      The Line Driver can be set to High-Z for redundant application.
      The following ways will set the drivers to High-Z:
      1. Setting the THZ pin to high will globally set both the Line Drivers
to High-Z;
      2. When there is no clock input on the OSCI pin, both the Line Driv-
ers will be High-Z (no clock means this: the input on the OSCI pin is in
high/low level, or the duty cycle is less than 30% or larger than 70%);
      3. After software reset, hardware reset or power on, both the Line
Drivers will be High-Z;
      4. Setting the T_HZ bit to ‘1’ will set the corresponding Line Driver
to High-Z;
      5. In Transmit Clock Master mode, if the XTS bit is ‘1’, the source of
the transmit clock is from the recovered clock from the line side. When
the recovered clock from the line side is lost, the Line Driver in the corre-
sponding link will be High-Z;
      6. In Transmit Clock Slave mode, if the XTS bit is ‘0’, the source of
the transmit clock is from the backplane timing clock. When the back-
plane timing clock is lost (i.e., no transition for more than 72 T1/E1/J1
cycles), the Line Driver in the corresponding link will be High-Z. How-
ever, there is an exception in this case. That is, if the link is in Remote
Loopback mode, the Line Driver will not be High-Z.
      7. When the transmit path is power down, the Line Driver in the cor-
responding link will be High-Z.
      By these ways, the TTIPn and TRINGn pins will enter into high
impedance state immediately.
      Controlled by the DFM_ON bit, the output driver short-circuit pro-
tection can be enabled. The driver’s output current (peak to peak) is lim-
ited to 110 mA typically. When the output current exceeds the limitation,
the transmit driver failure will be captured by the DF_S bit. Selected by
the DF_IES bit, a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the DF_S bit or any transi-
tion from ‘0’ to ‘1’ or from ‘1’ to ‘0’ on the DF_S bit will set the DF_IS bit.
When the DF_IS bit is ‘1’, an interrupt on the INT pin will be reported if
enabled by the DF_IE bit.
                                                                                101                                     August 20, 2009

3.26       TRANSMITTER IMPEDANCE MATCHING
      In T1/J1 mode, the transmitter impedance matching can be real-
ized by using internal impedance matching circuit. 100 Ω, 110 Ω, 75 Ω
or 120 Ω internal impedance matching circuit can be selected by the
T_TERM[1:0] bits. The external impedance circuitry is not supported in
T1/J1 mode.
      In E1 mode, the transmitter impedance matching can be realized
by using internal impedance matching circuit or external impedance
matching circuit. When the T_TERM[2] bit is ‘0’, the internal impedance
matching circuit is enabled. 100 Ω, 110 Ω, 75 Ω or 120 Ω internal
impedance matching circuit can be selected by the T_TERM[1:0] bits.
When the T_TERM[2] bit is ‘1’, the internal impedance matching circuit
is disabled, and different external resistors should be used to realize dif-
ferent impedance matching.
      Figure 2 shows the appropriate components to connect with the
cable for one link. Table 75 lists the recommended impedance matching
values for the transmitter.

5.2       REGISTER DESCRIPTION
     Depending on the operating mode, the registers are configured for T1/J1 or E1. Before setting any other registers, the operating mode should be
selected in registers 020H and 120H.
     According to the access method, the registers can be divided into direct registers and indirect registers. In the direct registers, the registers can
be divided into global configuration registers and per-link configuration registers. The register with only one address following its name is the global
configuration register, and the register with a set of address (two addresses) following its name is the per-link configuration register.

       Default
      A write operation to this register will generate a software reset.
      The software reset can only be applied when the clock on the OSCI pin is available.
      The software reset will set all the registers except the T1/J1 Or E1 Mode register (020H,...) to their default values. If the setting is changed in the
T1/J1 Or E1 Mode register (020H,...), a software reset must be applied.

LAC:
      This bit selects the LOS criterion.
      = 0: The T1.231 is selected. In short haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than 800 mVpp for 175 consec-
utive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than
100 consecutive zeros in 128 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, T1/J1-029H,...)) for 175 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is
greater than (Q + 4 dB) and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than 100 consecutive zeros in 128 consecutive bit periods.
      = 1: The I.431 is selected. In short haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than 800 mVpp for 1544 consecu-
tive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than
100 consecutive zeros in 128 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, T1/J1-029H,...)) for 1544 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is

BPV_INS:
      A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit generates a single Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error to be inserted to the data stream to be transmitted.
      This bit must be cleared and set again for the next BPV error insertion.
EXZ_DEF:
      This bit selects the Excessive Zero (EXZ) Error criterion.
      = 0: The ANSI is selected. In AMI line code rule, the EXZ error is defined as more than 15 consecutive zeros in the data stream. In B8ZS line
code rule, the EXZ error is defined as more than 7 consecutive zeros in the data stream.

      These bits must be set to ‘01’ to enable the Excessive Zero (EXZ) Error event to be counted in an internal 16-bit EXZ counter.
CNT_MD:
      = 0: The Manual Report mode is selected. The internal 16-bit EXZ counter transfers its content to the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte regis-
ters when there is a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the CNT_TRF bit.
      = 1: The Auto Report mode is selected. The internal 16-bit EXZ counter transfers its content to the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers
every one second automatically.
CNT_TRF:
      This bit is valid when the CNT_MD bit is ‘0’.
      A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit updates the content in the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers with the value in the internal 16-bit
EXZ counter.
      This bit must be cleared and set again for the next updating.

BOFF[2:0]:
      These bits give a binary number to define the bit offset. The bit offset is between the framing pulse on the RSFSn/MRSFS pin and the start of the
corresponding frame output on the RSDn/MRSD pin. The signaling bits on the RSIGn/MRSIG pin are always per-channel aligned with the data on the
RSDn/MRSD pin.

DDSC:
      This bit selects the synchronization criteria of T1 DM format.
      = 0: If a correct DDS pattern is received before the first F-bit of a single correct Frame Alignment Pattern and there is no mimic pattern, the T1 DM
synchronization is acquired.
      = 1: If a single correct Frame Alignment Pattern is received, and twelve correct DDS patterns before each F-bit of the correct Frame Alignment
Pattern are all detected, and there is no mimic pattern, the T1 DM synchronization is acquired.
MIMICC:
      This bit selects the synchronization criteria in SF format and ESF format.
      In SF format:
      = 0: When two consecutive Frame Alignment Patterns are received error free in the data stream, the SF is synchronized. In this case, the exist-
ence of mimic patterns is ignored.
      = 1: When two consecutive Frame Alignment Patterns are received error free in the data stream without mimic pattern, the SF is synchronized.
      In ESF format:
      = 0: When a single correct Frame Alignment Pattern and a single correct CRC-6 are found in the same frame, the ESF is synchronized. In this
case, the existence of mimic patterns is ignored.
      = 1: When four consecutive Frame Alignment Patterns are detected error free in the received data stream without mimic pattern, the ESF is syn-
chronized.
M2O[2:1]:
      In SF format, these two bits define the threshold of the F Bit Error numbers in N-bit sliding F bits window. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out
of synchronization.
      In ESF format, these two bits define the threshold of the Frame Alignment Bit Error numbers in N-bit sliding Frame Alignment bits window.
Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.
      In T1 DM format, these two bits define the threshold of the 7-bit pattern error numbers in N-pattern sliding 7-bit patterns window. The 7-bit pattern
consists of the 6-bit DDS pattern and its following F-bit. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.
      In SLC-96 format, these two bits define the threshold of the Ft bit error numbers in N-bit sliding Ft bits window or the Fs bit error numbers in N-bit
sliding Fs bits in Frame (2n) (0<n<12 and n=36) window. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.

    The function of the above two sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
BITENn:
    = 0: The data is not extracted from the corresponding bit.
    = 1: The data is extracted from the corresponding bit of the assigned channel.
    These bits are invalid when the EVEN bit and the ODD bit are both logic 0.
    The BITEN[7] bit corresponds to the first bit (MSB) of the selected channel.

    The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
EOM:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit indicates an entire HDLC packet is stored in the FIFO and starts the packet transmission.
ABORT:
    = 0: Disable the manual abort sequence insertion.
    = 1: The abort sequence (‘01111111’) is manually inserted to the current HDLC packet.
    This bit is self-cleared after the abortion.
THDLCM:
    = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
    = 1: Reserved.
TRST:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Transmitter. The reset will clear the FIFO.

     The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
UDRUNI:
     When the FIFO is empty and the last transmitted byte is not the end of the current HDLC packet, the under-run occurs. This bit indicates whether
the under-run occurs.
     = 0: No under-run occurs.
     = 1: Under-run occurs.
     This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.
RDYI:
     = 0: There is no status change on the RDY bit (b0, T1/J1-0B0H,... / 0B1H,... / 0B2H,...).
     = 1: There is a transition (from ‘0’ to ‘1’) on the RDY bit (b0, T1/J1-0B0H,... / 0B1H,... / 0B2H,...).
     This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.

5.2.1.2         Indirect Register
PMON:
     The PMON Counter Mapping Registers (00H ~ 0BH) of a link are updated as a group in the following three ways:
     1. A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the UPDAT bit (b1, T1/J1-0C2H,...) updates all the registers;
     2. If the AUTOUPD bit (b0, T1/J1-0C2H,...) is set to ‘1’, the registers will be updated every one second;

SCAL[5:0]:
     The following setting lists the standard value of normal amplitude in different operating modes. Each step change (one increasing or decreasing
from the standard value) will scale the amplitude of the D/A output by a certain offset. These bits are only effective when user programmable arbitrary
waveform is used.
     = 100001: Normal amplitude in E1 - 75 Ω & 120 Ω operating modes. Each step change scales about 3% offset.

RJA_LIMT:
      When the read and write pointer of the FIFO are within 2/3/4 bits (corresponding to the FIFO depth) of overflowing or underflowing, the bandwidth
of the JA can be widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. This bit selects whether the bandwidth is normal or wid-
ened.
      = 0: Normal bandwidth is selected.
      = 1: Widen bandwidth is selected. In this case, the JA will not attenuate the input jitter until the read/write pointer’s position is outside the 2/3/4
bits window.

      = 0: Disable the Receive Jitter Attenuator.
      = 1: Enable the Receive Jitter Attenuator.
RJA_DP[1:0]:
      These two bits select the Jitter Attenuation Depth.

LAC:
      This bit selects the LOS criteria.
      = 0: The G.775 is selected. In short haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than 800 mVpp for 32 consecu-
tive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than
16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, E1-029H,...)) for 32 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater
than (Q + 4 dB) and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods.
      = 1: The I.431/ETSI is selected. In short haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than 800 mVpp for 2048 con-
secutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less
than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, E1-029H,...)) for 2048 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater

BPV_INS:
     A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit generates a single Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error to be inserted to the data stream to be transmitted.
     This bit must be cleared and set again for the next BPV error insertion.
EXZ_DEF:
     This bit selects the Excessive Zero (EXZ) Error criteria.

ters when there is a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the CNT_TRF bit.
     = 1: The Auto Report mode is selected. The internal 16-bit EXZ counter transfers its content to the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers
every one second automatically.
CNT_TRF:
     This bit is valid when the CNT_MD bit is ‘0’.
     A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit updates the content in the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers with the value in the internal 16-bit
EXZ counter.
     This bit must be cleared and set again for the next updating.

TSOFF[6:0]:
      These bits give a binary number to define the timeslot offset. The timeslot offset is between the framing pulse on the TSFSn/MTSFS pin and the
start of the corresponding frame input on the TSDn/MTSD pin. The signaling bits on the TSIGn/MTSIG pin are always per-timeslot aligned with the
data on the TSDn/MTSD pin.
      In Non-multiplexed mode, the timeslot offset can be configured from 0 to 31 timeslots (0 & 31 are included). In Multiplexed mode, the timeslot off-

CRCM, SIGEN, GENCRC:
     These bits are valid when the FDIS bit (b0, E1-062H,...) is 0. They control what kind of frame is generated:
     SIGEN =1: signaling multiframe enable
     GENCRC=1: CRC multiframe enable
     CRCM=1: Modified CRC multiframe. This bit is only valid when GENCRC=1.
FDIS:
     = 0: Enable the generation of the Basic frame, CRC Multi-Frame and Channel Associated Signaling (CAS) Multi-Frame.
     = 1: Disable the generation of the Basic frame, CRC Multi-Frame and Channel Associated Signaling (CAS) Multi-Frame.

    The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
EMP:
    = 0: All valid HDLC blocks are pushed into the FIFO.
    = 1: The FIFO is empty, i.e., all the blocks are read from the FIFO.
    The corresponding HDLC Receiver reset will clear this bit.
PACK:
    = 0: The byte read from the FIFO is not an overhead byte.
    = 1: The byte read from the FIFO is an overhead byte.
    The corresponding HDLC Receiver reset will clear this bit.

     The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
HA[7:0]:
     In HDLC mode, when high byte address comparison or both bytes address comparison is required, the high byte address position (the byte fol-
lowing the opening flag) is compared with the value in these bits, or with ‘0xFC’ or ‘0xFE’. The HA[1] bit (the ‘C/R’ bit position) is excluded to compare.

    The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
EOM:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit indicates an entire HDLC packet is stored in the FIFO and starts the packet transmission.
ABORT:
    = 0: Disable the manual abort sequence insertion.
    = 1: The abort sequence (‘01111111’) is manually inserted to the current HDLC packet.
    This bit is self-cleared after the abortion.
THDLCM:
    = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
    = 1: Reserved.
TRST:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Transmitter. The reset will clear the FIFO.

5.2.2.2         Indirect Register
PMON:
     The PMON Counter Mapping Registers (00H ~ 0FH) of a link are updated as a group in the following three ways:
     1. A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the UPDAT bit (b1, E1-0C2H,...) updates all the registers;
     2. If the AUTOUPD bit (b0, E1-0C2H,...) is set to ‘1’, the registers will be updated every one second;

   000        EXTEST      The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the EXTEST instruction,
                          the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be sampled by loading the boundary scan
                          register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR
                          state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading patterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using
                          the Update-DR state.

                          of another boundary-scan test operation.
   001        IDCODE      The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device’s identification code can then
                          be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.
   111        BYPASS      The BYPASS instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used to bypass the
                          device.
   011         CLAMP      This instruction allows the state of the signals driven from device pins to be determined from the boundary-scan register while the bypass
                          register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO. The signals driven from the device pins will not change while the CLAMP
                          instruction is selected.
   010         HIGHZ      Use of the HIGHZ instruction places the device in a state in which all of its system logic outputs are placed in an inactive drive state (e.g.,
                          high impedance). In this state, and in-circuit test system may drive signals onto the connections normally driven by a device output without
                          incurring the risk of damage to the device.

    State                                                                                Description
  Test Logic In this state, the test logic is disabled to continue normal operation of the device. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register with the
    Reset IDCODE instruction.
             Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held high for at least 5 rising
             edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high.
  Run-Test/ This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The instruction reg-
     Idle    ister and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Select-DR
             state.
 Select-DR- This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its
    Scan     previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR state and a scan
             sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Select-IR-Scan
             state.
   Capture- In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction does not
     DR      change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising
             edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
   Shift-DR In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward its serial
             output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to
             TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
  Exit1-DR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Pause-DR The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI and TDO.
             For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test sequence. The test data reg-
             ister selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this
             state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-DR state.
  Exit2-DR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
 Update-DR The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST and SAM-
             PLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched into the parallel output
             of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output changes only in this state. All shift-reg-
             ister stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Select-IR- This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising
    Scan     edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction register is initiated. If
             TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction does not change during this
             state.
 Capture-IR In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of '100' on the rising edge of TCK. This supports fault-iso-
             lation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruction does not change dur-
             ing this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or the
             Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
   Shift-IR In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its serial output
             on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change dur-
             ing this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or
             remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
   Exit1-IR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.

  Pause-IR The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected by the cur-
           rent instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low.
           When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
  Exit2-IR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR state, which
           terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state. The test data register
           selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
 Update-IR The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. When the new
           instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction retain their previous value.

7.4       DIGITAL I/O TIMING CHARACTERISTICS
     The capacitive loading for timing measurement is:
     100 pF for BUS: D[7:0],
     50 pF for other pins.
     The timing can be applied to both clock edges as defined by active clock edge selection.
     Delays are measured according to the cross of 50% of the rising/falling edge.
     The duty cycle for TSCKn/MTSCK & RSCKn/MRSCK is from 40% to 60%.
