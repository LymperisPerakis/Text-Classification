CAUTION: Stresses above those listed in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress only rating and operation of the
device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational sections of this specification is not implied.
NOTES:
 1. Absolute maximum ratings are limiting values, applied individually, beyond which the serviceability of the circuit may be impaired.
     Functional operability under any of these conditions is not necessarily implied.
 2. JA is measured with the component mounted on an evaluation PC board in free air.

       1      TIP    An analog input connected to the TIP (more positive) side of the subscriber loop through a 150 feed resistor and a
                     ring relay contact. Functions with the Ring terminal to receive voice signals from the telephone and for loop
                     monitoring purposes.
       2     RING    An analog input connected to the RING (more negative) side of the subscriber loop through a 150 feed resistor and
                     a ring relay contact. Functions with the Tip terminal to receive voice signals from the telephone and for loop
                     monitoring purposes.
       3      RFS    Senses ring side of loop for ground key and ring trip detection. During ringing, the ring signal is inserted into the line
                     at this node and RF is isolated from RFS via a relay.
       4      VB+    Positive Voltage Source - Most positive supply. VB+ is typically 12V or 5V.
       5       C3    Capacitor #3 - An external capacitor to be connected between this terminal and analog ground. Required for proper
                     operation of the loop current limiting function, and for filtering VB-. Typical value is 0.3F, 30V.
       6      DG     Digital Ground - To be connected to zero potential and serves as a reference for all digital inputs and outputs on the
            (Note 5) SLIC microcircuit.
       7       RS    Ring Synchronization Input - A TTL-compatible clock input. The clock should be arranged such that a positive pulse
                     transition occurs on the zero crossing of the ring voltage source, as it appears at the RFS terminal. For Tip side
                     injected systems, the RS pulse should occur on the negative going zero crossing and for Ring injected systems, on
                     the positive going zero crossing. This ensures that the ring relay activates and deactivates when the instantaneous
                     ring voltage is near zero. If synchronization is not required, the pin should be tied to 5V.
       8      RD     Relay Driver - A low active open collector logic output. When enabled, the external ring relay is energized.
       9       TF    Tip Feed - A low impedance analog output connected to the TIP terminal through a 150 feed resistor. Functions
                     with the RF terminal to provide loop current, feed voice signals to the telephone set, and sink longitudinal current.
      10       RF    Ring Feed - A low impedance analog output connected to the RING terminal through a 150 feed resistor. Functions
                     with the TF terminal to provide loop current, feed voice signals to the telephone set, and sink longitudinal current.
      11      VB-    Negative Voltage Source - Most negative supply. VB- is typically -48V with an operational range of -42V to -58V.
                     Frequently referred to as “battery”.
      12      BG     Battery Ground - To be connected to zero potential. All loop current and some quiescent current flows into this ground
            (Note 5) terminal.
      13      SHD    Switch Hook Detection - A low active LS TTL - compatible logic output. This output is enabled for loop currents
                     exceeding 10mA and disabled for loop currents less than 5mA.
      14      GKD    Ground Key Detection - A low active LS TTL - compatible logic output. This output is enabled if the DC current into
                     the ring lead exceeds the DC current out of the tip lead by more than 20mA, and disabled if this current difference is
                     less than 10mA.
      15       PD    Power Denial - A low active TTL - Compatible logic input. When enabled, the switch hook detect (SHD) and ground
                     key detect (GKD) are not necessarily valid, and the relay driver (RD) output is disabled.
      16      RC     Ring Command - A low active TTL - Compatible logic input. When enabled, the relay driver (RD) output goes low on
                     the next high level of the ring sync (RS) input, as long as the SLIC is not in the power denial state (PD = 0) or the
                     subscriber is not already off- hook (SHD = 0).
      17       C2    Capacitor #2 - An external capacitor to be connected between this terminal and digital ground. Prevents false ground
                     key indications from occurring during ring trip detection. Typical value is 0.15F, 10V. This capacitor is not used if
                     ground key function is not required and (Pin 17) may be left open or connected to digital ground.
      18      OUT    The analog output of the spare operational amplifier. The output voltage swing is typically 5V.
      19       -IN   The inverting analog input of the spare operational amplifier.
      20      +IN    The non-inverting analog input of the spare operational amplifier.
      21       RX    Receive Input, 4-Wire Side - A high impedance analog input which is internally biased. Capacitive coupling to this
                     input is required. AC signals appearing at this input differentially drive the Tip feed and Ring feed terminals, which in
                     turn drive tip and ring through 300 of feed resistance on each side of the line.
      22       C4    Capacitor #4 - An external capacitor to be connected between this terminal and analog ground. This capacitor
                     prevents false ground key indication and false ring trip detection from occurring when longitudinal currents are
                     induced onto the subscriber loop from near by power lines and other noise sources. This capacitor is also required
                     for the proper operation of ring trip detection. Typical value is 0.5F, to 1.0F, 20V. This capacitor should be
                     nonpolarized.

         23              AG         Analog Ground - To be connected to zero potential and serves as a reference for the transmit output (TX) and receive
                      (Note 5)      input (RX) terminals.
         24              TX         Transmit Output, 4-Wire Side - A low impedance analog output which represents the differential voltage across Tip
                                    and Ring. Transhybrid balancing must be performed (using the SLIC microcircuit’s spare op amp) beyond this output
                                    to completely implement two to four wire conversion. This output is unbalanced and referenced to analog ground.
                                    Since the DC level of this output varies with loop current, capacitive coupling to the next stage is essential.
                         NC         No internal connection.

NOTES:
 5. Secondary protection diode bridge recommended is a 2A, 200V type.
 6. To obtain the specified transhybrid loss it is necessary for the three legs of the balance network, C6-R1 and R2 and C7-ZB-R3 , to match in
    impedance to within 0.3%. Thus, if C6 and C7 are 1F each, a 20% match is adequate. It should be noted that the transmit output to C6 sees
    a -22V step when the loop is closed. Too large a value for C6 may produce an excessively long transient at the op amp output to the PCM
    Filter/CODEC.
    A 0.5F and 100k gives a time constant of 50ms. The uncommitted op amp output is internally clamped to stay within 6.6V and is current
    limited.
 7. All grounds (AG, BG, and DG) must be applied before VB+ or VB-. Failure to do so may result in premature failure of the part. If a user wishes
    to run separate grounds off a line card, the AG must be applied first.
 8. Application shows Ring Injected Ringing, Balanced or Tip injected configuration may be used.
 9. Pin numbers given for SOIC package.
