TRANSMIT INTERFACE
   PIN #     NAME         TYPE                                     DESCRIPTION
    29      TTIP_0         O       Transmit TTIP Output - Channel (n):
    10      TTIP_1                 The XRT73L03B uses this pin along with TRing_(n) to transmit a bipolar
    20      TTIP_2                 line signal via a 1:1 transformer.
    27      TRing_0        O       Transmit Ring Output - Channel (n):
    12      TRing_1                The XRT73L03B uses this pin along with TTIP_(n) to transmit a bipolar
    18      TRing_2                line signal via a 1:1 transformer.
    34      TxClk_0         I      Transmit Clock Input for TPData and TNData - Channel (n):
     3      TxClk_1                This input pin must be driven at 34.368 MHz for E3 applications, 44.736
    25      TxClk_2                MHz for DS3 applications, or 51.84 MHz for SONET STS-1 applications.
                                   The XRT73L03B uses this signal to sample the TPData_(n) and
                                   TNData_(n) input pins. By default, the XRT73L03B is configured to
                                   sample these two pins on the falling edge of this signal.
                                   NOTE: If the XRT73L03B is operating in the HOST Mode, then the
                                   device can be configured to sample the TPData_(n) and TNData_(n)
                                   input pins on either the rising or falling edge of TxClk_(n).
    33     TPData_0         I      Transmit Positive Data Input - Channel (n):
     2     TPData_1                The XRT73L03B samples this pin on the falling edge of TxClk_(n). If the
    24     TPData_2                device samples a "1", then it generates and transmits a positive polarity
                                   pulse to the line.
                                   The data should be applied to this input pin if the Transmit Section is
                                   configured to accept Single-Rail data from the Terminal Equipment.
                                   NOTE: If the XRT73L03B is operating in the HOST Mode, then the
                                   XRT73L03B can be configured to sample the TPData_(n) pin on either
                                   the rising or falling edge of TxClk_(n).
    32     TNData_0         I      Transmit Negative Data Input - Channel (n):
     1     TNData_1                The XRT73L03B samples this pin on the falling edge of TxClk_(n). If the
    23     TNData_2                device samples a "1", then it generates and transmits a negative polarity
                                   pulse to the line.
                                   In Single-Rail Mode, this pin must be tied to GND to enable the HDB3/
                                   B3ZS Encoder and Decoder, (internally pulled-down).
                                   In Dual-Rail Mode this input is the N-Rail Data input.
                                   NOTE: If the XRT73L03B is operating in the HOST Mode, then the
                                   XRT73L03B can be configured to sample the TNData_(n) pin on either
                                   the rising or falling edge of TxClk_(n).

TRANSMIT INTERFACE
  PIN #      NAME  TYPE                                  DESCRIPTION
    35     TxLEV_0   I  Transmit Line Build-Out Enable/Disable Select - Channel (n):
     8     TxLEV_1      This input pin permits the Transmit Line Build-Out circuit within Channel
     9     TxLEV_2      (n) to be enabled or disabled. In E3 mode, this pin has no effect on the
                        transmit pulse shape.
                        Setting this pin to "High" disables the Line Build-Out circuit. In this
                        mode, Channel (n) outputs partially-shaped pulses onto the line via the
                        TTIP_(n) and TRing_(n) output pins.
                        Setting this pin to "Low" enables the Line Build-Out circuit within Chan-
                        nel (n). In this mode, Channel (n) outputs shaped pulses onto the line
                        via the TTIP_(n) and TRing_(n) output pins.
                        To comply with the Isolated DSX-3/STSX-1 Pulse Template Require-
                        ments per Bellcore GR-499-CORE or Bellcore GR-253-CORE:
                            a. Set this input pin to "1" if the cable length between the Cross-
                                Connect and the transmit output of Channel (n) is greater than
                                225 feet.
                            b. Set this input pin to "0" if the cable length between the Cross-
                                Connect and the transmit output of Channel (n) is less than 225
                                feet.
                        This pin is active only if the following two conditions are true:
                            a. The XRT73L03B is configured to operate in either the DS3 or
                                SONET STS-1 Modes.
                            b. The XRT73L03B is configured to operate in the Hardware Mode.
                        NOTE: This pin to should be tied to GND if the XRT73L03B is going to be
                        operating in the HOST Mode, (internally pulled-down).
   117     TxOFF_0   I  Transmitter OFF Input - Channel (n):
   116     TxOFF_1      Setting this input pin "High" turns off all of the Transmitter Sections. In
   115     TxOFF_2      this mode the TTIP and TRing outputs are tri-stated.
                        NOTES:
                              1. This input pin controls the TTIP and TRing outputs even when
                                  the XRT73L03B is operating in the HOST Mode.
                              2. For HOST Mode Operation, this pin is tied to GND if the Trans-
                                  mitter is intended to be turned off via the Microprocessor Serial
                                  Interface.

   PIN #      NAME        TYPE                                   DESCRIPTION
     49      RxClk_0        O     Receive Clock Output - Channel (n):
    111      RxClk_1              This output pin is the Recovered Clock signal from the incoming line sig-
     43      RxClk_2              nal for Channel (n). The Receive Section of Channel (n) outputs data via
                                  the RPOS_(n) and RNEG_(n) output pins on the rising edge of this clock
                                  signal.
                                  Configure the Receive Section of Channel (n) to update the data on the
                                  RPOS_(n) and RNEG_(n) output pins on the falling edge of RxClk_(n)
                                  by doing one of the following:
                                   a. Operating in the Hardware Mode
                                  Pull the RxClkINV pin to "High".
                                   b. Operating in the HOST Mode
                                  Write a "1" into the RxClkINV bit-field within the Command Register.
     50     RNEG_0          O     Receive Negative Data Output - Channel (n):
    110     RNEG_1                This output pin pulses "High" whenever Channel (n) of the XRT73L03B

                             The frequency of this "1’s" pattern is determined by TxClk_(n).
                             This input pin is ignored if the XRT73L03B is operating in the HOST

                             The criteria that the XRT73L03B uses to declare an LOS Condition
                             depends upon whether the device is operating in the E3 or STS-1/DS3

   60      RLOL_2            Condition. Channel (n) declares an LOL (Loss of Lock) Condition if the

                             Setting this pin "Low" causes all digital and analog outputs to go into a
                             high-impedance state to allow for in-circuit testing. This pin should be

                             This pin is only applicable during DS3 or STS-1 operations.

                            This pin’s functionality depends on whether the XRT73L03B is operating

                            The Local Microprocessor must assert this pin (set it to "0") in order to

                            Setting this input pin "High" disables the B3ZS/HDB3 Encoder &
                            Decoder blocks in the XRT73L03B and configures it to transmit and

                            Setting this input pin "Low" enables the B3ZS/HDB3 Encoder & Decoder
                            blocks and configures it to ransmit and receive the line signal in the

                            operation.
                            NOTE: If the XRT73L03B is operating in the Hardware Mode, this pin
                            setting configures the B3ZS/HDB3 Encoder and Decoder Blocks for all
