L9613                                                                          Functional description
3     Functional description
      The L9613 is a monolithic bus driver designed to provide bidirectional serial communication
      in automotive applications.
      The device provides a bidirectional link, called K, to the VBat related diagnosis bus. It also
      includes a separate comparator L which is also able to be linked to the VBat bus. The input
      TX and output RX of K are related to VCC with her integrated pull up resistances. Also the L
      comparator output LO has a pull up resistance connected to VCC.
      All VBat bus defined inputs LI and K have supply voltage dependent thresholds together with
      sufficient hysteresis to suppress line spikes. These pins are protected against over voltages,
      shorts to GND and VS and can also be driven beyond VS and GND. These features are also
      given for TX, RX and LI only taking into account the behavior of the internal pull up
      resistances. The thermal shut down function switches OFF the K output if the chip
      temperature increases above the thermal shut down threshold. To reactivate K again the
      chip temperature must decrease below the K switch ON temp. To achieve no fault for VS
      intervillage conditions the outputs will be switched OFF and stay at high impedance. The
      device is also protected against reverse battery condition. During lack of VS or GND all pins
      shows high impedance characteristic. To realize a lack of the VS related bus line LI and K
      the outputs LO and RX shows defined ON status. Suppressing all 4 classes of "Schaffner"
      signals (Schaffner 1; 2; 3a,b; 4) all pins can be load with short energy pulses of max.
      0.2mJ. All these features together with a high possible baud rate >130Kbaud, controlled
      output slopes for low EMI, a wide power supply voltage range and a real standby function
      with zero power consumption ISSB typ 1µA during system de powering VCC  0.5V make
      this device high efficient for automotive bus system.
      After wake up of the system from SB condition the first output signal will have an additional
      delay time tdtyp 5µs.
      The typical output voltage behavior for the K, LO, RX outputs as a function of the output
      current is shown in Figure 4. Figure 5 shows a waveform of the output signal when the low
      level changes from RON IOUT to IOUT 2 RON + UBE state. This variation occurs due to too low
      output current or after a negative transient forced to the output or to the supply voltage line.

3.1         ESD application hints
            To improve the ESD robustness of this device above specified ±2 kV/HBM external blocking
            capacitors must be used. Nevertheless the max. energy which can be clamped by this
            device should not exceeds 0.2mJ for each pin. An equivalent input diagram for calculation
            can be seen in Figure 11.
