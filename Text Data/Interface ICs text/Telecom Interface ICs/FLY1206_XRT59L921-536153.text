XRT59L921
Twenty-One Channel E1 Line Interface Unit
Ideal for Cost-Sensitive Transport Applications Including
Multi-service Provisioning Platforms and Routers
T      he XRT59L921 is an optimized twenty-one channel, E1, line
       interface unit, fabricated using low power CMOS
technology. The device contains twenty-one independent E1
channels. It is primarily targeted towards the SDH multiplexers that
accommodate TU12 Tributary Unit Frames. Line cards in these
units multiplex 21 E1 channels into higher SDH rates. Devices with
21 E1 interfaces such as the XRT59L921 provide the most efficient
method of implementing 63-channel line cards. Each channel
performs the driver and receiver functions necessary to convert
