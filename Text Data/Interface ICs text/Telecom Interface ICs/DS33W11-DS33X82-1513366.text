1.       Detailed Description
The DS33X162 family of devices provide interconnection and mapping functionality between Ethernet Systems and
WAN Time-Division Multiplexed (TDM) systems such as T1/E1/J1, HDSL, T3/E3, and SONET/SDH. The device is
composed of up to two 10/100/1000 Ethernet MACs, up to 16 Serial Ports, a Arbiter, GFP-F /HDLC/cHDLC/X.86
(LAPS) Mappers, a DDR SDRAM interface, and control ports. Ethernet traffic is encapsulated with GFP-F, HDLC,
cHDLC, or X.86 (LAPS) to be transmitted over the WAN Serial Interfaces. The WAN Serial Interfaces also receive
encapsulated Ethernet frames and transmit the extracted frames over the Ethernet ports. The LAN frame interface
consists of Ethernet interfaces using one of two physical layer protocols. It can be configured with up to two
10/100Mbps MII/RMII ports or a single GbE GMII port. The WAN Serial Interface can be configured for up to eight
serial data streams at up to 52Mbps each, or 16 serial data streams at up to 2.5Mbps each. The Serial Interfaces
can be seamlessly connected to the Maxim T1/E1/J1 Framers, Line Interface Units (LIUs), and Single-Chip
Transceivers (SCTs). The WAN interfaces can also be seamlessly connected to the Maxim T3/E3/STS-1 Framers,
LIUs, and SCTs to provide T3, E3, or STS1 connectivity.
Microprocessor control can be accomplished through a 8-bit Micro controller port or SPI Bus. The device has a
125MHz DDR SDRAM controller and interfaces to a 32-bit wide 256Mb DDR SDRAM via a 16-bit data bus. The
DDR SDRAM is used to buffer data from the Ethernet and WAN ports for transport.
The power supplies consist of a 1.8V core supply, a 2.5V DDR SDRAM supply, and 3.3V I/O supply. The DDR
interface also requires a 1.25V reference voltage that can be obtained through a resistor-divider network.

5.        Designing with the DS33X162 Family of Devices
The DS33X162 family of products provide the required flexibility and complexity to meet the needs of a very broad
range of applications. Although typical applications using these devices are very complex and each application has
a unique set of needs, most application developments follow a predictable set of steps:
     1. Identification of Application Requirements
     2. Device Selection
     3. Ancillary Device Identification
     4. Circuit Design
     5. Board Layout
     6. Software Development
     7. Production
5.1       Identification of Application Requirements
The designer of an application using one of the devices in the DS33X162 product line should begin by answering
several high-level questions.
The solutions to these questions, in conjunction with referencing Table 1-1, will lead to a proper device selection:
          How many and what type of TDM links are needed?
          How does data need to move between the various interfaces of the mapping device?
          What traffic prioritization methodologies will be needed?
          How many Ethernet ports are needed?
          Is direct multiplexing of PCM encoded voice traffic a requirement.
5.2       Device Selection
The answer to “How many and what type of TDM links are needed?” will normally narrow the selection to devices
that contain at least that many ports. For example, if 16 E1 links are required, the applicable solutions are the
DS33X161 and DS33X162. If 4 DS-3 links are required, the applicable solutions are the DS33X41, DS33X42,
DS33X81, DS33X82, DS33X161, and DS33X162.
The answer to “How does data need to move between the various interfaces of the mapping device?” will usually
further narrow the selection. The path any given frame takes through the device can be determined by the contents
of the frame, the port of entry, the user configured WAN Connections, and the user configured Forwarding Mode.
Note that all devices in the product family allow insertion and extraction of frames for inspection, (including ITU-T
Y.1731 OAM frames) by the host microprocessor, based on a number of conditions outlined in Section 8.17
If traffic flow is to be governed by VLAN tag information, the choices are narrowed to only those devices that
support VLAN forwarding: DS33X42, DS33X82, and DS33X162. If ingress traffic is to be segregated by VLAN ID or
DSCP Priority into separate WAN flows, the available number of WAN Groups in Table 1-1 should be considered.
Several Forwarding Modes govern the flow of frames through the device. See Table 8-4 in Section 8.9 for more
information.

5.3      Ancillary Device Selection
All devices in the product family require an external DDR SDRAM for operation. The user must select a JEDEC
JESD79D compliant DDR SDRAM. DDR 266 or faster may be used. The recommended size is 256 Mbit (4 Meg x
16 x 4 banks), although it is possible to use other sizes (see Section 5.4). P2P operation is supported, and 0-ohm
series termination is possible with proper PCB layout.
All devices in the product family require an external microprocessor for configuration and status monitoring.
Because the DS33X162 family of devices are designed to require only a minimal amount of processor support, an
inexpensive microcontroller can normally be used. In applications which make extensive use of the support for
higher-layer protocols may require additional protocol processing capability, microprocessor selection can normally
be determined by evaluating the management frame processing requirements of the particular application. All
devices in the product family are designed to support both polled and interrupt-driven environments.
Microprocessor control is possible through the 8-bit parallel control port or SPI Slave port. More information on
microprocessor control is available in Section 8.1. Note that the parallel bus is not available in the 144 pin
DS33X11, and the SPI Slave port must be used for processor control.
Depending on the application, external PDH framers and LIUs may be required. Maxim offers a broad range of
framers, LIUs, and single-chip transceivers compatible with the DS33X162 family of products.
The Ethernet interface will normally be connected to an external Ethernet PHY or Ethernet switch device. Many
commercially-available products are available and will seamlessly interface with the device’s MII, RMII, or GMII
options.
Several external clock sources are required for proper operation. See Section 8.3 for more information.
5.4      Circuit Design
Note that all devices except the DS33X11, DS33W11, and DS33W41 share a common footprint. This is intended to
make it very easy to design a circuit that easily scales from 4 to 16 WAN ports with alternate assembly BOMs.
When designing a PCB for 4 or 8 ports, care should be taken to tie the unused input pins for serial ports 5-16 or 9-
16 to ground. This will allow for use of the higher density device for prototype purposes. Care should be taken that
outputs from the DS33X162 family device that are present in the high-port count option but not in the low port-count
option may potentially leave inputs on other devices floating, and should be pulled appropriately to a known
voltage.
The device’s DDR SDRAM interface is designed to use a JESD79D 256 Mbit (4 Meg x 16 x 4 bank) DDR SDRAM
with a 16 bit data bus. If a larger DDR SDRAM must be used, the lowest 13 address lines (A0-A12) should be
used, and care should be taken to ground any unused address inputs on the DDR SDRAM. Note that in such a
case, only 256 Mbits are addressable by the device. If a smaller JESD79D DDR SDRAM is to be used (such as the
128 Mbit MT46V8M16), the unused address outputs should be left unconnected, and care should be taken in
software to keep the starting and ending addresses of each queue within the same memory bank. In all cases, P2P
operation is supported, and 0Ω series termination is possible with proper PCB layout.
5.5      Board Layout
The DDR SDRAM interface has particularly stringent layout requirements. Traces should have matched
impedances, be of equal length, and should not have stubs. Refer to the DDR SDRAM’s data sheet for more
information. Supply decoupling should be placed as close to the device as possible.
5.6      Software Development
All devices in the product family have a common register set. An example initialization sequence is shown in
Section 8.5. Software drivers and demonstration kit software are both available from Maxim. Go to
www.maxim-ic.com/support for the latest information.

                                        allowing multiplexing of the parallel interface address and data lines.
                                        When ALE is high, the values of the A[10:0] pins are used for read/write
      ALE         J7      —        I    operations. On the falling edge of ALE, the values of the A[10:0] pins are
                                        latched internally, and the latched value is used for read/write operations
                                        until the next rising edge of ALE. ALE should be tied high for non-

                                        for 10Mbps operation. In DTE mode, this is a clock input provided by the
                                        PHY. Note that TX_CLK2 is only available on devices with two Ethernet
                                        ports. Sourced from REF_CLK Input.

                                        Collision Detect 1, 2 (MII). Asserted by the Ethernet PHY to indicate that
                                        a collision is occurring. In DCE Mode this signal should be connected to
     COL1,       E14,                   ground. This signal is only valid in half duplex mode, and is ignored in full

                                        DCE or DTE Selection (MII). Setting this pin high places all Ethernet
                                        ports in DCE Mode. Setting this pin low places the Ethernet ports in DTE
                                        Mode.
                                        In DCE Mode, the MII interface can be directly connected to another
   DCEDTES       P13      L7      I
                                        MAC. In DCE Mode, the Transmit clock (TX_CLK) and Receive clock
                                        (RX_CLK) are outputs.
                                        Note that there is no software bit selection of DCEDTES. Note that DCE
                                        operation is only valid for 10/100, MII mode.
                                        RMII Selection Input. Set this pin to 1 for RMII operation. In devices with
   RMII_SEL      M14      K7      I     2 Ethernet ports, both ports will operate in RMII mode. REF_CLK must be
                                        50MHz. Set this pin to 0 for GMII or MII operation.

Note: Shaded pins do not apply to all devices in the product family. See the pin listing for specific pin availability. In the high port
count devices, the shaded input pins DO NOT HAVE PULLUP/PUL-DOWN resistors. Consideration must be taken during board
design to bias the inputs appropriately, and to float output pins (TDATA5-TDATA16, TX_EN2, TX_ERR2) if lower port count
designs are to be potentially stuffed with higher port count devices.

8.       Functional Description
The DS33X162 family of devices provide interconnection and mapping functionality between Ethernet Systems and
WAN Time-Division Multiplexed (TDM) systems such as T1/E1/J1, HDSL, T3/E3, and SONET/SDH. The device is
composed of up to two 10/100/1000 Ethernet MACs, up to 16 Serial Ports, a Arbiter, GFP/HDLC/cHDLC/X.86
(LAPS) Mappers, a DDR SDRAM interface, and control ports.
Ethernet traffic is encapsulated with GFP-F, HDLC, cHDLC, or X.86 (LAPS) to be transmitted over the WAN Serial
Interfaces. The WAN Serial Interfaces also receive encapsulated Ethernet frames and transmit the extracted
frames over the Ethernet ports.
 The LAN interface consists of Ethernet MACs using one of two physical layer protocols. The interface can be
configured with up to two 10/100Mbps MII/RMII ports or a single GbE GMII port. The MII/RMII and GMII interfaces
allow connection to commercially available Ethernet PHY and MAC devices.
The WAN physical interface supports 8 serial data streams up to 52Mbps each. The DS33X162 and DS33X161
support an additional 8 serial data streams with data rates up to 2.5Mbps each. The WAN serial interfaces receive
encapsulated Ethernet frames and transmit the extracted frames over the Ethernet ports. The WAN serial ports can
operate with a gapped clock, and can be connected to a framer, electrical LIU, optical transceiver, or T/E-Carrier
transceiver for transmission to the WAN. The Serial Interfaces can be seamlessly connected to the Maxim
T1/E1/J1 Framers, Line Interface Units (LIUs), and Single-Chip Transceivers (SCTs). The WAN interfaces can also
be seamlessly connected to the Maxim T3/E3/STS-1 Framers, LIUs, and SCTs to provide T3, E3, and STS1
connectivity.
Ethernet frames are queued and stored in an external 32-bit DDR SDRAM. The DDR SDRAM controller enables
connection to a 256Mb SDRAM without external glue logic, at clock frequencies up to 125MHz. The SDRAM is
used for the LAN Data, WAN Data, Frame Extraction, and Frame Insertion Queues. The user can program a “near
full threshold” (watermark) for the LAN and WAN queues that can be used to initiate automatic flow control. The
                                         43
device also provides the capability for X +1 payload and Barker sequence scrambling.
Microprocessor control can be accomplished through a 8-bit Micro controller port or SPI Bus. The device has a
125MHz DDR SDRAM controller and interfaces to a 32-bit wide 256Mb DDR SDRAM via a 16-bit data bus. The
DDR SDRAM is used to buffer data from the Ethernet and WAN ports for transport.
The power supplies consist of a 1.8V core supply, a 2.5V DDR SDRAM supply, and 3.3V I/O supply.

8.1      Parallel Processor Interface
Configuration and control can be accomplished through the 8-bit parallel microprocessor port. The device’s 16-bit
registers are accessed as sequential byte addresses. The 8-bit parallel data bus can be configured for Intel or
Motorola modes of operation. The 8-bit parallel data bus can be configured for Intel or Motorola modes of operation
with the MODE pin. When MODE = 0, bus timing is in Intel mode, as shown in Figure 12-13 and Figure 12-14.
When MODE = 1, bus timing is in Motorola mode, as shown in Figure 12-15 and Figure 12-16. The address space
is mapped through the use of 11 address lines, A0-A10. An address latch enable [ALE] pin is provided to allow for
multiplexing of the data and address signals. Note that the parallel bus is not available in the 144 pin DS33X11,
and the SPI Slave port must be used for processor control.
The Chip Select (CS) pin must be brought to a logic low level to gain read and write access to the microprocessor
port. With Intel timing selected, the Read (RD) and Write (WR) pins are used to indicate read and write operations
and latch data through the interface. With Motorola timing selected, the Read-Write (RW) pin is used to indicate
read and write operations while the Data Strobe (DS) pin is used to latch data through the interface.
The interrupt output pin (INT) is an open-drain output that will assert a logic-low level upon a number of software
maskable interrupt conditions. The inactive state of this pin can be configured with the GL.CR2.INTM bit. This pin is
normally connected to the microprocessor interrupt input. The register map is shown in Table 10-1 on Page 105.
8.1.1     Read-Write/Data Strobe Modes
The processor interface can operate in either read-write strobe mode or data strobe mode. When MODE = 0 the
read-write strobe mode is enabled and a negative pulse on RD performs a read cycle, and a negative pulse on WR
performs a write cycle. When MODE pin = 1, the data strobe mode is enabled and a negative pulse on DS when
RW is high performs a read cycle, and a negative pulse on DS when RW is low performs a write cycle. The read-
write strobe mode is commonly called the “Intel” mode, and the data strobe mode is commonly called the
“Motorola” mode.
8.1.2     Clear on Read
The latched status registers will clear on a read access. It is important to note that in a multi-task software
environment, the user should handle all status conditions of each register at the same time to avoid inadvertently
clearing status conditions. The latched status register bits are carefully designed so that an event occurrence
cannot collide with a user read access.
8.1.3     Interrupt and Pin Modes
The interrupt (INT) pin is configurable to drive high or float when not active. The GL.CR2.INTM bit controls the pin
configuration, when it is set to 1, the INT pin will drive high when inactive. After reset, the INT pin is in high
impedance mode until an interrupt source is active and enabled to drive the interrupt pin.
8.1.4     Multiplexed Bus Operation
An address latch enable [ALE] pin is provided to allow for multiplexing of the data and address signals. For
multiplexed operation, each of the eight data lines (D0-D7) must be externally connected to each of the lower eight
address lines (A0-A7). The remaining address lines (A8-A10) are connected as normal. Address inputs are latched
upon the falling edge of the ALE signal. ALE must remain low until the read or write operation is complete.

8.2      SPI Serial Processor Interface
The SPI interface is a four-signal serial interface that allows configuration and monitoring of the device with a
minimal number of electrical connections. The SPI interface uses Full-Duplex SPI Slave operation. The maximum
clock frequency of the SPI interface is 10MHz. Each access (read or write) takes approximately 2.4μs. With two
Address/Control bytes required for each data byte, the maximum data throughput rate is approximately 3.3
megabits per second. See the Section 11.1 for functional timing diagrams, and Section 12 for AC parametric
timing. Note that the parallel bus is not available in the 144-pin DS33X11, and the SPI Slave port must be used for
processor control.
The SPI bus is implemented using four signals: Clock (SPI_CLK), Master-Out Slave-In data (SPI_MOSI), Master-In
Slave-Out data (SPI_MISO), and Chip Select (CS). SPI_CLK polarity and phase can be set by the SPI_CPOL and
SPI_CPHA pins. The order of the address and data bits in the serial stream is selectable using the SPI_SWAP pin.
The Read/Write (R/W) bit is always the first bit and the Burst (B) bit is always last bit of the Address/Control Bytes
and their location is not affected by the SPI_SWAP pin setting.
Note that SPI “Burst mode” is not applicable for OAM frame insertion or extraction, due to the indirect access of the
extract and insert queues. The interface overhead associated with frame insertion and extraction is 5 register
accesses per frame.
The SPI protocol defines four combinations of SCK phase and polarity with respect to the data controlled by CPOL
(clock polarity) and CPHA (clock phase):

8.3      Clock Structure
The clock sources and functions are as follows:
     •   Serial Transmit Data (TCLKn) and Serial Receive Data (RCLKn) clock inputs are used to transfer data from
         the serial interface. These clocks can be continuous or gapped.
     •   The Serial Transmit Clock for ports 9-12 is a shared clock (TMCLK3). The Serial Transmit Sync for ports 9-
         12 is also shared (TMSYNC3).
     •   The Serial Transmit Clock for ports 13-16 is a shared clock (TMCLK4). The Serial Transmit Sync for ports
         13-16 is also shared (TMSYNC4).
     •   System Clock (SYSCLKI) input. Used for internal operation. This clock input cannot be a gapped clock. A
         clock supply with +/- 100 ppm frequency accuracy is suggested. A buffered version of this clock is provided
         on the SD_CLK pin for the operation of the SDRAM.
     •   The Transmit and Receive clocks for the MII/RMII Interface (TX_CLK and RX_CLK). In DTE mode, these
         are input pins and accept clocks provided by an Ethernet PHY.
     •   A Management Data Clock (MDC) output is derived from SYSCLKI and is used for information transfer
         between the internal Ethernet MAC and external PHY. The MDC clock frequency is 1.67MHz.
The device expects gapped clocks for T3/E3/T1/E1 data streams, minimally gapped for line overhead periods
The following table provides the different clocking options for the Ethernet interface.

8.3.1     Serial Interface Clock Modes
Serial Interface timing is determined by the line clocks. Both the transmit and receive clocks (TCLK and RCLK) are
inputs, and can be gapped.
8.3.2     Ethernet Interface Clock Modes
The Ethernet interfaces can be configured for MII, RMII, or GMII operation with the GL.CR1.P1SPD,
GL.CR1.P2SPD, SU.MACCR.GMIIMIIS bits and the RMII_SEL input pin. See Table 8-1 for details of the clock
requirements for the various Ethernet Interface configurations.
8.4      Resets and Low-Power Modes
The external RST pin and the reset bit GL.CR2.RST generate global reset signals. A global reset signal resets the
status and control registers on the chip (except the GL.CR2.RST bit) to their default values and resets all the other
flops to their reset values. The processor bus output signals are also placed in high-impedance mode when the
RST pin is active (low). The global reset bit (GL.CR2.RST) stays set after a one is written to it, but is reset to zero
when the external RST pin is active or when a zero is written to it. The system clock must be active for the device to
properly execute the reset. Allow 5 milliseconds after initiating a reset condition for the reset operation to complete.
The DS33X162 family of devices contain up to 54 individual software reset bits, depending on the port count of the
device. These functions of the various reset bits are outlined in the table below.

There are several features included to reduce power consumption. The reset bits of the LI.RCR1.RFRST,
LI.RVPCR.RVRST, LI.TVPCR.TVFRST, and VCAT.RCR4.RFRST registers also place the associated circuitry in a
low-power mode. Additionally, the RST pin may be held low indefinitely to keep the entire device in a low-power
mode. Note that exiting the low-power condition requires re-initialization and configuration.

STEP 6: Enable receive VCAT, Decapsulator, Transmit LAN
STEP 7: Enable Interrupts
8.6       Global Resources
The set of Global Registers begin at address location 000h. The global registers include Global resets, global
interrupt status, interrupt masking, clock configuration, and the Device ID registers. See the Global Register
Definitions in Table 10-2.
8.7       Per-Port Resources
The device contains a common set of global registers. The Serial (Line) Interfaces each have a set of registers for
configuration and control, denoted in this document with the “LI.” prefix. The Ethernet (Subscriber) Interfaces each
have a set of registers for configuration and control, denoted in this document with the “SU.” prefix.
8.8       Device Interrupts
Figure 8-2 diagrams the flow of interrupt conditions from their source status bits through the multiple levels of
information registers and mask bits to the interrupt pin. When an interrupt occurs, the host can read the Global
Interrupt Status register GL.ISR to initially determine the source of the interrupt. The host can then read the higher-
level status registers to further identify the source of the interrupt(s). All global status bits (GL.ISR) and
intermediate status bits (AR.BMIS, VCAT.RISR) are real-time bits that will clear once all appropriate interrupts
have been serviced and cleared. The interrupts from any source can be blocked at a global level by the writing a
zero in appropriate location in the global interrupt enable register GL.IER. Some portions of the device use interrupt
mask registers. Placing a “1” in the associated bit location associated with an interrupt condition prevents that
condition from causing a device interrupt. Some portions of the device use interrupt enable registers. Placing a “1”
in the associated bit location associated with an interrupt condition allows that condition to cause a device interrupt.
Latched Status bits that have been enabled or are un-masked are allowed to pass their interrupt conditions to the
Global Interrupt Status Registers. The Interrupt enable registers allow individual Latched Status conditions to
generate an interrupt, but when set to zero, they do not prevent the Latched Status bits from being set. Therefore,
when servicing interrupts, the user should AND the Latched Status with the associated Interrupt Enable Register in
order to exclude bits for which the user wished to prevent interrupt service. The user should NAND the Latched
Status bits with the associated Interrupt Mask Register. Latched Status Registers clear once read as described in
Section 8.1.2. This architecture allows the application host to periodically poll the latched status bits for non-
interrupt conditions, while using only one set of registers.
Note that the inactive state of the interrupt output pin is configurable. The GL.CR2.INTM bit controls the inactive
state of the interrupt pin, allowing selection of high-impedance or active driver.
The interrupt structure is designed to efficiently guide the user to the source of an enabled interrupt source. The
latched status bits for the interrupting entity must be read to clear the interrupt. Note that reading one latched status
bit will reset all bits in that register. During a reset condition, interrupts cannot be generated.

8.9       Forwarding Modes and WAN Connections
The path any given frame takes through the device can be determined by the contents of the frame, the port of
entry, the user configured WAN Connections, and the user configured Forwarding Mode.
8.9.1      Forwarding Modes
The set of rules that determine the route of frames between the Ethernet Interface(s) and WAN data stream(s) is
called the Forwarding Mode. The forwarding mode is selected in the GL.CR1 register. The five Forwarding Modes
are listed below. The connections between the Serial (WAN) Interfaces and the logical WAN data streams
described below are independent of these Forwarding Modes and will be described later. See Table 8-4 for
forwarding modes supported by each device.
Mode 1 - Single Ethernet Port with Priority Forwarding
Mode 2 - Per-Ethernet-Port Forwarding with Priority Scheduling
Mode 3 - Single Ethernet Port with VLAN Forwarding and Priority Scheduling
Mode 4 - Per-Ethernet-Port Forwarding, with VLAN Forwarding and Priority Scheduling within each VLAN group
Mode 5 – Full VLAN Forwarding in both the LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN directions.
Forwarding Mode 1 is Single Ethernet Port with Priority Forwarding. In this mode, Ethernet frames are segregated
into up to four priority queues and transmitted in separate WAN data streams. One example application is an
Ethernet Switch that forwards its traffic according to each frame’s priority encoding, as in an IP DSLAM or ISAM
that has a WAN connection with a VoIP Gateway on WAN Interface #1, a Video Stream device on WAN Interface
#2, and an internet POP on WAN Interface #3.
Forwarding Mode 2 is Per-Ethernet-Port Forwarding with Priority Scheduling. In this mode, frames from each
Ethernet port are forwarded to their own group of four priority queues, generating two separate WAN data streams
with priority scheduled traffic. One example application is a Leased Line Service for two independent Ethernet
subscribers. Each subscriber pays its own leased line fee and is guaranteed the full bandwidth of the WAN line
from end to end. This is the only mode that supports 1000Mbps Jumbo Frames (must use single Ethernet port
operation).
Forwarding Mode 3 is Single Ethernet Port with VLAN Forwarding and Priority Scheduling. In this mode, Ethernet
frames are forwarded by VLAN tag (VID) into up to four groups of four priority queues (WAN Groups) each. Each
WAN Group forms a separate WAN data stream with priority scheduled traffic. One example application is an
Service Router that is connected to four IP DSLAMs via DS3s. In the LAN-to-WAN direction, VLAN IDs are used to
distinguish the forwarding path while Priority coding is used to schedule the selection of frames within a Queue
Group.
Forwarding Mode 4 is Per-Ethernet-Port Forwarding, with VLAN Forwarding and Priority Scheduling within each
VLAN Group. In this mode, Ethernet frames from each Ethernet port are forwarded separately, by VLAN tag, into
two sets of four priority queues (WAN Groups) each. The two WAN Groups form separate WAN data streams with
priority scheduled traffic. One example application is 2 Leased Lines for 2 independent Ethernet subscribers (one
route might go to Chicago and the other to Santa Clara). VLAN tagging is used to segregate the traffic bound for
each route, and Priority coding can be used to provide prioritized scheduling within a VLAN group.
Forwarding Mode 5 is Full VLAN Forwarding in both the LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN directions. In this mode,
Ethernet frames from both ports can be forwarded by VLAN tag (VID) to one of two shared WAN groups. Within
each shared WAN group, there are two sets of four strict priority queues. The two sets of strict priority queues are
serviced with a round-robin algorithm. Frames are then encapsulated by Encapsulator #1 or #3. Frames received
from the WAN side can be forwarded by VLAN tag to either Ethernet port. The LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN
mappings are independent and can be configured separately. One example application is Central Office traffic
grooming where the time sensitive voice and video are segregated from a network and combined with other data
streams of similar priority.

The user may choose to disable unused features in a forwarding mode. In the forwarding modes with Priority
Forwarding or Priority Scheduling, both 802.1p VLAN PCP and DSCP are supported. The user-programmable
Priority Table is accessed through the SU.PTC, SU.PTAA, SU.PTWD, SU.PTRD, and SU.PTSA registers. The
Priority and Quality of Service (QoS) features of the device are discussed further in Section 8.16. Gigabit Ethernet
applications may only use Forwarding modes that support 1 Ethernet Port (modes 1, 2, or 3). In all forwarding
modes, VCAT/LCAS can be used to aggregate multiple physical serial ports for each WAN Group’s data stream,
except on the devices in the product family that do not support VCAT/LCAS. More information on the use of
VCAT/LCAS for link aggregation can be found in Section 8.12.
In the forwarding modes that use VLAN VID tags, the device references a user-programmable lookup table to
make forwarding decisions. Through the SU.VTC, SU.VTAA, SU.VTWD, and SU.VTRD registers, the user must
program a lookup table that maps up to 4096 VLAN VID tags each to one of the four WAN Groups in the LAN-to-
WAN direction, and from the WAN Groups to the two Ethernet Interfaces in the WAN-to-LAN direction. More
information on VLAN mapping can be found in Section 8.16. Within each WAN Queue group, 802.1p VLAN Priority
coding or DSCP Priority Coding can be used to assign traffic to 4 different priority queues. More information on
priority forwarding and scheduling for quality of service can be found in Section 8.16.

8.9.2      WAN Connections
Each Serial (WAN) Interface is mapped to a WAN Group through the VCAT.TCR3(1-16) and VCAT.RCR4(1-16)
registers. A WAN interface can only be assigned to one WAN Group. In devices in the product family that support
VCAT operation, if enabled, more than one WAN interface can be assigned to a WAN Group. Whenever a WAN
Group has more than one member, VCAT must be enabled for that group. A VCAT enabled WAN Group can
include up to 16 WAN Interfaces. More information on the use of VCAT/LCAS for link aggregation can be found in
Section 8.12.

8.9.3     Queue Configuration
The starting and ending locations for each queue in DDR SDRAM are user-configured. The address space of a 256
Mbit DDR SDRAM is 24-bits, providing an address range covering 16M 16-bit words. To reduce the complexity of
the user interface, only the upper 10 bits of each start/end queue address are user-configured. This provides a
minimum queue size granularity of 16K 16-bit words, or 32 Kbytes. The 10-bit values programmed into the queue
configuration registers can be multiplied by 32,768 in order to convert to bytes.
Each Serial (WAN) interface has an associated receive WAN Queue in external DDR SDRAM. The WAN Queues
receive data from the WAN interfaces and buffer it for processing. The user configures the size and location of
these queues through control registers in the Arbiter. Starting WAN queue addresses are configured in
AR.WQ1SA-AR.WQ16SA, and ending addresses in AR.WQ1EA-AR.WQ16EA. When using VCAT/LCAS, the
WAN queues are also used for differential delay compensation between members of a VCG. The user-configured
depth of these queues should provide for approximately 200 ms of data at the WAN line rate. This translates to
approximately 10Mb at a 52Mbps rate, and 300kb at 1.544Mbps. While it is possible to configure larger WAN
queues, note that limitations of the VCAT protocol only allow the resolution of 200ms at the line rate, and aliasing
may occur at larger WAN queue depths.
Data from the LAN interface is received into an internal buffer monitored by the SU.LIQOS.LIQOS bits. It is then
immediately processed and placed into one of 16 LAN Queues in external SDRAM, based on the forwarding mode
and information within the frame. Starting WAN queue addresses are configures in AR.LQ1SA-AR.WQ16SA and
ending addresses are configured in AR.LQ1EA-AR.LQ16EA.
The user defines a LAN queue threshold (watermark) that is used to trigger Ethernet flow control or device
interrupts in the AR.LQW register. Because WAN standards do not have a method for interactive flow-control, the
WAN queues do not have user-programmable watermark. The device provides overflow status for the WAN
queues in AR.WQOS and for the LAN queues in AR.LQOS. The device provides an indication that frame
discarding has been triggered due to the level of the WAN queues in AR.WQNFS. The interrupt operation related
to these functions is further defined in Section 8.8.
There are also four special-purpose external SDRAM queues used for frame insertion and extraction. The user
configures the size and location of these through control registers in the Arbiter. The LAN Insert queue is defined
by AR.LIQSA and AR.LIQEA. The LAN Extract Queue is defined by AR.LEQSA and AR.LEQEA. The WAN insert
queue is defined by AR.WIQSA and AR.WIQEA. The WAN Extract queue is defined by AR.WEQSA and
AR.WEQEA. Overflow status for the extraction queues is provided in AR.EQOS
An additional portion of the external SDRAM must be allocated for the Bridge/Filter function when in use. The 4k x
6-byte table used for DA lookup operations will be constructed at the location in the AR.BFTOA register.
The device does not provide error indication if the user creates a connection and queue that overwrites
data for another connection queue. The user must take care in setting the queue sizes.
The LAN and WAN queue pointers must be reset before traffic flow can begin. If this procedure is not followed,
incorrect data may be transmitted. The proper procedure for setting up a connection follows:
     •   Set up the queue sizes for both LAN and WAN queues.
     •   Set up the LAN Queue threshold and associated interrupt enables if desired.
     •   Reset the pointers for the associated queues
     •   Enable the associated ports.
     •   If a port is disconnected, reset the queue pointer after the disconnection.
Each queue can be individually reset as needed through the starting address register for that queue. All queue
pointers can be reset simultaneously through the AR.MQC register. This register also configures the behavior of
the WAN frame insertion.
Two scheduling algorithms can be used for prioritizing traffic to be transmitted from the LAN queues to the WAN
interface: Strict Priority and Weighted Round-Robin (WRR). WRR scheduling is available only in Forwarding Mode
2, with one Ethernet port. This is configured in the AR.LQSC register.

8.10 Bandwidth Capabilities (Throughput)
All devices in the product family support approximately 416Mbps aggregate throughput. However, on the high-port
count devices with dual Ethernet Interfaces (the DS33X162 and DS33X82), it is necessary to conform to certain
constraints when interfacing with T3/E3 WAN lines. These constraints do not apply for T1/E1 transport. Also, these
constraints do not apply to devices other than the DS33X162 and DS33X82.

Attempting operation of the DS33X162 or DS33X82 outside of these constraints may cause data loss. If the user
wishes to operate outside of the device’s designed capabilities, it is recommended that the user evaluate the
device performance under the specific application conditions and determine if the measured performance is
acceptable.
Note that the WAN Groups support the following rates:
         •   Maximum data rate for WAN Groups 1 and 2 = up to 416Mbps total (Group 1 + Group 2 ≤ 418Mbps)
         •   Maximum data rate for WAN Groups 3 and 4 = 180Mbps each
Note that the individual WAN ports support the following rates:
         •   Maximum line rate for WAN ports 1-8 = 52Mbps each
         •   Maximum line rate for WAN ports 9-16 = 2.044Mbps each

8.11 Serial (WAN)
The Serial Interfaces support time-division multiplexed, serial data I/O up to 52Mbps. The Serial Interface receives
and transmits encapsulated Ethernet frames, and consists of a physical serial port with a GFP/X.86/HDLC/cHDLC
engine. Each physical interface consists of a data pin, clock pin, and a synchronization pin in both the transmit and
receive directions. The Serial Interface can operate with a gapped clock, and can be connected to a framer,
electrical LIU, optical transceiver, or T/E-Carrier transceiver for WAN transmission. The Serial Interface can be
seamlessly connected to the Maxim T1/E1/J1 Framers, Line Interface Units (LIUs), and Single-Chip Transceivers
(SCTs). The interface can also be seamlessly connected to the Maxim T3/E3/STS-1 Framers, LIUs, and SCTs to
provide T3, E3, and STS1 connectivity.

8.12 Link Aggregation and Link Capacity Adjustment (VCAT/LCAS)
Virtual Concatenation (VCAT) allows information to be transmitted over up to 16 aggregated WAN links. The VCAT
function aligns all members of the VCG to the link with the most transmission delay. The information on all
members of the VCG must be buffered until the last data is received from the link with the most transmission delay.
The maximum differential delay allowed between the link with the most delay and the link with the least delay is
200 ms. Note that the queue size is user-programmed and could potentially be configured for values larger than
200 ms of data. In VCAT mode, the maximum recommended queue size is 200 ms worth of data. If the user
configures a queue size larger than 200ms while in VCAT mode, errors may occur due to aliasing. Note that link
aggregation is not possible using the DS33X11 and DS33W11, but the insertion of VCAT overhead is supported on
these devices.
VCAT Features:
     •   4 VCGs for the DS33X162/X82, 2 VCGs for the DS33X42, 1 VCG for the DS33X161/X81/X41/W41
     •   Max differential delay = 200 ms
     •   Receive and Transmit are independent (asymmetrical support)
     •   User programmable configuration of WAN ports used for VCG
     •   Supports Virtual Concatenation of up to 8 T3/E3 or 16 T1/E1
     •   RCLKs of a VCG must be frequency locked.
     •   All TMCLKs/TCLKs used for a VCG must be frequency locked.

8.12.2 VCAT/LCAS Configuration and Operation
VCAT/LCAS setup requires an external Micro to issue an instruction to setup and tear down the IMUX function.
The microprocessor can turn off links that are not participating. Once any changes to the transmit VCAT
configuration are made, a zero-to-one transition on VCAT.TCR1.TLOAD is required in order to load the updated
configuration.
8.12.2.1Receive VCAT Initialization
1. Configure the VCG Frame Mode via VCAT.RCR1.T3T1
2. Configure VCAT.RCR3 with the number of members per VCG.
3. Assign each port to the appropriate VCG via VCAT.RCR4.RVGS[2:0] and VCAT.RCR4.RPA.
4. Enable the Receive VCAT Blocks via VCAT.RCR1.RVBLKEN and VCAT.RCR1.RVENn.
5. Clear the FIFO Reset in VCAT.RCR4.
6. If needed, enable LCAS via VCAT.RCR2.LE[4:1].
8.12.2.2Transmit VC Group Initialization – LCAS Enabled
1. Assign each port to the appropriate VCG via VCAT.TCR3.TVGS[2:0] and VCAT.TCR3.TPA.
2. Assign the Sequence number to each port via VCAT.TCR3.SQ[3:0].
3. Configure VCAT.TCR2 with the number of members per VCG.
4. Configure the VCG Frame Mode via VCAT.TCR1.VnFM[1:0].
5. Write the LCAS Control word via VCAT.TLCR8.CTRL[3:0] to IDLE for participating links.
6. Enable LCAS through VCAT.RCR2.LE[4:1].
7. Enable the Transmit VCAT Block via VCAT.TCR1.TVBLKEN.
8. Initiate a zero-to-one transition on VCAT.TCR1.TLOAD in order to load the configuration.
8.12.2.3Transmit VC Group Initialization (LCAS Disabled)
1. Assign each port to the appropriate VCG via VCAT.TCR3.TVGS[2:0] and VCAT.TCR3.TPA.
2. Assign the Sequence number to each port via VCAT.TCR3.SQ[3:0].
3. Configure each VCG Frame Mode via VCAT.TCR1.VnFM[1:0].
4. Configure VCAT.TCR2 with the number of members per VCG.
5. Enable the Transmit VCAT Block via VCAT.TCR1.TVBLKEN.

8.12.3 Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS)
The Link Capacity Adjustment Scheme (LCAS) provides the capability to add and remove members from a VCAT
VCG. If LCAS is enabled viaVCAT.RCR2.LE[3:0], the receive LCAS block will extract all LCAS frame information
from the VCAT overhead. The LCAS status registers report the CTRL, GID, RS-ACK, and MST fields of the VCAT
frame. The LCAS CTRL field communicates the intent to add or remove a member from the group. The device
coordinates the addition or removal of links from the group of active members so that changes are hitless.
The transmit MST values are automatically controlled by the device by default. Optionally, this function can be
controlled by user software via the VCAT.TLCR3–VCAT.TLCR6 registers. The Transmit MST field communicates
the condition of the line (e.g., an LOM alarm), the reception of an Add command (and subsequent successful
alignment to the VCG), and the reception of a Remove command.
To enable Transmit LCAS, follow the initialization steps outlined in Section 8.12.2.2. Note that the
VCAT.TLCR8.CTRL[3:0] bits should be initialized with a CTRL command of IDLE. All changes to the CTRL[3:0]
register bits must be followed with a zero-to-one transition on VCAT.TCR1.TLOAD for the change to take effect.
Receive LCAS Functions:
• Aligns all members of the VCG
• Reports relevant fields and alarms to status registers
• Automatically transmits MST back to the Source (Manual control also configurable)
Transmit LCAS Functions:
• Outputs CTRL, MST, GID, RS-Ack to be inserted into VCAT overhead
• GID PRBS generator and insertion
• User-Configured GID insertion
• CRC generation and insertion
8.12.3.1Example LCAS Operation
     1. Initial CTRL command of IDLE, SQ value = max (16 for T1/E1, 8 for T3/E3)
     2. Addition of Member:
              a. Send ADD command, Change SQ value to 1+ SQ value(active link with the highest SQ)
              b. Wait for MST=OK on Receive LCAS (VCAT.RLSR1 register)
              c. Send EOS on this port; Port that was sending EOS now sends NORM
     3. Removal of Member
              a. Change command from NORM/EOS to IDLE; Change SQ value to max; Reorder other active
                 members’ SQ; If change was from EOS to IDLE, then next highest member changes from NORM
                 to EOS
     4. Response to Receive LCAS reporting MST=FAIL
              a. If the Receive LCAS reports that a MST value changed from OK to FAIL, the Transmit LCAS
                 should send DNU on that port.
              b. The SQ value remains the same.
              c. If the member that changes to DNU was EOS, EOS must be assigned to the member next in line.

8.12.4 Alarms and Conditions related to VCAT/LCAS
The latched status bits for the VCAT/LCAS sequence (VCAT.RSLSR.SQL), control (VCAT.RSLSR.CTRL) and
RS-Ack (VCAT.RSLSR.RSACKL) bits can be used to generate device interrupts on a change of state.
The latched Loss of Multiframe Sync (VCAT.RSLSR.LOML), Realign (VCAT.RRLSR.REALIGN[1-4]) and
Differential Delay (VCAT.RRLSR.DDE[1-4]) bits can be used to generate an interrupt upon transition from the
inactive (normal) to the active (alarm) state. If the user’s application requires an indication of the transition from the
active to inactive condition, the host processor should poll the (non-latched) status bits to determine when the
alarm becomes inactive.
8.13 Arbiter/Buffer Manager
The Arbiter manages the transport between the Ethernet and Serial ports. It is responsible for queuing and
dequeuing frames to a single external SDRAM. The arbiter handles requests from the Packet Processor and MAC
to transfer data to and from the SDRAM. For more information of how the Arbiter settings affect QoS, see Section
8.16. For more information on configuring the Arbiter’s interactions with the SDRAM queues, see Section 8.9.3.

8.14 Flow Control
In some applications, Flow Control may be required to ensure that data queues do not overflow and frames are not
dropped. The device allows for optional IEEE 802.3 Compliant flow control. There are 2 basic mechanisms of flow
control:
     •   In half duplex mode, a jam sequence is sent that causes a collision detection at the far end. The collision
         causes the transmitting node to reduce the rate of transmission.
     •   In full duplex mode, flow control is initiated by the receiving node sending a pause frame. The pause frame
         contains a time parameter that determines the pause timeout to be used by the transmitting node.
Several conditions can initiate the flow control mechanism:
     •   Flow Control can be initiated by a LAN Queue filling above the Watermark programmed in AR.LQW. Flow
         Control for each LAN Queue is independanty enabled in the SU.LQXPC register. Note that the LAN
         Queues are external DDR SDRAM buffers used to store data that has arrived on the MII/RMII/GMII
         interface(s) and has been processed by the receive MAC.
     •   Flow Control can be initiated by the CIR Policing function. More information on this function can be found
         in Section 8.21.
     •   Transmission of a pause frame can be manually initiated by writing a 1 to SU.MACFCR.FCB.
The Pause time value that is transmitted in outgoing Pause frames is user-programmable in the SU.MACFCR
register. Note that Pause control frame transmission must also be enabled with the SU.MACFCR.TFE bit. Pause
frame receipt must be enabled with SU.MACFCR.RFE. Although not commonly used, Unicast Pause frame
reception can be enabled with SU.MACFCR.UP.
The Watermark value programmed into AR.LQW is in units of memory from the top of the queue, thus a larger
value in AR.LQW indicates that more memory will remain available in the queue when flow control is exerted. Note
that in order to use flow control, the minimum LAN queue size is 2 frames (of maximum size) deep and the LAN
queue watermark threshold (AR.LQW) must be set to allow a minimum of 1 frame of maximum size to be received
after the threshold is crossed. If the Watermark is set too close to the top of the queue to allow time for the remote
node to respond, automatic flow control will not be effective.
In some applications, Ethernet flow control can interfere with higher-layer flow control protocols. For example,
TCP/IP flow control depends on lost frames in order to detect when it has exceeded a system’s capabilities. TCP/IP
flow control uses an increasing flow rate until lost frames are detected, at which point a back-off & resend algorithm
is used, based on the number of lost frames until a steady stream is maintained. If no frames are lost, TCP/IP will
continue attempting to increase the flow rate. If TCP/IP flow control is used in conjunction with Ethernet Flow
control, the results may be undesirable for some applications. The system architect should carefully study this
topic to determine if the system in design should use Ethernet flow control or frame discarding. The
DS33X162 family of devices support both flow control and frame discarding.
Rev: 063008                                                                                                  58 of 375

8.14.1 Full Duplex Flow control
Automatic flow control is governed by the LAN Queue high watermark in AR.LQW, and is enabled per LAN Queue
in the SU.LQXPC register. This allows the user to enable or disable flow control for each of the four mapped
PCP/DSCP priorities. When the LAN queue threshold is exceeded on which flow control is enabled, the device will
send a pause frame with the timer value programmed in SU.MACFCR.PT[15:0] when in full duplex, or a jamming
signal in half duplex. More information on configuring the queues, see Section 8.9.3. Also see the SU.MACFCR
register definition for recommended flow control settings.
The pause frame causes the distant transmitter to “pause for a time” before starting transmission again. The device
will send a pause frame as the queue has crossed the threshold defined in AR.LQW. The pause control frame is
retransmitted every 16.4us, 164us, or 1.64ms, depending on the settings in SU.MACFCR.PLT. The receive queue
could keep growing if the round trip delay is greater than the Pause time. Pause control will only take care of
temporary congestion it does not take care of systems where the traffic throughput is too high for the queue sizes
selected. If the flow control is not effective the receive queue will eventually overflow. This is indicated in
SU.LIQOS. If the receive queue is overflowed any new frames will not be received until the overflow condition is
corrected..
The user has the option of not enabling automatic flow control. In this case the thresholds and corresponding
interrupt mechanism to send pause frame by writing to the FCB bit in the MAC flow control register SU.MACFCR.
This allows the user to set not only the watermarks but also to decide when to send a pause frame or not based on
watermark crossings.
On the receive side the user has control over whether to respond to the pause frame sent by the distant end
(SU.MACFCR.RFE bit). On the Transmit queue the user has the option of setting high and low thresholds and
corresponding interrupts. There is no automatic flow control mechanism for data received from the Serial
side waiting for transmission over the Ethernet interface during times of heavy Ethernet congestion.
8.14.2 Half Duplex Flow control
Half duplex flow control functions like Full Duplex flow control, but a jamming sequence is used to exert
backpressure on the transmitting node rather than Pause control frames. The receiving node jams the first 4 bytes
of a frame that are received from the MAC in order to cause a collision detection at the distant end. In both
100Mbps and 10Mbps MII/RMII modes, 4 bytes are jammed upon reception of a new frame. Note that the jamming
mechanism does not jam the frame that is being received during the watermark crossing, but will wait to jam the
next frame after the AR.LQW is crossed. If the queue remains above the threshold, received frames will continue
to be jammed. This jam sequence is stopped when the queue falls below the threshold in AR.LQW.

8.15 Ethernet Interfaces
The Ethernet Interface allows for direct connection to Ethernet PHYs. The interface consists of a dual 10/100Mbps
MII/RMII interface or a single 1000Mbps GMII interface and associated Ethernet MACs. In GMII operation, the
interface contains 23 signals with a reference clock of 125MHz. In dual MII operation, each interface contains of 12
signals and uses a clock reference of 25MHz. In RMII operation, the interface contains 7 signals with a reference
clock of 50MHz. The device can be configured for GMII, MII, or RMII operation with the GL.CR1.P1SPD,
GL.CR1.P2SPD, SU.MACCR.GMIIMIIS bits and the RMII_SEL input pin. In DTE mode of operation, the TX_CLK
and RX_CLK signals are generated by the PHY and are inputs.
The data received from the MII, RMII, or GMII interface(s) is processed by internal IEEE 802.3 compliant Ethernet
MACs. The user can configure a maximum receive frame length beyond which the MAC discards the complete
frame. The maximum frame size can be configured in the SU.MPL register to any value up to 10240 bytes. Sizes
over 2048 bytes are considered “jumbo” frames. For more information on jumbo frame support requirements, see
Table 10-5. The maximum frame length (in bits) is the number specified in SU.MPL multiplied by 8.
The frame length calculation is shown below in Figure 8-8. The frame length includes only destination address,
source address, VLAN tag (2 bytes), type length field, data and CRC32. Note that the calculation used for
maximum frame size results in a different value than the 802.3 Type/Length field shown in the figure.

                                                        Max Frame Length
The distant end will normally reject the sent frames if jabber timeout, loss of carrier, excessive deferral, late
collisions, excessive collisions, under run, deferred or collision errors occur. Transmission of a frame under any of
these errors will be logged by the MAC management counters. The device provides user the option to not
automatically retransmit the frame if any of the errors have occurred through the MAC’s SU.MACCR.DRTY bit.
Frames received with errors are usually rejected by the device. More information on the Ethernet MAC functions
can be found in Section 8.19.

8.15.3 DTE and DCE Mode
When in 10/100 mode, the Ethernet MII interface(s) can be configured for DCE or DTE Mode. When configured in
DTE Mode, direct connection can be made to Ethernet PHYs. In DCE mode, the MII interface can be connected to
MII MAC devices other than an Ethernet PHY, such as Ethernet Switch devices. The DTE/DCE connections in MII
mode are shown in the following 2 figures.
In DCE Mode, the transmitter is connected to an external receiver and receiver is connected to an external MAC
transmitter. The selection of DTE or DCE mode is done by the hardware pin DCEDTES. DCE mode is not valid for
GbE (GMII) operation.

8.15.4 RMII Mode
The Ethernet interface can be configured for RMII operation by setting the hardware pin RMIIMIIS high. RMII
interface operates synchronously from the external 50MHz reference (REF_CLK). Only 7 signals are required. The
following figure shows the RMII architecture. Note that DCE mode is not supported for RMII mode and RMII is valid
only for full duplex operation.

8.16 Quality of Service (QoS) Features
The device contains several features designed to provide Quality of Service (QoS). These features include Virtual
LAN (VLAN) Forwarding and Priority Scheduling/Forwarding supporting both VLAN 802.1p and DSCP. The device
also includes features for Congestion Avoidance and Congestion Management. Information on Congestion
Avoidance using the integrated CIR can be found in Section 8.21. Information on Congestion Management using
Ethernet flow control can be found in Section 8.14.
VLAN Forwarding is used to separate traffic into different streams or combine traffic from multiple sources into a
single stream, while Priority Scheduling is used to prioritize traffic waiting in queue for WAN transmit bandwidth to
become available. Note that Priority Scheduling is different than Priority Forwarding. Priority Forwarding is a
technique used to separate traffic of various priority levels onto physically separate WAN connections. The use of
VLAN Forwarding, Priority Scheduling, and Priority Forwarding is determined by the Forwarding Mode of the
device. More information on the available Forwarding Modes can be found in Section 8.9.
Within the data stream for each WAN Queue group, 802.1p VLAN Priority Coding or DSCP Priority Coding can be
used to assign traffic to 4 different priority queues as discussed in the following sections.
8.16.1 VLAN Forwarding by VID (IEEE 802.1q)
The VLAN ID (VID) is a 12-bit field that is found beginning in the 15th byte of VLAN tagged Ethernet frames. The
format of the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagged frame is shown in Figure 8-13. The device uses a 4 kilobyte user-
configured “VLAN Table” to translate VLAN tag information into forwarding, trapping, or discarding decisions. For
more details on VLAN Table programming, see Section 8.16.2.
All frames received on the Ethernet interfaces are inspected for a VLAN ID (LAN-VLAN ID) value. The VLAN table
settings for each of the 4096 LAN-VLAN IDs are used to forward each frame to one of the four WAN groups, to
discard the frame, or to extract (trap) the frame. Only when operating in forwarding modes 3, 4, and 5 (as defined
in Section 8.9), can frames be forwarded to one of the four WAN Groups as assigned in the VLAN table. All 12-bit
LAN-VLAN IDs that are translated to the same WAN Group are considered part of the same LAN-VLAN Group.
Note that LAN-VLAN ID trapping must be assigned to an Ethernet Port with the SU.LPM.LEEPS bit, and enabled
with the SU.LPM.LEVIT bit.
All frames received on the WAN interfaces are inspected for a VLAN ID (WAN-VLAN ID) value. ). The VLAN table
settings for each of the 4096 WAN-VLAN IDs are used to forward each frame to one of the Ethernet ports, to
discard the frame, or to extract (trap) the frame. Only when operating in forwarding mode 5 (as defined in Section
8.9), can frames be forward to one of the Ethernet ports by their VLAN ID value. All 12-bit LAN-VLAN IDs that are
translated to the same Ethernet interface are considered part of the same WAN-VLAN Group. Note that WAN-
VLAN forwarding is only applicable when operating in forwarding mode 5. Also note that WAN-VLAN ID trapping
must be assigned to a specific WAN Group with the SU.WEM.WEDS bits and enabled with the SU.WEM.WEVIT
bit.
The LAN-VLAN configuration, used to specify the actions for VLAN ID values in frames received on the Ethernet
interfaces (LAN-to-WAN direction), may be unrelated to the WAN-VLAN configuration, used to specify the actions
for VLAN ID values for frames received on the WAN interface (WAN-to-LAN direction). Although there may be
VLAN tags in both data stream directions (LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN), the functionality of the device does not
require a symmetrical VLAN function. The LAN-VLAN forwarding and the WAN-VLAN forwarding may be used
independently of each other.

8.16.2 Programming the VLAN ID Table
A 4 kilobyte user-configured “VLAN Table” is used to translate VLAN tag information from each received frame into
forwarding, trapping (frame extraction), or discarding decisions. Each address in the table corresponds to a
specific VLAN ID (VID) value from 0 to 4095, and the bit settings at each address relate to actions taken when a
frame containing the corresponding VLAN ID value is detected. The VLAN Table is configured through the
SU.VTC, SU.VTAA, SU.VTWD, and SU.VTRD registers.
Within each address location in the VLAN table, two bits of data determine the actions taken for frames received on
the WAN interfaces with VLAN IDs matching the table address value, and four bits determine actions taken on
frames received on the LAN interfaces with VLAN IDs matching the table address value. The 4K x 2 bit space used
for WAN functions is referred to as the WAN-VLAN table. The 4 K x 4 bit space used for LAN functions is referred
to as the LAN-VLAN table.
The user can also configure a default “No VLAN detected” value in the SU.LNFC register to indicate what should
be done with frames that do not have a VLAN tags. The user may indicate the same forwarding location as one of
the other VLAN Groups, or it can be used to indicate an independent process or location. For example, the user
may indicate to discard untagged frames, while VLAN tags 0 through 4094 are forwarded to the 4 WAN Groups
and VLAN tag 4095 is forwarded to the LAN Extract queue.
To Reset the VLAN Table:
1) Write SU.VTC = 05h to ensure a 0-1 transition on SU.VTC.CI and enable the VLAN Table.
2) Write SU.VTC = 07h.
3) Read SU.VTSA.VTIS until = 1.
To Program the VLAN Table:
1) Write SU.VTAA = 00h in order to begin configuration at VID 00h.
2) 4096 times, write the value of SU.VTWD for the desired action for each VID value.
To Verify the VLAN Table:
1) Write SU.VTAA = 00h in order to begin verification at VID 00h.
2) 4096 times, read the value of SU.VTRD register and verify the value.
The LAN-VLAN ID frame extraction trap must be assigned to an Ethernet Port with the SU.LPM.LEEPS bit, and
enabled with the SU.LPM.LEVIT bit.
The WAN-VLAN ID frame extraction trap must be assigned to a specific WAN Group (Decapsulator) with the
SU.WEM.WEDS bits and enabled with the SU.WEM.WEVIT bit.
In order to enable the VLAN processing functions in each port, the SU.LP1C.LP1ETF[2:1] or
SU.LP2C.LP2ETF[2:1] bits must be properly configured. When the VLAN processing functions are enabled,
incoming frames are inspected for VLAN information. The VLAN protocol ID must match the value programmed in
SU.LQTPID. Frames with alternate VLAN PIDs are processed as “untagged”. In the WAN-to-LAN direction, the
corresponding function is performed in SU.WETPID.

8.16.3 Priority Coding with VLAN Tags (IEEE 802.1p)
The IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tagging standard allocated room for a priority code that was later defined by the IEEE
802.1p standard. IEEE 802.1p eventually became part of IEEE 802.1D.
With Priority Scheduling or Priority Forwarding enabled, the priority value is inspected as each frame arrives on the
Ethernet Interfaces. For IEEE 802.1p priority coding, the priority is located in the 15th byte of the Ethernet frame.
The format of the IEEE 802.1p VLAN tagged frame is shown in Figure 8-13. A user-programmed Priority Table is
used to translate the 3-bit 802.1p Priority value into one of four Priority Levels for each Ethernet Interface. The
received PCP value is used as the address for the Priority Table lookup operation. The Priority Levels correspond
to four separate queues. In Priority Forwarding (Forwarding Mode 1), the four queues are in separate WAN
Groups. In Priority Scheduling operation, each WAN Group contains a set of four priority queues. These queues
are collectively referred to as LAN Queues in other portions of this document.
The priority mode (802.1p, DSCP, or none) for each Ethernet port can be independently selected using the
SU.LP1C and SU.LP2C registers. See Section 8.16.6 for more information on programming the priority table.

8.16.4 Priority Coding with Multiple (Q-in-Q) VLAN Tags
Device operation with multiple VLAN tags is similar to operation with a single VLAN tag. The Ethernet Q-in-Q
format is similar to the case outlined above, except that a second VLAN tag is inserted after the Ethernet SA field.
The format of the VLAN Q-in-Q tagged frame is shown in Figure 8-14. Both VLAN tags include a PCP (User
Priority) value and a VLAN ID. The device only makes forwarding and scheduling decisions using the “outer-most”
VLAN tag located in Ethernet bytes # 13-16, and ignores additional tags. The user can configure an alternate
WAN-VLAN Q-in-Q or VLAN Tag Protocol ID (TPID) that is used instead of the default value of 8100 in the
SU.WETPID register. The user can configure an alternate LAN-VLAN Q-in-Q or VLAN Tag Protocol ID (TPID) that
is used instead of the default value of 8100h in the SU.LQTPID register. Some additional common TPIDs are 9100,
9200 and 88A8. See Section 8.16.6 for more information on programming the priority table.

8.16.5 Priority Coding with DSCP
The IETF RFC2474 (Differentiated Services) defines a Layer-3 alternate to 802.1p priority coding, known as
Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP). DSCP is composed of a 6-bit value located in the second byte of the IP
header. When Priority Scheduling or Priority Forwarding are enabled, the priority value is inspected as each frame
arrives on the Ethernet Interfaces. The format of the DSCP tagged frame is shown in Figure 8-15. The device
supports DSCP priority carried in IPv4 or IPv6 packets. A user-programmed Priority Table is used to translate the
6-bit DSCP Priority into one of four Priority Levels for each Ethernet Interface. The received PCP value is used as
the address for the Priority Table lookup operation. The Priority Levels correspond to four separate queues. In
Priority Forwarding (Forwarding Mode 1), the four queues are in separate WAN Groups. In Priority Scheduling
operation, each WAN Group contains a set of four priority queues. These queues are collectively referred to as
LAN Queues in other portions of this document.
The priority mode (802.1p, DSCP, or none) for each Ethernet port can be independently selected using the
SU.LP1C and SU.LP2C registers. The DSCP function is a simple enable/disable function, with all of the other
parameters (Ethernet Frame Format, and Ethernet Type) being discovered by the device. See Section 8.16.6 for
more information on programming the priority table.

8.16.6 Programming the Priority Table
The user-programmable Priority Table is accessed indirectly through the SU.PTC, SU.PTAA, SU.PTWD,
SU.PTRD, and SU.PTSA registers. The device contains a single table, with the MSB of the table address
(SU.PTAA.PTAA) used to distinguish the LAN port in multi-port devices. When a frame is received, the PCP or
DSCP value in the received frame is the address used to look up the user-programmed priority level in the Priority
Table.
The device does not require that the priority mapping be linear or monotonic. Arbitrary assignments are allowed.
Note that while the DSCP/PCP protocol definitions use a higher value to indicate a higher priority, the device uses
a lower value to indicate a higher priority. As an example, for the values PCP = 000b and DSCP = 00000b (as
defined by their protocol definitions as lowest priority) most users will choose to assign the associated priority table
address location (SU.PTAA.PTAA[6:1]=000000b) a value of 11b, indicating the lowest possible priority. Similarly
for the values PCP = 111b and DSCP = 111111b, typically the associated Priority Table address will be assigned a
value of 00b. Example Priority Table configurations for a single port are shown in the tables below.

8.17 OAM support with Frame Trapping, Extraction, and Insertion
The device has the ability to insert and extract frames from/to the host microprocessor from both the WAN interface
and the LAN interface. There are four user-accessible FIFOs for this purpose: one for WAN insertion, one for WAN
extraction, one for LAN insertion, and one for LAN extraction. Each FIFO has the ability to issue an interrupt when
it is empty (Insertion FIFOs) or has a frame available (Extraction FIFOs). In order for frames to be extracted by the
host microprocessor, they must first be “trapped”. The device has two “traps” for capturing frames for extraction –
the LAN Trap and the WAN Trap. The maximum frame size that may be trapped or inserted is 2048 bytes.
The LAN Trap (when appropriately enabled) inspects each frame received on the Ethernet interface for its Ethernet
Destination Address (DA), VLAN tag, Q-in-Q tag, and Ethernet Type. These parameters help to determine what to
do with each frame. The LAN Trap is logically located between the Ethernet MAC and the circuitry that performs
forwarding to the WAN groups.
The WAN Trap (when appropriately enabled) inspects each frame received on the Serial interface for its Ethernet
Destination Address (DA), VLAN tag, Q-in-Q tag, Ethernet Type, or user-programmable header value. The WAN
Header Trap enables trapping on SLARP, GFP PTI/UPI, GFP CID or Shim Tag. The WAN trap is logically located
after the line decoding functions (bit/byte destuffing, descrambling), and the Decapsulator packet processing
circuitry.
Note that SPI “Burst mode” is not applicable for frame insertion or extraction, due to the indirect access of the
extract and insert queues.
There are 6 Ethernet Frame Formats supported for QoS and OAM Frame Extraction. The supported frame formats
are diagramed in Figure 8-16 and include:
      • DIX
      • VLAN tagged DIX
      • Q-in-Q tagged DIX
      • 802.3 LLC/SNAP
      • VLAN tagged 802.3 LLC/SNAP
      • Q-in-Q tagged 802.3 LLC/SNAP
The user is not required to specify or configure an Ethernet frame format because it is normal for LAN traffic to
simultaneously carry multiple different Ethernet formats.

8.17.1 Frame Trapping
Frames from the LAN interface can be trapped by VLAN ID, Ethernet Type, Broadcast Address, Management
Multicast Address (01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx), Destination Address, or a range of Destination Addresses. Frames from the
WAN interface can be trapped by VLAN ID, Ethernet Type, Broadcast Address, Management Multicast Address
(01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx), Destination Address, a range of destination addresses, or by a user-programmable header
comparison. LAN trapping is enabled in the SU.LPM register. WAN trapping is enabled in the SU.WEM register.
The LAN Trap can only be user configured to monitor one Ethernet port. The selection of LAN port to be monitored
is done with the SU.LPM.LEEP bit. The WAN Trap can only monitor for WAN Extract conditions on one (of the four
possible) Decapsulator (WAN Group) data streams. The selection of the WAN Group to monitor is done with
SU.WEM.WEDS[1:0]. The maximum frame size that may be trapped is 2Kbytes.
8.17.1.1LAN-VLAN Trapping
When trapping frames received on the LAN interface by VLAN ID, the user configures the VLAN IDs (VIDs) to be
trapped using the LAN-VLAN Table. Trapping is then enabled or disabled with the SU.LPM.LEVIT bit. See Section
8.16 for more information on VLAN configuration. Only one LAN Port can be allowed to forward frames to the LAN
Extract Queue (which of the two ports is determined by user configuration). If VLAN Forwarding is enabled, and the
4-bit value returned from the LAN-VLAN Table indicates “Extract”, but the port that the frame is associated with has
not been configured to forward to the LAN Extract queue, then the “Extract” status returned from the VLAN Table is
ignored. For more details on LAN-VLAN Table programming, see Section 8.16.2.
8.17.1.2LAN Ethernet Type Trapping
When trapping frames received on the LAN interface by Ethernet Type, the user can configure and 2-byte Ethernet
Type Field to be trapped in the SU.LEET register. Trapping is then enabled or disabled with the SU.LPM.LEETT
bit. Ethernet Type trapping enables the capture of ARP, BPDU, and other management traffic.
8.17.1.3LAN Ethernet Destination Address Trapping
When trapping frames received on the LAN interface by Unicast Destination Address, the user programs the
Destination Address for extraction into the SU.LEDAL, SU.LEDAM, and SU.LEDAH registers. By using a mask for
the lower two bytes of the DA in the SU.LEDAX register, all of the addresses within a range can be forwarded to
the LAN Extract queue. Trapping is then enabled or disabled with the SU.LPM.LEDAT bit.
When trapping frames received on the LAN interface by management multicast address (01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx), the
user simply enables extraction with the SU.LPM.LMGMTT bit. All trapped frames will be forwarded to the LAN
extract queue.
When trapping frames received on the LAN interface by broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), the user simply
enables extraction with the SU.LPM.LBAT bit. All trapped frames will be forwarded to the LAN extract queue.
8.17.1.4WAN Ethernet Destination Address Trapping
When trapping frames received on the WAN interface by Unicast Destination Address (DA), the user programs the
Destination Address for extraction into the SU.WEDAL, SU.WEDAM, and SU.WEDAH registers. By using a mask
for the lower two bytes of the DA in the SU.WEDAX register, all of the management addresses within a range can
be forwarded to the WAN Extract queue. Trapping is then enabled or disabled with the SU.WEM.WEDAT bit.
When trapping frames received on the WAN interface by management multicast address (01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx), the
user simply enables extraction with the SU.WEM.WMGMTT bit. All trapped frames will be forwarded to the WAN
extract queue.
When trapping frames received on the WAN interface by broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF), the user simply
enables extraction with the SU.WEM.WBAT bit. All trapped frames will be forwarded to the WAN extract queue.

8.17.1.5WAN-VLAN Trapping
When trapping frames received on the WAN interface by VLAN ID, the user configures the VLAN IDs (VIDs) to be
trapped using the WAN-VLAN Table. Trapping is then enabled or disabled with the SU.WEM.WEVIT bit. See
Section 8.16 for more information on VLAN configuration. Only one WAN Group Decapsulator can be allowed to
forward frames to the WAN Extract Queue at a time (determined by user configuration). If VLAN Trapping is
enabled, and the 4-bit value returned from the WAN-VLAN Table indicates “Extract”, but the port that the frame is
associated with has not been configured to forward to the WAN Extract queue, then the “Extract” status returned
from the WAN-VLAN Table is ignored. For more details on WAN-VLAN Table programming, see Section 8.16.2.
8.17.1.6WAN Ethernet Type Trapping
When trapping frames received on the WAN interface by Ethernet Type, the user can configure and 2-byte
Ethernet Type Field to be trapped in the SU.WEET register. Trapping is then enabled or disabled with the
SU.WEM.WEETT bit. The WAN Ethernet Type trap is valid only with frame formats in which the Ethernet Type
occurs in the first 32 bytes. Thus, the WAN Ethernet Type trap is not valid with the following frame types:
      •   4-byte Encapsulation Header with Q-in-Q & std VLAN & LLC/SNAP (HDLC or GFP-Null)
      •   8-byte Encapsulation Header with Q-in-Q & std VLAN & LLC/SNAP (HDLC or GFP-Linear)
      •   8-byte Encapsulation Header with std VLAN & LLC/SNAP (HDLC or GFP-Linear)
8.17.1.7WAN Header Trapping
Trapping can also be performed on any two consecutive bytes within the first 8 bytes of frames received from the
WAN interface. When trapping frames received on the WAN interface by header, the user configures a 2-byte
value to be trapped in the SU.WEHT register. The offset is configured in the SU.WEHTP register. Trapping is then
enabled or disabled with the SU.WEM.WEHT bit.
8.17.2 Frame Extraction and Frame Insertion
Extraction of trapped frames through the microport is done one byte at a time, with the beginning of the frame
being read first. The device must be configured to properly trap frames as described in Section 8.17.1. The user
may enable an interrupt to alert the host processor that a frame is available for extraction via the GL.MSIER3
interrupt enable register. A latched status register (GL.MLSR3) may also be used as indication that a frame is
available for extraction. When a trapped frame is available, the user must select the correct FIFO with the
GL.MCR1 register. The user must then read the length of the frame from GL.MSR1 or GL.MSR2 in order to know
how many bytes to extract. The user then reads one byte at a time from the FIFO read access register
(GL.MFARR) to extract the entire frame. When the entire frame has been read, the user indicates that the frame
may be discarded from the FIFO with the GL.MFAWR.RD_DN bit.
Steps for Frame Extraction:
1. Read the GL.MSR3 LAN/WAN FIFO Extraction Available Status bit to verify FIFO has a frame to be read.
2. Select the corresponding FIFO via GL.MCR1.
3. Read the size of frame in bytes from GL.MSR1 or GL.MSR2.
4. Read the frame from the GL.MFARR register one byte at a time.
5. Write a 0-to-1 transition to GL.MFAWR.RD_DN.
6. Repeat step 1.
Insertion of a frame through the host microport is done one byte at a time, with the beginning of the frame written
first. The user must first configure the LAN insertion settings and enable insertion via the SU.LIM register, or
configure the WAN insertion settings and enable insertion via the AR.MQC register. The correct FIFO must then be
selected with the GL.MCR1 register. The length of the frame to be inserted must then be written into GL.MCR2 or
GL.MCR3. The user proceeds to write one byte of the frame at a time to the FIFO access register, GL.MFAWR,
beginning with the first byte of the frame. Each write to this address automatically increments the pointer of the
selected FIFO. When the entire frame has been written, the GL.MFAWR.WR_DN bit is used to indicate that the
frame is ready for transmission.
Steps for Frame Insertion:
1. Configure the LAN insertion settings in the SU.LIM register, or WAN insertion settings in AR.MQC.
2. Read the GL.MSR3 LAN/WAN Queue Empty Status bit to verify FIFO is empty.
Rev: 063008                                                                                                 77 of 375

3. Select the appropriate FIFO for insertion via GL.MCR1.
4. Write the size of frame in bytes to GL.MCR3 for LAN insertion, GL.MCR2 for WAN insertion.
5. Write the frame to the GL.MFAWR.WPKT[0:7], one byte at a time.
6. Write a 0-to-1 transition to GL.MFAWR.WR_DN.
7. Repeat Step 1.
Frames loaded into the WAN Insertion FIFO should not include the GFP Length and cHEC fields. Inserted frames
should include all other applicable GFP/HDLC header information and a valid HECs. The header information on
inserted frames may be different than the header of normal traffic to allow for a number of management protocols
to be present on the link. The only modifications made by the device to data placed in the WAN Insertion queue are
the addition of the GFP Length/cHEC, the line coding functions of bit/byte stuffing, and X43+1 scrambling, if
enabled.
Frames loaded into the LAN Insertion FIFO should be complete and valid IEEE 802.3 or DIX Ethernet frames. If the
Ethernet MAC has been configured to add a FCS to all frames (SU.LIM.LP1CE or SU.LIM.LP2CE), the inserted
frame should not contain an Ethernet FCS. The frame loaded into the insertion FIFO should not contain a preamble
or start frame delimiter, as these will be automatically added by the MAC. Frames inserted to the LAN do not pass
through a Decapsulator.
8.17.2.1WAN Insert Forwarding
The WAN Insert Queue can be user assigned to be multiplexed with only one LAN Queue Group. The Group
Scheduler for the assigned LAN Queue Group multiplexes the WAN Insert data with the data from the LAN Queue
Group.
8.17.3 OAM by Ethernet Destination Address (DA)
The device can be configured to directly trap broadcast, management multicast (01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx), and unicast
frames by Ethernet Destination Addresses for extraction by a microprocessor. The host microprocessor can be
user-programmed for parsing, interpreting, and responding to OAM messages.
8.17.4 OAM by IP Address
When a node on the network first tries to send a management frame to the device, the transmitting node would
normally broadcast an ARP request for the unknown IP address, asking for the network to resolve the IP address
to a physical MAC address. The device is able to trap ARP request using the Broadcast address trap. The user
software should examine each ARP request, and when appropriate, insert a frame in response to the ARP request
that will associate the device's management MAC address with the desired IP address. The network then transmits
frames with the DA value of the physical MAC address in the ARP response. The device would then trap the follow-
on frames by MAC (DA) address.
8.17.5 OAM by VLAN Tag
The device can be configured to trap frames with any number of user-programmed VLAN IDs in the VLAN table.
The VLAN table is accessed indirectly through the SU.VTC, SU.VTAA, and SU.VTWD registers. The
SU.VTWD.LVDW bit is used to indicate a VLAN ID (VID) value is to be extracted if received on the LAN interface.
The SU.VTWD.WVQFW bit is used to indicate a VLAN ID (VID) value is to be extracted if received on the WAN
interface. Note that VLAN trapping must also be enabled with the SU.WEM or SU.LPM registers.
8.17.6 SNMP Support
The device can be configured to trap unicast frames for extraction by the microprocessor. The host microprocessor
can be user-programmed for parsing, interpreting, and responding to SNMP messages. Hardware counters are
provided for supporting portions of RFC2819 (RMON), and portions of RFC1213 (MIB-II). See Section 8.19.2 for
more information on the MAC Management counters used for this purpose.

8.18 Bridging and Filtering
The Automatic Learning and Filtering functions for Ethernet Bridging are only applicable in 10/100Mbps Ethernet
applications. The static DA filtering functions available in the MAC may be used for 1000Mbps applications as
described in Section 8.19.3. The high-level features of the Automatic Learning and Filtering functions are shown
below:
     • Supports up to two 10/100 Ethernet Ports
     • Self-learning filtering table is “shared” between the two LAN Ports (not 2 independent tables)
     • Supports a continuous stream of 64-byte frames on both ports
     • Automatically learns up to 4096 MAC Addresses
     • Provides automatic Address Aging
When enabled, the Automatic Bridge Filter monitors the LAN input data stream to build a Bridge Filter Table based
on Ethernet Source Addresses (SA). A SA learning function allows the device build a table of source addresses
and their associated interface. If the SA of a received frame is not found in the table, then the current SA is stored
in the Bridge Filter Table. The Bridge Filter Table is then used to determine whether to forward or drop each frame
as it is received. If the Destination Address (DA) of a received frame from the LAN is equal to the value of an SA
that is already stored in the Bridge Filter table, the frame is discarded. If no match is found, then the frame is
forwarded to the WAN Groups.
An aging function is used to determine when a SA entry has aged to the point that it is no longer useful. The user
configures an Aging Period in SU.BFC.BFAP[1-9] that defines how long an SA will be stored in the Bridge table.
After that time period, the entry is removed so that the position may used by another SA value. The Aging Period
can be user configured to any value from 1 second to 300 seconds in 1 second steps (300 seconds is the default
setting).
On devices with two Ethernet Ports, one Bridge Filter Table is shared by the 2 LAN Ports. An SA address that is
learned on LAN Port 1 is treated as though it was also learned on LAN Port 2. This has the effect that each frame
DA received on LAN Port 1 is tested against all SAs learned on LAN Port 1 and LAN Port 2 (the same is true for
frame DAs received on LAN Port 2). If a DA matches a stored SA from either port, the frame will be discarded.
If the LAN Trap determines that a frame matches one of the LAN Extract Trap conditions, the frame is forwarded to
the LAN Extract Queue, regardless of whether the Bridge Filter indicates that frame is to be discarded.
8.18.1 Bridge Filter Table Reset
The Bridge Filter Table Reset function is used to clear all of the Bridge Table entries. This function is automatically
triggered at power-up and can be manually triggered by the user by setting SU.BFC.BFTR to 1. During the Bridge
Filter Table Reset operation, traffic will be processed as normal. The user has the option of disabling the LAN Ports
so that there is no traffic during the Bridge Filter Table Reset process or allowing traffic to continue flowing at the
same time as the Bridge Filter Table Reset process. If the user does not disable traffic, then the table may learn
some new entries before the complete table has been reset. The Bridge Filter Table Reset function takes
approximately 64 ms to complete.

8.19 Ethernet MAC
Indirect addressing is required to access the Ethernet MAC registers. Writing to the Ethernet MAC registers
requires address and data information to be loaded into multiple registers, and the write operation initiated through
a control bit. Reading from the MAC registers requires address information to be loaded into two registers, the read
operation initiated through a control bit. After the read operation completes, data is read from four registers.
Algorithm for Indirect MAC Write Operation:
1) Read SU.MAC1RWC.MCS and verify that a read/write access is not in progress.
2) Write the address for the access into the SU.MAC1AWL and SU.MAC1AWH registers.
3) Write the data to be written into the SU.MAC1WD0-3 registers.
4) Write SU.MAC1RWC = 0x01.
5) Poll SU.MAC1RWC.MCS until the bit is clear, indicating that the write operation has completed.
Algorithm for Indirect MAC Read Operation:
1) Read SU.MAC1RWC.MCS and verify that a read/write access is not in progress.
2) Write the address for the access into the SU.MAC1RADH and SU.MAC1RADL registers.
3) Write SU.MAC1RWC = 0x03.
4) Poll SU.MAC1RWC.MCS until the bit is clear, indicating that the read operation has completed.
5) Read the data from SU.MAC1RD0-SU.MAC1RD3.
Note that only one operation can be initiated (read or write) at one time. Data cannot be written or read from the
MAC registers until the SU.MAC1RWC.MCS bit has been cleared by the device. The MAC Registers are listed in
the following table.
Rev: 063008                                                                                                   80 of 375

8.19.1 PHY MII Management Block and MDIO Interface
The MII Management Block allows for the host to control up to 32 PHYs, each with 32 registers. The MII block
communicates with the external PHY using 2-wire serial interface composed of MDC (serial clock) and MDIO for
data. The MDIO data is valid on the rising edge of the MDC clock. The Frame format for the MII Management
Interface is shown Figure 8-17. The read/write control of the MII Management is accomplished through the indirect
SU.GMIIA MII Management Address Register and data is passed through the indirect SU.GMIID Data Register.
These indirect registers are accessed through the MAC Control Registers defined in Table 8-14. The MDC clock is
internally generated and runs at 1.67MHz. Note that the device provides a single MII Management port, and all
control registers for this function are located in MAC 1.

8.19.3 Programmable Ethernet Destination Address Filtering
In addition to the automatic learning and filtering features described in Section 8.18, the Ethernet MAC has the
capability to filter frames by MAC Destination Address. This feature is available at all data rates. The user may
program up to 16 destination addresses that may be allowed or disallowed.
The following pseudo code is an example enabling static MAC address filter 0 to allow frames with a DA of
12:34:56:78:9A:BC to pass.
Perform an       indirect write to MACCR for a basic configuration:
   0x004A =      0x00 ; Point to MACCR
   0x004B =      0x00
   0x0046 =      0x0C
   0x0047 =      0x88
   0x0048 =      0x00
   0x0049 =      0x00
   0x004C =      0x01 ; issue write command
Configure MAC Filter #0 to a value of 12:34:56:78:9A:BC and enable it:
   0x004A = 0x40 ; Point to ADDR0H
   0x004B = 0x00
   0x0046 = 0x9A ; Note the byte order of 9A:BC.
   0x0047 = 0xBC
   0x0048 = 0x00
   0x0049 = 0x80
   0x004C = 0x01 ; issue write command
   0x004A = 0x44 ; Point to ADDR0L
   0x004B = 0x00
   0x0046 = 0x12 ; Note the byte order of 12:34:56:78
   0x0047 = 0x34
   0x0048 = 0x56
   0x0049 = 0x78
   0x004C = 0x01 ; issue write command
Configure the MAC         Filtering in MACFCR:
   0x004A = 0x04 ;        Point to MACFCR
   0x004B = 0x00
   0x0046 = 0x00 ;        0x01 will disable filtering
   0x0047 = 0x00
   0x0048 = 0x00
   0x0049 = 0x00 ;        0x80 will disable filtering
   0x004C = 0x01 ;        issue write command

8.20.1 Transmit Packet Processor (Encapsulator)
The data from each WAN Group is processed by the Transmit Packet Processor (or Encapsulator) before being
transmitted on the Serial interfaces. The Encapsulator performs bit reordering, FCS processing, frame error
insertion, stuffing, frame abort sequence insertion, inter-frame padding, VLAN tag insertion, MPLS tag insertion,
PPP Headers, LAPS Headers, octet removal, and frame scrambling. Each WAN Group’s encapsulation settings
can be independently configured with the PP.EMCR(1-4) registers.
The Encapsulator automatically inserts the inter-frame fill and flag characters based on the selection of
HDLC/cHDLC/LAPS or GFP in PP.EMCR.EPRTSEL. A Line Header Insertion function (in PP.ELHHR and
PP.ELHLR) allows the user to insert Address, Control, and Protocol bytes for HDLC/cHDLC/X.86, or Type and
tHEC bytes for GFP. The Tag 1 Insertion function (in PP.ET1DHR and PP.ET1DLR) allows the user to insert a 4-
byte MPLS tag immediately before the Destination Address (DA). The Tag 2 Insertion function (in PP.ET2DHR and
PP.ET2DLR) allows the user to insert a 4-byte VLAN tag immediately after the Source Address (SA). Any existing
VLAN tags are “pushed” lower in the frame.
HDLC processing can be disabled. Disabling HDLC processing disables FCS processing, frame error insertion,
stuffing, frame abort sequence insertion, and inter-frame fill/padding. Only bit reordering and frame scrambling are
not disabled.
Bit reordering changes the bit order of each byte. If bit reordering is disabled, the outgoing 8-bit data stream
DT[1:8] with DT[1] being the MSB and DT[8] being the LSB is output from the Transmit FIFO with the MSB in
TFD[7] (or 15, 23, or 31) and the LSB in TFD[0] (or 8, 16, or 24) of the transmit FIFO data TFD[7:0] 15:8, 23:16, or
31:24). If bit reordering is enabled, the outgoing 8-bit data stream DT[1:8] is output from the Transmit FIFO with the
MSB in TFD[0] and the LSB in TFD[7] of the transmit FIFO data TFD[7:0]. In bit synchronous mode, DT [1] is the
first bit transmitted. Bit reordering is configured using the PP.EMCR.TBRE bit. Note that bit reordering is not
available in the A1 device revision (GL.IDR.REVn=000).
FCS processing, when enabled in PP.EMCR(1-4), appends a calculated FCS to the frame. The polynomial used
for FCS-16 is x16 + x12 + x5 + 1. The polynomial used for FCS-32 is x32 + x26 + x23 + x22 + x16 + x12 + x11 + x10 + x8 +
x7 + x5 + x4 + x2 + x + 1. The FCS is inverted after calculation. If packet processing is disabled, FCS processing is
not performed.
Frame error insertion inserts errors into the GFP PLI, data unit, or FCS bytes. A single bit is corrupted in each
errored frame. The location of the corrupted bit is user-programmable. Error insertion is controlled by the PP.EEIR

In HDLC/cHDLC/LAPS(X.86) mode, the inter-frame fill is selectable per WAN group with PP.EMCR.EIIS. If packet
processing is disabled, inter-frame padding is not performed. The frame scrambler is a x43 + 1 scrambler that
scrambles the entire frame data stream. Frame scrambling is selectable per WAN group with PP.EMCR.ECFCRD.
To optimize WAN bandwidth in point-to-point applications, the Ethernet header information may be removed from
the datagram prior to encapsulation. The Encapsulator can be configured to remove either 14 or 18 bytes from
each incoming frame using the PP.EMCR.ERE[1:0] bits. Byte removal starts with the DA field. Removing 14 bytes
will remove the DA, SA, and Length/Type fields. Removing 18 bytes will remove the DA, SA, Length/Type, and
VLAN Tag fields. Once all packet processing has been completed, the serial data stream is forwarded.
Note that some devices in the product family have less than four encapsulators. The DS33X11 contains only
Encapsulator #1. The DS33W41 and DS33X42 contain only encapsulators #1 and #3.
8.20.2 Receive Packet Processor (Decapsulator)
The Receive Packet Processor accepts data from the Receive Serial Interface performs frame descrambling, frame
delineation, inter-frame fill filtering, frame abort detection, destuffing, frame size checking, FCS error monitoring,
FCS byte extraction, and bit reordering. Frame delineation determines the frame boundary by identifying a frame
start or end flag. Receive packet processing can be disabled. Disabling packet processing disables frame
delineation, inter-frame fill filtering, frame abort detection, destuffing, frame size checking, FCS error monitoring,
and FCS byte extraction. Only frame descrambling and bit reordering are not disabled. The frame descrambler is a
self-synchronizing x43 + 1 descrambler.
Inter-frame fill filtering removes the inter-frame fill between frames. When a frame end flag is detected, all data is
discarded until a frame start flag is detected. The inter-frame fill can be flags or all 1s. The number of 1s between
flags does not need to be an integer number of bytes, and if at least seven 1s are detected in the first 16 bits after a
flag, all data after the flag is discarded until a start flag is detected.
Frame abort detection searches for a frame abort sequence between the frame start flag and a frame end flag, if an
abort sequence is detected, the frame is marked with an abort indication, the aborted frame count is incremented,
and all subsequent data is discarded until a valid frame start flag is detected.
Destuffing removes the extra data inserted to prevent data from mimicking a HDLC/cHDLC/X.86 flag or an abort
sequence. A start flag is detected, destuffing is performed until an end flag is detected. The start and end flags are
discarded. In bit synchronous mode, bit destuffing is performed. Bit destuffing consists of discarding any '0' that
directly follows five contiguous 1s. After destuffing is completed, the serial bit stream is forwarded.
Frame size validation checks each frame for a programmable maximum size. As the frame data comes in, the total
number of bytes is counted. If the frame length is below the minimum size limit, the frame is marked with an
aborted indication, and the frame size violation count is incremented. If the frame length is above the maximum
size limit, the frame is marked with an aborted indication, the frame size violation count is incremented, and all
frame data is discarded until a frame start is received. The minimum and maximum lengths include the FCS bytes,
and are determined after destuffing has occurred.
FCS error monitoring checks the FCS and aborts errored frames. If an FCS error is detected, the FCS errored
frame count is incremented and the frame is marked with an aborted indication. If an FCS error is not detected, the
receive frame count is incremented. The FCS type (16-bit or 32-bit) is programmable.
FCS byte extraction discards the FCS bytes. If FCS extraction is enabled, the FCS bytes are extracted from the
frame and discarded. If FCS extraction is disabled, the FCS bytes are stored in the receive FIFO with the frame.
Bit reordering changes the bit order of each byte. Normally, the first bit of each byte in the received data stream is
assumed to be the MSB. If bit reordering is enabled, the first bit of each byte in is assumed to be the LSB. Once all
of the packet processing has been completed, the data stream is passed to the WAN Queues. Bit reordering is
configured using the PP.DMCR.RBRE bit. Note that bit reordering is not available in the A1 device revision
(GL.IDR.REVn=000).
The Decapsulator collects 2 statistics; the number of good frames and number of errored frames due any errors.
These statistics are latched bit counters and are cleared when read by the user.
The Decapsulator must be configured to remove the 4-byte encapsulation line header information if it is present.
The 4-byte removal function is selected using the PP.DMCR.DR1E control bit. When enabled, 4 bytes are removed
Rev: 063008                                                                                                 87 of 375

immediately after the cHEC bytes when in GFP mode or after the start flag when in HDLC mode. This bit should be
set to 1 for X.86, cHDLC and GFP transport. This bit should be equal to 0 for HDLC traffic with no headers.
The Decapsulator can be configured to remove a MPLS tag prior to forwarding to the LAN interface. The 4-byte
removal function used for this purpose is enabled using the PP.DMCR.DR2E control bit. When enabled, 4 bytes
are removed after the first remove (DR1E) function. Note that PP.DMCR.DR1E must be properly configured for this
function to operate correctly.
The Decapsulator can be configured to remove a VLAN tag prior to forwarding to the LAN interface. The 4-byte
removal function used for this purpose is enabled using the PP.DMCR.DR3E control bit. When enabled, 12 bytes
are skipped (Ethernet DA/SA) and the following 4 bytes are removed. This function is performed after the
Decapsulator Remove Function 1 and/or Decapsulator Remove Function 2 have been performed. When
Decapsulator Remove Functions 1 and 2 are disabled, 12 bytes are skipped from the beginning of the Ethernet
frame.
To optimize WAN bandwidth in point-to-point applications, Ethernet header information may be removed from the
datagram during WAN transport. The Decapsulator can be configured to replace the missing Ethernet header
information prior to forwarding to the LAN interface, by inserting a 14 or 18 byte values to each incoming frame.
This function is enabled using the PP.DMCR.DAE[1:0] control bits. When enabled, a 14-byte value from the
PP.DA1DR through PP.DA7DR registers or a 18-byte value from the PP.DA1DR through PP.DA9DR registers will
be inserted after the cHEC bytes in GFP mode, or after the HDLC header/flag when in HDLC mode. Once all
packet processing is performed by the Decapsulator, the Ethernet frames are forwarded to the MAC for
transmission on the LAN interface.
Note that some devices in the product family have less than four Decapsulators. The DS33X11 contains only
Decapsulator #1. The DS33W41 and DS33X42 contain only Decapsulators #1 and #3.

8.20.3 GFP-F Encapsulation and Decapsulation
The GFP-F protocol provides a method for encapsulating Ethernet Frames over point-to-point serial links. The
device expects a frame or multiframe synchronization signal to provide the byte boundary. This is provided by the
RSYNC and TSYNC pins. The receive functional timing is shown Figure 11-13. The transmit functional timing is
shown in Figure 11-9.
GFP-F Encapsulation is selected with the EPRTSEL register bit. However, there are two types of GFP-F: Null and
Linear Extension Mode. The device allows the selection of GFP Linear Extension through a user-configured “GFP
CRC Mode“ bit for each Encapsulator and Decapsulator (PP.EMCR.EGCM and PP.DMCR.DGCM). For each
mode, several additional register settings are required as outlined in the following sections.
In both GFP modes, the Line Header Insertion function (in PP.ELHHR and PP.ELHLR) must be programmed by
the user to insert the required GFP Type and tHEC fields. This structure, which is also known as the GFP Payload
Header, indicates the contents of the encapsulated payload. The Type field consists of sub fields that are used to
indicate the payload type (PTI), Payload FCS Indicator (PFI) Extension Header Identifier (EXI) and User Payload
Identifier (UPI).

The PTI field will normally be programmed to 000b for subscriber traffic. A PTI of 100b may be used for
management traffic in some applications. The PFI bit should match the user configured setting for pFCS in
PP.DMCR.DFCSAD and PP.EMCR.EFCSAD. A PFI value of 1 indicates that the payload includes a pFCS. The
EXI bits should equal 0000b for GFP Null, and 0001b for GFP Linear Extension. The UPI field should be configured
to match the type of traffic being transported. Possible UPI values are shown in the table below.

The final two bytes of the TYPE/tHEC field are used to perform header validation. The tHEC calculation is a CRC-
16 operation in which the two byte PLI is multiplied by X16 and divided (modulo 2) by the polynomial X16+X12+X5+1.
Another common representation for this polynomial is 0x1021. The initialization value for the operation is 0x0000.
The MSB of the PLI is bit 16, and the resulting remainder of the operation is the tHEC. To avoid requiring this
algorithm implementation in the user’s software, some common Type and the corresponding tHEC values are
provided in the table below.

When receiving either GFP Null or GFP Linear Extension frames from the WAN, the PP.DMCR.DR1E bit should be
set to 1 in order to remove the incoming GFP Type and tHEC bytes from the data stream.
The ITU-T G.8040 specification requires that when using GFP over a PDH link, the VCAT byte position must not be
used for payload information. The reservation or usage of the VCAT byte position is selected via the
VCAT.TCR3.TNVCGC bit.

8.20.3.1GFP-F NULL
When configured for GFP Null operation, no additional header information is required. The Encapsulator’s Tag 1
Insertion function (in PP.ET1DHR and PP.ET1DLR) is available to insert a 4-byte MPLS tag immediately before the
Ethernet Destination Address (DA), and the Tag 2 Insertion function (in PP.ET2DHR and PP.ET2DLR) is available
to insert a 4-byte VLAN tag immediately after the Source Address (SA). Any existing VLAN tags are “pushed” lower
in the frame. The resulting encapsulated frame format is shown below. Note that when enabled in this mode, the
pFCS calculation begins with the 9th byte of the frame.

8.20.3.2GFP-F Linear Extension
When configured for GFP Linear Extension mode, an additional header is required. The Encapsultor’s Tag 1
Insertion function (in PP.ET1DHR and PP.ET1DLR, enabled with PP.EMCR.ET1E) is used to insert the 4-byte
GFP Extension Header value. If receiving GFP Linear Extension frames from the WAN, the PP.DMCR.DR2E bit
should be set to 1 in order to remove the incoming GFP CID, Spare, and eHEC bytes from the data stream.

The final two bytes of the Linear Extension Header field are used to perform header validation. The eHEC
calculation is a CRC-16 operation in which the two byte CID (and Spare) value is multiplied by X16 and divided
(modulo 2) by the polynomial X16+X12+X5+1. Another common representation for this polynomial is 0x1021. The
initialization value for the operation is 0x0000. The MSB of the CID is bit 16, and the resulting remainder of the
operation is the eHEC. To avoid requiring this algorithm implementation in the user’s software, several example

8.20.4 X.86 Encoding and Decoding
X.86 protocol provides a method for encapsulating Ethernet Frame for eventual transport on a SONET or SDH
network. LAPS provides a byte-synchronous HDLC-like framing structure for encapsulation of Ethernet frames, but
is not as susceptible to dynamic bandwidth expansion as bit-stuffed HDLC. LAPS encapsulated frames can be
used to send data onto a SONET/SDH network. The device expects a byte synchronization signal to provide the
byte boundary for the X.86 receiver. This is provided by the RSYNC pin. The functional timing is shown Figure
11-13. The X.86 transmitter provides a byte boundary indicator with the signal TSYNC. The functional timing is
shown in Figure 11-9.
A Line Header Insertion function (in PP.ELHHR and PP.ELHLR) allows the user to insert Address, Control, and
SAPI bytes. The Tag 1 Insertion function (in PP.ET1DHR and PP.ET1DLR) allows the user to insert a 4-byte MPLS
tag immediately before the Destination Address (DA). The Tag 2 Insertion function (in PP.ET2DHR and
PP.ET2DLR) allows the user to insert a 4-byte VLAN tag immediately after the Source Address (SA). Any existing
VLAN tags are “pushed” lower in the frame.

The device will encode the MAC Frame with X.86 / LAPS encapsulation on a complete serial stream if configured
for X.86 mode in the register PP.EMCR. The device provides the following functions:
     • 32 bit FCS
     • X43+1 Scrambling/Descrambling
     • Transparency Processing
     • Rate Adaptation Removal.
Received frames are aborted if:
     • If 7d,7E is detected. This is an abort frame sequence in X.86
     • Invalid FCS is detected
     • The received frame has less than 6 octets
     • Control, SAPI and address field are mismatched to the programmed value
     • Octet 7D and octet other than 5D,5E,7E or DD is detected
When in X.86 mode, the device encapsulates frames with a Start Flag (7Eh), Address, Control and SAPI field,
followed by the frame and a 32-bit FCS. A X43+1 scrambler scrambles the data. Between the Start and Stop flags,
data bytes matching the start/abort flag is replaced with a 2-byte escape sequence. Figure 8-20 shows a frame
Encapsulated in a LAPS Frame. Options for MPLS and VLAN and Q-in-Q information bytes are user configured. In
the receive direction, rate adaptation octets are removed. In the transmit direction, idle code fill is used, and rate
adaptation is not performed. The Encapsulator performs transparency processing or octet stuffing to ensure that
the data does not mimic flags. For transparency processing, 7Eh is translated to 7D 5Eh and 7Dh is translated to
7D 5Dh. Byte stuffing consists of detecting bytes that mimic flag and escape sequence bytes (7Eh and 7Dh), and
replacing the mimic bytes with an escape sequence (7Dh) followed by the mimic byte exclusive 'OR'ed with 20h.

8.20.5 HDLC Encoding and Decoding
The HDLC protocol provides a simple method for encapsulating Ethernet Frames over point-to-point serial links.
HDLC Encapsulation can be bit or byte synchronous. In byte synchronous mode, byte stuffing is performed. Byte
stuffing consists of detecting bytes that mimic flag and escape sequence bytes (7Eh and 7Dh), and replacing them
with an escape sequence (7Dh) followed by the byte ‘exclusive-OR’ed’ with 20h. In Bit Synchronous HDLC, 5
consecutive ones must always be followed by a 0 to avoid mimicking a start or stop flag. Note that the 5
consecutive ones can straddle any 2 consecutive bytes. HDLC frame Encapsulation of the frame is shown in
Figure 8-21.
A Line Header Insertion function (in PP.ELHHR and PP.ELHLR) allows the user to insert Address, Control, and
Protocol bytes. The Tag 1 Insertion function (in PP.ET1DHR and PP.ET1DLR) allows the user to insert a 4-byte
MPLS tag immediately before the Destination Address (DA). The Tag 2 Insertion function (in PP.ET2DHR and
PP.ET2DLR) allows the user to insert a 4-byte VLAN tag immediately after the Source Address (SA). Any existing
VLAN tags are “pushed” lower in the frame.
The device provides the following HDLC functions.
     • Insertion of HDLC flags
     • Performs HDLC bit and byte stuffing
     • Insertion of Payload FCS (32 bit / 16 bit)
     • Selectable X43+1 scrambling
     • Selectable Idle: All Ones or Flag insertion
HDLC Receive Compatibility:
     •   HDLC with no line headers and encapsulated Ethernet Frames.
     •   HDLC with LAPS Headers.
     •   HDLC with Cisco HDLC Headers.
     •   HDLC Encapsulated Ethernet Frames with VLAN Tags .
     •   HDLC Encapsulated Ethernet Frames with MPLS Headers.
     •   Bit or Byte Synchronous Stuffed HDLC
     •   HDLC FCS lengths of 0, 16, or 32 bits.
     •   Interframe fill can be 7Eh or all 1s.
     •   X43+1 scrambled frame.

8.21 CIR/CBS Controller
The device provides a Committed Information Rate (CIR) / Committed Burst Rate (CBS) provisioning facility. The
CIR/CBS can be used to restrict the transport of received MAC data to a specific rate. The CIR will restrict the data
flow from the Receive MAC to Transmit Packet Processor. Policing parameters are user-defined in the SU.L1PP
and SU.L2PP registers. The data rate increments for CIR/CBS provision that are available to the user are based on
the operational data rate and are approximately: 64kbps from DC to 2Mbps, 2Mbps from 2Mbps to 64Mbps, and
16Mbps from 16Mbps to 416Mbps. The CIR function is based on a time-averaged value of bytes transmitted. When
the CIR is enabled, the average bytes per second of Ethernet traffic forwarded to the serial WAN interfaces is
limited to the configured CIR. The transmit CBS for all CIR settings is selectable using SU.L1PP.CBSS and
SU.L2PP.CBSS.
Some details regarding operation of the CIR are as follows:
     •   The maximum value of CIR cannot effectively exceed the aggregate serial transmit line rate.
     •   If the data rate received from the Ethernet interface is higher than the CIR, the device can be configured to
         invoke flow control or to discard frames to reduce the forwarded traffic rate.
     •   CIR function is only available for data received at the Ethernet Interface to be forwarded to WAN. There is
         not a CIR function for data arriving from the WAN to be sent to the Ethernet Interface.
The user provides the following configuration parameters:
Parameter          Configured settings           Description
                   Off                           Enables/Disables the CIR/CBS Policing function.
Policing           Policing Pause Enabled        Enables Pause flow control when CIR is exceeded.
                   Policing Discard Enabled      Enabled Discarding of frames when CIR is exceeded.

When interfacing to a Maxim T1/E1 transceiver as shown, the device should be programmed to invert the RCLK
input for each serial interface (LI.RCR1.RCLKINV = 1).
Because the first gapped transmit clock input edge after the transmit sync pulse is coincident with the start of the
first byte of user data, the transmit sync setup control bits must be configured for a sync pulse that arrives zero
clock cycles early ( LI.TCR.TS_SETUP[1:0] = 00).

10.      Device Registers
Eleven address bits are used address the register space. The register map is shown in Table 10-1. The
addressable range is 000h-7FFh. Register address locations are shared across the product family to preserve
software compatibility. The Serial Interface (Line) Registers are used to configure the serial port and the associated
transport protocol. The Ethernet Interface (Subscriber) registers are used to control and observe each of the
Ethernet ports. The registers associated with the MAC must be configured through indirect register write /read
access due to the architecture of the device.
When writing to a register input values for unused bits and registers (those designated with “–“) should be zero
unless specifically noted otherwise, as these bits and registers are reserved. When a register is read from, the
values of the unused bits and registers should be ignored. A latched status bit is set when an event happens and is
cleared when read.
Note that although most registers are defined as 16-bit registers, the constituent bytes are accessed through the
parallel or SPI interfaces one byte at a time. Individual address locations are defined for each byte. The register
details are provided in the following tables.

This bit setting is only applicable to MII and RMII modes.
Bits 0-2: Forwarding Mode Control (FMC[2:0])
000 = Reserved
         001 = Forwarding mode 1. Single Ethernet Port with Priority Forwarding. In this mode, Ethernet frames
                 are segregated into up to four priority levels and forwarded to separate WAN data streams.
         010 = Forwarding mode 2. Per-Ethernet-Port Forwarding with Priority Scheduling. In this mode, frames
                 from each Ethernet port are forwarded to their own group of four priority queues, generating two
                 separate WAN data streams with priority scheduled traffic.
         011 = Forwarding mode 3. Single Ethernet Port with VLAN Forwarding and Priority Scheduling. In this
                 mode, Ethernet frames are forwarded by VLAN tag (VID) into up to four groups of four priority
                 queues (WAN Groups) each. Each WAN Group forms a separate WAN data stream with priority
                 scheduled traffic.
         100 = Forwarding mode 4. Per-Ethernet-Port Forwarding, with VLAN Forwarding and Priority
                 Scheduling within each VLAN group. In this mode, Ethernet frames from each Ethernet port are
                 forwarded separately, by VLAN tag, into two sets of four priority queues (WAN Groups) each. The
                 two WAN Groups form separate WAN data streams with priority scheduled traffic.
         101 = Forwarding mode 5. Full VLAN Forwarding in both the LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN
                 directions. In this mode, Ethernet frames from both ports can be forwarded by VLAN tag to two
                 shared WAN groups. Within each WAN group, there are two sets of four priority queues. The two
                 sets of priority queues are serviced with a round-robin algorithm. Frames received from the WAN
                 side can be forwarded by VLAN tag to either Ethernet port. The LAN-to-WAN and WAN-to-LAN
                 mappings are independent and can be configured separately.
         110 = Reserved.
         111 = Reserved.
In all forwarding modes, VCAT/LCAS can be used to aggregate multiple physical serial ports for each WAN
Group’s data stream, except on devices that do not support VCAT/LCAS.

Bit 3: Interrupt Mode (INTM) When this bit is set to 1, the inactive state of the INT pin will be high-impedance.
When this bit is equal to 0, the inactive state of the INT pin will be a driven logic high.
Bit 2: Encap/Decap Loopback (ENDEL) When this bit is set to 1, the WAN-side output data from Encapsulator #1
is looped back to the WAN input of Decapsulator #1.
Bit 0: Global Reset (RST) When this bit is set, all of the internal data path, status, and control registers (except the
RST bit), on all ports, will be reset to the default state. This bit must remain set to 1 for a minimum of 100ns to
initiate the reset operation. The bit should be cleared to 0 for normal operation to resume. Note that setting this bit
does not tri-state output pins. When using a revision A1 (GL.IDR.REVn=000) device in SPI mode, the individual
block reset bits or the hardware reset pin should be used instead of this bit.

Bit 9: Read Byte (RD_DN) A zero-to-one transition is required after the last byte of the frame has been read from
the MFAWR Register. This signals the associated FIFO (WAN Extract or LAN Extract) to reset its pointers.
Bit 8: Write Byte (WR_DN) A zero-to-one transition is required after the last byte of the frame has been written to
MFAWR Register. This transition signals that the frame is ready to be transferred.
Bits 0-7: Packet Write Byte (WPKT[7:0]) If an Insertion FIFO is selected, this register inserts a byte of frame data
into the FIFO selected by MCR2. The beginning of the frame to be transmitted is written first. Each write
automatically increments the FIFO pointer. If an Extraction FIFO is selected, this register reports a byte of frame
data from the FIFO selected by MCR2. The beginning of the frame to be transmitted is read first. Each read
automatically increments the FIFO pointer.

Bit 1: MAC Command RW – If this bit is written to 1, a read is performed from the MAC. If this bit is written to 0, a
write operation is performed. Address information for write operations must be located in SU.MAC1AWH and
SU.MAC1AWL. Address information for read operations must be located in SU.MAC1RADH and SU.MAC1RADL.
The user must also write a 1 to the MCS bit, and the device will clear MCS when the operation is complete.
Bit 0: MAC Command Status – Setting MCS in conjunction with MCRW will initiate a read or write to the MAC
registers. Upon completion of the read or write this bit is cleared. Once a read or write command has been initiated
the host must poll this bit to see when the operation is complete.

SU.MAC1AWL. Address information for read operations must be located in SU.MAC1RADH and SU.MAC1RADL.
The user must also write a 1 to the MCS bit, and the device will clear MCS when the operation is complete.
Bit 0: MAC Command Status – Setting MCS in conjunction with MCRW will initiate a read or write to the MAC
registers. Upon completion of the read or write this bit is cleared. Once a read or write command has been initiated
the host must poll this bit to see when the operation is complete.

This register is used to control the VLAN Table. The Initialization function resets all of the 4096 entries in the VLAN
Table to their default value.
Bit 2: Control Table Enable (CTE) When equal to zero, the VLAN Table is fully enabled. When set to 1, the VLAN
Table is only enabled as required by the LAN Extract (LAN-VLAN Trap), WAN Extract (WAN-VLAN Trap), or
microprocessor operations.
Bit 1: Control Initialization (CI). A transition from zero to one starts the VLAN Table initialization by resetting all
VLAN table addresses to their default values. A device reset will also trigger a VLAN Table initialization.
Bit 0: Control Auto Increment Mode (CAIM). When set to 1, the VLAN Table Address in SU.VTAA is
automatically incremented with each read or write of the SU.VTWD or SU.VTRD registers.

Whenever a write is performed to this configuration register address the data is stored in the VLAN Table at the
address specified by the SU.VTAA register (i.e. the VTAA value must be provided in advance of the VTWD data).
VLAN Forwarding, Extracting (Trapping), or Discarding. Each address (SU.VTAA) in the VLAN table
corresponds to a specific VLAN ID (VID) value from 0 to 4095, and the bit settings at each address relate to
actions taken when a frame containing the corresponding VLAN ID value is detected. These values are used to
translate VLAN tag information from each received frame into forwarding, trapping (frame extraction), or discarding
decisions. The user may configure any or all of the 4096 VLAN IDs values in the VLAN table. The data written to
this register is stored in the VLAN Table at the specified VLAN Table Address.

         0 = Forward frames received from the WAN with this VID value to Ethernet Port 1
         1 = Forward frames received from the WAN with this VID value to Ethernet Port 2
Bit 3: LAN-VLAN Discard (LVDW)
         0 = Do nothing.
         1 = Discard frames received from the LAN with this VID
Bit 2: LAN-VLAN Extract Forwarding (LAN-VLAN Trap) (LVEFW)
         0 = Do not forward this frame to the LAN Extract Queue
         1 = Forward this frame to the LAN Extract Queue
Bits 0-1: LAN-VLAN Queue Forwarding (LVQFW [2:1])
         00 = Forward frames with a VID value equal to this table address to LAN Queue Group 1

Bit 12: VLAN Table Initialization Status (VTIS): This bit is set to 1 when the VLAN Table initialization has been
completed. Occurs upon reset.
Bits 0-11: VLAN Table Shadow Address (VTSA [12:1]) This register interfaces directly to the VLAN Table
memory block to provide the selected VLAN Table Address that is to be used for each VLAN Table operation (LAN
Trap, WAN Trap or uP Read/Write). When SU.VTC.CAIM = 1, the Shadow Address automatically increments for
each Read and/or Write VLAN Table Access.

10.3 Ethernet Interface Registers
The Ethernet Interface registers are used to configure GMII/MII/RMII bus operation and establish the MAC
parameters as required by the user. The MAC Registers cannot be addressed directly from the Processor port. The
registers below are used to perform indirect read or write operations to the MAC registers. The MAC Status
Registers are shown in Table 10-3. Accessing the MAC Registers is described in Section 8.19.

WAN Extract Modes. This register determines which set of WAN Trap modes have been enabled. The WAN Trap
modes can be unrelated to the LAN Trap modes in the opposite direction. Any combination of these Traps can be
enabled. If any enabled Trap Modes overlap so that the WAN Trap indicates that a frame should be forwarded to
an Ethernet Port and to the WAN Extract, the frame is to be only forwarded to the WAN Extract (e.g. the user might
have configured the WAN Trap to forward the frame’s VLAN ID to Ethernet Port 1, but the frame’s DA might also
indicate that the frame is to be sent to the WAN Extract). WAN VLAN/Q-in-Q Forwarding is enabled through the
Forwarding Mode (not through these registers). The default setting is all Modes disabled.
Bit 9: WAN Extract Management Address Trap (WMGMTT)
         0 = WAN Extract Management Address Trap is disabled.
         1 = WAN Extract Management Address Trap is enabled. All Ethernet frames with an Ethernet Destination
         Address (DA) = 01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx, where “x” is “don’t care,” are forwarded to the WAN extract queue.
Bit 8: WAN Extract Broadcast Address Trap (WBAT)
         0 = WAN Extract Broadcast Address Trap is disabled.
         1 = WAN Extract Broadcast Address Trap is enabled. All Ethernet frames with an Ethernet Destination
         Address (DA) = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF are forwarded to the WAN extract queue.
Bit 7: WAN “No VLAN/Q-in-Q” Detected Forwarding (WNVDF).
         0 = When the 13th and 14th bytes in the frame do not equate to the value in WETPID, then the frame is to be
         forwarded to Ethernet Interface 1.
         1 = When the 13th and 14th bytes in the frame do not equate to the value in WETPID, then the frame is to be
         forwarded to Ethernet Interface 2.
To configure the X162 for VLAN or Q-in-Q, WAN to LAN forwarding, the Forwarding Mode must be set to 5, and
the WETPID register must be configured (or use the configuration register default values).
Bit 6: WAN Extract FIFO Reset (WEFR)
         0 = Normal – no reset.
         1 = One-time, momentary reset of the WAN Extract FIFO.

Bits 4-5: WAN Extract Decap Source (WEDS[2:1])
        00 = WAN Extract is to be performed on the data stream from Decapsulator 1 (WAN Group 1).
        01 = WAN Extract is to be performed on the data stream from Decapsulator 2 (WAN Group 2).
        10 = WAN Extract is to be performed on the data stream from Decapsulator 3 (WAN Group 3).
        11 = WAN Extract is to be performed on the data stream from Decapsulator 4 (WAN Group 4).
Note that not all decapsulators are available in all Forwarding Modes. The user should consult the forwarding
diagrams in Section 8.9.1 for the available decapsulators for the configured Forwarding Mode.
Bit 3: WAN Extract VLAN ID Trap (WEVIT)
        0 = WAN Extract VLAN ID Trap is disabled.
        1 = WAN Extract VLAN ID Trap is enabled. (See Section 8.16.2 for VLAN table programming details.)
Note: Invalid if the WAN Extract Decapsulator (selected by WEDS) has been configured to add an Ethernet Header
(in PP.DMCR.DAE[1:0]). Adding an Ethernet header implies that there is no VLAN ID to Trap.
Bit 2: WAN Extract Ethernet Type Trap (WEETT)
        0 = WAN Extract Ethernet Type Trap is disabled.
        1 = WAN Extract Ethernet Type Trap is enabled.
Note: Invalid if the WAN Extract Decapsulator (selected by WEDS) has been configured to add an Ethernet Header
(in PP.DMCR.DAE[1:0]). Adding an Ethernet header implies that there is no Ethernet Type field to Trap. Note that
WAN Extract Ethernet Type trapping is not available for frame formats in which the Ethernet Type field is more than
32 bytes into the frame. Thus, Ethernet Type trapping is not applicable on WAN frames in the LLC/SNAP frame
format with 4/8 byte frame headers plus dual VLAN Tags.
Bit 1: WAN Extract Destination Address Trap (WEDAT)
        0 = WAN Extract Destination Address Trap is disabled.
        1 = WAN Extract Destination Address Trap is enabled.
Note: Invalid if the WAN Extract Decapsulator (selected by WEDS) has been configured to add an Ethernet Header
(in PP.DMCR.DAE[1:0]). Adding an Ethernet header implies that there is no Ethernet DA to Trap.
Bit 0: WAN Extract Header Trap (WEHT)
        0 = WAN Extract Header Trap is disabled.
        1 = WAN Extract Header Trap is enabled.

Bits 0-7: WAN Extract Destination Address Mask (WEDAX [8:1]) This value provides a Mask for the Least
Significant byte of the WAN Extract Destination Address (bits 0 - 7 of WEDA0). This mask allows the device to Trap
on multiple DAs (e.g. Bridge Group Address 01-80-C2-00-00-00, Slow Protocols 01-80-C2-00-00-01 and Bridge
Management 01-80-C2-00-00-10). The default setting is all bit positions = 0.
         0 = bit mask disabled.
         1 = bit mask enabled (this bit of the WAN Extract Destination Address is “don’t care”).

Bits 0-15: WAN Extract Ethernet Type (WEET [16:1]). This value defines the 2-byte Ethernet Protocol Type
that the WAN Trap is to monitor for. Bits 0 to 7 are used to define the least significant byte. One example setting is
08-06 (hex) for Ethernet Type = ARP. Note that WAN Extract Ethernet Type trapping is not available for frame
formats in which the Ethernet Type field is more than 32 bytes into the frame. Thus, Ethernet Type trapping is not
applicable on WAN frames in the LLC/SNAP frame format with 4/8 byte frame headers plus dual VLAN Tags.

Bit 11: LAN Port #2 - SRAM Queue Reset (LP2R)
         0 = Normal operation.
         1 = One-time, momentary reset of all SRAM Queue pointers associated with LAN Transmit Port 2.
Bit 10: LAN Port #1 - SRAM Queue Reset (LP1R)
         0 = Normal operation.
         1 = One-time, momentary reset of all SRAM Queue pointers associated with LAN Transmit Port 1.
To insure proper reset function, the associated MAC Transmit must be disabled before a reset. This must be done
to ensure that the Transmit MAC is not in the middle of transmitting a frame when the queue is reset. Activating
LP1R does not affect traffic on Port 2 and activating LP2R does not affect traffic on Port 1.
Bit 9: LAN Port 2 CRC Enable (LP2CE)
         0 = The transmit MAC will not add an Ethernet FCS (CRC) to frames before transmission.
         1 = The transmit MAC adds an Ethernet FCS (CRC) to all frames before transmission.
Bit 8: LAN Port 1 CRC Enable (LP1CE)
         0 = The transmit MAC will not add an Ethernet FCS (CRC) to frames before transmission.
         1 = The transmit MAC adds an Ethernet FCS (CRC) to all frames before transmission.
Bit 4: LAN Insert FIFO Reset (LIFR)
         0 = Normal – no reset.
         1 = One-time, momentary reset of the LAN Insert FIFO.
Bit 2-3: LAN Insert Insertion Point (LIIP[2:1])
         00 = LAN Insert data is multiplexed with data from Decapsulator #1.
         01 = LAN Insert data is multiplexed with data from Decapsulator #2.
         10 = LAN Insert data is multiplexed with data from Decapsulator #3.
         11 = LAN Insert data is multiplexed with data from Decapsulator #4.
If the LAN Insert is assigned to a Decapsulator that is not enabled (because of the Forwarding mode setting or
because there are no enabled WAN ports associated with that Decapsulator) then the LAN Insert has exclusive
use of that LAN Transmit Queue. For MPL > 2048, if the LAN Insert is enabled (LIE = 1), LIIP must equal 00. In
Forwarding Modes 2 and 5, only LIIP = 00 and 10 are valid. In all other cases, the recommended value is LIIP = 01
for insertion to LAN Port 1, or LIIP = 10 for insertion to LAN Port 2.
Bit 1: LAN Insert Priority (LIP)
         0 = LAN Insert frames are lower priority than frames from the associated Decapsulator.
         1 = LAN Insert frames are higher priority than frames from the associated Decapsulator.
Bit 0: LAN Insert Enable (LIE)
         0 = LAN Insertion is disabled.
         1 = LAN Insertion is enabled.

This register determines which set of LAN Trap modes have been enabled and whether the device is being used in
a single or dual LAN Port application. The LAN Trap modes can be unrelated to the WAN Trap modes in the
opposite direction. Any combination of these Traps can be enabled. If any enabled Trap Modes overlap so that the
LAN Trap indicates that a frame should be forwarded to a LAN Queue and to the LAN Extract, the frame is to be
only forwarded to the LAN Extract (e.g. the user might have configured the LAN Trap to forward the frame’s VLAN
ID to LAN Queue 1, but the frame’s DA might also indicate that the frame is to be sent to the LAN Extract). LAN
VLAN/Q-in-Q Forwarding is enabled through the device’s Forwarding Mode (Common Control Registers; not
through these registers).
Bit 9: LAN Extract Management Address Trap (LMGMTT)
        0 = LAN Extract Management Address Trap is disabled
        1 = LAN Extract Management Address Trap is enabled. All Ethernet frames with an Ethernet Destination
        Address (DA) = 01:80:C2:xx:xx:xx, where “x” is “don’t care”, are forwarded to the LAN extract queue.
Bit 8: LAN Extract Broadcast Address Trap (LBAT)
        0 = LAN Extract Broadcast Address Trap is disabled
        1 = LAN Extract Broadcast Address Trap is enabled. All Ethernet frames with an Ethernet Destination
        Address (DA) = FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF are forwarded to the LAN extract queue.
Bit 4: LAN Extract LAN Port Source (LEEPS)
        0 = LAN Extract is to be performed on the data stream from LAN Port 1.
        1 = LAN Extract is to be performed on the data stream from LAN Port 2. This option is only valid on
        devices that contain two Ethernet Ports, in Forwarding Modes 2, 4, and 5.
Bit 3: LAN Extract VLAN ID Trap (LEVIT)
        0 = LAN Extract VLAN ID Trap is disabled
        1 = LAN Extract VLAN ID Trap is enabled (See Section 8.16.2 for VLAN table programming details.)
Bit 2: LAN Extract Ethernet Type Trap (LEETT)
        0 = LAN Extract Ethernet Type Trap is disabled
        1 = LAN Extract Ethernet Type Trap is enabled
Bit 1: LAN Extract Destination Address Trap (LEDAT)
        0 = LAN Extract Destination Address Trap is disabled
        1 = LAN Extract Destination Address Trap is enabled
Bit 0: LAN Port Mode (LPM).
        0 = Single Port Applications using Port 1 (required for GbE applications)
        1 = Dual Port Applications (GbE GMII operation not allowed)

The L2PE = 1 (Enabled) is only valid when LPM = 1 (Dual Port) and when in Forwarding Modes 2, 4, or 5.
Otherwise, the device should be configured to L2PE =0 (Disabled).
When LAN Port 2 Priority Forwarding or Priority Scheduling has been enabled, the user must also configure the
Priority Table and No Priority Detected registers.
When LAN Port 2 Ethernet Tag Forwarding has been enabled, the user must also configure the Ethernet Tag Table
and No Ethernet Tag Detected registers.

Bits 0-13: Maximum Packet Length (MPL [14:1]) Maximum frame length, in bytes. The receive MAC discards
Ethernet frame received from the LAN interface that have a frame length greater than the user configured MPL
value. This value is applied to both Ethernet ports. If the device has been configured to discard the Ethernet FCS
then the byte count up to the FCS is used. If the FCS is retained, then the count includes 4 bytes for the FCS. The
maximum valid value for this register is 10240 bytes. Note that frames between 9018 and 10240 bytes may be
counted as “giant frames” by the MAC.

LAN 2 Policing Parameters. This register determines the Policing function setting for Ethernet port 2. The Policing
function is used to control the rate at which frames are forwarded to Serial Interfaces. The Policing function can be
configured to send Explicit Back Pressure Flow Control to the Ethernet Sending equipment (Ethernet Pause
Control) or can be used to enable a frame discarding mechanism that restrict the rate at which frame are accepted.
Bit 15: Committed Burst Size Selection (CBSS) This bit function is not available in device revision A1
(GL.IDR.REVn=000).
         0 = Default condition. CBS is 4096 bytes.
         1 = CBS is 12288 bytes. Only valid in Policing Discard mode.
Bits 10-11: LAN 2 Policing Mode (L2PM[2:1])
         00 = Policing Disabled
         01 = Policing Pause Enabled
         10 = Policing Discard Enabled
         11 = Reserved
Bits 8-9: LAN 2 Policing Credit Range (L2PCR[2:1])
         00 = Low Credit Range for CIR = 64kbps to 2Mbps
         01 = Mid Credit Range for CIR = 2Mbps to 16Mbps
         10 = High Credit Range for CIR = 16Mbps to 416Mbps
         11 = Reserved
Bits 0-7: LAN 2 Policing Credit Threshold (L2PCT[8:1]). This register specifies the Credit Threshold setting of
the Policing function. Only values between 8 to 255 are supported.

Priority Table Control This register is used to initialize and specify the operating mode of the Priority Table. The
Initialization function causes each entry of the Priority Table to be populated with the Priority Table Write Data
default value. The configuration of this table is similar to that of the VLAN Table. However, although this table
provides an automated self-init at power-up, it does not allow the user to request a new initialization ”at will”.
Bit 1: Priority Table Enable (PTE) When equal to zero, the Priority Table is enabled. When set to 1, the Priority
Table does not affect the forwarding of frames.
Bit 0: Priority Table Auto Increment Mode (PTAIM) When set, the Priority Table Address in SU.PTAA is
automatically with each read or write of the SU.PTWD or SU.PTRD registers.

Bit 6: Priority Table Port Access Address (PTPAA). This bit is an extension of the PTAA[6:1] bits, but is used to
divide between Priority lookups for Ethernet (LAN) Port 1 (PTPAA = 0) and Ethernet (LAN) Port 2 (PTPAA = 1). Not
valid for devices with only one Ethernet port.
Bits 0-5: Priority Table Access Address (PTAA [6:1]). These bits provide the Priority Table Address for a uP
Read or Write operation. The address into the priority table is used to resolve VLAN 802.1p PCP and DSCP to the
four priority levels. When using PCP priority mode, only addresses PTAA[3:1] are used. The priority mode for each
Ethernet port can be independently selected using the SU.LP1C and SU.LP2C registers.

Bits 0-12: LAN Queue Watermark [LQW 13-1] This register specifies the Watermark Threshold that is used to
trigger a LAN Pause control frame. One value is used for all 16 queues (each queue is independently enabled and
tested). The value from this register is multiplied by 64 to determine the minimum number of bytes available in each
DDR SDRAM LAN Queue after Flow Control (or LAN Queue Watermark Interrupt) is triggered. The maximum valid
value is decimal 8191, which designates that a minimum of 8191 x 64 bytes = 524,224 bytes can be stored after
the watermark is reached. The lowest valid setting is decimal 3, or a minimum of 192 bytes available when flow
control is triggered.
The purpose of the LQW setting is to prevent data loss due to queue overflow. The LQW setting is independent of
the CIR Policing function that monitors the rate at which data is received irrespective of the fill level of the queue.
For applications with maximum packet Length < 2049 and with a short Ethernet PHY transmission distance (< 25
meters) it is recommended that the LQW be set to a minimum value of 57.
For applications that include a long Ethernet PHY transmission distance the LQW setting can be increased. For
GbE applications the LQW value can be increased by 1 for each additional 88 meters (up to LQW = 8191 or
715km). For 100Mbps each incremental step will support 880 meters (at 100Mbps there is less/slower data on the
transmission line). For 10Mbps each incremental step will support 8,800 meters. It is recommended that the user
verify the LQW setting in long Ethernet transmission line applications.

Bits 0-15: WAN Queue Near Full Status (WQNFS[16-1]) This register indicates whether an impending overflow
condition has occurred on a WAN Queue, and the device initiated the discarding of incoming frames on a WAN
interface. This condition can occur if the transmit LAN interface is disabled, if the MAC has received excessive
pause flow control frames and completely filled the buffers for the transmit LAN while responding to the pause
requests, or if operating in half duplex mode with heavy LAN network congestion. This register is cleared each time
it is read.
          0 = Normal operation
          1 = At least one “Near Full” condition detected since last read, frames may have been discarded.

Bit 15: Encapsulator GFP CRC Mode(EGCM)
          0= GFP Null. Encapsulator pFCS calculation begins with the 9th byte after the start of the frame.
          1= GFP Linear. Encapsulator pFCS calculation begins with the 13th byte after the start of the frame.
Bit 14: Encapsulator Protocol Selection (EPRTSEL)
          0= GFP
          1= HDLC/cHDLC/LAPS(X.86)
Bit 13: Encapsulator Frame Check Sequence Append Disable (EFCSAD) When set to 1, frames will not have a
HDLC/GFP FCS appended prior to transmission. When equal to 0, the encapsulation FCS will be appended.
Bit 12: Encapsulator Scrambler Disable (ECFCRD) When set to 1, encapsulation X43+1 scrambling is disabled.
Bit 11: Encapsulator 16-bit FCS Enable (EFCS16EN) – When set to 1, the HDLC Encapsulation uses a 16-bit
FCS. When equal to 0, a 32 bit FCS is appended. This bit only applies when EFCSAD = 0.
Bit 9: Encapsulator Ethernet FCS Bypass (EFCSB) When set to 1, the Ethernet FCS is forwarded exactly as
received. When equal to 0, the Ethernet FCS is removed prior to encapsulation.
Bit 8: Encapsulator Bit Byte Synchronous (EBBYS) When set to 1, the Encapsulator performs Byte Stuffing.
When equal to 0, the Encapsulator performs Bit Stuffing. When in GFP mode (EPRTSEL = 0), this bit should be set
to 1. Bit-stuffed HDLC is not valid for multi-member VCGs.
Bit 7: Encapsulator Interframe Idle Selection (EIIS) When set to 1, the Encapsulator Idle sequence is 0xFF.
When equal to 0, the Encapsulator Idle sequence is 0x7E. This bit only applies when EPRTSEL = 1.
Bit 6: Encapsulator Line Header Enable (ELHDE) When set to 1, the Encapsulator will insert the values in
PP.ELHHR and PP.ELHLR as a 4-byte Line Header. The header is appended after the PLI+CHEC field in GFP
mode, and after the start flag in HDLC mode.
Bit 5: Encapsulator Tag 1 Enable (ET1E) When set to 1, the Encapsulator will insert the values in PP.ET1DHR
and PP.ET1DLR as a 4-byte tag immediately before the DA field.
Bit 4: Encapsulator Tag 2 Enable (ET2E) When set to 1, the Encapsulator will insert the values in PP.ET2DHR
and PP.ET2DLR as a 4-byte tag immediately after the SA field.
Bits 2-3: Encapsulator Remove Enable (ERE[1:0])
          00 = Normal operation.
          01 = 18 bytes are removed from the frame prior to encapsulation, starting with the DA field.
          10 = 14 bytes are removed from the frame prior to encapsulation, starting with the DA field.
          11 = Reserved.
Bit 1: Transmit Bit Reorder (TBRE) Controls the endian order of HDLC transmission. This bit function is not
available in device revision A1 (GL.IDR.REVn=000).

         0 = HDLC payload will be transmitted MSB-first. Default operation.
         1 = HDLC payload will be transmitted LSB-first.
Bit 0: Encapsulator HDLC CRC Bit Reorder (EHCBO) Controls the endian order of the HDLC CRC calculation.
This bit function is not available in device revision A1 (GL.IDR.REVn=000).
         0 = HDLC CRC will be calculated MSB-first. Default operation.
         1 = HDLC CRC will be calculated LSB-first.

Bit 15: Encapsulator PLI Error Insert Enable (EPLIEIE) When set to 1, a single-bit error insertion is enabled for
the PLI field. This includes the 2 PLI Header bits and the corresponding CHEC.
Bit 14: Encapsulator Data Error Insert Enable (EDEIE) When set to 1, a single-bit error insertion is enabled for
the data field. Errors can only be inserted in the first byte of the payload data. Hence the EBD bit setting has no
effect for inserting payload errors.
Bit 13: Encapsulator Ethernet FCS Error Insert Enable (EFCSEIE) When set to 1, a single-bit error insertion is
enabled for the Ethernet FCS field.
Bit 12: Encapsulator FCS Error Insert Enable (EPLIEIE) When set to 1, a single-bit error insertion is enabled for
the encapsulation FCS field.
Bits 10-11: Encapsulator Byte Decode (EBD[1:0]) These bits determine which of the 4 bytes need error insertion
for the PLI, Ethernet FCS, and Encapsulation FCS fields. These bits have no effect on data error insertion.
Bits 2-9: Encapsulator Error Insert (EIE[7:0]) These 8 bits determine the bit location of the error insertion in the
selected field. Only one error is inserted for each transition of ESEI.
Bit 1: Encapsulator Single Error Insert (ESEI) Changing this bit from a 0 to a 1 causes a single error insertion.
For a second error insertion, the user must first clear this bit.

Bit 15: Decapsulator GFP CRC Mode (DGCM)
          0=GFP Null. Decapsulator does not verify the eHEC value.
          1=GFP Linear. Decapsulator verifies the eHEC value and discards failing frames.
Bit 14: Decapsulator Protocol Selection (DPRTSEL)
Selects between GFP and HDLC based forms of encapsulation. Additionally, when transitioning HDLC between
byte and bit modes of operation, this byte is used to reset the HDLC circuitry. In order to initiate a reset the HDLC
circuitry during bit/byte stuffing mode changes, this bit must be set to zero briefly, then set back to 1.
          0=GFP Based.
          1=HDLC Based.
Bit 13: Decapsulator Frame Check Sequence Append Disable (DFCSAD)– When equal to 0, the incoming
frame’s encapsulation (HDLC/GFP) CRC (FCS) will be validated and removed. When set to 1, the decapsulated
frame will not be expected to contain an encapsulation CRC and no bytes will be removed.
Bit 12: Decapsulator Scrambler Disable (DCFCRD) When set to 1, the X43+1 descrambler is turned off.
Bit 11: Decapsulator 16-bit FCS Enable (DFCS16EN) When set to 1 the decapsulated frame must contain a 16-
bit FCS. When equal to zero, a 32-bit FCS is expected. This bit is relevant if DFCSAD is reset.
Bit 9: Decapsulator Bit Byte Synchronous(DBBS) When set to 1, the Decapsulator expects byte-stuffed HDLC.
When equal to zero, the Decapsulator expects bit-stuffed HDLC. When in GFP mode (DPRTSEL = 0), this bit
should be set to 1. After changing this bit, the HDLC circuitry should be reset using the PP.DMCR.DPRTSEL bit.
Bit-stuffed HDLC is not valid for multi-member VCGs (WAN Groups).
Bit 8: Receive Bit Reorder (RBRE) Controls the endian order of HDLC reception. This bit function is not available
in device revision A1 (GL.IDR.REVn=000).
          0 = HDLC payload will be received MSB-first. Default operation.
          1 = HDLC payload will be received LSB-first.
Bit 7: Decapsulator Remove Function 1 Enable (DR1E) When set to 1, 4 bytes are removed immediately after
the cHEC bytes (for GFP) or start of HDLC flag (for HDLC). This bit should be set to 1 for X.86, Cisco HDLC and
GFP transport. This bit should be reset to 0 for HDLC traffic with no headers.
Bit 6: Decapsulator Remove Function 2 Enable (DR2E) When set to 1, 4 bytes are removed after the first
remove function. This function should always be used in conjunction with Decapsulator Remove Function 1.
Bit 5: Decapsulator Remove Function 3 Enable (DR3E) When set to 1, 12 bytes are skipped and then 4 bytes
are removed. The 12 bytes are skipped after either Decapsulator Remove Function 1 and/or Decapsulator Remove
Function 2 have been performed (when enabled). When Decapsulator Remove Functions 1 and 2 are disabled, 12
bytes are skipped from the beginning of the frame.

Bits 3-4: Decapsulator Add Enable (DAE[1:0]) Controls the insertion of additional bytes by the decapsulator.
         00 = Normal operation.
         01 = The 18 byte value from the PP.DA1DR through PP.DA9DR registers will be inserted after the
                  cHEC bytes in GFP mode, or after the HDLC header/flag when in HDLC mode.
         10 = The 14 byte value from the PP.DA1DR through PP.DA7DR registers will be inserted after the
                  cHEC bytes in GFP mode, or after the HDLC header/flag when in HDLC mode.
         11 = Reserved.
Bit 2: Decapsulator GFP Synchronization Control (DGSC) When set, “triple synchronization” is selected. Three
consecutive PLIs and respective cHEC must be correct to enter the Synchronization State. If equal to zero, two
consecutive correct PLIs and cHECs are required. Only applicable to GFP Mode.
Bit 1: Decapsulator HDLC Rate Adaptation (DHRAE)
         0= Disabled. Default for non-X.86 (LAPS) modes.
         1= Enabled. “7D DD” sequence removed from data stream. For use in X.86 (LAPS) mode.
Bit 0: Decapsulator HDLC CRC Bit Order (DHCBO) Controls the endian order of the HDLC CRC calculation.
This bit function is not available in device revision A1 (GL.IDR.REVn=000).
         0 = HDLC CRC will be calculated MSB-first. Default operation.
         1 = HDLC CRC will be calculated LSB-first.

Bit 3: Decapsulator Error Mode (DEM) When set to 1, errored frames are forwarded. Normally they are
discarded. This bit function was located in DMCR bit 0 in device revision A1 (GL.IDR.REVn=000).
Bit 2: Decapsulator State Machine Reset (DSMRE) If this bit is set and DFSRWPC transitions, The
Decapsulator State Machine will be reset.
Bit 1: Decapsulator FIFO Pointer reset Enable (DFPRE) - Setting this bit to a 1 will enable the FIFO to be reset.
The FIFO Read and Write pointer will be reset if DFSRWPC transitions and this bit is set.
Bit 0: Decapsulator FIFO and State Read, Write, and PMU Control (DFSRWPC)- A 0 to 1 transition enables the
FIFO Read and Write Addresses, Status Registers to be read by the processor. The user must wait 4 system
clocks before the reads can be done. This bit is used to control resetting of the FIFO Read and Write Pointers and
the Decapsulator State Machine. This bit is also used as a PMU update for all decapsulator latched counters.

Bits 8-11: Transmit VCAT Sequence Mapping (TVSQ[3:0]) These four bits are a BCD number that is used in the
“SQ” field of the VCAT MFI on that port. When LCAS is enabled, the internal LCAS engine controls the transmit
sequence number and reading these bits provides the current assigned sequence number for a given port. The
user should take care to not overwrite these bits when LCAS is enabled. When LCAS is not enabled, the user
can write a value to specifically assign a port’s sequence in a VCG. Note that in T3/E3 operation, only sequence
numbers 0-7 are valid.
Bit 4: Transmit Non-VCG Control (TNVCGC)
         0 = The VCAT byte position is not used for payload data. Required when placing GFP encapsulated
Ethernet over PDH for compliance with ITU-T G.8040.
         1 = The VCAT byte position is used for payload data. Only valid when the port is not configured as a
member of a VCAT group.

TVGS[2:0]       Transmit WAN Group and VCAT Selection
000             VCAT disabled for WAN Port, WAN Group 1

110             VCAT disabled for WAN Port, WAN Group 4
111             VCAT enabled for WAN Port, WAN Group 4 (VCG4)
Note: Only one port may be assigned to a Non-VCG.
Bit 0: Transmit Port n Assign (TPA)
         0 = Port n is Unused.
         1 = Port n is assigned to a WAN Group or VCG.

10.8 Serial Interface Registers
The Serial Interface contains the Serial transport circuitry and the associated serial port. The Serial Interface
register map consists of registers that are common functions, transmit functions, and receive functions.
Bits that are underlined are read-only; all other bits can be written. All reserved registers and bits with “-“
designation should be written to zero, unless specifically noted in the register definition. When read, the information
from reserved registers and bits designated with “-“ should be discarded.
Counter registers are updated by asserting (low to high transition) the associated performance monitoring update
signal (xxPMU). During the counter register update process, the associated performance monitoring status signal
(xxPMS) is deasserted. The counter register update process consists of loading the counter register with the
current count, resetting the counter, forcing the zero count status indication low for one clock cycle, and then
asserting xxPMS. No events are missed during this update procedure.
A latched bit is set when the associated event occurs, and remains set until it is cleared by reading. Once cleared,
a latched bit will not be set again until the associated event occurs again. Reserved configuration bits and registers
should be written to zero.
10.8.1 Serial Interface Transmit and Common Registers
Serial Interface Transmit Registers are used to control the transmitter associated with each Serial Interface. The
register map is shown in the following Table. Note that throughout this document the HDLC Processor is also
referred to as a “packet processor”.

Bit 23: Watchdog Disable (WDD) - When set to 1, the watchdog timer on the receiver is disabled. When equal to
0, the MAC allows only 2048 bytes of data per frame.
Bit 22: Jabber Disable (JD) - When set to 1, the transmitter’s jabber timer is disabled. When equal to 0, the MAC
allows only 2048 bytes to be transmitter per frame.
Bit 21: Frame Burst Enable (FBE) – When set to 1, the MAC allows frame bursting during transmission in half-
duplex mode.
Bit 20: Jumbo Frame Enable (JFE) - When set to 1, the MAC allows the reception of frames up to 9018 bytes in
length without reporting a giant frame error in the receive frame status register. Frames between 9018 and 10240
bytes in length are passed with a giant frame error indication. Jabber Disable and Watchdog Disable bits should be
set to 1 to transmit and receive jumbo frames. This bit should be cleared when operating in full-duplex mode.
Bit 15: GMII / MII Selection (GMIIMIIS)
         0 = GMII mode
         1 = MII/RMII mode
Bit 14: Endian Mode (EM) - When set to 1, the MAC operates in Big-Endian Mode. When equal to 0, the MAC
operates in Little-Endian Mode. The Endian mode selection is applicable only for the transmit and receive data
paths.
Bit 13: Disable Receive Own (DRO) - When set to 1, the MAC disables the reception of frames while TX_EN is
asserted. When this bit equals zero, transmitted frames are also received by the MAC. This bit should be cleared
when operating in full-duplex mode.

Bit 12: Loopback Mode (LM) - When set to 1, all frames destined for the transmit GMII/MII/RMII interface are
internally transferred to the receive GMII/MII/RMII. Frames received on the GMII/MII/RMII are not transferred to the
transmit GMII/MII/RMII interface. Note that there is no SA/DA swapping performed. If SA/DA swapping of LAN
traffic is required, the LAN extract/insertion functions must be used.
Bit 11: Duplex Mode (DM) - When set to 1, the MAC transmits and receives simultaneously (full-duplex).
Bit 9: Disable Retry (DRTY) - When set to 1, the MAC makes only a single attempt to transmit each frame. If a
collision occurs, the MAC ignores the current frame, reports a Frame Abort, reports an excessive collision error,
and proceeds to the next frame. When this bit equals 0, the MAC will retry collided frames based on the settings in
the Backoff Limit bits before signaling a retry error. This bit is applicable to half-duplex mode only.
Bit 8: Automatic Pad Stripping (APST) - When set to 1, all incoming frames with less than 46 byte length are
automatically stripped of the pad characters and FCS. When equal to zero, all frames are received unmodified.
Bit 7: Automatic CRC Stripping (ACST) - When set to 1, the MAC will strip the FCS field on incoming frames only
if the length field is less than or equal to 1500 bytes. All received frames with length field greater than 1500 bytes
will be passed to the receiver without stripping of the FCS field. When equal to zero, all frames are received
unmodified. For most applications of this device, this bit should equal 0.
Bits 5 - 6: Back-Off Limit (BOLMT[1:0])- These two bits allow the user to set the back-off limit used for the
maximum retransmission delay for collided frames. Default operation limits the maximum delay for retransmission
to a countdown of 10 bits from a random number generator. The user can reduce the maximum number of counter
bits as described in the table below. See IEEE 802.3 for details of the back-off algorithm.
Bit 7      Bit 6    Random Number Generator Bits Used
    0        0                               10
    0        1                                8
    1        0                                4
    1        1                                1
Bit 4: Deferral Check (DC) - When set to 1, the MAC will abort frame transmission if it has deferred for more than
24,288 bit times. The deferral counter starts when the transmitter is ready to transmit a frame, but is prevented
from transmission because RX_CRS is active. If the MAC begins transmission but a collision occurs after the
beginning of transmission, the deferral counter is reset again. If this bit is equal to zero, then the MAC will defer
indefinitely.
Bit 3: Transmitter Enable (TE) - When set to 1, frame transmission is enabled. When equal to zero, transmission
is disabled.
Bit 2: Receiver Enable (RE) - When set to 1, frame reception is enabled. When equal to zero, frames are not
received.

Bit 31: Receive All Frames (RAF) - When set to 1, the receiver forwards all frames to the device, even if they do
not pass the destination address filter. When equal to zero, the receiver only forwards those frames that pass the
destination address filter.
Bit 7: Pass Pause Control Frames (PCF) - When set to 1, the receiver forwards all special multicast PAUSE
control frames to the device. The MAC also decodes the PAUSE control frame and disables the transmitter for the
specified amount of time. When equal to zero, the MAC decodes the PAUSE control frame and disables the
transmitter for the specified amount of time, but does not forward the PAUSE frame to the device.
Bit 5: Disable Broadcast Frames (DBF) - When set to 1, the MAC filters all incoming Broadcast frames. When
equal to zero, all broadcast frames are forwarded to the device.
                                                                                    st
Bit 4: Pass All Multicast (PAM) - When set to 1, all received multicast frames (1 bit of DA = “1”) are forwarded,
irrespective of the settings of the Hash filter and Inverse Filtering bits.
Bit 3: Inverse Filtering (INVF) - When set to 1, the programmable DA filter operates in inverse filtering mode. The
result of the filtering operations by the Hash HFUF/HFMF bits is inverted. When equal to zero, filtering is
determined by the HFUF/HFMF bits.
Bit 2: Hash Mode for Unicast Frames (HFUF) - When set to 1, address filtering operates in the imperfect (hash)
address filtering mode for unicast frames, according to the hash table. When equal to zero, perfect address filtering
is performed on unicast frames using the addresses specified in the MAC address filter registers.
Bit 1: Hash Mode for Multicast Frames (HFMF) - When set to 1, address filtering operates in the imperfect (hash)
address filtering mode for multicast frames, according to the hash table. When this bit equals zero, perfect address
filtering is performed on multicast frames using the addresses specified in the MAC address filter registers.
Bit 0: Promiscuous Mode (PM) – When set to 1, all non-control frames are allowed to pass, including broadcast
frames, regardless of destination address.
See Section 8.19.3 for more details on frame-filtering configuration.

Notes: “slots” are defined by the IEEE as the amount of time that it takes to transmit 64 bytes for 10/100Mbps and 512
bytes for 1000Mbps. Only the 10/100Mbps applications are applicable for the Port 2 MAC.
Bit 3: Unicast Pause Frame Detect (UP) - When set to 1, the MAC will detect Pause control frames with the
device’s unicast address, in addition to detecting Pause control frames with a multicast address. When equal to
zero, the MAC will only detect Pause control frames with the unique multicast address as specified in the 802.3x
standard.
Bit 2: Receive Flow Control Enable (RFE) - When set to 1, the MAC will receive Pause control frames and
disable the transmitter for the specified pause time. When this bit is equal to zero, the device will not respond to
Pause control frames.
Bit 1: Transmit Flow Control Enable (TFE) - When operating in Full-Duplex mode, if this bit is set, the MAC will
transmit Pause control frames as needed. When equal to zero, the MAC will not transmit Pause control frames.
Bit 0: Flow Control Busy (FCB) - This bit is equal to 1 when the transmission of a Pause control frame is in
progress. If the user writes a “1” to this bit, the device will transmit one Pause control frame.

This register configures and initiates auto-negotiation of the external PHY device. It also enables PHY loopback.
Bit 16: Enable Comma Detect (ECD) - When set to 1, the MAC is enabled for comma detection and word
resynchronization.
Bit 14: External Loopback Enable (ELE) - When set to 1, causes the external PHY to loopback the transmit data
to the receiver.
Bit 13: Auto-Negotiation Enable (ANE) - When set to 1, the MAC will automatically negotiate the link speed with
the remote node. When equal to zero, auto-negotiation is disabled.
Bit 9: Restart Auto-Negotiation (RAN) - When set to 1 and ANE=1, the MAC will initiate auto-negotiation. This bit
will clear itself after auto-negotiation is started. Should be equal to zero during normal operation.

Bit 20: Flush Transmit FIFO (FTF) When this bit is written to 1, the MAC transmit FIFO is reset and cleared. This
bit automatically resets to zero when the reset operation is complete. Transmission should be disabled during the
flush transmit FIFO operation. Typically, the user will want to flush the transmit FIFO prior to enabling transmission
to avoid transmitting possible frame fragments that may be in the FIFO.

  11.      Functional Timing
  11.1 Functional SPI Interface Timing
  Note: The transmit and receive order of the address and data bits are selected by the SPI_SWAP pin. The R/W
  (read/write) MSB bit and B (burst) LSB bit position is not affected by the SPI_SWAP pin setting.
  11.1.1 SPI Transmission Format and CPHA Polarity
  When SPI_CPHA = 0, CS may be de-asserted between accesses. An access is defined as one or two control
  bytes followed by a data byte. CS cannot be de-asserted between the control bytes, or between the last control
  byte and the data byte. When SPI_CPHA = 0, CS may also remain asserted between accesses. If it remains
  asserted and the BURST bit is set, no additional control bytes are expected after the first control byte(s) and data
  are transferred. If the BURST bit is set, the address will be incremented for each additional byte of data transferred
  until CS is de-asserted. If CS remains asserted and the BURST bit is not set, a control byte(s) is expected following
  the data byte, and the address for the next access will be received from that. Anytime CS is de-asserted, the
  BURST access is terminated.
  When SPI_CPHA = 1, CS may remain asserted for more than one access without being toggled high and then low
  again between accesses. If the BURST bit is set, the address should increment and no additional control bytes are
  expected. If the BURST bit is not set, each data byte will be followed by the control byte(s) for the next access.
  Additionally, CS may also be de-asserted between accesses when SPI_CPHA =1. In the case, any BURST access
  is terminated, and the next byte received when CS is re-asserted will be a control byte.
  The following diagrams describe the functionality of the SPI port for the four combinations of SPI_CPOL and
  SPI_CPHA. They indicate the clock edge that samples the data and the level of the clock during no-transfer events
  (high or low). Since the SPI port acts as a slave device, the master device provides the clock. The user must
  configure the SPI_CPOL and SPI_CPHA pins to describe which type of clock that the master device is providing.
  Note that due to the address space of the device, the unused bits A13, A12, and A11 should always be zero.

11.2 Functional Serial Interface Timing
The Serial Interface provides flexible timing to interconnect with a wide variety of serial devices. Figure 11-9 shows
the basic functional timing relationship for the transmit serial port interface. TCLK may be gapped during Framing
Overhead positions or to support Fractional T1/E1/T3/E3, as shown in Figure 11-11. The device provides the
TSYNC signal as a frame or byte boundary indication to an external interface. TSYNC is normally active high on
the first bit of the multiframe, but can be programmed to occur up to three cycles early, as shown in Figure 11-12.
TSYNC is minimally one pulse wide, but may be active for multiple clock cycles.

Figure 11-13 shows the basic functional timing relationship for the receive serial port interface. RCLK may be
gapped during Framing Overhead positions or to support Fractional T1/E1/T3/E3, as shown in Figure 11-15. The
RSYNC signal must be provided to the device as a frame, multiframe, or byte boundary indication. VCAT
applications require a multiframe boundary. The expected position of the RSYNC pulse is not programmable, and
must be provided as indicated. Note that the first clock after the RSYNC will sample the LSB of the last byte of the
previous frame.

Figure 11-17 shows the receive serial port timing relationship when the data stream contains PCM octets. This
example shows two PCM octets being demuxed from the Ethernet data. RVSYNC is minimum one clock period
wide, but may be high multiple clock periods. Note that the PCM octets output on RVDATA are buffered for one
RVSYNC period, i.e. the PCM octets are delayed one frame. Voice data may be output at any point between frame
syncs, output when RVDEN is low.

GMII Receive data on RXD[1:0] is expected to be synchronous with the rising edge of ______. The data is only

Each MII Interface Transmit Port has its own TX_CLK and data interface. The data TXD [3:0] operates
synchronously with TX_CLK. The LSB is presented first. TX_CLK should be 2.5MHz for 10Mbps operation and
25MHz for 100Mbps operation. TX_EN is valid at the same time as the first byte of the preamble. In DTE Mode
TX_CLK is input from the external PHY. In DCE Mode, the device provides TX_CLK, derived from an external
reference (SYSCLKI).
In Half-Duplex (DTE) Mode, the device supports RX_CRS and COL signals. RX_CRS is active when the PHY
detects transmit or receive activity. If there is a collision as indicated by the COL input, the device will replace the
data nibbles with jam nibbles. After a “random“ time interval, the frame is retransmitted. The MAC will try to send
the frame a maximum of 16 times. The jam sequence consists of 55555555h. Note that the COL signal and
RX_CRS can be asynchronous to the TX_CLK and are only valid in half duplex mode.

Receive Data (RXD[3:0]) is clocked from the external PHY synchronously with RX_CLK. The RX_CLK signal is
2.5MHz for 10Mbps operation and 25MHz for 100Mbps operation. RX_DV is asserted by the PHY from the first
Nibble of the preamble in 100Mbps operation or first nibble of SFD for 10Mbps operation. The data on RXD[3:0] is
not accepted by the MAC if RX_DV is low or RX_ERR is high (in DTE mode). RX_ERR should be tied low when in
DCE Mode.

13.1 JTAG TAP Controller State Machine Description
This section covers the details on the operation of the Test Access Port (TAP) Controller State Machine. The TAP
controller is a finite state machine that responds to the logic level at JTMS on the rising edge of JTCLK.
13.1.1 TAP Controller State Machine
The TAP controller is a finite state machine that responds to the logic level at JTMS on the rising edge of JTCLK.
See Figure 13-2 for a diagram of the state machine operation.
13.1.1.1Test-Logic-Reset
Upon power-up, the TAP Controller is in the Test-Logic-Reset state. The Instruction register will contain the
IDCODE instruction. All system logic of the device will operate normally.
13.1.1.2Run-Test-Idle
The Run-Test-Idle is used between scan operations or during specific tests. The Instruction register and test
registers will remain idle.
13.1.1.3Select-DR-Scan
All test registers retain their previous state. With JTMS LOW, a rising edge of JTCLK moves the controller into the
Capture-DR state and will initiate a scan sequence. JTMS HIGH during a rising edge on JTCLK moves the
controller to the Select-IR-Scan state.
13.1.1.4Capture-DR
Data may be parallel-loaded into the test data registers selected by the current instruction. If the instruction does
not call for a parallel load or the selected register does not allow parallel loads, the test register will remain at its
current value. On the rising edge of JTCLK, the controller will go to the Shift-DR state if JTMS is LOW or it will go to
the Exit1-DR state if JTMS is HIGH.
13.1.1.5Shift-DR
The test data register selected by the current instruction is connected between JTDI and JTDO and will shift data
one stage towards its serial output on each rising edge of JTCLK. If a test register selected by the current
instruction is not placed in the serial path, it will maintain its previous state.
13.1.1.6Exit1-DR
While in this state, a rising edge on JTCLK will put the controller in the Update-DR state, which terminates the
scanning process, if JTMS is HIGH. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW will put the controller in the Pause-
DR state.
13.1.1.7Pause-DR
Shifting of the test registers is halted while in this state. All test registers selected by the current instruction will
retain their previous state. The controller will remain in this state while JTMS is LOW. A rising edge on JTCLK with
JTMS HIGH will put the controller in the Exit2-DR state.
13.1.1.8Exit2-DR
A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS HIGH while in this state will put the controller in the Update-DR state and
terminate the scanning process. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW will enter the Shift-DR state.
Rev: 063008                                                                                                   364 of 375


  ________________________________________________ DS33X162/X161/X82/X81/X42/X41/X11/W41/W11
13.1.1.9Update-DR
A falling edge on JTCLK while in the Update-DR state will latch the data from the shift register path of the test
registers into the data output latches. This prevents changes at the parallel output due to changes in the shift
register.
13.1.1.10Select-IR-Scan
All test registers retain their previous state. The instruction register will remain unchanged during this state. With
JTMS LOW, a rising edge on JTCLK moves the controller into the Capture-IR state and will initiate a scan
sequence for the instruction register. JTMS HIGH during a rising edge on JTCLK puts the controller back into the
Test-Logic-Reset state.
13.1.1.11Capture-IR
The Capture-IR state is used to load the shift register in the instruction register with a fixed value. This value is
loaded on the rising edge of JTCLK. If JTMS is HIGH on the rising edge of JTCLK, the controller will enter the
Exit1-IR state. If JTMS is LOW on the rising edge of JTCLK, the controller will enter the Shift-IR state.
13.1.1.12Shift-IR
In this state, the shift register in the instruction register is connected between JTDI and JTDO and shifts data one
stage for every rising edge of JTCLK towards the serial output. The parallel register, as well as all test registers,
remains at their previous states. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS HIGH will move the controller to the Exit1-IR
state. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW will keep the controller in the Shift-IR state while moving data one
stage thorough the instruction shift register.
13.1.1.13Exit1-IR
A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW will put the controller in the Pause-IR state. If JTMS is HIGH on the rising
edge of JTCLK, the controller will enter the Update-IR state and terminate the scanning process.
13.1.1.14Pause-IR
Shifting of the instruction shift register is halted temporarily. With JTMS HIGH, a rising edge on JTCLK will put the
controller in the Exit2-IR state. The controller will remain in the Pause-IR state if JTMS is LOW during a rising edge
on JTCLK.
13.1.1.15Exit2-IR
A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW will put the controller in the Update-IR state. The controller will loop back
to Shift-IR if JTMS is HIGH during a rising edge of JTCLK in this state.
13.1.1.16Update-IR
The instruction code shifted into the instruction shift register is latched into the parallel output on the falling edge of
JTCLK as the controller enters this state. Once latched, this instruction becomes the current instruction. A rising
edge on JTCLK with JTMS held low will put the controller in the Run-Test-Idle state. With JTMS HIGH, the
controller will enter the Select-DR-Scan state.

13.2 Instruction Register
The instruction register contains a shift register as well as a latched parallel output and is 3 bits in length. When the
TAP controller enters the Shift-IR state, the instruction shift register is connected between JTDI and JTDO. While in
the Shift-IR state, a rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW will shift the data one stage towards the serial output at
JTDO. A rising edge on JTCLK in the Exit1-IR state or the Exit2-IR state with JTMS HIGH will move the controller
to the Update-IR state. The falling edge of that same JTCLK will latch the data in the instruction shift register to the
instruction parallel output. Instructions supported by the device and its respective operational binary codes are
shown in Table 13-1.

13.2.1 SAMPLE:PRELOAD
This is a mandatory instruction for the IEEE 1149.1 specification. This instruction supports two functions. The
digital I/Os of the device can be sampled at the boundary scan register without interfering with the normal operation
of the device by using the Capture-DR state. SAMPLE:PRELOAD also allows the device to shift data into the
boundary scan register via JTDI using the Shift-DR state.
13.2.2 BYPASS
When the BYPASS instruction is latched into the parallel instruction register, JTDI connects to JTDO through the
one-bit bypass test register. This allows data to pass from JTDI to JTDO not affecting the device’s normal
operation.
13.2.3 EXTEST
This allows testing of all interconnections to the device. When the EXTEST instruction is latched in the instruction
register, the following actions occur. Once enabled via the Update-IR state, the parallel outputs of all digital output
pins are driven. The boundary scan register is connected between JTDI and JTDO. The Capture-DR will sample all
digital inputs into the boundary scan register.
13.2.4 CLAMP
All digital outputs of the device will output data from the boundary scan parallel output while connecting the bypass
register between JTDI and JTDO. The outputs will not change during the CLAMP instruction.
13.2.5 HIGHZ
All digital outputs of the device are placed in a high-impedance state. The BYPASS register is connected between
JTDI and JTDO.
13.2.6 IDCODE
When the IDCODE instruction is latched into the parallel instruction register, the identification test register is
selected. The device identification code is loaded into the identification register on the rising edge of JTCLK
following entry into the Capture-DR state. Shift-DR can be used to shift the identification code out serially via
JTDO. During Test-Logic-Reset, the identification code is forced into the instruction register’s parallel output. The

13.4 Test Registers
IEEE 1149.1 requires a minimum of two test registers: the bypass register and the boundary scan register. An
optional test register has been included in the device. This test register is the identification register and is used in
conjunction with the IDCODE instruction and the Test-Logic-Reset state of the TAP controller.
13.4.1 Boundary Scan Register
This register contains both a shift register path and a latched parallel output for all control cells and digital I/O cells
and is n bits in length.
13.4.2 Bypass Register
This is a single one-bit shift register used in conjunction with the BYPASS, CLAMP, and HIGHZ instructions, which
provides a short path between JTDI and JTDO.
13.4.3 Identification Register
The identification register contains a 32-bit shift register and a 32-bit latched parallel output. This register is
selected during the IDCODE instruction and when the TAP controller is in the Test-Logic-Reset state.

13.5 JTAG Functional Timing
This functional timing for the JTAG circuits shows:
      •     The JTAG controller starting from reset state.
      •     Shifting out the first 4 LSB bits of the IDCODE.
      •     Shifting in the BYPASS instruction (111) while shifting out the mandatory X01 pattern.
      •     Shifting the TDI pin to the TDO pin through the bypass shift register.
      •     An asynchronous reset occurs while shifting.

Note: Shaded pins do not apply to all devices in the product family. See the pin listing for specific pin availability. In the high port
count devices, the shaded input pins DO NOT HAVE PULLUP/PULLDOWN resistors. Consideration must be taken during
board design to bias the inputs appropriately, and to float output pins (TDATA5-TDATA16, TX_EN2, TX_ERR2) if lower port
count designs are to be potentially stuffed with higher port count devices.
