     4         LLoop   I  Local Loopback Input Select:
                          This input pin permits the user to configure the XRT59L91 device to
                          operate in the “Local Loopback” Mode; in order to support Diagnostic
                          Operations.
                          When the XRT59L91 device is operating in the Local Loopback
                          Mode, then TTIP and TRing output signals will be (internally)
                          routed to RTIP and RRing input signals.
                          Setting this input pin “high” configures the XRT59L91 device to
                          operate in the “Local Loopback” Mode. Setting this input pin “low”
                          configures the XRT59L91 device to operate in the “Normal” Mode.
                          Note: Pulling both the “LLoop” and “RLoop” input pins to VDD,
                          simultaneously, will cause the XRT59L91 device to operate in the “In-

                          routed to the TxPOS and TxNEG input pins.
                          Setting this input pin “high” configures the XRT59L91 device to
                          operate in the “Remote Loopback” Mode. Setting this input pin “low”
                          configures the XRT59L91 device to operate in the “Normal” Mode.
