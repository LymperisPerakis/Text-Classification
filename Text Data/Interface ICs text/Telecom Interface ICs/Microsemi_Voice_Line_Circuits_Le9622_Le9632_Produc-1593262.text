miSLIC™ Series Solution Overview
The sixth-generation miSLIC line interface solution consists of a miSLIC device, VoicePath API-II (VP-API-II)
Software, and Profiles Data Structures. To support the miSLIC device, Microsemi offers comprehensive software
and hardware collateral packages, including 2-layer printed circuit board reference designs.
The VoicePath API-II (VP-API-II) software initializes the FXS port coefficient data containing application or country-
specific AC and DC parameters, ringing and other signaling characteristics, and configures the switching power
supply. VP-API-II resides on the customer’s VoIP processor or SoC and provides high-level control over the
telephony functions. VP-API-II offers a seamless migration between products utilizing its common software
architecture and interfaces with the Microsemi VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software.
A Microsoft® Windows® GUI (Graphical User Interface) application, VoicePath Profile Wizard (VP Profile Wizard),
allows the user to select the operating parameters of the FXS channels and to automatically generate the sets of
data structures, called Profiles, that are required by the VP-API-II for integration with the VoIP host software.
The Le9622/Le9632 miSLIC device implements a universal telephone line interface with a PCM and SPI interface.
This interface is voltage programmable to support 1.8V, 2.5V and 3.3V SoC Processors. All AC, DC, and signaling
parameters are fully programmable via the PCM and SPI interfaces
The switching regulator controller generates the high voltage needed for efficiently powering and ringing analog
telephones. The Le9622 supports two switching regulator architectures. The lowest cost Shared Buck-Boost
Automatic Battery Switch (BBABS) architecture uses a fixed voltage for ringing with up to 85VPK open circuit
capability. The Multi-Line Inverting-Boost Automatic Battery Switch (ABS) also uses a fixed voltage, with up to
100VPK open circuit capability. The Le9632 also supports two switching regulator architectures. The High Voltage
Flyback architecture tracks the ringing voltage during ringing, with up to 140-VPK capability. The High Voltage
Inverting-Boost switcher which also tracks the ringing voltage during ringing with up to 125-VPK capability. The
battery tracks the DC feed with both architectures. The switching regulators provide high efficiency in all operating
states and corresponding low power consumption.
The Le9622/Le9632 utilizes the VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software to resolve line circuit faults and to
provide line diagnostics. The integrated digital access to line information such as AC and DC line voltages and
Metallic or Longitudinal currents is crucial for remote applications where dedicated test hardware is not cost
effective.
Additionally, the VeriVoice Manufacturing Software (VVMT) package provides test functions intended to facilitate
factory testing, eliminating the need for expensive external test equipment.

Customer Application
This block represents the user’s line management module that performs tasks such as initializing the system,
configuring lines, changing the line states in response to line events and other inputs, switching digitized voice
traffic, etc. Microsemi provides example implementations of this layer as part of the VoicePath SDK.
VoicePath API-II
The VoicePath API-II is the core component of the Microsemi VoicePath SDK. This software module runs on the
host microprocessor that controls one or more Microsemi voice telephony devices.
Hardware Abstraction Layer
The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides access to Microsemi voice telephony devices through the SPI
interface. The HAL software is platform-dependent and must be implemented by the VP-API-II user. Microsemi
provides example HAL source code with the VoicePath SDK.
