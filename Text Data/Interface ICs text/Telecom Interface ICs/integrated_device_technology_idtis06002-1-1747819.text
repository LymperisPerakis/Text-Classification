                                              TCLKn: Transmit Clock for Channel 0~3
                                              The clock of 2.048 MHz for transmit is input on this pin. The transmit data at TDn/TDPn or TDNn is sam-
                                              pled into the device on the falling edges of TCLKn.
                                              Pulling TCLKn high for more than 16 MCLK cycles, the corresponding transmitter is set in Transmit All
                                              Ones (TAOS) state (when MCLK is clocked). In TAOS state, the TAOS generator adopts MCLK as the
                                              clock reference.
                                              If TCLKn is low, the corresponding transmit channel is set into power down state, while driver output ports
                                              become high-Z.
                                              Different combinations of TCLKn and MCLK result in different transmit mode. It is summarized as the fol-

                                              In Single Rail mode, the received NRZ data is output on this pin. The data is decoded by AMI or HDB3 line
                                              code rule.
                                              CVn: Code Violation for Channel 0~3
                                              In Single Rail mode, the bipolar violation, code violation and excessive zeros will be reported by driving pin
   RD0/RDP0                   40         P2   CVn high for a full clock cycle. However, only bipolar violation is indicated when AMI decoder is selected.

   RD3/RDP3        O          70         P13  In Dual Rail Mode with clock recovery, these pins output the NRZ data. A high signal on RDPn indicates
                                              the receipt of a positive pulse on RTIPn/RRINGn while a high signal on RDNn indicates the receipt of a
   CV0/RDN0     High-Z        41         P3   negative pulse on RTIPn/RRINGn.
   CV1/RDN1                   34         M3   The output data at RDn or RDPn/RDNn are clocked out on the falling edges of RCLK when the CLKE input
   CV2/RDN2                   76         M12  is low, or are clocked out on the rising edges of RCLK when CLKE is high.
   CV3/RDN3                   69         P12  In Dual Rail Mode without clock recovery, these pins output the raw RZ sliced data. In this data recovery
                                              mode, the active polarity of RDPn/RDNn is determined by pin CLKE. When pin CLKE is low, RDPn/RDNn
                                              is active low. When pin CLKE is high, RDPn/RDNn is active high.
                                              In hardware mode, RDn or RDPn/RDNn will remain active during LOS. In host mode, these pins will either
                                              remain active or insert alarm indication signal (AIS) into the receive path, determined by bit AISE in regis-

                                              RCLKn: Receive Clock for Channel 0~3
                                              In clock recovery mode, this pin outputs the recovered clock from signal received on RTIPn/RRINGn. The

                   O                          received data are clocked out of the device on the rising edges of RCLKn if pin CLKE is high, or on falling

    RCLK2                     78         M14
                 High-Z                       In data recovery mode, RCLKn is the output of an internal exclusive OR (XOR) which is connected with
    RCLK3                     71         P14
                                              RDPn and RDNn. The clock is recovered from the signal on RCLKn.
                                              If Receiver n is powered down, the corresponding RCLKn is in high-Z.
                                              MCLK: Master Clock
                                              This is an independent, free running reference clock. A clock of 2.048 MHz is supplied to this pin as the
                                              clock reference of the device for normal operation.
                                              In receive path, when MCLK is high, the device slices the incoming bipolar line signal into RZ pulse (Data
     MCLK           I         10         E1   Recovery mode). When MCLK is low, all the receivers are powered down, and the output pins RCLKn,
                                              RDPn and RDNn are switched to high-Z.
                                              In transmit path, the operation mode is decided by the combination of MCLK and TCLKn (see TCLKn pin
                                              description for details).
                                              NOTE: Wait state generation via RDY/ACK is not available if MCLK is not provided.

     LOS1                                     A high level on this pin indicates the loss of signal when there is no transition over a specified period of
                              35         K3
                   O                          time or no enough ones density in the received signal. The transition will return to low automatically when

                                              clocked out of the device on the falling edges of SCLK if pin CLKE is high, or on the rising edges of SCLK
                                              if pin CLKE is low.
 SDO/RDY/ACK       O          83         K14  RDY: Ready Output
                                              In parallel Intel host mode, the high level of this pin reports to the host that bus cycle can be completed,
                                              while low reports the host must insert wait states.

                                              In parallel Motorola host mode, the low level of this pin indicates that valid information on the data bus is
                                              ready for a read operation or acknowledges the acceptance of the written data during a write operation.

                                              In hardware control mode, A4 must be connected to GND. MC[3:0] are used to select one transmitter or
                                              receiver of channel 1 to 4 for non-intrusive monitoring. Channel 0 is used as the monitoring channel. If a
                                              transmitter is monitored, signals on the corresponding pins TTIPn and TRINGn are internally transmitted
                                              to RTIP0 and RRING0. If a receiver is monitored, signals on the corresponding pins RTIPn and RRINGn
                                              are internally transmitted to RTIP0 and RRING0. The clock and data recovery circuit in Receiver 0 can
                                              then output the monitored clock to pin RCLK0 as well as the monitored data to RDP0 and RDN0 pins. The
                                              signals monitored by channel 0 can be routed to TTIP0/TRING0 by activating Remote Loopback in this
                                              channel.
                                              Performance Monitor Configuration determined by MC[3:0] is shown below. Note that if MC[2:0] = 000, the
                                              device is in normal operation of all the channels.

                                              When pin MODE1 is low, the parallel host interface operates with separate address and data bus. In this
                                              mode, the signal on this pin is the address bus of the host interface.

2.18.2 SERIAL HOST INTERFACE
    By pulling pin MODE2 to VDDIO/2, the device operates in the serial
host Mode. In this mode, the registers are accessible through a 16-bit
word which contains an 8-bit command/address byte (bit R/W and 5-
address-bit A1~A5, A6 and A7 bits are ignored) and a subsequent 8-bit
data byte (D7~D0), as shown in Figure-19. When bit R/W is set to ‘1’,
data is read out from pin SDO. When bit R/W is set to ‘0’, data on pin
SDI is written into the register whose address is indicated by address
bits A5~A1.

                                         The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the
                                         EXTEST instruction, the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be
       000                Extest         sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by
                                         shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading
                                         patterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using the Update-DR state.
                                         The sample instruction samples all the device inputs and outputs. For this instruction, the boundary scan register is placed
                                         between TDI and TDO. The normal path between IDT82V2054 logic and the I/O pins is maintained. Primary device inputs

Table-20 TAP Controller State Description
        State                                                                              Description
                   In this state, the test logic is disabled. The device is set to normal operation. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register
                   with the IDCODE instruction.
  Test Logic Reset
                   Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held high for at least 5
                   rising edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high. The device processor automatically enters this state at power-up.
                   This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The
    Run-Test/Idle  instruction register and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                   moves to the Select-DR state.
                   This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction
                   retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR
   Select-DR-Scan
                   state and a scan sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller
                   moves to the Select-IR-Scan state.
                   In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction
    Capture-DR     does not change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in
                   this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
                   In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward
      Shift-DR     its serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising
                   edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
                   This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
      Exit1-DR     state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR
                   state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                   The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI
                   and TDO. For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test
     Pause-DR      sequence. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                   state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                   moves to the Exit2-DR state.
                   This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
      Exit2-DR     state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state.
                   The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                   The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST
                   and SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched into
     Update-DR     the parallel output of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output changes
                   only in this state. All shift-register stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and the instruc-
                   tion does not change during this state.
                   This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and
                   a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction reg-
   Select-IR-Scan
                   ister is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction
                   does not change during this state.
                   In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of ‘100’ on the rising edge of TCK. This sup-
                   ports fault-isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruc-
     Capture-IR
                   tion does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-
                   IR state if TMS is held high, or the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
                   In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its
                   serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction
       Shift-IR
                   does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR
                   state if TMS is held high, or remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.

       State                                                                            Description
                  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
      Exit1-IR    state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state.
                  The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                  The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected
     Pause-IR     by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state as
                  long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
                  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
      Exit2-IR    state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state.
                  The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                  The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK.
     Update-IR    When the new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction
                  retain their previous value.
