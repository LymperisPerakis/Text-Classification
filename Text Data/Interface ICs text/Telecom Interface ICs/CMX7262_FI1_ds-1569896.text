1    Brief Description
The CMX7262 TWELP Vocoder IC is a device supporting a Tri-Wave Excited Linear Prediction (TWELP)
vocoder functionality in a single chip. The CMX7262 is capable of encoding analogue voice into TWELP-
encoded frames. It is capable of decoding TWELP-encoded frames back to analogue voice.
Input and output signals may be passed through the C-BUS interface, or the on-chip analogue-to-digital
and digital-to-analogue converters (ADC/DAC).
The CMX7262 is designed to be flexible. However, it interfaces directly to the CMX7141 modem and the
two can used together to build a dPMR radio.
The device utilises CML’s proprietary FirmASIC component technology. On-chip sub-systems are
configured by a Function Image™ data file that is uploaded during device initialisation and defines the
device's function and feature set. The Function Image™ can be loaded automatically from a host
microcontroller over the C-BUS serial interface or from an external memory device. The device's functions
and features can be enhanced by subsequent Function Image™ releases, facilitating in-the-field
upgrades.
The CMX7262 operates from a 3.3V supply and includes selectable power saving modes. It is available in
a 64-VQFN (Q1) and 64-LQFP (L9) packages.
Note that text shown in pale grey indicates features that will be supported in future versions of the device.

Notes:
To achieve good noise performance, VDD and VBIAS decoupling and protection of the receive path from
extraneous in-band signals is very important. It is recommended that the printed circuit board is laid out
with a ground plane in the CMX7262 area to provide a low-impedance connection between the VSS pins
and the VDD and VBIAS decoupling capacitors.

                     Figure 3 Recommended External Components – Xtal Interface
Notes:
 The clock circuit can operate with either a xtal or external clock generator. If using an external clock
    generator it should be connected to the XTAL/CLOCK pin and the xtal and other components are not
    required. For external clock generator frequency range see section 7.1.2 Operating Limits. When
    using an external clock generator the XTAL oscillator circuit may be disabled to save power, see 9.1.2
    Program Block 1 – Clock Control for details.
   The tracks between the xtal and the device pins should be as short as possible to achieve maximum
    stability and best start up performance. It is also important to achieve a low-impedance connection
    between the xtal capacitors and the ground plane.
   The DVSS supply to the xtal oscillator capacitors C1 and C2 should be of low impedance and
    preferably be part of the DVSS ground plane to ensure reliable start up. For correct values of capacitors
    C1 and C2 refer to the manufacturer’s documentation for the xtal used.

5.4    Audio Output
5.4.1 Audio Output Routing
The CMX7262 has four possible analogue outputs: two differential outputs – ANAOUT1 and ANAOUT2, a
low-impedance differential output speaker driver – SPKR1 and, a single-ended output – SPKR2 that can
drive a headset/earpiece.
The CMX7262’s DAC (ANAOUT DAC) can output analogue waveforms on any or all of the four outputs
(ANAOUT1, ANAOUT2, SPKR1 and SPKR2) under the control of four C-BUS registers. Figure 6
Analogue Audio Output Routing, shows the analogue output signal routing and control.

5.4.2 Audio Output Reconstruction Filter
The CMX7262 ANAOUT1 and ANAOUT2 outputs provide internal reconstruction filtering. To complete the
reconstruction filter, the external RC network shown in Figure 7 should be used for each of the differential
outputs. The SPKR1 and SPKR2 outputs do not need any external reconstruction filter.

5.5.2 Differential Audio Input
The device has an anti-alias filter in the analogue audio input path which should be sufficient for most
applications. However, if additional filtering is required, it can be done at the input to the device.
The input impedance of the ANAIN1 pins varies with the input gain setting, see section 7.1.3 Operating
Characteristics.
5.5.3 Single-Ended Audio Input Interface
A single-ended input can be connected to the CMX7262 using the ANAIN2 pins. Gain and filtering circuitry
can be constructed around these pins, as shown in Figure 11.

5.6    GPIO Pins
All GPIO pins are configured as inputs with an internal bus-hold circuit, after the Function Image™ has
been loaded. This avoids the need for users to connect external termination (pullup/pulldown) resistors to
these inputs. The bus-hold is equivalent to a 75kΩ resistor either pulling up to logic 1 or pulling down to
logic 0. As the input is pulled to the opposite logic state by the user, the bus-hold resistor will change, so
that it also pulls to the new logic state. The internal bus-hold can be disabled or re-enabled using
programming register P1.20 in Program Block 1 – Clock Control.

6     General Description
6.1    CMX7262 Features
The CMX7262 is a half-duplex TWELP Vocoder chip that performs encoding of linear PCM samples /
analogue audio into TWELP-coded packets or, decoding of TWELP-coded data into linear PCM samples /
analogue audio. CMX7262 contains on-chip ADC and DAC which can be used to sample and output
analogue waveforms.
A flexible power control facility allows the device to be placed in its optimum power save mode when not
actively processing signals.
The device includes a crystal clock generator, with phase-locked loop to enable operation from a range of
reference xtal frequencies.
A block diagram of the device is shown in Figure 1.
Encoder Functions:
      Analogue voice / 16-bit linear PCM samples to TWELP-coded packets.
      Input filtering – when processing the CMX7262’s analogue audio input.
      Noise Reduction processing on the input signal before encoding.
      FEC encoder with interleaver for protection against channel errors.
Decoder Functions:
      TWELP decoding to analogue voice or 16-bit linear PCM samples.
      Output filtering– when processing the CMX7262’s analogue audio output.
      The decoder processes either hard or soft decision bits from the modem.
      FEC decoder and de-interleaver.
Repeater Functions:
      The FEC alone can be decoded and re-applied without having to voice decode and voice re-
         encode, allowing the CMX7262 to be used in repeater systems.
Interface:
      Optimised C-BUS (4-wire, high speed synchronous serial command/data bus) interface to host for
         control and data transfer, including streaming C-BUS for efficient data transfer.
      Input data can emanate from the analogue audio input or C-BUS.
      Output data can be sent to the analogue audio output and/or C-BUS.
      Open drain IRQ to host.
      Three GPIO pins.
      Serial memory or C-BUS (host) boot mode.
6.2    Signal Interfaces
Figure 12 shows the CMX7262 input and output interfaces. The CMX7262‘s output can be sent to either
one or both of its outputs simultaneously – C-BUS (for transfer to the host microcontroller) and/or,
analogue audio output. Input to the CMX7262 must come from one of the two input ports – C-BUS (input
data from the host controller) or the analogue audio input.

6.3    System Design
A number of system architectures can be supported by the CMX7262. The most highly-integrated solution
uses a CMX7262 Vocoder under full control of the CMX7141. In this mode, audio codec functions can be
provided by the on-chip ADC and DAC in the CMX7262. It is also possible to use the audio codec
functions of the CMX7141 and use CMX7262 as a digital vocoder co-processor. In both these modes the
CMX7262 will be under the full control of CMX7141.
Figure 13 shows the configuration using CMX7262’s internal audio codec. In this configuration the
CMX7141 uses its SPI port to interface with CMX7262’s C-BUS port to control and to transfer data to/from
CMX7262. Using the on-chip converters of CMX7262, allows the system designer to exploit the variety of
analogue inputs and outputs that CMX7262 offers. For more details, see Section 5.4 and 5.5.
When CMX7141 is used in analogue mode, the CMX7262 can be configured to pass-through mode where
it samples analogue waveforms and transfers the linear PCM samples to the CMX7141 or, it receives
linear PCM samples from the CMX7141 and outputs the result as an analogue waveform.

6.4    Xtal Frequency
The CMX7262 is designed to work with a xtal or an external frequency oscillator within the ranges
specified in section 7.1.2. Block 1 of the Programming Block (refer to the User Manual) must be loaded
with the correct values to ensure that the device will work to specification with the user-selected clock
frequency. A list of configuration values can be found in Table 7, supporting a sampling rate of 8kHz for a
range of xtal or external oscillator frequencies.
6.5    Host Interface
A serial data interface (C-BUS) is used for command, status and data transfers between the CMX7262
and the host microcontroller; this interface is compatible with Microwire™, SPI™, and other similar
interfaces. Interrupt signals notify the host microcontroller when a change in status has occurred; the
microcontroller should read the Status register across the C-BUS and respond accordingly. Interrupts only
occur if the appropriate mask bit has been set, see Section 6.12.5.
6.5.1 C-BUS Operation
This block provides for the transfer of data and control or status information between the CMX7262
internal registers and the host microcontroller over the C-BUS serial bus. Single register transactions
consist of a single Register Address byte sent from the microcontroller, which may be followed by a data
word sent from the microcontroller to be written into one of the CMX7262’s write only registers, or a data
word read from one of the CMX7262’s read only registers. Streaming C-BUS transactions consist of a
single register address byte followed by many data bytes being written to, or read from, the CMX7262. All
C-BUS data words are multiples of 8 bits wide, the width depending on the source or destination register.
Note that certain C-BUS transactions require only an address byte to be sent from the microcontroller, no
data transfer being required. The operation of the C-BUS is illustrated in Figure 15.
Data sent from the microcontroller on the CDATA (command data) line is clocked into the CMX7262 on
the rising edge of the SCLK input. Data sent from the CMX7262 to the microcontroller on the RDATA
(reply data) line is valid when SCLK is high. The CSN line must be held low during a data transfer and kept
high between transfers. The C-BUS interface is compatible with most common microcontroller serial
interfaces and may also be easily implemented with general purpose microcontroller I/O pins controlled by
a simple software routine. Section 7.2 (C-BUS Timing) gives detailed C-BUS timing requirements.
Note that, due to internal timing constraints, there may be a delay of up to 60µs between the end of a
C-BUS write operation and the device reading the data from its internal register.

To increase the data bandwidth between the microcontroller and CMX7262, certain of the C-BUS read and
write registers are capable of data-streaming operation. This allows a single address byte to be followed by
the transfer of multiple read or write data words, all within the same C-BUS transaction. This can
significantly increase the transfer rate of large data blocks, as shown in Figure 16.

6.6    Function Image™ Loading
The Function Image™ (FI), which defines the operational capabilities of the device, may be obtained from
the CML Technical Portal, following registration. This is in the form of a 'C' header file, which can be
included into the host controller software or programmed into an external serial memory. The
                 TM
Function Image size can never exceed 128kbytes, although a typical FI will be considerably less than
this. Note that the BOOTEN1, 2 pins are only read at power-on, when the RESETN pin goes high, or
following a C-BUS General Reset, and must remain stable throughout the FI loading process. Once the FI
load has completed, the BOOTEN1, 2 pins are ignored by the CMX7262 until the next power-up or Reset.
The BOOTEN 1, 2 pins are both fitted with internal low current pull-up devices.
For serial memory load operation, BOOTEN2 should be pulled low by connecting it to DV ss either directly
or via a 47kΩ resistor (see Table 2).
Whilst booting, the boot loader will return the checksum of each block loaded in the C-BUS Audio Out data
word streaming register. The checksums can be verified against the published values to ensure that the FI
has loaded correctly.
Once the FI has been loaded, the CMX7262 performs these actions:
      (1) The product identification code is reported in the C-BUS Audio Out data word streaming register.
      (2) The FI version code is reported in the C-BUS Audio Out data word streaming register.

6.6.1 FI Loading from Host Controller
The FI can be included in the host controller software build and downloaded into the CMX7262 at power-
up over the C-BUS interface, using the Audio In streaming register. For Function Image™ load, the
CMX7262 accepts raw 16-bit Function Image™ data using the Audio In Data Word - $49 write register.
The BOOTEN 1, 2 pins must be set to the C-BUS load configuration, the CMX7262 powered or Reset, and
then data can then be sent directly over the C-BUS to the CMX7262.
If the host detects a brownout, the BOOTEN 1, 2 pins should be set to re-load the FI. A General Reset
should then be issued or the RESETN pin used to reset the CMX7262 and the appropriate FI load
procedure followed.
Streaming C-BUS may be used to load the Audio In Data Word - $49 write register with the
Function Image™, and the Input Level - $4B read register used to ensure that the Audio In streaming
register is not allowed to overflow during the load process.
NOTE: The Input Level - $4B read register and the Output Level - $4F read register are valid only when
booting and must not be accessed at any other time.
The download time is limited by the clock frequency of the C-BUS; with a 5MHz SCLK it should take less
than 250ms to complete even when loading the largest possible Function Image™.

6.6.2 FI Loading from Serial Memory
The FI must be converted into a format for the serial memory programmer (normally Intel Hex) and loaded
into the serial memory by either the host or an external programmer. The serial memory should contain the
same data stream as written to the Audio In streaming register as shown in Figure 17. The most significant
byte of each 16-bit word should be stored first in serial memory.
The serial memory should be interfaced to the CMX7262 using SSOUT0 as the chip select and PCM port
pins, which act as an SPI port whilst booting (refer Section 3). Section 5.3 Serial Port Interface, shows the
connections required for interfacing a typical device such as the AT25F512 Serial Flash memory with the
CMX7262.
The CMX7262 needs to have the BOOTEN pins set to serial memory load, and then on power-on,
following the RESETN pin becoming high, or following a C-BUS General Reset, the CMX7262 will
automatically load the data from the serial memory without intervention from the host controller.

TWELP Vocoder                                                                                     CMX7262
6.7    TWELP Coding Format 1
This section provides a brief description about the TWELP voice coding standard. The motivation behind
the TWELP voice coding standard is to compress analogue voice in order to reduce the bandwidth
required to transmit it.
TWELP converts linear PCM data at 8 ksamples/s, into a 2.4 kbps coded bitstream (without FEC) or into a
3.6 kbps coded bitstream (with FEC). The coded bitstream is packed into bytes for efficient transfer to the
host, over the C-BUS interface.
TWELP technology uses unique proprietary signal decomposition and parameter encoding methods,
ensuring high quality voice at high compression ratios.
The TWELP Vocoder operates on a frame-by-frame basis. A frame is 20ms of voice data. Each 20ms
frame of voice data consists of 160 linear 16-bit PCM samples, sampled at 8kHz. Each frame of voice
data is converted into 48 bits of TWELP-coded frame (without FEC) or into 72 bits of TWELP-coded frame
(with FEC). 1, 2, 3 or 4 frames can be encoded at once. Interleaving is supported, with interleaver size
selectable from 1, 2, 3 or 4 frames.
When FEC is used, the integral FEC decoder can optionally use “soft-decision” metrics to improve its
decoding ability if the input can be applied as a 4-bit representation of the received demodulated signal.
The FEC can also be used on its own, so that data can be decoded/error-corrected then re-encoded and
forwarded on. This allows the CMX7262 to be used in in digital voice repeater systems.
6.8    Vocoder Frame / Packet Sizes
Packets of both raw and FEC-protected vocoder data are transferred between the device and the host
over the byte wide streaming C-BUS registers (Vocoder In and Vocoder Out registers).
TWELP Frame:
A frame is 20ms of voice data. It could be 160 linear PCM samples or, 6 bytes of raw TWELP-coded data
or, 9 bytes of TWELP-coded data with FEC.
TWELP Packet:
A packet is a combination of one or more frames. The CMX7262 can handle packets of up to 4 frames.
Packets of raw vocoder frames:
During raw encoding, each 20ms of audio is encoded into 48-bits of TWELP-coded frame. These bits are
packed into bytes for transfer over C-BUS. For details see Section 6.9 Data Transfer Using C-BUS
Interface. Table 3 shows all allowed packet sizes handled by the CMX7262. This is the amount of data that
the host should expect to read from the Vocoder Out register for each packet size, when encoding. This is
also the amount of data that CMX7262 expects to read from the Vocoder In register when decoding.
Packets of FEC-protected vocoder frames:
The CMX7262 has a built-in FEC system to protect the vocoder frames when transported over an error
prone channel. When FEC is enabled, data interleaving is automatically set to match the packet size.
Interleaving provides good performance over a channel with burst errors, typical in wireless applications.
FEC and interleaving is applied on a packet basis. Therefore, a complete packet must be presented in the
Vocoder In register for the decoder to start decoding.
When FEC is enabled, each 20ms of audio is encoded into 72-bits of TWELP-coded frame. These bits are
packed into bytes for transfer over C-BUS. For details see section 6.9 Data Transfer Using C-BUS
Interface. Table 3 shows all allowed packet sizes handled by the CMX7262. This is the amount of data that

the host should expect to read from the Vocoder Out register for each packet size, when encoding. This is
also the amount of data that the CMX7262 expects to read from the Vocoder In register when decoding.
The FEC decoder provides the possibility to operate with both “hard decision and “soft decision” inputs.
Hard Decision Input (Hard bits):
Hard bits are represented by one bit per bit. These are packed into 9 bytes for a single TWELP-coded
frame. For details see section 6.9 Data Transfer Using C-BUS Interface. A TWELP-coded packet consists
of 1/2/3/4 frames. Table 3 lists the number of bytes of hard bits for each packet size.
Soft Decision Input (Soft bits):
Each information bit in soft decision mode is represented by 4 bits:
                                  Decision value              Interpretation

In this case a TWELP-coded frame will be represented using 72x4 = 288 bits. These are packed into 36
bytes for a single TWELP-coded frame. For details see section 6.9 Data Transfer Using C-BUS Interface.

6.8.1 TWELP Packed Data Format
The CMX7262 handles 16-bit linear PCM samples as well as TWELP-coded data frames. Each TWELP-
coded data frame is 48-bits (without FEC) or 72-bits (with FEC). The TWELP-coded bitstream is packed
into bytes for efficient transfer into/out of CMX7262.
Raw Vocoder Packets
Without FEC, the TWELP encoder compresses 160 samples (20ms of audio at 8kHz sampling rate) into
48-bits. Groups of 8-bits are packed into data bytes. 6 packed bytes make a frame of TWELP-coded bits.
For data input to the CMX7262, packed bytes are written to the Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write register in
the following order:
The byte at the top is the first out of the Vocoder Out register for the encoder and the first into the Vocoder
In register for the decoder. The bits in a packet are named D0 through D47. The bits should be transmitted
in order starting with D0 and ending with D47.

FEC Protected Vocoder Packets
Hard Decision Packets
With FEC enabled, the TWELP encoder compresses 160 samples (20ms of audio at 8kHz sampling rate)
into 72-bits. Groups of 8-bits are packed into data bytes. With hard decision decoding, where each
information bit is represented using a single bit, 9 packed bytes make a frame of TWELP-coded bits.
For data input to the CMX7262, packed bytes are written to the Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write register in
the following order:
The byte at the top is the first out of the Vocoder Out register for the encoder and the first into the Vocoder
In register for the decoder. Groups of 1, 2, 3 or 4 frames make a TWELP-coded packet. The bits in a

Soft Decision Packets
With FEC enabled, the TWELP encoder compresses 160 samples (20ms of audio at 8kHz sampling rate)
into 72-bits. Groups of 8-bits are packed into data bytes. With soft decision decoding, where each
information bit is represented using 4 bits, 36 packed bytes (9x4) make a frame of TWELP-coded bits.
For data input to the CMX7262, packed bytes are written to the Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write register in
the following order:
The byte at the top is the first out of the Vocoder Out register for the encoder and the first into the Vocoder
In register for the decoder. Groups of 1, 2, 3 or 4 frames make a TWELP-coded packet. The bits in a
packet are named D0 through D287 (for maximum packet size of 4 frames). The bits should be
transmitted in order starting with D0 and ending with D287. The bits of a nibble are shown as n3 to n0, with
n3 being the most significant and n0 being the least significant.

The above ordering/packing also applies when the host is reading TWELP-coded frames from the
Vocoder Out Data Byte - $4C read register.
Linear PCM Samples
Linear PCM samples are always transferred using one 16-bit word per sample. Input is through the Audio
In Data Word - $49 write register. Output is through the Audio Out Data Word - $4D read register.

TWELP Vocoder                                                                                        CMX7262
6.9     Data Transfer Using C-BUS Interface
Data transferred over the C-BUS interface between CMX7262 and host is either TWELP-coded packets or
linear PCM samples. There are two sets of streaming registers to handle the two different data types:
         Audio In and Audio Out streaming registers (word wide) – to handle 16-bit linear PCM samples.
         Vocoder In and Vocoder Out streaming registers (byte wide) – to handle 8-bit TWELP-coded
          data.
Transfer of linear PCM samples:
Linear PCM samples are transferred to and from the host via the Audio In and Audio Out registers. The
Audio In and Audio Out registers are word wide streaming registers.
The Audio In and Audio Out streaming registers can hold one packet of linear PCM samples. A packet
may consist of one or more 20ms audio frames. The packet size is selectable using the VCFG - $55 write
register. Table 3 shows the number of linear PCM samples associated with each packet size.
The only exception is “Pass-through” mode, where a packet is defined as a single frame of 16 samples, for
both input and output.
Each Audio In / Audio Out word is 16-bits. The Audio In Data Word - $49 write and Audio Out Data Word -
$4D read registers can be accessed as a single read/write or using streaming C-BUS.
Transfer of vocoder data:
TWELP-coded packets are transferred to and from the host via the Vocoder In and Vocoder Out registers.
The Vocoder In and Vocoder Out registers are byte wide streaming registers.
The Vocoder In and Vocoder Out streaming registers can hold one packet of TWELP-coded data. A
packet may consist of one or more 20ms audio frames. The packet size is selected using the VCFG - $55
write register. Table 3 shows the number of coded bytes produced for various packet sizes.
Each Vocoder In / Vocoder Out word is 8-bits. The Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write and Vocoder Out
Data Byte - $4C read registers can be accessed as either a single read/write or using streaming C-BUS.
The Audio In data word register and Vocoder In data byte register are collectively referred to as the Input
Registers or C-BUS Input. Similarly, the Audio Out data word register and Vocoder Out data byte register
are collectively referred to as the Output Registers or C-BUS Output.
At any time only one input streaming register (Audio In OR Vocoder In register) can be used, along with
one output streaming register (Audio Out OR Vocoder Out register).
When operating in encode or decode mode the CMX7262 will actively copy the contents of the Audio In /
Vocoder In input registers into an internal buffer, called the “Input Buffer”. The Input Buffer has space for
one packet of data. Similarly, there is an internal “Output Buffer” which has space for one packet of data,
and is connected to the Audio Out / Vocoder Out registers.
On reset or on entry to any active mode (Encode / Decode / Pass-through / Enc-Dec / FEC Loop) the
CMX7262 Input and Output buffers will be empty – this means that initially two packets of data can be
written to the Audio In / Vocoder In input register and may be stored by the CMX7262. Similarly, there is
space in the CMX7262 for two output packets – one in the Audio Out / Vocoder Out output register and
one in the Output Buffer. Once this storage is full, the CMX7262 will stop processing data and will flag a
“Data Overflow” error using the Status - $7E read register.

TWELP Vocoder                                                                                            CMX7262
The registers that affect data transfer to/from C-BUS interface are:
        Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write
        Audio In Data Word - $49 write
        Vocoder Out Data Byte - $4C read
        Audio Out Data Word - $4D read
        Status - $7E read
The remainder of this section explains data transfer to and from the host using the C-BUS interface.
Operational Details when Decoding:
     1. At the start of an active operating mode, the host may initially write up to two packets of data
         without handshaking.
     2. When decoding, a whole packet must be received before processing can begin.
     3. When decoding the decoded result will become available once the entire packet has been
         processed.
     4. When decoding, the availability of the entire decoded packet in the Audio Out register may be
         determined using the Output Data Available (ODA) bit in the Status - $7E read register.
Operational Details when Encoding:
     1. At the start of an active operating mode, the host may initially write up to two packets of data in
         without handshaking.
     2. When encoding (regardless of the number of frames per packet) encoding will begin as soon as
         one frame is received.
     3. When encoding the encoded result will become available once a whole packet is processed.
     4. When encoding, the availability of a whole packet in the Vocoder Out register may be determined
         using the Output Data Available (ODA) bit in the Status - $7E read register.
     5. During encoding, when the CMX7262 begins processing the last frame in a packet, the Input Data
         Wanted (IDW) bit is set in the Status - $7E read register to indicate that the Audio In / Vocoder In
         input register is free to accept more input packets.
When the input data source is C-BUS:
     1. The operating mode (Encode / Decode / Pass-through / Enc-Dec / FEC Loop) must be selected
         using the VCTRL - $6B write register. Any write to the VCTRL - $6B write register will cause the
         Audio In and Vocoder In input registers and Input Buffer, along with the Audio Out and Vocoder
         Out output registers and the Output Buffer, to be flushed.
     2. The Audio Source field in the Audio Routing - $5D write register must be set to indicate that audio
         input is through the C-BUS interface.
     3. The host writes a packet of data to the Audio In / Vocoder In register (see Audio In Data Word -
         $49 write, Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write registers).
     4. Once a packet of data has been read by the CMX7262, the host will be signalled using the IDW
         (Input Data Wanted) bit in the Status - $7E read register. Initially it is possible to write two packets
         of data to the CMX7262 but after this time the host must wait until IDW is set before writing
         another packet of input data.
When the input data source is analogue audio input and the output data destination is C-BUS:
When the Audio Source is set to analogue audio, input data from the analogue audio input will be loaded
into the internal Input Buffer, without the host having to intervene in the data transfer process. The Audio
Source may be set to analogue audio input only when the CMX7262 is in Encode / Enc-Dec / Pass-
through mode.

TWELP Vocoder                                                                                         CMX7262
If the audio source is the analogue audio input, and the audio destination is C-BUS, the host must read the
output data quickly enough to maintain real-time constraints. Once started, the analogue audio input will
operate at an 8kHz sample rate regardless of the host C-BUS access rate. If the Vocoder Out register is
not read quickly enough by the host a data overflow will occur, which the CMX7262 will indicate to the host
using the Status - $7E read register.
When the output data destination is C-BUS:
     1. The operating mode (Encode / Decode / Pass-through / Enc-Dec / FEC Loop) must be selected
          using VCTRL - $6B write register. Any write to this register will cause the Audio In and Vocoder In
          input registers and Input Buffer, along with the Audio Out and Vocoder Out output registers and
          the Output Buffer, to be flushed.
     2. Once a packet of input has been processed, the CMX7262 places the output data in the Audio Out
          / Vocoder Out register and signals the host using the ODA (Output Data Available) bit in the Status
          - $7E read register, On ODA being set, the host can read an entire packet from the Audio Out /
          Vocoder Out register.
When the output data destination is - analogue audio output and audio source is C-BUS:
When the Audio Destination is set to analogue audio output, the data in the output buffer will be sent to the
analogue audio output, without the host having to intervene in the data transfer process. The audio
destination may be set to analogue audio output only when the CMX7262 is in Decode / Enc-Dec / Pass-
through mode.
If the audio destination is analogue audio output, and the audio source is C-BUS, the host must provide
input data to the C-BUS quickly enough to maintain real-time constraints. Once started, the analogue
audio output will operate at an 8kHz sample rate regardless of the host C-BUS access rate. If the C-BUS
Vocoder In register is not written quickly enough by the host a data underflow will occur, which the
CMX7262 will indicate to the host using the Status - $7E read register.
Figure 19 illustrates operation when data is transferred into the CMX7262 using C-BUS input. Figure 20
illustrates operation when data is transferred from the CMX7262.

6.10 Noise Reduction
The TWELP Encoder in CMX7262 contains a built-in propriety noise suppression algorithm that can be
activated optionally. The level of noise suppression can be controlled using the Noise Suppression - $53
write register.
6.11 Noise Gate
The output from the TWELP decoder may optionally be passed through a noise gate that fully mutes the
audio output signal while it is below a configurable amplitude threshold. Noise suppression is different and
complementary; it is an encoder process that significantly reduces, but may not completely eliminate,
background noise. Accordingly the decoder noise gate and encoder noise suppression functions work well
in conjunction.
Noise Gate is active in Decode and Enc-Dec modes only.
The noise gate is controlled by the Threshold and Delay fields in the Noise Gate Configuration - $5E write
register.
6.12 Device Control
Once the Function Image™ is loaded, the CMX7262 can be set to one of its operating modes using the
VCTRL - $6B write register:
        Idle mode – for configuration or low-power operation.
        Encode mode – for encoding from linear PCM into TWELP-coded frames.
        Decode mode – for decoding from TWELP-coded frames into linear PCM samples.
        Enc-Dec mode – a test mode which encodes linear PCM to TWELP audio format and then
         decodes it again – providing the ability to evaluate audio quality.
        Pass Thru – simply passes the audio from source port to destination port. Source and destination
         ports are set using VCTRL - $6B write register.
        FEC Loop – for decoding just the FEC in a TWELP-coded packet, in order to correct any bit
         errors, and re-apply the FEC on the error corrected bit stream.
These modes are described in the following sections. All control is carried out over the C-BUS interface:
either directly to operational registers or, for parameters that are not likely to change during operation,
using the Programming Register - $6A write in idle mode.
To conserve power when the device is not actively processing a signal, place the device into idle mode.
Additional power saving can be achieved by disabling unused hardware blocks. However, most of the
hardware power saving is automatic. Note that the BIAS block must be enabled to allow any of the
Analogue Input or Output blocks to function. It is only possible to write to the Programming register whilst
in Idle mode. See:
        Programming Register - $6A write
        VCTRL - $6B write
        Programming Register Operation
        Bias Control - $B7 write.
6.12.1 Normal Operation Overview
In normal operation (after the CMX7262 is configured), the required mode must be selected and correctly
formatted data input and read out. This process is carried out by specifying the input audio source and
output audio destination and selecting the type of operation (Encode/Decode/Enc-Dec/Pass-through/FEC
Loop). Such options are required to be configured correctly before encoding/decoding can begin.

TWELP Vocoder                                                                                     CMX7262
For continuous operation, data must be transferred into and out of the CMX7262. Audio transfer into the
CMX7262 can be through the analogue audio input or, the host can feed in the data using C-BUS
streaming registers. Similarly, the output can be transferred out of the CMX7262 using the analogue audio
output or, to the host using the C-BUS streaming registers.
C-BUS transfers use the Audio In/Vocoder In streaming registers to transfer data into the CMX7262, and
the Audio Out/Vocoder Out streaming registers to transfer data out of the CMX7262. The Status register is
used to indicate that the data has been dealt with, or if more data is wanted. The CMX7262 can be
configured to interrupt the host when it is ready to accept more data or when there is a packet of data
ready to be read.
During active operation, the most significant registers are:
       VCTRL - $6B write
       Status - $7E read
       IRQ Enable - $6C write
       Audio In Data Word - $49 write
       Vocoder In Data Byte - $48 write
       Audio Out Data Word - $4D read
       Vocoder Out Data Byte - $4C read
6.12.2 Vocoder Operation
The CMX7262 has many features which allows the device to offer significant flexibility. However, basic
encoding or decoding can be carried out by understanding the operation of just a few registers.
Basic Operation

coded frames when the input comes from Audio In FIFO and the output is sent to the Vocoder Out FIFO:

The procedure described above can be adapted, to achieve different Decoding / Pass-through / FEC Loop
modes, with different input and output ports. Encoding from the linear PCM samples to TWELP-coded
frames will continue as long as there is enough input data and the mode bits (b2-0) of VCTRL - $6B write
register have not changed. The registers used for basic operation are:
        VCTRL - $6B write
        VCFG - $55 write
        Status - $7E read
        Audio In Data Word - $49 write
        Vocoder Out Data Byte - $4C read
The basic encoding operation described above is illustrated by Figure 21.

6.12.3 Device Configuration (Using the Programming Register)
While in idle mode the Programming register becomes active, providing access to the Program Blocks.
Program Blocks allow additional configuration of the CMX7262. Features that can be configured include:
         Configuration of the CMX7262 to operate with a non-default XTAL input frequency.
Full details of how to configure the programming register are given in Section 9 in the User Manual.
6.12.4 Device Configuration (Using dedicated registers)
Some device features may be configured using dedicated registers. This allows for configuration when the
device is not in idle mode. Configuration of the following features is possible:
         Gain, power saving and muting of the analogue audio output
         Gain, power saving and muting of the analogue audio input
         Gain and muting of linear PCM signals. i.e., the input signal in Encoder / Enc-Dec / Pass-through
          modes OR the output signal in Decoder mode
         Decoder Noise Gate – noise threshold and gate activation delay
The registers that allow configuration of these features are:
         AIG - $B1 write
         AOG1 - $B4 write
         AOG2 - $B5 write
         AOG3 - $B6 write
         ANAOUT Config - $B3 write
         ANAIN Config - $B0 write.
         Fine Gain - $5B write
         Noise Gate Configuration - $5E write
6.12.5 Interrupt Operation
The CMX7262 can produce an interrupt output when various events occur. Examples of such events
include when the vocoder has finished processing and has the output data available, or when the vocoder
is ready to accept more input data or an output overflow when processing audio data.
Each event has an associated Status register bit and an Interrupt Mask register bit. The Interrupt Mask
register is used to select which status events will trigger an interrupt on the IRQN line. Events can be
masked using the IRQ mask bit (bit 15) or individually masked using the Interrupt Mask register. Enabling
an interrupt by setting a mask bit (01) after the corresponding Status register bit has already been set to
1 will also cause an interrupt on the IRQN line. The IRQ bit (bit 15) of the Status register reflects the IRQN
line state.
All interrupt flag bits in the Status register are cleared and the interrupt request is cleared following the
command/address phase of a C-BUS read of the Status register. See:
         Status - $7E read
         IRQ Enable - $6C write.

6.13 Signal Level Optimisation
The internal signal processing of the CMX7262 will operate with wide dynamic range and low distortion
only if the signal level at all stages in the signal processing chain is kept within the recommended limits.
For a device working from a 3.3V supply, the signal range which can be accommodated without distortion
is specified in 7.1.3 Operating Characteristics. Signal gain and dc offset can be manipulated as follows:
6.13.1 Audio Output Path Levels
The signals output from ANAOUT DAC have independent gain controls. The Fine Output adjustment has
a maximum attenuation of 6dB and no gain, whereas the Coarse Output adjustment has a variable
attenuation of up to 14.2dB and 6dB gain.
The ANAOUT signals may be independently inverted. Inversion is achieved by selecting a negative value
for the (linear) Fine Output adjustment.
See:
         Fine Gain - $5B write.
         ANAOUT Config - $B3 write.
         AOG1 - $B4 write
         AOG2 - $B5 write.
         AOG3 - $B6 write.
6.13.2 Audio Input Path Levels
The Coarse Input has a variable gain of up to +22.4dB and no attenuation. With the lowest gain setting
(0dB), the maximum allowable input signal level at the ANAIN pins is specified in section 7.1.3 Operating
Characteristics.
A Fine Input level adjustment is provided, although the CMX7262 should operate correctly with the default
level selected. Inversion is achieved by selecting a negative value for the (linear) Fine Input gain
adjustment.
It should be noted that if the maximum allowable signal input level is exceeded, signal distortion will occur
regardless of the internal attenuation.
See:
         Fine Gain - $5B write.
         ANAIN Config - $B0 write
         AIG - $B1 write.

Notes:       61. Depending on the command, 1, 2 or more bytes of CDATA are sent to CMX7262 MSB first,
                  LSB (Bit 0) last. RDATA is read from CMX7262 MSB first, LSB (Bit 0) last.
             62. Commands are acted upon between the last rising edge of SCLK of each command and the
                  rising edge of the CSN signal.
             63. The CMX7262 is able to work with SCLK pulses starting and ending at either polarity.
These timings are for the latest version of streaming C-BUS and allow faster transfers than the original C-
BUS timing specification. The CMX7262 can be used in conjunction with devices that comply with the
slower timings, subject to system throughput constraints.

About FirmASIC
CML’s proprietary FirmASIC component technology reduces cost, time to market and development risk,
with increased flexibility for the designer and end application. FirmASIC combines Analogue, Digital,
Firmware and Memory technologies in a single silicon platform that can be focused to deliver the right
feature mix, performance and price for a target application family. Specific functions of a FirmASIC
device are determined by uploading its Function Image™ during device initialization.                                          New
Function Images™ may be later provided to supplement and enhance device functions, expanding or
modifying end-product features without the need for expensive and time-consuming design changes.
FirmASIC devices provide significant time to market and commercial benefits over Custom ASIC,
Structured ASIC, FPGA and DSP solutions. They may also be exclusively customised where security or
intellectual property issues prevent the use of Application Specific Standard Products (ASSP’s).
