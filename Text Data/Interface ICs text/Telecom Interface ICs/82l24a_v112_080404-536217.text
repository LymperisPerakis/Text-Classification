   5       TxClk_0         I   Transmitter_n Clock Input: E1 rate at 2.048MHz ± 50ppm.
  21       TxClk_1             During normal operation both in Host Mode and Hardware Mode, TxClk is used
  55       TxClk_2             for sampling input data at TxPOS/TData and TxNEG, while MCLK is used as
  71       TxClk_3             the timing reference for the transmit pulse shaping circuit. If TxClk is active
                               while MClk is not present, TxPOS and TxNEG accepts NRZ data input and the
                               transmit pulse width is determined by TxClk clock duty cycle. If TxClk is tied to
                               “Low”, TxPOS and TxNEG input accepts RZ data format and the pulse width is
                               determined by the duty cycle of the input data. In RZ Mode, single-rail data for-
                               mat is not supported.
                               In Hardware Mode, if TxClk is tied "High" for more than 10 µs, then TAOS (a
                               continuous all one's AMI signal) will be transmitted to the line using MCLK as
                               timing reference.
                               If TxClk_0 is tied “Low” for more than 10 µs, the transmitter will be powered
                               down and the output will be tri-stated.
  14       TxOFF_0         I   Powered-down Transmitter_n:
  15       TxOFF_1             In Hardware Mode, tie this pin "High" to power-down channel 0 transmitter and
  16       TxOFF_2             set TTIP_n and TRing_n to high impedance.
  17       TxOFF_3             NOTE: Internally pulled -up with a 50kΩ resistor.

                            In Hardware Mode, the parallel Microprocessor interface is disabled and
                            enables all hardware control pin functions.
                            In Host Mode, the parallel microprocessor interface pins are used for control

                            Input clock for synchronous microprocessor operation. Maximum clock rate is
                            16 MHz. This pin is internally pulled-up for asynchronous microprocessor inter-
                         I  face when no clock is present.
             Codes          Coding/Decoding Select.
                            In Hardware Mode, if single-rail data format is selected (pin 8 =”1”), connect
                            this pin "High" to select AMI encoding and decoding. Connect this pin Low to
                            select HDB3.

                            With Intel bus timing, a Low pulse on WR selects a write operation when CS pin
                            is Low. When configured in Motorola bus timing, a "High" pulse on R/W selects
                            a read operation and a Low pulse on R/W selects a write operation when CS is
                            Low.
  15        RD_DS        I  Read Input (Data Strobe).
                            With Intel bus timing, a Low pulse on RD selects a read operation when CS pin
                            is Low. When configured in Motorola bus timing, a Low pulse on DS indicates a
                            read or write operation when CS pin is Low.
  16        ALE_AS       I  Address Latch Input (Address Strobe).
                            With Intel bus timing, the address inputs are latched into the internal register on
                            the falling edge of ALE. When configured in Motorola bus timing, the address
                            inputs are latched into the internal register on the falling edge of AS.
  17          CS         I  Chip Select Input.
                            This signal must be Low in order to access the parallel port.

   PCLK   Process Clock Input: Input clock for synchronous microprocessor operation. Maximum clock speed is
          16MHz. This pin is internally pulled up for asynchronous microprocessor operation if no clock is present.
 ALE_AS   Address Latch Input (Address Strobe): With Intel bus timing, the address inputs are latched into the inter-
          nal register on the falling edge of ALE. When configured in Motorola bus timing, the address inputs are
          latched into the internal register on the falling edge of AS.
    CS    Chip Select Input: This signal must be low in order to access the parallel port.
  RD_DS   Read Input (Data Strobe): With Intel bus timing, a low pulse on RD selects a read operation when CS pin
          is low. When configured in Motorola bus timing, a low pulse on DS indicates a read or write operation
          when CS pin is low.
 WR_R/W   Write Input (Read/Write): With Intel bus timing, a low pulse on WR selects a write operation when CS pin
          is low. When configured in Motorola bus timing, a high pulse on R/W selects a read operation and a low
          pulse on R/W selects a write operation when CS pin is low.
RDY_DTACK Ready Output (Data Transfer Acknowledge Output): With Intel bus timing, RDY is asserted high to indi-
          cate the device has completed a read or write operation. When configured in Motorola bus timing, DTACK
          is asserted low to indicate the device has completed a read or write operation.
    INT   Interrupt Output: This pin is asserted low to indicate an interrupt caused by an alarm condition in the
          device status registers. The activation of this pin can be blocked by the interrupt status register bit.

                         Writing a "1" to this bit longer than 10µs initiates a device reset
                         through the microprocessor interface. All internal circuits are
