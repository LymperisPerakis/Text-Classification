   1    66    OSC1  Oscillator Input. This pin is either connected via a 20.000 MHz crystal to OSC2 where a
                    crystal is used, or is directly driven when a 20.000 MHz oscillator is employed (see
                    Figures 6 and 7). CMOS input switching level.
   2    67    OSC2  Oscillator Output. Not suitable for driving other devices.

                    bit MSN (page 01H, address 1AH, bit 1) is set to 1. If MSN=0, the position of the valid
                    and tristated nibbles is reversed.
                    (ii) A 64 kb/s output when the 64 KHz common channel signalling option is selected
                    (page 01H, address 1AH, bit 0, 64KCCS =1) for channel 16.
   6    71     CSTi Control ST-BUS Input. CSTi carries one of the following two serial streams for CAS and

Device Overview
The MT9075B is an advanced PCM 30 framer with an on-chip Line Interface Unit (LIU) that meets or supports the
latest ITU-T Recommendations for PCM 30 and ISDN primary rate including G.703, G.704, G.706, G.775, G.796,
G.732, G.823 and I.431. It also meets or supports the layer 1 requirements of ETSI ETS 300 011, ETS 300 166,
ETS 300 233 and BS6450.
The Line Interface Unit (LIU) of the MT9075B interfaces the digital framer functions to the PCM 30 transformer-
isolated four wire line. The transmit portion of the MT9075B LIU consists of a digital buffer, a digital-to-analog
converter and a differential line driver. The receiver portion of the LIU consists of an input signal peak detector, an
optional two-stage equalizer, a smoothing filter, data and clock slicers and a clock extractor. The optional equalizer
allows for error free reception of data with a line attenuation of up to 20 dB.
The LIU also contains a Jitter Attenuator (JA), which can be configured to either the transmit or receive path. The
JA will attenuate jitter from 2.5 Hz and roll-off at a rate of 20 dB/decade. Its intrinsic jitter is less than 0.02 UI.

                                                        MT9075B                                           Data Sheet
The digital portion of the MT9075B connects an incoming stream of time multiplexed PCM channels (at
2.048 Mbit/s) to the transmit payload of the E1 trunk, while the receive payload is connected to the ST-BUS or GCI
2.048 Mbit/s backplane bus for both data and signalling. Control, reporting and conditioning of the line is
implemented via a parallel microprocessor interface. The MT9075B framing algorithm allows automatic
interworking between CRC-4 and non-CRC-4 interfaces.
The Sa bits can be accessed by the MT9075B in the following four ways:
•   Single byte registers;
•   Five byte transmit and receive national bit buffers;
•   Data link pins TxDL, RxDL, RxDLCLK and TxDLCLK;
•   HDLC Controller with a 128 byte FIFO.
The MT9075B operates in either termination or transparent modes selectable via software control. In the
termination mode the CRC-4 calculation is performed as part of the framing algorithm. In the transmit transparent
mode, no framing or signalling is imposed on the data transmit from DSTi on the line. In addition, the MT9075B
optionally allows the data link maintenance channel to be modified and updates the CRC-4 remainder bits to reflect
the modification. All channel, framing and signalling data passes through the device unaltered. This is useful for
intermediate point applications of a PCM 30 link where the data link data is modified, but the error information
transported by the CRC-4 bits must be passed to the terminating end. In the receive transparent mode, the
received line data is channelled to DSTo with framing operations disabled, consequently, the data passes through
the slip buffer and drives DSTo with an arbitrary alignment.
The MT9075B has a comprehensive suite of status, alarm, performance monitoring and reporting features. These
include counters for BPVs, CRC errors, E-bit errors, errored frame alignment signals, BERT, and RAI and
continuous CRC errors. Also, included are transmission error insertion for BPVs, CRC-4 errors, frame and non-
frame alignment signal errors, payload errors and loss of signal errors.
A complete set of loopback functions is provided, which includes digital, remote, ST-BUS, payload, metallic, local
and remote time slot.
The MT9075B also contains a comprehensive set of maskable interrupts and an interrupt vector function. Interrupt
sources consist of synchronization status, alarm status, counter indication and overflow, timer status, slip indication,
maintenance functions and receive channel associated signalling bit changes. A special set of maskable interrupts
have been included for sensing changes in the state of the national use bits and nibbles, in compliance to emerging
ETS requirements.
The MT9075B system timing may be slaved to the line, operated in freerun mode, or controlled by an external
timing source.

Receiver
The receiver portion of the MT9075B LIU consists of an input signal peak detector, an optional two-stage equalizer,
a smoothing filter, adaptive threshold comparators, data and clock slicers, and a clock extractor. Receive
equalization gain can be set via software control or it can be determined automatically by the peak detectors.
The output of the receive equalizer is conditioned by a smoothing filter and is passed on to the clock and data slicer.
The clock slicer output signal drives a phase locked loop, which generates the extracted clock (E2o). This extracted
clock is used to sample the output of the data comparator.
The LOS output pin (pin 61 in PLCC, pin 57 in MQFP) is user selectable, by setting control bit LOS/LOF (page 02H,
register 13H, bit 2), to indicate a loss of signal or loss of basic frame synchronization condition. In addition, a status

bit, LLOS (bit 4 in page 3, register 18H) is provided to indicate the presence of a loss signal condition. The
occurrence of a loss signal condition is defined as per I.431, i.e., when the incoming signal amplitude is more than
20 dB below the nominal amplitude for a time duration of at least 1 ms.
The receive LIU circuit requires a terminating resistor of either 120  or 75  across the device side of the
receive1:1 transformer as shown in Figure 4. The return loss of the receiver, complying with G.703, is greater
than:
•   12 dB from 51 kHz to 102 kHz;
•   18 dB from 102 kHz to 2048 kHz;
•   14 dB from 2048 kHz to 3072 kHz.
The jitter tolerance of the MT9075B clock extractor circuit exceeds the requirements of G.823 (Figure 3).
Transmitter
The MT9075B differential line driver is designed to drive a 1:2 step-up transformer (see Figure 4). A 0.68 uF
capacitor is required between the TTIP and the transmit transformer. Resistors RT (as shown in Figure 4) are for
termination for transmit return loss. The values of RT may be optimized for 120  lines, 75  lines or set at an
intermediary value to serve both applications. Program the Transmit Pulse Control Word (address 1FH page 1) to
adjust the pulse amplitude accordingly. Alternatively, the pulse level and shape may be discretely programmed by
writing to the Customer Pulse Level registers (addresses 1CH to 1FH, page 2) and setting the Custom Transmit
Pulse bit high (bit 3 of the Transmit Pulse Control Word).

Jitter Attenuator (JA)
The MT9075B Jitter Attenuator (JA), which consists of a Phase Locked Loop (PLL) and data FIFO, can be used on
either the transmit or receive side of the interface.
On the transmit side the C4b signal clocks the data into the FIFO, the PLL de-jitters the C4b clock and the resulting
clean C4b signal clocks the data out of the FIFO.
When the JA is selected on the receive side, the extracted clock signal clocks the data into the FIFO. The same
clock feeds the PLL and the resulting de-jittered clock is used to clock the data out of the FIFO.
The JA meets the jitter transfer characteristics as proposed by G.823 and the relevant recommendations as
shown in Figure 8. The JA FIFO depth can be selected to be from 16 to 128 words deep, in multiples of 16 (2-
bit) words. Its read pointer can be centered by changing the JFC bit (address 18H of page 02H) to provide
maximum jitter tolerance. If the read pointer should come within 4 bits of either end of the FIFO, the read clock
frequency will be increased or decreased by 0.0625 UI to correct the situation. The maximum time needed to
centre is Tmax= 3904Depth ns, where Depth is the selected JA FIFO depth. During this time the JA will not
attenuate jitter.
To ensure normal operation, the JA FIFO depth should be set in software to be larger than the anticipated maximum
UI of input jitter.
Clock Jitter Attenuation Modes
MT9075B has three basic jitter attenuation modes of operation, selected by the BS/LS and BL/FR control pins.
•   System Bus Synchronous Mode
•   Line Synchronous Mode
•   Free-run mode

                                                   Table 2 - Selection of Clock Jitter Attenuation Modes
Depending on the mode selected, the Jitter Attenuator (JA) can attenuate either transmit clock jitter or receive
clock jitter, or be disconnected. Control bits JAS, JAT/JAR (address 18H of page 02H) determine the JA
selection under certain modes. Table 2 shows the configuration of related control pins and control bits required
to place the MT9075B in the appropriate jitter attenuation mode.
Referring to the mode names given in Table 2, the basic operation of the jitter attenuation modes is summarized
                                                 Frequency (Hz)
as follows:
•   In SysBusSync (1-3) modes, pins C4b and F0b are always configured as inputs, while in the Line
    Synchronous and Free-Run modes C4b and F0b are configured as outputs.
•   In SysBusSync1 mode, an external clock is applied to C4b. The applied clock is dejittered by the internal
    PLL before being used to transmit data. The clock extracted (with no jitter attenuation performed) from the
    receive data can be monitored on pin E2o.

•   In SysBusSync2 mode, the clock applied to pin C4b is assumed to be jitter-free and is directly used to
    transmit data. The internal PLL is used to dejitter the extracted receive clock. The dejittered receive clock is
    output on pin E2o.
•   In SysBusSync3 mode, no jitter attenuation is applied to either the transmit or receive clocks. The transmit
    data is synchronized to clock applied to pin C4b. The extracted receive clock is not dejittered and is supplied
    directly to the E2o output.
•   In Line Synchronous mode, the clock extracted from the receive data is dejittered using the internal PLL and
    then output on pin C4b. Pin E2o provides the extracted receive clock before it has been dejittered. The
    transmit data is synchronous to the clean receive clock.
•   In Free-Run mode the transmit data is synchronized to the internally generated clock. The internal clock is
    output on pin C4b. The clock signal extracted from the receive data is not dejittered and is output directly on
    pin E2o.
The PCM 30 Interface
PCM 30 (E1) basic frames are 256 bits long and are transmitted at a frame repetition rate of 8000 Hz, which
results in an aggregate bit rate of 256 bits x 8000/sec = 2.048 Mbits/sec. The actual bit rate is 2.048 Mbits/sec
+/-50 ppm encoded in HDB3 format. The HDB3 control bit (page 01H, address 15H, bit 5) selects either HDB3
encoding or alternate mark inversion (AMI) encoding. Basic frames are divided into 32 time slots numbered 0 to
31, see Figure 30. Each time slot is 8 bits in length and is transmitted most significant bit first (numbered bit 1). This
results in a single time slot data rate of 8 bits x 8000/sec. = 64 kbits/sec.
It should be noted that the Zarlink ST-BUS also has 32 channels numbered 0 to 31, but the most significant bit
of an eight bit channel is numbered bit 7 (see Zarlink Application Note MSAN-126). Therefore, ST-BUS bit 7 is
synonymous with PCM 30 bit 1; bit 6 with bit 2: and so on (Figure 31).
PCM 30 time slot 0 is reserved for basic frame alignment, CRC-4 multiframe alignment and the communication
of maintenance information. In most configurations time slot 16 is reserved for either Channel Associated Signalling
(CAS or ABCD bit signalling) or Common Channel Signalling (CCS). The remaining 30 time slots are called
channels and carry either PCM encoded voice signals or digital data. Channel alignment and bit numbering is
consistent with time slot alignment and bit numbering. However, channels are numbered 1 to 30 and relate to time
slots as per Table 3.

Basic Frame Alignment
Time slot 0 of every basic frame is reserved for basic frame alignment and contains either a Frame Alignment
Signal (FAS) or a Non-Frame Alignment Signal (NFAS). FAS and NFAS occur in time slot zero of consecutive basic
frames as shown in Table 7. Bit two is used to distinguish between FAS (bit two = 0) and NFAS (bit two = 1).
Basic frame alignment is initiated by a search for the bit sequence 0011011 which appears in the last seven bit
positions of the FAS, see the Frame Algorithm section. Bit position one of the FAS can be either a CRC-4 remainder
bit or an international usage bit.
Bits four to eight of the NFAS (i.e., Sa4 - Sa8) are additional spare bits which may be used as follows:
•   Sa4 to Sa8 may be used in specific point-to-point applications (e.g. transcoder equipments conforming to
    G.761).
•   Sa4 may be used as a message-based data link for operations, maintenance and performance monitoring.

•   Sa5 to Sa8 are for national usage.
A maintenance channel or data link at 4,8,12,16,or 20 kHz for selected Sa bits is provided by the MT9075B to
implement these functions. Note that for simplicity all Sa bits including Sa4 are collectively called national bits
throughout this document.
Bit three (designated as “A”), the Remote Alarm Indication (RAI), is used to indicate the near end basic frame
synchronization status to the far end of a link. Under normal operation, the A (RAI) bit should be set to 0, while in
alarm condition, it is set to 1.
Bit position one of the NFAS can be either a CRC-4 multiframe alignment signal, an E-bit or an international usage
bit. Refer to an approvals laboratory and national standards bodies for specific requirements.
CRC-4 Multiframing
The primary purpose for CRC-4 multiframing is to provide a verification of the current basic frame alignment,
although it can also be used for other functions such as bit error rate estimation. The CRC-4 multiframe consists of
16 basic frames numbered 0 to 15, and has a repetition rate of 16 frames X 125 microseconds/frame = 2 msec.
CRC-4 multiframe alignment is based on the 001011 bit sequence, which appears in bit position one of the first six
NFASs of a CRC-4 multiframe.
The CRC-4 multiframe is divided into two submultiframes, numbered 1 and 2, which are each eight basic frames or
2048 bits in length.
The CRC-4 frame alignment verification functions as follows. Initially, the CRC-4 operation must be activated
and CRC-4 multiframe alignment must be achieved at both ends of the link. At the local end of a link, all the bits
of every transmit submultiframe are passed through a CRC-4 polynomial (multiplied by X4 then divided by X4 +
X + 1), which generates a four bit remainder. This remainder is inserted in bit position one of the four FASs of
the following submultiframe before it is transmitted (see Table 7).
The submultiframe is then transmitted and, at the far end, the same process occurs. That is, a CRC-4 remainder is
generated for each received submultiframe. These bits are compared with the bits received in position one of the
four FASs of the next received submultiframe. This process takes place in both directions of transmission.
When more than 914 CRC-4 errors (out of a possible 1000) are counted in a one second interval, the framing
algorithm will force a search for a new basic frame alignment. See Frame Algorithm section for more details.
The result of the comparison of the received CRC-4 remainder with the locally generated remainder will be
transported to the far end by the E-bits. Therefore, if E1 = 0, a CRC-4 error was discovered in a submultiframe 1
received at the far end; and if E2 = 0, a CRC-4 error was discovered in a submultiframe 2 received at the far end.
No submultiframe sequence numbers or re-transmission capabilities are supported with layer 1 PCM 30 protocol.
See ITU-T G.704 and G.706 for more details on the operation of CRC-4 and E-bits.
There are two CRC multiframe alignment algorithm options selected by the AUTC control bit (address 11H, page
01H). When AUTC is zero and CSYN is zero, automatic CRC-to-non-CRC interworking is selected, if CRC-4
multiframe alignment is not found in 400 msec, the status bit CRCIWK (page 03H, address 10H) is set low and no
further attempt to achieve CRC-4 synchronization is made as long as the device remains in terminal frame
synchronization. When AUTC is one and CSYN is zero, a reframe will be initiated every 8 msec if the MT9075B
achieves terminal frame synchronization, but fails to achieve CRC-4 synchronization. In this case, if ARAI is low,
RAI will flicker high with every reframe. If CRC MFAI is unsuccessful after 400ms, RAI will stay high continuously.
The control bit for transmit E bits (TE, bit 4 at address 16H of page 01H) will have the same function in both states
of AUTC. That is, when CRC-4 synchronization is not achieved the state of the transmit E-bits will be the same as
the state of the TE control bit. When CRC-4 synchronization is achieved the transmit E-bits will function as per ITU-
T G.704. Table 4 outlines the operation of the AUTC, ARAI and TALM control bits of the MT9075B.

CAS Signalling Multiframing
The purpose of the signalling multiframing algorithm is to provide a scheme that will allow the association of a
specific ABCD signalling nibble with the appropriate PCM 30 channel. Time slot 16 is reserved for the
communication of Channel Associated Signalling (CAS) information (i.e., ABCD signalling bits for up to 30
channels). Refer to ITU-T G.704 and G.732 for more details on CAS multiframing requirements.
A CAS signalling multiframe consists of 16 basic frames (numbered 0 to 15), which results in a multiframe repetition
rate of 2 msec. It should be noted that the boundaries of the signalling multiframe may be completely distinct from
those of the CRC-4 multiframe. CAS multiframe alignment is based on a multiframe alignment signal (a 0000 bit
sequence), which occurs in the most significant nibble of time slot 16 of basic frame 0 of the CAS multiframe. Bit 6
of this time slot is the multiframe alarm bit (usually designated Y). When CAS multiframing is acquired on the
receive side, the transmit Y-bit is zero; when CAS multiframing is not acquired, the transmit Y-bit is one. Bits 5, 7
and 8 (usually designated X) are spare bits and are normally set to one if not used.
Time slot 16 of the remaining 15 basic frames of the CAS multiframe (i.e., basic frames 1 to 15) are reserved for the
ABCD signalling bits for the 30 payload channels. The most significant nibbles are reserved for channels 1 to 15
and the least significant nibbles are reserved for channels 16 to 30. That is, time slot 16 of basic frame 1 has ABCD
for channel 1 and 16, time slot 16 of basic frame 2 has ABCD for channel 2 and 17, through to time slot 16 of basic
frame 15 has ABCD for channel 15 and 30.

MT9075B Access and Control
Register Access
The control and status of the MT9075B is achieved through a non-multiplexed parallel microprocessor port. The
parallel port may be configured for Motorola style control signals (by setting pin INT/MOT low) or Intel style control
signals (by setting pin INT/MOT high).
The controlling microprocessor gains access to specific registers of the MT9075B through a two step process. First,
writing to the internal Command/Address Register (CAR) selects one of the 18 pages of control and status registers
(CAR address: AC4 = 0, AC3-AC0 = don't care, CAR data D7 - D0 = page number). Second, each page has a
maximum of 16 registers that are addressed on a read or write to a non-CAR address (non-CAR: address AC4 = 1,
AC3-AC0 = register address, D7-D0 = data). Once a page of memory is selected, it is only necessary to write to the
CAR when a different page is to be accessed. See Figures 11 and 12 for timing requirements.
Please note that for microprocessors with read/write cycles less than 200 ns, a wait state or a dummy operation (for
C programming) between two successive read/write operations to the HDLC FIFO is required.
Table 5 associates the MT9075B control and status pages with access and page descriptions.

channel associated signalling bits (e.g., ITU-T R1 and R2 signalling), and when control bit RPSIG (page 01H,

Transmit AIS Operation
The pin TAIS (Transmit AIS, pin 60 in PLCC, pin 48 in MQFP) allows an all ones signal to be transmitted from the
point of power-up without the need to write any control registers. During this time the IRQ pin is tristated. After the
interface has been initialized normal operation can take place by making TAIS high.
National Bit Buffers
Table 7 shows the contents of the transmit and receive Frame Alignment Signals (FAS) and Non-frame Alignment
Signals (NFAS) of time slot zero of a PCM 30 signal. Even numbered frames (CRC Frame # 0, 2, 4,...) are FASs
and odd numbered frames (CRC Frame # 1, 3, 5,...) are NFASs. The bits of each channel are numbered 1 to 8, with
bit 1 being the most significant and bit 8 the least significant.

Note that the Data Link (DL) pin functions, if selected, override the transmit national bit buffer function.
The CRC-4 Alignment status CALN (page 03H, address 12H) and maskable interrupt CALNI (page 01H, address
1DH) indicate the beginning of every received CRC-4 multiframe.
Maskable interrupts are available for change of state of Sa5 bits or change of state of Sa6 nibbles. By writing the
proper control bits, an interrupt can be generated on a change of state of any Sa bit (except Sa4 - normally reserved
for the data link), or any nibbles for Sa5 through Sa8. See the description of page 01H, address 19H for more details.
In addition, the transparent transmission of channel 0 is supported to meet the ETS requirement. Selectable on a bit
by bit basis, Sa bits in channel 0 DSTi data can be programmed using register 17H of page 01H to be sent
transparently onto the line.
Data Link Operation
Timeslot 0
The MT9075B has a user defined 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 kbit/s data link for transport of maintenance and performance
monitoring information across the PCM 30 link. This channel functions using the Sa bits (Sa4~Sa8) of the PCM 30
timeslot zero non-frame alignment signal (NFAS). Since the NFAS is transmitted every other frame - a periodicity of
250 microseconds - the aggregate bit rate is a multiple of 4 kb/s. As there are five Sa bits independently available
for this data link, the bit rate will be 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 kb/s, depending on the bits selected for the Data Link (DL).
The Sa bits used for the DL are selected by setting the appropriate bits, Sa4~Sa8, to one in the Data Link Select
Word (page 01H, address 10H, bits 4-0). Access to the DL is provided by pins TxDLCLK, TxDL, RxDLCLK and
RxDL, which allow easy interfacing to an external controller.
Data to be transmit onto the line in the Sa bit position is clocked in from the TxDL pad (pin 65 in PLCC, pin 62 in
MQFP) with the clock TxDLCLK (pin 64 in PLCC, pin 61 in MQFP). Although the aggregate clock rate equals the bit
rate, it has a nominal pulse width of 244 ns, and it clocks in the TxDL as if it were a 2.048 Mb/s data stream. The
clock can only be active during bit times 4 to 0 of the STBUS frame. The TxDL input signal is clocked into the
MT9075B by the rising edge of TxDLCLK. If bits are selected to be a part of the DL, all other programmed functions
for those Sa bit positions are overridden.
The RxDLCLK signal (pin 39 in PLCC, pin 20 in MQFP) is derived from the receive extracted clock and is
aligned with the receive data link output RxDL. The HDB3 decoded receive data, at 2.048 Mbit/s, is clocked out
                                                                20

of the device on pin RxDL (pin 40 in PLCC, pin 21 in MQFP). In order to facilitate the attachment of this data
stream to a Data Link controller, the clock signal RxDLCLK consists of positive pulses, of nominal width of 244
ns, during the Sa bit cell times that are selected for the data link. Again, this selection is made by programming
address 10H of master control page 01H. No DL data will be lost or repeated when a receive frame slip occurs.
See Figures 13-16 for timing requirements.
Timeslot 16
Channel 16 may be used to create a transparent 64 kb/s clear channel. In this event CSTi (pin 6 in PLCC, pin 71 in
MQFP) becomes the data input pin for channel 16 transmit data, and CSTo (pin 5 in PLCC, pin 70 in MQFP)
becomes a 64 kb/s serial output link. The CSTo output link is synchronous to the extracted clock timebase. The pin
Rx64KCK (pin 47 in PLCC, pin 35 in MQFP) provides a 64 kHz clock for use with 64 kb/s data emanating from
CSTo. The 64 kb/s input data from CSTi is clocked in with an internal 64 kHz clock synchronous to the I/O pin C4b
(pin 45 in PLCC, pin 33 in MQFP) timebase. The internal clock toggles coincident with every second ST-BUS
channel boundary, with the first rising edge of a frame occurring at the beginning of ST-BUS channel 2.
Dual HDLC
The MT9075B has two identical HDLC controllers (HDLC0, HDLC1) for the S a bits and channel 16 respectively.
The following features are common to both HDLC controllers:
•   Independent transmit and receive FIFO's;
•   Receive FIFO maskable interrupts for nearly full (programmable interrupt levels) and overflow conditions;
•   Transmit FIFO maskable interrupts for nearly empty (programmable interrupt levels) and underflow
    conditions;
•   Maskable interrupts for transmit end-of-packet and receive end-of-packet;
•   Maskable interrupts for receive bad-frame (includes frame abort);
•   Transmit end-of-packet and frame-abort functions.
HDLC0 Functions
When connected to the Data Link (DL) HDLC0 will operate at a selected bit rate of 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20 kbits/sec.
HDLC0 can be selected by setting the control bit HDLC0 (bit 7) to one in page 01H, address 14H. When this bit is
zero all interrupts from HDLC0 are masked. For more information refer to following sections.
HDLC1 Functions
This controller may be connected to time slot 16 under Common Channel Signalling (CCS) mode. It should be
noted that the AIS16S function (page 03H, address 19H) will always be active and the TAIS16 function (page 01H,
address 16H) will override all other transmit signalling.
HDLC1 can be selected by setting the control bit HDLC1 (bit 6) to one in page 01H, address 14H. When this bit is
zero all interrupts from HDLC1 are masked.
HDLC Overview
The HDLC handles the bit oriented packetized data transmission as per X.25 level two protocol defined by CCITT. It
provides flag and abort sequence generation and detection, zero insertion and deletion, and Frame Check
Sequence (FCS) generation and detection. A single byte, dual byte and all call address in the received frame can
be recognized. Access to the receive FCS and inhibiting of transmit FCS for terminal adaptation are also provided.
Each HDLC controller has a 128 byte deep FIFO associated with it. The status and interrupt flags are
programmable for FIFO depths that can vary from 16 to 128 bytes in steps of 16 bytes. These and other features
are enabled through the HDLC control registers on page 0BH and 0CH.

HDLC Frame Structure
A valid HDLC frame (also referred as “packet”) begins with an opening flag, contains at least 16 bits of data
field, and ends with a 16 bit FCS followed by a closing flag (Table 9).
All HDLC frames start and end with a unique flag sequence “011111102” (7EH). The transmitter generates these
flags and appends them to the packet to be transmitted. The receiver searches the incoming data stream for the
flags on a bit-by-bit basis to establish frame synchronization.

                                   Flag (7EH)       Field                    Flag (7EH)

                                             Table 9 - HDLC Frame Format
The data field usually consists of an address field, control field and information field. The address field consists of
one or two bytes directly following the opening flag. The control field consists of one byte directly following the
address field. The information field immediately follows the control field and consists of n bytes of data. The HDLC
does not distinguish between the control and information fields and a packet does not need to contain an
information field to be valid.
The FCS field, which precedes the closing flag, consists of two bytes. A cyclic redundancy check utilizing the
CCITT standard polynomial “X16+X12+X5+1” produces the 16-bit FCS. In the transmitter the FCS is calculated on
all bits of the address and data field. The complement of the FCS is transmitted, most significant bit first, in the FCS
field. The receiver calculates the FCS on the incoming packet address, data and FCS field and compares the result
to “F0B8”. If no transmission errors are detected and the packet between the flags is at least 32 bits in length then
the address and data are entered into the receive FIFO minus the FCS which is discarded.
Data Transparency (Zero Insertion/Deletion)
Transparency ensures that the contents of a data packet do not imitate a flag, go-ahead, frame abort or idle
channel. The contents of a transmitted frame, between the flags, is examined on a bit-by-bit basis and a 0 is
inserted after all sequences of 5 contiguous 1s (including the last five bits of the FCS). Upon receiving five
contiguous 1s within a frame the receiver deletes the following 0.
Invalid Frames
A frame is invalid if one of the following four conditions exists:
•   If the FCS pattern generated from the received data does not match the “F0B8” pattern then the last data
    byte of the packet is written to the received FIFO with a ‘bad packet’ indication.
•   A short frame exists if there are less than 25 bits between the flags. Short frames are ignored by the receiver
    and nothing is written to the receive FIFO.
•   Packets which are at least 25 bits in length but less than 32 bits between the flags are also invalid. In this
    case the data is written to the FIFO but the last byte is tagged with a “bad packet” indication.
•   If a frame abort sequence is detected the packet is invalid. Some or all of the current packet will reside in the
    receive FIFO, assuming the packet length before the abort sequence was at least 26 bits long.
Frame Abort
The transmitter will abort a current packet by substituting a zero followed by seven contiguous 1s in place of the
normal packet. The receiver will abort upon reception of seven contiguous 1s occurring between the flags of a
packet which contains at least 26 bits.

                                                                  MT9075B                                                        Data Sheet
Note that should the last received byte before the frame abort end with contiguous 1s, these are included in the
seven 1s required for a receiver abort. This means that the location of the abort sequence in the receiver may occur
before the location of the abort sequence in the originally transmitted packet. If this happens then the last data
written to the receive FIFO will not correspond exactly with the last byte sent before the frame abort.
Interframe Time Fill and Link Channel States
When the HDLC transmitter is not sending packets it will wait in one of two states
•   Interframe Time Fill state: This is a continuous series of flags occurring between frames indicating that the
    channel is active but that no data is being sent.
•   Idle state: An idle Channel occurs when at least 15 contiguous 1s are transmitted or received.
In both states the transmitter will exit the wait state when data is loaded into the transmitter FIFO.
Go-Ahead
A go-ahead is defined by a 9 bit sequence "011111110" (contiguous 7Fs) and hence is the occurrence of a frame
abort sequence followed by a zero. This feature is used to distinguish a proper in-packet frame abort sequence
from one occurring outside of a packet for some special applications
HDLC Functional Description
The HDLC controller can be reset by either the reset pin (RESET, pin 11 in PLCC or pin 84 in MQFP) or by the
control bit HRST at address 1BH in page 0BH (for HDLC0) or page 0CH (for HDLC1). When reset, the HDLC
Control Registers are cleared, resulting in the transmitter and receiver being disabled. The receiver and transmitter
can be enabled independent of each other through Control Register 1 at address 13H. The transceiver input and
output are enabled when the enable control bits in Control Register 1 are set. Transmit to receive loopback as well
as a receive to transmit loopback are also supported. Transmit and receive bit rates and enables can operate
independently.
Received packets from the serial interface are sectioned into bytes by an HDLC receiver that detects flags, checks
for go-ahead signals, removes inserted zeros, performs a cyclical redundancy check (CRC) on incoming data, and
monitors the address if required. Packet reception begins upon detection of an opening flag. The resulting bytes are
concatenated with two status bits (RQ9 and RQ8 at address 14H) and placed in a receiver first-in-first-out buffer
(RX FIFO). Register 14H also contains control bits that generate status and interrupts for microprocessor read
control.
In conjunction with the control circuitry, the microprocessor writes data bytes into a transmit buffer (TX FIFO)
register that generates status and interrupts. Packet transmission begins when the microprocessor writes a byte to
the TX FIFO. Two status bits are added to the TX FIFO for transmitter control of frame aborts (FA) and end of
packet (EOP) flags. Packets have flags appended, zeros inserted, and an FCS, added automatically during serial
transmission. When the TX FIFO is empty and finished sending a packet, Interframe Time Fill bytes (continuous
flags (7E hex)), or Mark Idle (continuous ones) are transmitted to indicate that the channel is idle.
HDLC Transmitter
Following initialization and enabling, the transmitter is in the Idle Channel state (Mark Idle), continuously sending
ones. Interframe Time Fill state (Flag Idle) is selected by setting the Mark Idle bit in Control Register 1 to one1. The
transmitter remains in either of these two states until data is written to the TX FIFO. Control Register 1 bits EOP
(End Of Packet) and FA (Frame Abort) are set as status bits before the microprocessor loads 8 bits of data into the
    1. If the MT9075B HDLC transmitter is set up in the Interframe Time Fill state (bit 2 Mark-Idle =1, page B or C, address 13H), then it will
    occasionally (less than 1% of the time) fail to transmit the opening flag when it is changed from the disabled state to the enabled state
    (bit 5 TxEN changed from 0 to 1). A missing opening flag will cause the packet to be lost at the receiving end.
    This problem only affects the first packet transmitted after the HDLC transmitter is enabled. Subsequent packets are unaffected.
                                                                        23

                                                      MT9075B                                           Data Sheet
10 bit wide FIFO (8 bits data and 2 bits status). To change the tag bits being loaded in the FIFO, Control Register 1
must be written to before writing to the FIFO. However, EOP and FA are reset after writing to the TX FIFO. The
Transmit Byte Count Register may also be used to tag an EOP. The register is loaded with the number of bytes in
the packet and decrements after every write to the Tx FIFO. When a count of one is reached, the next byte written
to the FIFO is tagged as an end of packet. The register may be made to cycle through the same count if the packets
are of the same length by setting Control Register 2, bit Cycle (at address 15H of page 0BH for HDLC0 or 0CH for
HDLC1).
If the transmitter is in the Idle Channel state when data is written to the TX FIFO, then an opening flag is sent and
data from TX FIFO follows. Otherwise, data bytes are transmitted as soon as the current flag byte has been sent.
TX FIFO data bytes are continuously transmitted until either the FIFO is empty or an EOP or FA status bit is read by
the transmitter. After the last bit of the EOP byte has been transmitted, a 16-bit FCS is sent followed by a closing
flag. When multiple packets of data are loaded into TX FIFO, only one flag is sent between packets.
Frame Aborts (FA, the transmission of 7F hex), are transmitted by tagging a byte previously written to the TX FIFO.
When a byte has an FA tag, then an FA is sent instead of that tagged byte. That is, all bytes previous to but not
including that byte are sent. After an FA, the transmitter returns to the Mark Idle or Interframe Time Fill state,
depending on the state of the Mark idle control bit.
TX FIFO underrun will occur if the FIFO empties and the last byte did not have either an EOP or FA tag. A frame
abort sequence will be sent when an underrun occurs.
Below is an example of the transmission of a three byte packet (’AA’’03’’77’ hex) (Interframe time fill). TxEN can be
enabled before or after this sequence.
(a) Write’04’ to Control Register 1 - Mark Idle bit set
(b) Write’AA’ to Tx FIFO -Data byte
(c) Write’03’ to Tx FIFO - Data byte
(d) Write’34’ to Control Register 1 - TxEN; EOP; Mark Idle bits set
(e) Write’77’ to Tx FIFO - Final data byte
The transmitter may be enabled independently of the receiver. This is done by setting the TxEN bit of the Control
Register. Enabling happens immediately upon writing to the register. Disabling using TxEN will occur after the
completion of the transmission of the present packet; the contents of the FIFO are not cleared. Disabling will consist
of stopping the transmitter clock. The Status and Interrupt Registers may still be read, and the FIFO and Control
Registers may be written to while the transmitter is disabled. The transmitted FCS may be inhibited using the Tcrci
bit of Control Register 2. In this mode the opening flag followed by the data and closing flag is sent and zero
insertion is still included, but no FCS. That is, the FCS is injected by the microprocessor as part of the data field.
This is used in V.120 terminal adaptation for synchronous protocol sensitive UI frames.
HDLC Receiver
After initialization and enabling, the receiver clocks in serial data, continuously checking for Go-Aheads (0 1111
1110), flags (0111 1110), and Idle Channel states (at least fifteen ones). When a flag is detected, the receiver
synchronizes itself to the serial stream of data bits, automatically calculating the FCS. If the data length between
flags after zero removal is less than 25 bits, then the packet is ignored so no bytes are loaded into Rx FIFO. When
the data length after zero removal is between 25 and 31 bits, a first byte and bad FCS code are loaded into the Rx
FIFO. For an error-free packet, the result in the CRC register should match the HEX pattern of “F0B8” when a
closing flag is detected.
If address recognition is required, the Receiver Address Recognition Registers (address 10H and 11H) are loaded
with the desired address and the Adrec bit in the Control Register 1 (address 13H) is set to one. Bit 0 of the
Address Registers is used as an enable bit for that byte, thus allowing either or both of the first two bytes to be
compared to the expected values. In addition, seven bits of address comparison can be realized on the first byte if
this is a single byte address by setting the Seven bit of Control Register 2 (address 15H).

                                                        MT9075B                                           Data Sheet
Two Status Register bits (RQ8 and RQ9) are appended to each data byte as it is written to the Rx FIFO. They
indicate that a good packet has been received (good FCS and no frame abort), or a bad packet with either incorrect
FCS or frame abort. The Status and Interrupt Registers should be read before reading the Rx FIFO since status and
interrupt information correspond to the byte at the output of the FIFO (i.e., the byte about to be read). The Status
Register bits are encoded as follows:
       RQ9        RQ8              Byte status
         1          1       last byte (bad packet)
         0          1             bad packet
         1          0       last byte (good packet)
         0          0            packet byte
The end-of-packet-detect (EOPD) interrupt indicates that the last byte written to the RX FIFO was an EOP byte.
The end-of-packet-read (EOPR) interrupt indicates that the byte about to be read from the RX FIFO is an EOP byte.
The Status Register should be read to see if the packet is good or bad before the byte is read.
A minimum size packet has an 8-bit address, an 8-bit control byte, and a 16-bit FCS pattern between the opening
and closing flags. Thus, the absence of a data transmission error and a frame length of at least 32 bits results in the
receiver writing a valid packet code with the EOP byte into RX FIFO. The last 16 bits before the closing flag are
regarded as the FCS pattern and will not be transferred to the receiver FIFO. Only data bytes (Address, Control,
Information) are loaded into the Rx FIFO.
In the case of an RX FIFO overflow, no clocking occurs until a new opening flag is received. In other words, the
remainder of the packet is not clocked into the FIFO. Also, the top byte of the FIFO will not be written over. If the
FIFO is read before the reception of the next packet then reception of that packet will occur. If two beginning of
packet conditions (RQ9=0; RQ8=1) are seen in the FIFO, without an intermediate EOP status, then overflow
occurred for the first packet.
The receiver may be enabled independently of the transmitter. This is done by setting the RxEN bit of Control
Register 1. Enabling happens immediately upon writing to the register. Disabling using RxEN will occur after the
present packet has been completely loaded into the FIFO. Disabling can occur during a packet if no bytes have
been written to the FIFO yet. Disabling will consist of disabling the internal receive clock. The FIFO, Status, and
Interrupt Registers may still be read while the receiver is disabled. Note that the receiver requires a flag before
processing a frame, thus if the receiver is enabled in the middle of an incoming packet it will ignore that packet and
wait for the next complete one.
The receive CRC (FCS) can be monitored in the Rx CRC Registers (address 18H and 19H). These registers
contain the actual CRC sent by the other transmitter in its original form, that is, MSB first and bits inverted. These
registers are updated by each end of packet (closing flag) received and therefore should be read when an end of
packet is received so that the next packet does not overwrite the registers.
Slip Buffer
In addition to the elastic buffer in the jitter attenuator(JA), another elastic buffer (two frames deep) is present,
attached between the receive side and the ST-BUS (or GCI Bus) side of the MT9075B. This elastic buffer is
configured as a slip buffer which absorbs wander and low frequency jitter in multi-trunk applications. The received
PCM 30 data is clocked into the slip buffer with the E2o clock and is clocked out of the slip buffer with the C4b clock.
The E2o extracted clock is generated from, and is therefore phase-locked with, the receive PCM 30 data. In normal
operation, the E2o clock will be phase-locked to the C4b clock by an external phase locked loop (PLL). Therefore,
in a single trunk system the receive data is in phase with the E2o clock, the C4b clock is phase-locked to the E2o
clock, and the read and write positions of the slip buffer will remain fixed with respect to each other.
In a multi-trunk slave or loop-timed system (i.e., PABX application) a single trunk will be chosen as a network
synchronizer, which will function as described in the previous paragraph. The remaining trunks will use the system
timing derived from the synchronizer to clock data out of their slip buffers. Even though the PCM 30 signals from the
network are synchronous to each other, due to multiplexing, transmission impairments and route diversity, these
                                                              25

signals may jitter or wander with respect to the synchronizing trunk signal. Therefore, the E2o clocks of non-
synchronizer trunks may wander with respect to the E2o clock of the synchronizer and the system bus.
Network standards state that, within limits, trunk interfaces must be able to receive error-free data in the presence
of jitter and wander (refer to network requirements for jitter and wander tolerance). The MT9075B will allow a
maximum of 26 channels (208 UI, unit intervals) of wander and low frequency jitter before a frame slip will occur.
The minimum delay through the receive slip buffer is approximately two channels and the maximum delay is
approximately 60 channels (see Figure 9).
When the C4b and the E2o clocks are not phase-locked, the rate at which data is being written into the slip buffer
from the PCM 30 side may differ from the rate at which it is being read out onto the ST-BUS. If this situation
persists, the delay limits stated in the previous paragraph will be violated and the slip buffer will perform a controlled
frame slip. That is, the buffer pointers will be automatically adjusted so that a full PCM 30 frame is either repeated
or lost. All frame slips occur on PCM 30 frame boundaries.
Two status bits, RSLIP and RSLPD (page 03H, address 15H), give indication of a slip occurrence and direction.
RSLIP changes state in the event of a slip. If RSLPD=0, the slip buffer has overflowed and a frame was lost; if
RSLPD=1, a underflow condition occurred and a frame was repeated. A maskable interrupt SLPI (page 01H,
address 1BH) is also provided.
Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between the read and write pointers of the receive slip buffer. Measuring
clockwise from the write pointer, if the read pointer comes within two channels of the write pointer a frame slip will
occur, which will put the read pointer 34 channels from the write pointer. Conversely, if the read pointer moves more
than 60 channels from the write pointer, a slip will occur, which will put the read pointer 28 channels from the write
pointer. This provides a worst case hysteresis of 13 channels peak (26 channels peak-to-peak) or a wander
tolerance of 208 UI.

Framing Algorithm
The MT9075B contains three distinct framing algorithms: basic frame alignment, signalling multiframe alignment
and CRC-4 multiframe alignment. Figure 10 is a state diagram that illustrates these algorithms and how they
interact.
After power-up, the basic frame alignment framer will search for a frame alignment signal (FAS) in the PCM 30
receive bit stream. Once the FAS is detected, the corresponding bit 2 of the non-frame alignment signal (NFAS) is
checked. If bit 2 of the NFAS is zero a new search for basic frame alignment is initiated. If bit 2 of the NFAS is one
                                                                      26

and the next FAS is correct, the algorithm declares that basic frame synchronization has been found (i.e., page
03H, address 10H, bit 7, SYNC is zero).
Once basic frame alignment is acquired the signalling and CRC-4 multiframe searches will be initiated. The
signalling multiframe algorithm will align to the first multiframe alignment signal pattern (MFAS = 0000) it receives in
the most significant nibble of channel 16 (page 3, address 10H, bit 6, MFSYNC = 0). Signalling multiframing will be
lost when two consecutive multiframes are received in error.
The CRC-4 multiframe alignment signal is a 001011 bit sequence that appears in PCM 30 bit position one of the
NFAS in frames 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11 (see Table 7). In order to achieve CRC-4 synchronization two CRC-4 multiframe
alignment signals must be received without error (page 03H, address 10H, bit 5, CRCSYN = 0) within 8 msec.
The MT9075B framing algorithm supports automatic interworking of interfaces with and without CRC-4 processing
capabilities. That is, if an interface with CRC-4 capability, achieves valid basic frame alignment, but does not
achieve CRC-4 multiframe alignment by the end of a predefined period, the distant end is considered to be a non-
CRC-4 interface. When the distant end is a non-CRC-4 interface, the near end automatically suspends receive
CRC-4 functions, continues to transmit CRC-4 data to the distant end with its E-bits set to zero, and provides a
status indication. Naturally, if the distant end initially achieves CRC-4 synchronization, CRC-4 processing will be
carried out by both ends. This feature is selected when control bit AUTC (page 01H, address 11H) is set to zero.
Notes for Synchronization State Diagram (Figure 10)
1. The basic frame alignment, signalling multiframe alignment, and CRC-4 multiframe alignment functions operate
    in parallel and are independent.
2. The receive channel associated signalling bits and signalling multiframe alignment bit will be frozen when multi-
    frame alignment is lost.
3. Manual re-framing of the receive basic frame alignment and signalling multiframe alignment functions can be
    performed at any time.
4. The transmit RAI bit will be one until basic frame alignment is established, then it will be zero.
5. E-bits can be optionally set to zero until the equipment interworking relationship is established. When this has
    been determined one of the following will take place:
    a. CRC-to-non-CRC operation - E-bits = 0,
    b. CRC-to-CRC operation - E-bits as per G.704 and I.431.
6. All manual re-frames and new basic frame alignment searches start after the current frame alignment signal
    position.
7. After basic frame alignment has been achieved, loss of frame alignment will occur any time three consecutive
    incorrect basic frame alignment signals are received. Loss of basic frame alignment will reset the complete
    framing algorithm.
8. When CRC-4 multiframing has been achieved, the primary basic frame alignment and resulting multiframe
    alignment will be adjusted to the basic frame alignment determined during CRC-4 synchronization. Therefore,
    the primary basic frame alignment will not be updated during the CRC-4 multiframing search, but will be updated
    when the CRC-4 multiframing search is complete.

                                                    MT9075B                                             Data Sheet
Channel Signalling
When control bit TxCCS (page 01H, address 1AH) is set to one, the MT9075B is in Common Channel Signalling
(CCS) mode. When TxCCS is low it is in Channel Associated Signalling mode (CAS). The CAS mode ABCD
signalling nibbles can be passed either via the micro-ports (when page 01H, address 1AH, bit 3, RPSIG = 1) or
through related channels of the CSTo and CSTi serial links (when RPSIG = 0). Memory page 05H contains the
receive ABCD nibbles and page 06H the transmit ABCD nibbles for micro-port CAS access.
In CAS operation an ABCD signalling bit debounce of 14 msec. can be selected by writing a one to DBNCE (page
02H, address 10H, bit 0)). This is consistent with the signalling recognition time of ITU-T Q.422. It should be noted
that there may be as much as 2 msec. added to this duration because signalling equipment state changes are not
synchronous with the PCM 30 multiframe.
If multiframe synchronization is lost (page 03H, address 10H, bit 6, MFSYNC = 1) all receive CAS signalling nibbles
are frozen. Receive CAS nibbles will become unfrozen when multiframe synchronization is acquired.
When the CAS signalling interrupt is unmasked (page 01H, address 1CH, bit 0, SIGI=1), pin IRQ (pin 12 in PLCC,
85 in MQFP) will become active when a signalling nibble state change is detected in any of the 30 receive
channels. The SIGI interrupt vector (page 04H, address 12H) is 01H.
In CCS mode the data transmit on channel 16 is either sourced from channel 16 data on DSTi or from the pin
CSTi. If 64KCCS (page 01H, address 1AH, bit 0) is zero the data is sourced from DSTi. If 64KCCS is high data
destined for channel 16 is clocked in from CSTi (pin 6 in PLCC, pin 71 in MQFP) with an internal 64 KHz clock
divided down from C4b. Data received from channel 16 is clocked out on CSTo (pin 5 in PLCC, pin 70 in
MQFP). By dividing down the extracted 2.048 MHz clock, a 64 kHz receive clock synchronous with the data is
created. This signal is output on Rx64KCK (pin 47 in PLCC, pin 35 in MQFP).
Loopbacks
In order to meet PRI Layer 1 requirements and to assist in circuit fault sectionalization, the MT9075B has six
loopback functions. The control bits for digital, remote, ST-BUS, payload and metallic loopbacks are located on
page 01H, address 15H. The remote and local time slot loopbacks are controlled through control bits 5 and 4 of the
Per Time Slot Control Words on pages 07H and 08H.

Error Counters
The MT9075B has nine error counters, which can be used for maintenance testing, an ongoing measure of the
quality of a PCM 30 link and to assist the designer in meeting specifications such as ITU-T I.431 and G.821. All
counters can be preset or cleared by writing to the appropriate locations. A separate status page - “1 Second
Status” on page 09H - latches the states of the following counters: E-bit Error Counter, Errored Frame Alignment
Signal Counter, Bipolar Violation Counter and CRC Error Counter on a one second interval, coincident with the one
second status bit.
Associated with each counter is a maskable event occurrence interrupt and a maskable counter overflow interrupt.
Overflow interrupts are useful when cumulative error counts are being recorded. For example, every time the frame
error counter overflow (FERO) interrupt occurs, 256 frame errors have been received since the last FERO interrupt.
All counters are cleared and held low by programming the counter clear bit (master control page 01H, address 1AH,
bit 2) high. Counter overflows set bits in the counter overflow latch (page 04H, address 16H); this latch is cleared
when read.

The overflow reporting latch (page 04H, address 16H) contains a register whose bits are set when individual
counters overflow. These bits stay high until the register is read.
PRBS Error Counter (PS7-0)
There are two 8 bit counters associated with PRBS comparison; one for errors and one for time. Any errors that are
detected in the receive PRBS will increment the PRBS Error Rate Counter of page 04H, address 10H. Writes to this
counter will clear an 8 bit counter, PSM7-0 (page 01H, address 11H) which counts receive CRC-4 multiframes. A
maskable PRBS counter overflow (PRBSO) interrupt (page 1, address 19H) is associated with this counter.
CRC Multiframe Counter for PRBS (PSM7-0)
This eight bit counter counts receive CRC-4 multiframes. It can be directly loaded via the microport. The counter will
also be automatically cleared in the event that the PRBS error counter is written to by the microport. This counter is
located on page 04H, address 11H.
E-bit Counter (EC9-0)
E-bit errors are counted by the MT9075B in order to support compliance with ITU-T requirements. This ten bit
counter is located on page 04H, addresses 13H and 14H respectively. It is incremented by single error events, with
a maximum rate of twice per CRC-4 multiframe.
There are two maskable interrupts associated with the E-bit error measurement. EBI (page 1, address 1CH) is
initiated when the least significant bit of the counter toggles, and EBO (page 01H, address 1DH) is initiated when
the counter overflows.
Jitter FIFO Counter (JFC7-0)
This is an eight bit counter that is incremented when the FIFO read pointer comes within 4 words of an underflow or
overflow condition. During this time the read clock will abruptly speed-up or slow-down to avoid an overflow or
underflow condition. This counter is located on page 04H, address 15H.
Loss of Synchronization Counter (LBF7-0)
This eight bit counter increments with each loss of basic frame alignment. This programmable counter is located on
page 04H, address 17H.
Bit Error Rate Counter (BR7-BR0)
An 8 bit Error Rate (BERT) counter BR7 - BR0 is located on page 04H address 18H, and is incremented once for
every bit detected in error on either the seven frame alignment signal bits.
There are two maskable interrupts associated with the bit error rate measurement. BERI (page 01H, address 1CH)
is initiated when the least significant bit of the BERT counter (BR0) toggles, and BERO (page 01H, address 1DH) is
initiated when the BERT counter value changes from FFH to 00H.
Errored FAS Counter (EFAS7-EFAS0)
An eight bit Frame Alignment Signal Error counter EFAS7 - EFAS0 is located on page 04H address 1AH, and is
incremented once for every receive frame alignment signal that contains one or more errors.
There are two maskable interrupts associated with the frame alignment signal error measurement. FERI (page
01H, address 1BH) is initiated when the least significant bit of the errored frame alignment signal counter toggles,
and FERO (page 01H, address 1DH) is initiated when the counter changes from FFH to 00H.

Bipolar Violation Error Counter (BPV15-BPV0)
The bipolar violation error counter will count bipolar violations or encoding errors that are not part of HDB3
encoding. This counter BPV15-BPV0 is 16 bits long (page 04H, addresses 1DH and 1CH) and is incremented once
for every BPV error received. It should be noted that when presetting or clearing the BPV error counter, the least
significant BPV counter address should be written to before the most significant location.
There are two maskable interrupts associated with the bipolar violation error measurement. BPVI (page 01H,
address 1CH) is initiated when the least significant bit of the BPV error counter toggles. BPVO (page 01H, address
1BH) is initiated when the counter changes from FFFFH to 0000H.
CRC Error Counter (CC9-0)
CRC-4 errors are counted by the MT9075B in order to support compliance with ITU-T requirements. This ten bit
counter is located on page 04H, addresses 1EH and 1FH respectively. It is incremented by single error events,
which is a maximum rate of twice per CRC-4 multiframe.
There is a maskable interrupts associated with the CRC error measurement. CRCI (page 01H, address 1CH) is
initiated when the least significant bit of the counter toggles, and CRCO (page 01H, address 1DH) is initiated when
the counter overflows.
Error Insertion
Six types of error conditions can be inserted into the transmit PCM 30 data stream through control bits, which are
located on page 02H, address 10H. These error events include the bipolar violation errors (BPVE), CRC-4 errors
(CRCE), FAS errors (FASE), NFAS errors (NFSE), payload (PERR) and a loss of signal error (LOSE). The LOSE
function overrides the HDB3 encoding function.
Per Time Slot Control
There are two per time slot control pages (page 07H and 08H) occupying a total of 32 unique addresses. Each
address controls a matching timeslot on the 32 transmit channels (onto the line) and the equivalent channel data on
the receive (DSTo) data. For example, address 0 of the first per time slot control page contains program control for
transmit timeslot 0 and DSTo channel 0.
Per Time Slot Looping
Any channel or combination of channels may be looped from transmit (sourced from DSTi) to receive (output on
DSTo) STBUS channels. When bit 4 (LTSL) in the Per Time Slot Control Word is set the data from the equivalent
transmit timeslot is looped back onto the equivalent receive channel.
Any channel or combination of channels may be looped from receive (sourced from the line data) to transmit
(output onto the line) channels. When bit 5 (RTSL) in the Per Time Slot Control Word is set the data from the
equivalent receive timeslot is looped back onto the equivalent transmit channel.
PRBS Testing
If the control bit ADSEQ is zero (from master control page 02H address 13H - Access Control Word), any
channel or combination of transmit channels may be programmed to contain a generated pseudo random bit
sequence (215-1). The channels are selected by setting bit 3 (TTST) in the Per Time Slot Control Word.
1. If the control bit ADSEQ is zero any combination of receive channels may be connected to the PRBS decoder
     (215-1). Each error in the incoming sequence causes the PRBS error counter to increment. The receive chan-
     nels are selected by setting bit 2 (RRST) in the Per Time Slot Control Word.
If the PRBS testing is performed in a metallic or external looparound the Per Time Slot Control Words with TTST
(transmit test, bit 3) set should have RRST (receive test, bit 2) set at the same time.

A-law Milliwatt
If the control bit ADSEQ is one (from master control page 02H - access control word), the A-law digital milliwatt
sequence (Table 10), defined by G.711, is available to be transmit on any combination of selected channels. The
channels are selected by setting bit 3 (TTST), in the Per Time Slot Control Word.
The same sequence is available to replace received data on any combination of DSTo channels. This is
accomplished by setting bit 2 (RRST) in the Per Time Slot Control Word for the corresponding channel.

Message Mode
The transmit data on any of the transmit channels may be sourced either from the equivalent DSTi channel or from
a dual port RAM programmed by the microport. The address of each dual port RAM memory location is uniquely
associated with a transmit channel number. When bit 7 (TXMSG) in the Per Time Slot Control Word for that channel
is set the transmit data for the channel is sourced from within the transmit message page dual port RAM (on page
0FH and 10H).
Receive data may also be read by the microprocessor port. The Rx message mode dual port RAMs (on page
11H and 12H) have a unique address associated with each incoming line channel. When the processor reads
any of the 32 memory locations, it reads the last byte received from the corresponding channel.
Alarms
The following alarms are detected by the receiver. Each may generate a maskable interrupt:
•   Remote Alarm Indication (RAI) - bit 3 (A) of the receive NFAS;
•   Alarm Indication Signal (AIS) - unframed all ones signal for at least a double frame (512 bits) or two double
    frames (1024 bits);
•   Channel 16 Alarm Indication Signal - all ones signal in channel 16;
•   Auxiliary pattern - 101010... pattern for at least 512 bits;
•   Loss of Signal - a loss of signal condition occurs when the receive signal is detected with more than 127
    consecutive zeros. A loss of signal condition will terminate when an average ones density of at least 12.5%
    has been received over a period of 127 contiguous pulse positions starting with a pulse.
•   Remote Signalling Multiframe Alarm - bit 6 (Y-bit) of the multiframe alignment signal.
•   T1 - (T1 timer bit on page 03H address 12H) this status bit (and maskable interrupt) shall be high when a
    signal that is not normal has been received for a minimum of 100 msec. This bit will be low when a normal
    signal is being received.

•   T2 - (T2 timer bit on page 03H address 12H) this status bit (and maskable interrupt) shall be high when a
    normal signal has been received for a minimum of 10 msec. This bit will be low when an abnormal signal is
    being received.
The alarm reporting latch (address 1BH page 04H) contains a register whose bits are set high for selected alarms.
These bits stay high until the register is read. This allows the controller to record intermittent or sporadic alarm
occurrences.
Automatic Alarms
The transmission of RAI and signalling multiframe alarms can be made to function automatically from control bits
ARAI and AUTY (page 01H, address 11H) When ARAI = 0 and basic frame synchronization is lost (page 03H,
address 10H, bit 7, SYNC = 1), the MT9075 will automatically transmit the RAI alarm signal to the far end of the
link. The transmission of this alarm signal will cease when basic frame alignment is acquired.
When AUTY = 0 and signalling multiframe alignment is not acquired (page 03H, address 10H, bit 6, MFSYNC = 1),
the MT9075 will automatically transmit the multiframe alarm (Y-bit) signal to the far end of the link. This
transmission will cease when signalling multiframe alignment is acquired.
Interrupts
The MT9075B has an extensive suite of maskable interrupts, which are divided into eight categories based on the
type of event that caused the interrupt. Each interrupt category has an associated interrupt vector described in
Table 11. When unmasked interrupts occur, IRQ will go low and one or more bits of the interrupt vector IV7-IV0
(page 04H, address 12H) will go high. After the interrupt vector is read it is automatically cleared and IRQ will return
to a high impedance state. The interrupt acknowledgment function can also be accomplished by toggling the INTA
bit (page 01H, address 1AH).
All the interrupts of the MT9075B are maskable. This is accomplished through the corresponding interrupt mask
words on page 01H (except for the HDLC interrupt mask registers which are located on page 0BH and 0CH).

After a device reset (RESET pin or RST control bit), interrupts from the following interrupt mask words are masked:
•   National use bit interrupt mask word
•   Interrupt mask words one through three.
•   HDLC interrupt mask word.
and the interrupts of mask word zero are unmasked.
All interrupts may be suspended, without changing the interrupt mask words, by making the SPND control bit (page
01H, address 1AH) high. Also, when pin TAIS is held low, all interrupts are suspended automatically. This allows for
system initialization without spurious interrupts.

 Bit   Name                                       Functional Description
  7    ASEL     AIS Select. This bit selects the criteria on which the detection of a valid Alarm
         (0)    Indication Signal (AIS) is based. If zero, the criteria is less than three zeros in a two
                frame period (512 bits). If one, the criteria is less than three zeros in each of two
                consecutive double-frame periods (512 bits per double-frame).
  6   MFSEL     Multiframe Select. This bit determines which receive multiframe signal (CRC-4 or
         (0)    signalling) the RxMF (pin 42 in PLCC, 23 in MQFP) signal is aligned with. If zero,
                RxMF is aligned with the receive signalling multiframe. If one, RxMF is aligned with
                the receive CRC-4 multiframe.
  5    NBTB     National Bit Transmit Buffer. If one, the transmit NFAS signal originates from the
         (0)    transmit national bit buffer; if zero, the transmit NFAS signal originates from the
                TNU4-8 bits of page 01H, address 12H.
4 - 0 Sa4 - Sa8 A one selects the corresponding Sa bits of the NFA signal for 4, 8, 12, 16 or 20
      (00000) kbits/sec. data link channel. Data link (DL) selection will function in termination mode
                only; in transmit transparent mode Sa4 is automatically selected - see TxTRSP
                control bit of page 01H, address 11H. If zero, the corresponding bits of transmit non-
                frame alignment signal are programmed by the Non-Frame Alignment Control Word
                (page 01H, address 12H).

 7      TIU0    Transmit International Use Zero. When CRC-4 operation is disabled (CSYN=1),
         (0)    this bit is transmit on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in bit position one of time-slot
                zero of frame-alignment frames. It is reserved for international use and should
                normally be kept at one. If CRC processing is used, i.e., CSYN =0, this bit is ignored.
 6     CRCM     CRC-4 Modification. If one, activates the CRC-4 remainder modification function
         (0)    when the device is in transparent mode. The received CRC-4 remainder is modified
                to reflect only the changes in the transmit DL. If zero, time slot zero data from DSTi
                will not be modified in transparent mode.
 5      RST     Reset. When this bit is changed from zero to one the device will reset to its default
         (0)    mode. See the Reset Operation section for the default settings.
 4     ARAI     Automatic RAI Operation. If zero, the Remote Alarm Indication bit (the A bit) will
         (0)    function automatically. That is, RAI=0 when basic synchronization has been
                acquired and RAI=1 when basic synchronization has not been acquired. If one,
                the remote alarm indication bit is controlled through the TALM bit of the transmit
                Non-Frame Alignment Control Word.
 3     AUTY     Automatic Y-Bit Operation. If zero, the Y-bit of the transmit multiframe alignment
         (0)    signal will report the multiframe alignment status to the far end i.e., zero - multiframe
                alignment acquired, one - lost. If one, the Y-bit is under the manual control of the
                Transmit Multiframe Alignment Control Word.

         (0)  No framing or signaling is imposed on the data transmit from DSTi onto the line. If
              zero, it is in termination mode.
 1    CSYN    CRC-4 Synchronization. If zero, basic CRC-4 synchronization processing is
         (0)  activated, and TIU0 bit and TIU1 bit programming will be overwritten. If one, CRC-4
              synchronization is disabled, the first bits of channel 0 are used as international use
              bits and are programmed by TIU0 and TIU1.
 0    AUTC    Automatic CRC-interworking. If zero, automatic CRC-interworking is activated. If
         (0)  one, it is deactivated. See Framing Algorithm section for a detail description.

        (1)  bit is transmit on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in bit position one of time-slot zero of
             non-frame-alignment frames. It is reserved for international use and should normally
             be kept at one. If CRC processing is used, i.e., CSYN =0, this bit is ignored.
 6      ---  Unused. Set low for normal operation.
 5    TALM   Transmit Remote Alarm. This bit is transmitted on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in
        (1)  bit position three (A bit) of time slot zero of NFAS frames. It is used to signal an alarm
             to the remote end of the PCM 30 link (one - alarm, zero - normal). This control bit is
             ignored when ARAI is zero (page 01H, address 11H).

        (0)  transmitted on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in bit positions one to four
             of time slot 16 of frame zero of every signalling multiframe. These bits
             are used by the far end to identify specific frames of a signalling
             multiframe. TMA1-4 = 0000 for normal operation.
 3      X1   This bit is transmitted on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in bit position
        (1)  five of time slot 16 of frame zero of every multiframe. X1 is normally set
             to one.
 2       Y   This bit is transmitted on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in bit position six
        (1)  of time slot 16 of frame zero of every multiframe. It is used to indicate the
             loss of multiframe alignment to the remote end of the link. If one - loss of
             multiframe alignment; if zero - multiframe alignment acquired. This bit is
             ignored when AUTY is zero (page 01H, address 11H).
1-0  X2, X3  These bits are transmitted on the PCM 30 2048 kbit/sec. link in bit
       (11)  positions seven and eight respectively, of time slot 16 of frame zero of

         the receiver analog input instead. If zero, metallic loopback is disabled.
 5  HDB3 High Density Bipolar 3 Encoding. If zero, HDB3 encoding is enabled in
     (0) the transmit direction. If one, AMI signal without HDB3 encoding is
         transmitted. HDB3 is always decoded in the receive direction.
 4  MFRF Multiframe Reframe. If one, for at least one frame, and then cleared the
     (0) MT9075B will initiate a search for a new signalling multiframe position.
         Reframing function is activated on the one-to-zero transition of the MFRF
         bit.
 3  DLBK Digital Loopback. If one, then the digital stream to the transmit LIU is
     (0) looped back in place of the digital output of the receive LIU. Data coming out
         of DSTo will be a delayed version of DSTi. If zero, this feature is disabled.
 2  RLBK Remote Loopback. If one, then all bipolar data received on RRTIP/RRING
     (0) are directly routed to TTIP/TRING on the PCM 30 side of the MT9075B. If

 0           64KCCS          64 Kbits/s Common Channel Signalling. If one, common channel
                 (0)         signalling information is sourced from CSTi, and common channel
                             signalling information is clocked out of CSTo. The transmit clock is an
                             internal clock. This 64 KHz clock is divided down from C4b and is
                             synchronous with the STBUS channel boundaries. The rising edges of
                             the clock occur between channels 1 and 2; 5 and 6; 9 and 10; 13 and
                             14; 17 and 18; 21 and 22; 25 and 26; 29 and 30. The receive clock is
                             synchronous with the same channel times, but derived from the
                             extracted clock timebase. The CCS receive clock is driven out on
                             Rx64KCK (pin 47 in PLCC, 35 in MQFP) when this bit is set. If zero
                             CSTi and CSTo have 2.048 mb/s bit rates and operate as per Tables

      (0)     inserts a single bipolar violation error into the transmit PCM 30 data. A
              one, zero or one-to-zero transition has no function.
 6  CRCE      CRC-4 Error Insertion. A zero-to-one transition of this bit inserts a single
      (0)     CRC-4 error into the transmit PCM 30 data. A one, zero or one-to-zero
              transition has no function.
 5   FASE     Frame Alignment Signal Error Insertion. A zero-to-one transition of this
      (0)     bit inserts a single error into the time slot zero frame alignment signal of
              the transmit PCM 30 data. A one, zero or one-to-zero transition has no
              function.
 4   NFSE     Non-frame Alignment Signal Error Insertion. A zero-to-one transition of
      (0)     this bit inserts a single error into bit two of the time slot zero non-frame
              alignment signal of the transmit PCM 30 data. A one, zero or one-to-zero
              transition has no function.
 3   LOSE     Loss of Signal Error Insertion. If one, the MT9075B transmits an all
      (0)     zeros signal (no pulses) in every PCM 30 time slot. If zero, data is
              transmitted normally.

            per LLOS status bit on page 03H address 18H). If low, pin LOS will go high
            when either a loss of signal (LLOST =1) or a loss of basic frame alignment
            state exits (bit SYNC on page 03H address 10H is zero).
 1   ADSEQ  Digital Milliwatt or Digital Test Sequence. If one, the A-law digital milliwatt
       (0)  analog test sequence will be selected by the Per Time Slot Control bits
            TTST and RTST (on page 07H and 08H). If zero, the PRBS 215-1 bit error
            rate test sequence will be selected by the Per Time Slot Control bits TTST
            and RTST. The PRBS generator is reset whenever this bit is set to 1.
 0   GCI/ST GCI or ST-BUS Frame Pulse. If one, the MT9075B will transmit or receive
       (0)  a GCI frame pulse on pin F0b (pin 46 in PLCC, 34 in MQFP). If zero, the

 7    Adrec    Address Recognition. When one this bit will enable address recognition.
        (0)    This forces the receiver to recognize only those packets having the unique
               address as programmed in the Receive Address Recognition Registers or if
               the address is an All call address.
 6    RxEN     Receive Enable. When one the receiver will be immediately enabled and
        (0)    will begin searching for flags, Go-Aheads etc.
               When zero this bit will disable the HDLC receiver after the rest of the packet
               presently being received is finished. The receiver internal clock is disabled.
 5    TxEN     Transmit Enable. When one the transmitter will be immediately enabled
        (0)    and will begin transmitting data, if any, or go to a mark idle or interframe
               time fill state.
               When zero this bit will disable the HDLC transmitter after the completion of
               the packet presently being transmitted. The transmitter internal clock is
               disabled.
 4    EOP      End Of Packet. Forms a tag on the next byte written the TX FIFO, and
        (0)    when set will indicate an end of packet byte to the transmitter, which will
               transmit an FCS following this byte. This facilitates loading of multiple
               packets into TX FIFO. Reset automatically after a write to the TX FIFO
               occurs.
 3      FA     Frame Abort. Forms a tag on the next byte written to the TX FIFO, and
        (0)    when set to one FA will indicate to the transmitter that it should abort the
               packet in which that byte is being transmitted. Reset automatically after a
               write to the TX FIFO.
 2   Mark-Idle When zero, the transmitter will be in an idle state. When one it is in an
        (0)    interframe time fill state. These two states will only occur when the TX FIFO
               is empty.

                       will identify the FIFO as being empty. However, the actual bit values in the
                       RX FIFO will not be reset.
 0        Txfrst       TX FIFO Reset. When one, the TX FIFO will be reset. The Status Register
            (0)        will identify the FIFO as being empty. This bit will be reset when data is
                       written to the TX FIFO. However, the actual bit values of data in the TX
                       FIFO will not be reset. It is cleared by the next write to the TX FIFO.

 7      GA         Go-Ahead. Indicates a go-ahead pattern was detected by the HDLC
                   receiver. This bit is reset after a read.
 6    EOPD         End Of Packet Detect. This bit is set to one when an end of packet (EOP)
                   byte was written into the RX FIFO by the HDLC receiver. This can be in
                   the form of a flag, an abort sequence or as an invalid packet. This bit is
                   reset after a read.
 5     TEOP        Transmit End Of Packet. This bit is set to one when the transmitter has
                   finished sending the closing flag of a packet or after a packet has been
                   aborted. This bit is reset after read.
 4    EOPR         End Of Packet Read. This bit is set to one when the byte about to be read
                   from the RX FIFO is the last byte of the packet. It is also set to one if the
                   Rx FIFO is read and there is no data in it. This bit is reset after a read.
 3     TxFL        TX FIFO Low. This bit is set to one when the TX FIFO is emptied below
                   the selected low threshold level. This bit is reset after a read.
 2  FA: Txunder    Frame Abort/TX FIFO Underrun. When Intsel bit of Control Register 2 is
                   low, this bit is set to one when a frame abort is received during packet re-
                   ception. It must be received after a minimum number of bits have been re-
                   ceived (26) otherwise it is ignored.
                   When Intsel bit of Control Register 2 is one, this bit is set to one for a TX
                   FIFO underrun indication. If one it indicates that a read by the transmitter
                   was attempted on an empty Tx FIFO.
                   This bit is reset after a read.
 1      RxFf       RX FIFO Full. This bit is set to one when the RX FIFO is filled above the
                   selected full threshold level. This bit is reset after a read.
 0    RxOvfl       RX FIFO Overflow. A one indicates that the 128 byte RX FIFO
                   overflowed (i.e. an attempt to write to a 128 byte full RX FIFO). The HDLC
                   will always disable the receiver once the receive overflow has been
                   detected. The receiver will be re-enabled upon detection of the next flag,
                   but will overflow again unless the RX FIFO is read. This bit is reset after a
                   read.

7-0 Cnt7 - 0   The Transmit Byte Count Register. It is used to indicate the length of the
     (0000     packet about to be transmitted. When this register reaches the count of
     0000)     one, the next write to the Tx FIFO will be tagged as an end of packet byte.
               The counter decrements at the end of the write to the Tx FIFO. If the Cycle
               bit of Control Register 2 is set high, the counter will cycle through the
               programmed value continuously.

 7  HRST    HDLC Reset. When this bit is set to one, the HDLC will be reset. This is
    (0000   similar to RESET being applied, the only difference being that this bit will
    0000)   not be reset automatically. This bit can only be reset by writing a zero twice
            to this location or applying RESET.
 6  RTloop  RT Loopback. When this bit is set to one, receive to transmit HDLC
      (0)   loopback will be activated. Receive data, including end of packet indication,
            but not including flags or CRC, will be written to the TX FIFO as well as the
            RX FIFO. When the transmitter is enabled, this data will be transmitted as
            though written by the microprocessor. Both good and bad packets will be
            looped back. Receive to transmit loopback may also be accomplished by
            reading the RX FIFO using the microprocessor and writing these bytes,
            with appropriate tags, into the TX FIFO.

 2   Ftst   FIFO Test. This bit when set to one allows the writing to the RX FIFO and
      (0)   reading of the TX FIFO through the microprocessor to allow more efficient
            testing of the FIFO status/interrupt functionality. This is done by making a
            TX FIFO write become a RX FIFO write and a RX FIFO read become a TX
            FIFO read. In addition, EOP/FA and RQ8/RQ9 are re-defined to be
            accessible (i.e. RX write causes EOP/FA to go to RX fifo input; TX read
            looks at output of TX FIFO through RQ8/RQ9 bits).
