Functional Description
The MT88L70 monolithic DTMF receiver offers small size, low power consumption and high performance, with 3
volt operation. Its architecture consists of a bandsplit filter section, which separates the high and low group tones,
followed by a digital counting section which verifies the frequency and duration of the received tones before passing
the corresponding code to the output bus.
Filter Section
Separation of the low-group and high group tones is achieved by applying the DTMF signal to the inputs of two
sixth-order switched capacitor bandpass filters, the bandwidths of which correspond to the low and high group
frequencies. The filter section also incorporates notches at 350 and 440 Hz for exceptional dial tone rejection. Each
filter output is followed by a single order switched capacitor filter section which smooths the signals prior to limiting.
Limiting is performed by high-gain comparators which are provided with hysteresis to prevent detection of
unwanted low-level signals. The outputs of the comparators provide full rail logic swings at the frequencies of the
incoming DTMF signals.
Decoder Section
Following the filter section is a decoder employing digital counting techniques to determine the frequencies of the
incoming tones and to verify that they correspond to standard DTMF frequencies. A complex averaging algorithm
protects against tone simulation by extraneous signals such as voice while providing tolerance to small frequency
deviations and variations. This averaging algorithm has been developed to ensure an optimum combination of
immunity to talk-off and tolerance to the presence of interfering frequencies (third tones) and noise. When the
detector recognizes the presence of two valid tones (this is referred to as the “signal condition” in some industry
specifications) the “Early Steering” (ESt) output will go to an active state. Any subsequent loss of signal condition
will cause ESt to assume an inactive state (see “Steering Circuit”).
Steering Circuit
Before registration of a decoded tone pair, the receiver checks for a valid signal duration (referred to as character
recognition condition). This check is performed by an external RC time constant driven by ESt. A logic high on ESt
causes vc (see Figure 3) to rise as the capacitor discharges. Provided signal condition is maintained (ESt remains
high) for the validation period (tGTP), vc reaches the threshold (VTSt) of the steering logic to register the tone pair,
latching its corresponding 4-bit code (see Table 1) into the output latch. At this point the GT output is activated and
drives vc to VDD. GT continues to drive high as long as ESt remains high. Finally, after a short delay to allow the
output latch to settle, the delayed steering output flag (StD) goes high, signalling that a received tone pair has been
registered. The contents of the output latch are made available on the 4-bit output bus by raising the three state
control input (TOE) to a logic high. The steering circuit works in reverse to validate the interdigit pause between
signals. Thus, as well as rejecting signals too short to be considered valid, the receiver will tolerate signal
interruptions (dropout) too short to be considered a valid pause. This facility, together with the capability of selecting

Guard Time Adjustment
In many situations not requiring selection of tone duration and interdigital pause, the simple steering circuit shown
in Figure 3 is applicable. Component values are chosen according to the formula:
                                                      tREC=tDP+tGTP
                                                       tID=tDA+tGTA
The value of tDP is a device parameter (see Figure 7) and tREC is the minimum signal duration to be recognized by
the receiver. A value for C of 0.1 µF is recommended for most applications, leaving R to be selected by the
designer.

                                             Figure 3 - Basic Steering Circuit
Different steering arrangements may be used to select independently the guard times for tone present (tGTP) and
tone absent (tGTA). This may be necessary to meet system specifications which place both accept and reject limits
on both tone duration and interdigital pause. Guard time adjustment also allows the designer to tailor system
parameters such as talk off and noise immunity. Increasing tREC improves talk-off performance since it reduces the
probability that tones simulated by speech will maintain signal condition long enough to be registered. Alternatively,
a relatively short tREC with a long tDO would be appropriate for extremely noisy environments where fast acquisition
time and immunity to tone drop-outs are required. Design information for guard time adjustment is shown in Figure
4.
Power-down and Inhibit Mode
A logic high applied to pin 6 (PWDN) will power down the device to minimize the power consumption in a standby
mode. It stops the oscillator and the functions of the filters.
Inhibit mode is enabled by a logic high input to the pin 5 (INH). It inhibits the detection of tones representing
characters A, B, C, and D. The output code will remain the same as the previous detected code (see Table 1).

Differential Input Configuration
The input arrangement of the MT88L70 provides a differential-input operational amplifier as well as a bias source
(VRef) which is used to bias the inputs at mid-rail. Provision is made for connection of a feedback resistor to the op-
amp output (GS) for adjustment of gain. In a single-ended configuration, the input pins are connected as shown in
Figure 6 with the op-amp connected for unity gain and VRef biasing the input at 1/2VDD. Figure 5 shows the
differential configuration, which permits the adjustment of gain with the feedback resistor R5.
