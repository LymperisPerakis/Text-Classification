   NAME
 CLKSEL0      A8     I  Clock Select inputs for Master Clock Synthesizer - Hardware mode
 CLKSEL1      B8        CLKSEL[2:0] are input signals to a programmable frequency synthesizer that can be
 CLKSEL2      C8        used to generate a master clock from an external accurate clock source according to
                        the table below.
                        In Hardware mode, the MCLKRATE control signal is generated from the state of
                        EQC[4:0] inputs.
                        In Host mode, the state of these pins are ignored and the master frequency PLL is con-
                        trolled by the corresponding interface bits. See Table 36 register address 10000001

                           tern from the transmitter of any channel that the receiver of that channel has detected
                           an LOS condition. A "Low" level on this pin disables this function.
                           Note: All channels share the same ATAOS control function.

                           In external termination mode (TXTSEL = 0), setting this pin “High” selects a trans-
                           former ratio of 1:2 for the transmitter. A “Low” on this pin sets the transmitter trans-
                           former ratio to 1:2.45. In the internal termination mode the transmitter transformer
                           ratio is permanently set to 1:2 and the state of this pin is ignored.

                           In Hardware mode, when this pin is “Low” the receive line termination is determined
                           only by an external resistor. When “High”, the receive termination is realized by the
                           internal resistor or the combination of internal and external resistors. These conditions
                           are described in the table below.
                           NOTE: In Hardware mode all channels share the same RXTSEL control function.

                           In Host mode, the RXTSEL_n bits in the channel control registers determine if the
                           receiver termination is external or internal. However, the function of RXTSEL can be
                           transferred to the Hardware pin by setting the TERCNTL bit (bit 6) to “1” in the register

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The XRT83SL38 is a fully integrated short-haul transceiver intended for T1, J1 or E1 systems. Simplified block
diagrams of the chip are shown in Figure 1, Host mode and Figure 2, Hardware mode.
In T1 applications, the XRT83SL38 can generate five transmit pulse shapes to meet the short-haul Digital
Cross-connect (DSX-1) template requirement. The operation and configuration of the XRT83SL38 can be
controlled through a parallel microprocessor Host interface or Hardware control.
MASTER CLOCK GENERATOR
Using a variety of external clock sources, the on-chip frequency synthesizer generates the T1 (1.544MHz) or
E1 (2.048MHz) master clocks necessary for the transmit pulse shaping and receive clock recovery circuit.
There are two master clock inputs MCLKE1 and MCLKT1. In systems where both T1 and E1 master clocks are
available these clocks can be connected to the respective pins. All channels of a given XRT83Sl38 must be
operated at the same clock rate, either T1, E1 or J1 modes.
In systems that have only one master clock source available (E1 or T1), that clock should be connected to both
MCLKE1 and MCLKT1 inputs for proper operation. T1 or E1 master clocks can be generated from 8kHz,
16kHz, 56kHz, 64kHz, 128kHz and 256kHz external clocks under the control of CLKSEL[2:0] inputs according
to Table 1.
NOTE: EQC[4:0] determine the T1/E1 operating mode. See Table 5 for details.

In Host mode the programming is achieved through the corresponding interface control bits, the state of the
CLKSEL[2:0] control bits and the state of the MCLKRATE interface control bit.
RECEIVER
RECEIVER INPUT
At the receiver input, a cable attenuated AMI signal can be coupled to the receiver through a capacitor or a 1:1
transformer. The input signal is first applied to a selective equalizer for signal conditioning. The maximum
equalizer gain is up to 36 dB for both T1 and E1 modes. The equalized signal is subsequently applied to a
peak detector which in turn controls the equalizer settings and the data slicer. The slicer threshold for both E1
and T1 is typically set at 50% of the peak amplitude at the equalizer output. After the slicers, the digital
representation of the AMI signals are applied to the clock and data recovery circuit. The recovered data
subsequently goes through the jitter attenuator and decoder (if selected) for HDB3 or B8ZS decoding before
being applied to the RPOS_n/RDATA_n and RNEG_n/LCV_n pins. Clock recovery is accomplished by a digital
phase-locked loop (DPLL) which does not require any external components and can tolerate high levels of
input jitter that meets or exceeds the ITU-G.823 and TR-TSY000499 standards.

RECEIVE MONITOR MODE
In applications where Monitor mode is desired, the equalizer can be configured in a gain mode which handles
input signals attenuated resistively up to 29dB, along with 0 to 6dB cable attenuation for both T1 and E1
applications, refer to Table 5 for details. This feature is available in both Hardware and Host modes.
RECEIVER LOSS OF SIGNAL (RLOS)
For compatibility with ITU G.775 requirements, the RLOS monitoring function is implemented using both
analog and digital detection schemes. If the analog RLOS condition occurs, a digital detector is activated to
count for 32 consecutive zeros in E1 (4096 bits in Extended Los mode, EXLOS = “1”) or 175 consecutive zeros
in T1 before RLOS is asserted. RLOS is cleared when the input signal rises +3dB (built in hysteresis) above
the point at which it was declared and meets 12.5% ones density of 4 ones in a 32 bit window, with no more
than 16 consecutive zeros for E1. In T1 mode, RLOS is cleared when the input signal rises +3dB (built in
hysteresis) above the point at which it was declared and contains 16 ones in a 128 bit window with no more
than 100 consecutive zeros in the data stream. When loss of signal occurs, RLOS register indication and
register status will change. If the RLOS register enable is set high (enabled), the alarm will trigger an interrupt
causing the interrupt pin (INT) to go low. Once the alarm status register has been read, it will automatically
reset upon read (RUR), and the INT pin will return high.
Analog RLOS
Setting the Receiver Inputs to -15dB T1/E1 Short Haul Mode
By setting the receiver inputs to -15dB T1/E1 short haul mode, the equalizer will detect the incoming amplitude
and make adjustments by adding gain up to a maximum of +15dB normalizing the T1/E1 input signal.
NOTE: This is the only setting that refers to cable loss (frequency), not flat loss (resistive).
Once the T1/E1 input signal has been normalized to 0dB by adding the maximum gain (+15dB), the receiver
will declare RLOS if the signal is attenuated by an additional -9dB. The total cable loss at RLOS declaration is
typically -24dB (-15dB + -9dB). A 3dB hysteresis was designed so that transients will not trigger the RLOS to
clear. Therefore, the RLOS will typically clear at a total cable attenuation of -21dB. See Figure 5 for a
simplified diagram.

By setting the receiver inputs to -29dB T1/E1 gain mode, the equalizer will detect the incoming amplitude and

RECEIVE HDB3/B8ZS DECODER
The Decoder function is available in both Hardware and Host modes on a per channel basis by controlling the
TNEG_n/CODES_n pin or the CODES_n interface bit. The decoder function is only active in single-rail Mode.
When selected, receive data in this mode will be decoded according to HDB3 rules for E1 and B8ZS for T1
systems. Bipolar violations that do not conform to the coding scheme will be reported as Line Code Violation at
the RNEG_n/LCV_n pin of each channel. The length of the LCV pulse is one RCLK cycle for each code
violation. In E1mode only, an excessive number of zeros in the receive data stream is also reported as an error
at the same output pin. If AMI decoding is selected in single rail mode, every bipolar violation in the receive
data stream will be reported as an error at the RNEG_n/LCV_n pin.
RECOVERED CLOCK (RCLK) SAMPLING EDGE
This feature is available in both Hardware and Host modes on a global basis. In Host mode, the sampling
edge of RCLK output can be changed through the interface control bit RCLKE. If a “1” is written in the RCLKE
interface bit, receive data output at RPOS_n/RDATA_n and RNEG_n/LCV_n are updated on the falling edge of
RCLK for all eight channels. Writing a “0” to the RCLKE register, updates the receive data on the rising edge of
RCLK. In Hardware mode the same feature is available under the control of the RCLKE pin.

REV. 1.0.2     OCTAL T1/E1/J1 SH TRANSCEIVER WITH CLOCK RECOVERY AND JITTER ATTENUATOR
JITTER ATTENUATOR
To reduce phase and frequency jitter in the recovered clock, the jitter attenuator can be placed in the receive
signal path. The jitter attenuator uses a data FIFO (First In First Out) with a programmable depth that can vary
between 2x32 and 2x64. The jitter attenuator can also be placed in the transmit signal path or disabled
altogether depending upon system requirements. The jitter attenuator, other than using the master clock as
reference, requires no external components. With the jitter attenuator selected, the typical throughput delay
from input to output is 16 bits for 32 bit FIFO size or 32 bits for 64 bit FIFO size. When the read and write
pointers of the FIFO in the jitter attenuator are within two bits of over-flowing or under-flowing, the bandwidth of
the jitter attenuator is widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. When this
situation occurs, the jitter attenuator will not attenuate input jitter until the read/write pointer's position is outside
the two bits window. Under normal condition, the jitter transfer characteristic meets the narrow bandwidth
requirement as specified in ITU- G.736, ITU- I.431 and AT&T Pub 62411 standards.
In T1 mode the Jitter Attenuator Bandwidth is always set to 3Hz. In E1 mode, the bandwidth can be reduced
through the JABW control signal. When JABW is set “High” the bandwidth of the jitter attenuator is reduced
from 10Hz to 1.5Hz. Under this condition the FIFO length is automatically set to 64 bits and the 32 bits FIFO
length will not be available in this mode. Jitter attenuator controls are available on a per channel basis in the
Host mode and on a global basis in the Hardware mode.
GAPPED CLOCK (JA MUST BE ENABLED IN THE TRANSMIT PATH)
The XRT83SL38 LIU is ideal for multiplexer or mapper applications where the network data crosses multiple
timing domains. As the higher data rates are de-multiplexed down to T1 or E1 data, stuffing bits are removed
which can leave gaps in the incoming data stream. If the jitter attenuator is enabled in the transmit path, the
32-Bit or 64-Bit FIFO is used to smooth the gapped clock into a steady T1 or E1 output. The maximum gap
width of the 8-Channel LIU is shown in Table 2.

ARBITRARY PULSE GENERATOR FOR T1 AND E1
The arbitrary pulse generator divides the pulse into eight individual segments. Each segment is set by a 7-Bit
binary word by programming the appropriate channel register. This allows the system designer to set the
overshoot, amplitude, and undershoot for a unique line build out. The MSB (bit 7) is a sign-bit. If the sign-bit is
set to “1”, the segment will move in a positive direction relative to a flat line (zero) condition. If this sign-bit is set
to “0”, the segment will move in a negative direction relative to a flat line condition. A pulse with numbered
segments is shown in Figure 8.

By default, the arbitrary segments are programmed to 0x00h. The transmitter outputs will result in an all zero pattern to the
line. For E1 arbitrary mode, see global register 0xC0h.
TRANSMITTER
DIGITAL DATA FORMAT
Both the transmitter and receiver can be configured to operate in dual or single-rail data formats. This feature is
available under both Hardware and Host control modes, on a global basis. The dual or single-rail data format
is determined by the state of the SR/DR pin in Hardware mode or SR/DR interface bit in the Host mode. In
single-rail mode, transmit clock and NRZ data are applied to TCLK_n and TPOS_n/TDATA_n pins respectively.
In single-rail and Hardware mode the TNEG_n/CODES_n input can be used as the CODES function. With
TNEG_n/CODES_n tied “Low”, HDB3 or B8ZS encoding and decoding are enabled for E1 and T1 modes
respectively. With TNEG_n/CODES_n tied “High”, the AMI coding scheme is selected. In both dual or single-
rail modes of operations, the transmitter converts digital input data to a bipolar format before being transmitted
to the line.
TRANSMIT CLOCK (TCLK) SAMPLING EDGE
Serial transmit data at TPOS_n/TDATA_n and TNEG_n/CODES_n are clocked into the XRT83SL38 under the
synchronization of TCLK_n. With a “0” written to the TCLKE interface bit, or by pulling the TCLKE pin “Low”,
input data is sampled on the falling edge of TCLK_n. The sampling edge is inverted with a “1” written to TCLKE
interface bit, or by connecting the TCLKE pin “High”.

TRANSMIT HDB3/B8ZS ENCODER
The Encoder function is available in both Hardware and Host modes on a per channel basis by controlling the
TNEG_n/CODES_n pin or CODES interface bit. The encoder is only available in single-rail mode. In E1 mode
and with HDB3 encoding selected, any sequence with four or more consecutive zeros in the input serial data
from TPOS_n/TDATA_n, will be removed and replaced with 000V or B00V, where “B” indicates a pulse
conforming with the bipolar rule and “V” representing a pulse violating the rule. An example of HDB3 Encoding
is shown in Table 3. In a T1 system, an input data sequence with eight or more consecutive zeros will be
removed and replaced using the B8ZS encoding rule. An example of Bipolar with 8 Zero Substitution (B8ZS)

OCTAL T1/E1/J1 SH TRANSCEIVER WITH CLOCK RECOVERY AND JITTER ATTENUATOR                                    REV. 1.0.2
The driver monitor circuit is used to detect transmit driver failure by monitoring the activities at TTIP and TRING
outputs. Driver failure may be caused by a short circuit in the primary transformer or system problems at the
transmit input. If the transmitter of a channel has no output for more than 128 clock cycles, the corresponding
DMO pin goes “High” and remains “High” until a valid transmit pulse is detected. In Host mode, the failure of
the transmit channel is reported in the corresponding interface bit. If the DMOIE bit is also enabled, any
transition on the DMO interface bit will generate an interrupt. The driver failure monitor is supported in both
Hardware and Host modes on a per channel basis.
TRANSMIT PULSE SHAPER & LINE BUILD OUT (LBO) CIRCUIT
The transmit pulse shaper circuit uses the high speed clock from the Master timing generator to control the
shape and width of the transmitted pulse. The internal high-speed timing generator eliminates the need for a
tightly controlled transmit clock (TCLK) duty cycle. With the jitter attenuator not in the transmit path, the
transmit output will generate no more than 0.025Unit Interval (UI) peak-to-peak jitter. In Hardware mode, the
state of the A[4:0]/EQC[4:0] pins determine the transmit pulse shape for all eight channels. In Host mode
transmit pulse shape can be controlled on a per channel basis using the interface bits EQC[4:0]. The chip
supports five fixed transmit pulse settings for T1 Short-haul applications plus a fully programmable waveform
generator for arbitrary transmit output pulse shapes (The arbitrary pulse generators are available for both T1
and E1). The choice of the transmit pulse shape and LBO under the control of the interface bits are
summarized in Table 5. For CSU LBO transmit pulse design information, refer to ANSI T1.403-1993 Network-
to-Customer Installation specification, Annex-E.
NOTE: EQC[4:0] determine the T1/E1 operating mode of the XRT83SL38. When EQC4 = “1” and EQC3 = “1”, the
         XRT83SL38 is in the E1 mode, otherwise it is in the T1/J1 mode. For details on how to enable the E1 arbitrary
         mode, see global register 0xC0h.

TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE TERMINATIONS
The XRT83SL38 is a versatile LIU that can be programmed to use one Bill of Materials (BOM) for worldwide
applications for T1, J1 and E1. For specific applications the internal terminations can be disabled to allow the
use of existing components and/or designs.
RECEIVER (CHANNELS 0 - 7)
INTERNAL RECEIVE TERMINATION MODE
In Hardware mode, RXTSEL (Pin 83) can be tied “High” to select internal termination mode for all receive
channels or tied “Low” to select external termination mode. Individual channel control can only be done in Host
mode. By default the XRT83SL38 is set for external termination mode at power up or at Hardware reset.

TRANSMIT TERMINATION MODE
In Hardware mode, TXTSEL (Pin 84) can be tied “High” to select internal termination mode for all transmit
channels or tied “Low” for external termination. Individual channel control can be done only in Host mode. In
Host mode, bit 6 in the appropriate register for a given channel is set “High” to select the internal termination
mode for that specific transmit channel, see Table 20, “Microprocessor Register #1, Bit Description,” on
page 52.

For internal termination, the transformer turns ratio is always 1:2. In internal mode, no external resistors are
used. An external capacitor of 0.68μF is used for proper operation of the internal termination circuitry, see

REDUNDANCY APPLICATIONS
Telecommunication system design requires signal integrity and reliability. When a T1/E1 primary line card has
a failure, it must be swapped with a backup line card while maintaining connectivity to a backplane without
losing data. System designers can achieve this by implementing common redundancy schemes with the
XRT83SL38 Line Interface Unit (LIU). The XRT83SL38 offers features that are tailored to redundancy
applications while reducing the number of components and providing system designers with solid reference
designs. These features allow system designers to implement redundancy applications that ensure reliability.
The Internal Impedance mode eliminates the need for external relays when using the 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy
schemes.

PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS
In many applications switching the control of the transmitter outputs and the receiver line impedance to
hardware control will provide faster transmitter ON/OFF switching.
In Host Mode, there are two bits in register 130 (82H) that control the transmitter outputs and the Rx line
impedance select, TXONCNTL (Bit 7) and TERCNTL (Bit 6).
Setting bit-7 (TXONCNTL) to a “1” transfers the control of the Transmit On/Off function to the TXON_n
Hardware control pins. (Pins 90 through 93 and pins 169 through 172).
Setting bit-6 (TERCNTL) to a “1” transfers the control of the Rx line impedance select (RXTSEL) to the
RXTSEL Hardware control pin (pin 83).
Either mode works well with redundancy applications. The user can determine which mode has the fastest
switching time for a unique application.
TYPICAL REDUNDANCY SCHEMES
    ■  ·1:1 One backup card for every primary card (Facility Protection)
    ■  ·1+1 One backup card for every primary card (Line Protection)
    ■  ·N+1One backup card for N primary cards
1:1 REDUNDANCY
A 1:1 facility protection redundancy scheme has one backup card for every primary card. When using 1:1
redundancy, the backup card has its transmitters tri-stated and its receivers in high impedance. This eliminates
the need for external relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation. The transmit
and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
1+1 REDUNDANCY
A 1+1 line protection redundancy scheme has one backup card for every primary card, and the receivers on
the backup card are monitoring the receiver inputs. Therefore, the receivers on both cards need to be active.
The transmit outputs require no external resistors. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are
described separately.
TRANSMIT 1:1 & 1+1 REDUNDANCY
For 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy, the transmitters on the primary and backup card should be programmed for
Internal Impedance mode. The transmitters on the backup card should be tri-stated. Select the appropriate
impedance for the desired mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for
blocking DC bias. See Figure 13 for a simplified block diagram of the transmit section for 1:1 and 1+1
redundancy scheme.
NOTE: For simplification, the over voltage protection circuitry was omitted.

RECEIVE 1:1 & 1+1 REDUNDANCY
For 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy, the receivers on the primary card should be programmed for Internal Impedance
mode. The receivers on the backup card should be programmed for External Impedance mode. Since there is
no external resistor in the circuit, the receivers on the backup card will be high impedance. This key design
feature eliminates the need for relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
Select the impedance for the desired mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. To swap the primary card, set the backup
card to Internal Impedance mode, then the primary card to External Impedance mode. See Figure 14 for a
simplified block diagram of the receive section for a 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy scheme.

N+1 redundancy has one backup card for N primary cards. Due to impedance mismatch and signal contention,
external relays are necessary when using this redundancy scheme. The advantage of relays is that they create
complete isolation between the primary cards and the backup card. This allows all transmitters and receivers
on the primary cards to be configured in internal impedance mode, providing one bill of materials for all
interface modes of operation. The transmit and receive sections of the XRT83SL38 are described separately.
TRANSMIT
For N+1 redundancy, the transmitters on all cards should be programmed for internal impedance mode
providing one bill of materials for T1/E1/J1. The transmitters on the backup card do not have to be tri-stated. To
swap the primary card, close the desired relays, and tri-state the transmitters on the failed primary card. A
0.68μF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for blocking DC bias. See Figure 15 for a simplified block diagram
of the transmit section for an N+1 redundancy scheme.
NOTE: For simplification, the over voltage protection circuitry was omitted.

RECEIVE
For N+1 redundancy, the receivers on the primary cards should be programmed for internal impedance mode.
The receivers on the backup card should be programmed for external impedance mode. Since there is no
external resistor in the circuit, the receivers on the backup card will be high impedance. Select the impedance
for the desired mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. To swap the primary card, set the backup card to internal
impedance mode, then the primary card to external impedance mode. See Figure 16. for a simplified block
diagram of the receive section for a N+1 redundancy scheme.

PATTERN TRANSMIT AND DETECT FUNCTION
Several test and diagnostic patterns can be generated and detected by the chip. In Hardware mode each
channel can be independently programmed to transmit an All Ones pattern by applying a “High” level to the
corresponding TAOS_n pin. In Host mode, the three interface bits TXTEST[2:0] control the pattern generation
and detection independently for each channel according to Table 12.
                                     TABLE 12: PATTERN TRANSMISSION CONTROL

TRANSMIT ALL ONES (TAOS)
This feature is available in both Hardware and Host modes. With the TAOS_n pin connected to a “High” level
or when interface bits TXTEST2=“1”, TXTEST1=“0” and TXTEST0=“1” the transmitter ignores input from
TPOS_n/TDATA_n and TNEG_n/CODES_n pins and sends a continuous AMI encoded all “Ones” signal to the
line, using TCLK_n clock as the reference. In addition, when the Hardware pin and interface bit ATAOS is
activated, the chip will automatically transmit the All “Ones” data from any channel that detects an RLOS
condition. This feature is not available on a per channel basis. TCLK_n must NOT be tied “Low”.
NETWORK LOOP CODE DETECTION AND TRANSMISSION
This feature is available in Host mode only. When the interface bits TXTEST2=”1”, TXTEST1=”1” and
TXTEST0=”0” the chip is enabled to transmit the “00001” Network Loop-Up Code from the selected channel
requesting a Loop-Back condition from the remote terminal. Simultaneously setting the interface bits
NLCDE1=”0” and NLCDE0=”1” enables the Network Loop-Up code detection in the receiver. If the “00001”
Network Loop-Up code is detected in the receive data for longer than 5 seconds, the NLCD bit in the interface
register is set indicating that the remote terminal has activated remote Loop-Back and the chip is receiving its
own transmitted data. When the interface bits TXTEST2=”1”, TXTEST1=”1” and TXTEST0=”1” the chip is
enabled to transmit the Network Loop-Down Code (TLDC) “001” from the selected channel requesting the
remote terminal the removal of the Loop-Back condition.
In the Host mode each channel is capable of monitoring the contents of the receive data for the presence of
Loop-Up or Loop-Down code from the remote terminal. In the Host mode the two interface bits NLCDE[1:0]
control the Loop-Code detection independently for each channel according to Table 13.
                                     TABLE 13: LOOP-CODE DETECTION CONTROL

                  1              1      Automatic Loop-Code detection and Remote Loop-Back Activation
Setting the interface bits to NLCDE1=”0” and NLCDE0=”1” activates the detection of the Loop-Up code in the
receive data. If the “00001” Network Loop-Up code is detected in the receive data for longer than 5 seconds,
the NLCD interface bit is set to “1” and stays in this state for as long as the receiver continues to receive the

Network Loop-Up Code. In this mode if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, the chip will initiate an interrupt on every
transition of NLCD. The host has the option to ignore the request from the remote terminal, or to respond to the
request and manually activate Remote Loop-Back. The host can subsequently activate the detection of the
Loop-Down Code by setting NLCDE1=”1” and NLCDE0=”0”. In this case, receiving the “001” Loop-Down Code
for longer than 5 seconds will set the NLCD bit to “1” and if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, the chip will initiate
an interrupt on every transition of NLCD. The host can respond to the request from the remote terminal and
remove Loop-Back condition. In the manual Network Loop-Up (NLCDE1=”0” and NLCDE0=”1”) and Loop-
Down (NLCDE1=”1” and NLCDE0=”0”) Code detection modes, the NLCD interface bit will be set to “1” upon
receiving the corresponding code in excess of 5 seconds in the receive data. The chip will initiate an interrupt
any time the status of the NLCD bit changes and the Network Loop-code interrupt is enabled.
In the Host mode, setting the interface bits NLCDE1=”1” and NLCDE0=”1” enables the automatic Loop-Code
detection and Remote Loop-Back activation mode if, TXTEST[2:0] is NOT equal to “110”. As this mode is
initiated, the state of the NLCD interface bit is reset to “0” and the chip is programmed to monitor the receive
input data for the Loop-Up Code. If the “00001” Network Loop-Up Code is detected in the receive data for
longer than 5 seconds in addition to the NLCD bit in the interface register being set, Remote Loop-Back is
automatically activated. The chip stays in remote Loop-Back even if it stops receiving the “00001” pattern. After
the chip detects the Loop-Up code, sets the NLCD bit and enters Remote Loop-Back, it automatically starts
monitoring the receive data for the Loop-Down code. In this mode however, the NLCD bit stays set even if the
receiver stops receiving the Loop-Up code, which is an indication to the host that the Remote Loop-Back is still
in effect. Remote Loop-Back is removed if the chip detects the “001” Loop-Down code for longer than 5
seconds. Detecting the “001” code also results in resetting the NLCD interface bit and initiating an interrupt.
The Remote Loop-Back can also be removed by taking the chip out of the Automatic detection mode by
programming it to operate in a different state. The chip will not respond to remote Loop-Back request if Local
Analog Loop-Back is activated locally. When programmed in Automatic detection mode the NLCD interface bit
stays “High” for the whole time the Remote Loop-Back is activated and initiates an interrupt any time the status
of the NLCD bit changes provided the Network Loop-code interrupt is enabled.
TRANSMIT AND DETECT QUASI-RANDOM SIGNAL SOURCE (TDQRSS)
Each channel of XRT83SL38 includes a QRSS pattern generation and detection block for diagnostic purposes
that can be activated only in the Host mode by setting the interface bits TXTEST2=”1”, TXTEST1=”0” and
TXTEST0=”0”. For T1 systems, the QRSS pattern is a 220-1pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) with no
more than 14 consecutive zeros. For E1 systems, the QRSS pattern is 215 -1 PRBS with an inverted output.
With QRSS and Analog Local Loop-Back enabled simultaneously, and by monitoring the status of the QRPD
interface bit, all main functional blocks within the transceiver can be verified.
When the receiver achieves QRSS synchronization with fewer than 4 errors in a 128 bits window, QRPD
changes from “Low” to “High”. After pattern synchronization, any bit error will cause QRPD to go “Low” for one
clock cycle. If the QRPDIE bit is enabled, any transition on the QRPD bit will generate an interrupt.
With TDQRSS activated, a bit error can be inserted in the transmitted QRSS pattern by transitioning the
INSBER interface bit from “0” to “1”. Bipolar violation can also be inserted either in the QRSS pattern, or input
data when operating in the single-rail mode by transitioning the INSBPV interface bit from “0” to “1”. The state
of INSBER and INSBPV bits are sampled on the rising edge of the TCLK_n. To insure the insertion of the bit
error or bipolar violation, a “0” should be written in these bit locations before writing a “1”.

LOCAL ANALOG LOOP-BACK (ALOOP)
With Local Analog Loop-Back activated, the transmit data at TTIP and TRING are looped-back to the analog
input of the receiver. External inputs at RTIP/RRING in this mode are ignored while valid transmit data
continues to be sent to the line. Local Analog Loop-Back exercises most of the functional blocks of the
XRT83SL38 including the jitter attenuator which can be selected in either the transmit or receive paths. Local
Analog Loop-Back is shown in Figure 17.

In the Remote Loop-Back mode if the jitter attenuator is selected in the transmit path, the receive data from the
Clock and Data Recovery block is looped back to the transmit path and is applied to the jitter attenuator using
RCLK as transmit timing. In this mode the transmit clock and data are also ignored, while RCLK and received
data will continue to be available at their respective output pins. Remote Loop-Back with the jitter attenuator
selected in the transmit path is shown in Figure 19.

DIGITAL LOOP-BACK (DLOOP)
Digital Loop-Back or Local Loop-Back allows the transmit clock and data to be looped back to the
corresponding receiver output pins through the encoder/decoder and jitter attenuator. In this mode, receive
data and clock are ignored, but the transmit data will be sent to the line uninterrupted. This loop back feature
allows users to configure the line interface as a pure jitter attenuator. The Digital Loop-Back signal flow is
shown in Figure 20.

DUAL LOOP-BACK
Figure 21 depicts the data flow in dual-loopback. In this mode, selecting the jitter attenuator in the transmit
path will have the same result as placing the jitter attenuator in the receive path. In dual Loop-Back mode the
recovered clock and data from the line are looped back through the transmitter to the TTIP and TRING without
passing through the jitter attenuator. The transmit clock and data are looped back through the jitter attenuator
to the RCLK and RPOS/RDATA and RNEG pins.

MICROPROCESSOR REGISTER TABLES
The microprocessor interface consists of 256 addressable locations. Each channel uses 16 dedicated 8 byte
registers for independent programming and control. There are four additional registers for global control of all
channels and two registers for device identification and revision numbers. The remaining registers are for
factory test and future expansion. The control register map and the function of the individual bits are
summarized in Table 17 and Table 18 respectively.

                              NOTES:
                                    1. This bit provides independent turn-off or turn-on
                                       control of each receiver channel.
                                    2. In Hardware mode all receiver channels are always
                                       on in the TQFP package. In the BGA packace all
                                       receiver channels can be turned on or off together by
                                       applying the appropriate signal to the RXON pin (#
                                       K16).
         D4         EQC4_n    Equalizer Control bit 4: This bit together with EQC[3:0] are        R/W      0

                             number n. In a T1 system QRSS pattern is a 220-1 pseudo-

                             tive zeros. In a E1 system, QRSS is a 215-1 PRBS pattern.

                            receiving the Loop-Up code. The Remote Loop-Back condition
                            is removed when the chip receives the Loop-Down code for
                            more than 5 seconds or if the Automatic Loop-Code detection
                            mode is terminated.

                            stream of the selected channel number n. Bipolar violation can
                            be inserted either in the QRSS pattern, or input data when
                            operating in single-rail mode. The state of this bit is sampled
                            on the rising edge of the respective TCLK_n.
                            NOTE:     To ensure the insertion of a bipolar violation, a “0”
                                     should be written in this bit location before writing a

                            writing a “1” to this bit selects a transformer ratio of 1:2 for the
                            transmitter. Writing a “0” sets the transmitter transformer ratio
                            to 1:2.45. In the internal termination mode the transmitter
                            transformer ratio is permanently set to 1:2 and the state of this
                            bit has no effect.

     D3           NLCD_n    Network Loop-Code Detection:                                        RO    0
                            This bit operates differently in the Manual or the Automatic
                            Network Loop-Code detection modes.
                            In the Manual Loop-Code detection mode, (NLCDE1 = “0”
                            and NLCDE0 = “1” or NLCDE1 = “1” and NLCDE0 = “0”) this
                            bit gets set to “1” as soon as the Loop-Up (“00001”) or Loop-
                            Down (“001”) code is detected in the receive data for longer
                            than 5 seconds. The NLCD bit stays in the “1” state for as long
                            as the chip detects the presence of the Loop-code in the
                            receive data and it is reset to “0” as soon as it stops receiving
                            it. In this mode, if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, the chip will
                            initiate an interrupt on every transition of the NLCD.
                            When the Automatic Loop-code detection mode, (NLCDE1
                            = “1” and NLCDE0 =”1”) is initiated, the state of the NLCD
                            interface bit is reset to “0” and the chip is programmed to mon-
                            itor the receive input data for the Loop-Up code. This bit is set
                            to a “1” to indicate that the Network Loop Code is detected for
                            more than 5 seconds. Simultaneously the Remote Loop-Back
                            condition is automatically activated and the chip is pro-
                            grammed to monitor the receive data for the Network Loop
                            Down code. The NLCD bit stays in the “1” state for as long as
                            the Remote Loop-Back condition is in effect even if the chip
                            stops receiving the Loop-Up code. Remote Loop-Back is
                            removed if the chip detects the “001” pattern for longer than 5
                            seconds in the receive data.Detecting the “001” pattern also
                            results in resetting the NLCD interface bit and initiating an
                            interrupt provided the NLCD interrupt enable bit is active.
                            When programmed in Automatic detection mode, the
                            NLCD interface bit stays “High” for the entire time the Remote
                            Loop-Back is active and initiate an interrupt anytime the status
                            of the NLCD bit changes. In this mode, the Host can monitor
                            the state of the NLCD bit to determine if the Remote Loop-
                            Back is activated.

                            cate All Ones Signal is detected by the receiver. The value of
                            this bit is based on the current status of Alarm Indication Signal
                            detector of channel n. If the AISDIE bit is enabled, any transi-
                            tion on this bit will generate an Interrupt.
     D1           RLOS_n    Receive Loss of Signal: This bit is set to a “1” to indicate that   RO    0
                            the receive input signal is lost. The value of this bit is based on
                            the current status of the receive input signal of channel n. If the
                            RLOSIE bit is enabled, any transition on this bit will generate
                            an Interrupt.
     D0          QRPD_n     Quasi-random Pattern Detection: This bit is set to a “1” to         RO    0
                            indicate the receiver is currently in synchronization with QRSS
                            pattern. The value of this bit is based on the current status of
                            Quasi-random pattern detector of channel n. If the QRPDIE bit

CLOCK SELECT REGISTER
The input clock source is used to generate all the necessary clock references internally to the LIU. The
microprocessor timing is derived from a PLL output which is chosen by programming the Clock Select Bits and
the Master Clock Rate in register 0x81h. Therefore, if the clock selection bits or the MCLRATE bit are being
programmed, the frequency of the PLL output will be adjusted accordingly. During this adjustment, it is
important to "Not" write to any other bit location within the same register while selecting the input/output clock
frequency. For best results, register 0x81h can be broken down into two sub-registers with the MSB being bits
D[7:3] and the LSB being bits D[2:0] as shown in Figure 22. Note: Bit D[7] is a reserved bit.

Programming Examples:
Example 1: Changing bits D[7:3]
If bits D[7:3] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 2: Changing bits D[2:0]
If bits D[2:0] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 3: Changing bits within the MSB and LSB
In this scenario, one must initiate TWO write operations such that the MSB and LSB do not change within ONE
write cycle. It is recommended that the MSB and LSB be treated as two independent sub-registers. One can
either change the clock selection (MSB) and then change bits D[2:0] (LSB) on the SECOND write, or vice-
versa. No order or sequence is necessary.

                              This bit is used to enable the Arbitrary Pulse Generators for
                              shaping the transmit pulse shape when E1 mode is selected.
                              If this bit is set to "1", all 8 channels will be configured for the
                              Arbitrary Mode. However, each channel is individually con-
                              trolled by programming the channel registers 0xn8 through
                              0xnF, where n is the number of the channel.
