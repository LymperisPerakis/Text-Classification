 Notes:
    1. The Si3050 specifications are guaranteed when the typical application circuit (including component tolerance) and any
        Si3050 and any Si3011/18/19 are used. See "2. Typical Application Schematic" on page 17 for the typical application
        circuit.
    2. All minimum and maximum specifications are guaranteed and apply across the recommended operating conditions.
        Typical values apply at nominal supply voltages and an operating temperature of 25 °C unless otherwise stated.
    3. Operation above 125 °C junction temperature may degrade device reliability.

 Notes:
    1. Measured at TIP and RING with 600 termination at 1 kHz, as shown in Figure 1 on page 6.
    2. With FULL = 1, the transmit and receive full-scale level of +3.2 dBm can be achieved with a 600  ac termination.
        While the transmit and receive level in dBm varies with reference impedance, the DAA will transmit and receive 1 dBV
        into all reference impedances. With FULL2 = 1, the transmit and receive full-scale level of +6.0 dBm can be achieved
        with a 600  termination. In this mode, the DAA will transmit and receive +1.5 dBV into all reference impedances.
    3. Receive full-scale level produces –0.9 dBFS at DTX.
    4. DR = 20 x log (RMS VFS/RMS Vin) + 20 x log (RMS Vin/RMS noise). The RMS noise measurement excludes
        harmonics. Here, VFS is the 0 dBm full-scale level per Note 1 above.
    5. Measurement is 300 to 3400 Hz. Applies to both transmit and receive paths.
    6. Vin =1 kHz, –3 dBFS.
    7. THD = 20 x log (RMS distortion/RMS signal).
    8. DRCID = 20 x log (RMS VCID/RMS VIN) + 20 x log (RMS VIN/RMS noise). VCID is the 1.5 V full-scale level with the
        enhanced caller ID circuit. With the typical CID circuit, the VCID full-scale level is 6 V peak, and the DRCID decreases to
        50 dB.
    9. Refer to Tables 10–11 for relative gain accuracy characteristics (passband ripple).

 Notes:
    1. All timing (except Rise and Fall time) is referenced to the 50% level of the waveform. Input test levels are
        VIH = VD – 0.4 V, VIL = 0.4 V. Rise and Fall times are referenced to the 20% and 80% levels of the waveform.
    2. FSYNC/PCLK relationship must be fixed after RESET
    3. The minimum RESET pulse width is the greater of 250 ns or 10 PCLK cycle times.

 Notes:
     1. All timing is referenced to the 50% level of the waveform. Input test levels are VIH = VO – 0.4 V, VIL = 0.4 V, rise and fall
         times are referenced to the 20% and 80% levels of the waveform.
     2. FSYNC must be 8 kHz under all operating conditions.
     3. Specification applies to PCLK fall to DTX tri-state when that mode is selected.

 Notes:
    1. All timing is referenced to the 50% level of the waveform. Input test levels are VIH = VO – 0.4 V, VIL = 0.4 V, rise and fall
        times are referenced to the 20% and 80% levels of the waveform.
    2. FSYNC must be 8 kHz under all operating conditions.
    3. Specification applies to PCLK fall to DTX tri-state when that mode is selected.

Notes:
   1. R7–R8 may be substituted for R30–R33 and C30–C31 for lower cost, but reduced CID performance.
   2. Several diode bridge configurations are acceptable. Parts, such as a single HD04, a DF-04S, or four 1N4004 diodes,
       may be used (suppliers include General Semiconductor, Diodes Inc., etc.).

Notes:
     1. The off-hook counter and calibrations prevent transmission or reception of data for 402.75 ms (default) for the line
         voltage to settle.
     2. The caller alert signal (CAS) tone transmits from the CO to signal an incoming call.
     3. The device is taken on-hook to read the line voltage in the LVS bits to detect parallel handsets. In this mode, no data is
         transmitted on the DTX pin.

matches the impedance set by ACIM.
The Si3050 also offers a digital hybrid stage for
additional near-end echo cancellation. For each ac
termination setting, the eight programmable hybrid
registers (Registers 45–52) can be programmed with
coefficients to increase cancellation of real-world line
impedances. This digital filter can produce 10 dB or
greater of near-end echo cancellation in addition to the
trans-hybrid loss from the analog hybrid circuitry.

5.32. PCM Highway
The Si3050 contains a flexible programmable interface for the transmission and reception of digital PCM samples.
PCM data transfer is controlled via the PCLK and FSYNC inputs, the PCM Transmit and Receive Start Count
registers (Registers 34–37), and the PCM Mode Select register (Register 33). The interface can be configured to
support from 4 to 128 8-bit timeslots in each frame, which corresponds to PCLK frequencies of 256 kHz to
8.192 MHz in power of 2 increments. Time slot assignment and data delay from FSYNC edge are handled via the
TXS and RXS registers. These 10-bit values are programmed with the number of PCLK cycles following the rising
edge of FSYNC until the data transfer begins. Because the Si3050 looks for the rising edge of FSYNC, both long
and short FSYNC pulse widths can be accommodated. A value of 0 in the PCM Transmit and Receive Start Count
registers signifies that the MSB of the data should occur in the same cycle as the rising edge of FSYNC.
40                                                           Rev. 1.5


                                                                     Si3050 + Si3011/18/19
By setting the correct starting point of the data, the Si3050 can operate with buses having multiple devices
requiring different time slots. The DTX pin is high impedance except during transmission of an 8-bit PCM sample.
DTX returns to high impedance either on the negative edge of PCLK during the LSB or on the positive edge of
PCLK following the LSB. This behavior is based on the setting of the TRI bit in the PCM Mode Select register.
Tristating on the negative edge allows the transmission of data by multiple sources in adjacent timeslots without the
risk of driver contention. In addition to 8-bit data modes, a 16-bit linear mode is also provided. This mode can be
activated via the PCMF bits in the PCM Mode Select register. Double-clocked timing also is supported in which the
duration of a data bit is two PCLK cycles. This mode is activated via the PHCF bit in the PCM Mode Select register.
Setting the TXS or RXS registers greater than the number of PCLK cycles in a sample period stops data
transmission or reception. Figures 30–33 illustrate the usage of the PCM highway interface to adapt to common
PCM standards.

5.33. Companding in PCM Mode
The Si3050 supports both µ-Law and A-Law companding formats in addition to 16-bit linear data. The 8-bit
companding schemes follow a segmented curve formatted as a sign bit, three chord bits, and four step bits. µ-Law
is commonly used in North America and Japan, while A-Law is primarily used in Europe. Data format is selected
via the PCMF bits (Register 33). Table 22 on page 45 and Table 23 on page 46 define the µ-Law and A-Law
encoding formats. If linear mode is used the resulting 16-bit data is transmitted in two consecutive 8-bit PCM
highway timeslots as shown in Figure 34.
5.34. 16 kHz Sampling Operation in PCM Mode
The Si3050 can be configured to support a 16 kHz sampling rate and transmit the data on an 8 kHz PCM or GCI
highway bus. By setting the HSSM bit (Register 7, bit 3) to 1, the DAA changes its sampling rate, Fs, to 16 kHz if it
was originally configured for an 8 kHz sampling rate. If µ-law or A-law companding is used, the resulting 8-bit
samples are transmitted in two consecutive 8-bit PCM highway timeslots. If linear mode is used, the resulting 16-bit
samples are transmitted in four consecutive 8-bit PCM highway timeslots as shown in Figure 35.

5.35. SPI Control Interface
The control interface to the Si3050 is a 4-wire interface modeled on commonly available micro-controller and serial
peripheral devices. The interface consists of four pins: clock (SCLK), chip select (CS), serial data input (SDI), and
serial data output (SDO). In addition, the Si3050 includes a serial data through output pin (SDITHRU) to support
daisy chain operation of up to 16 devices. The device can operate with 8-bit and 16-bit SPI controllers. Each SPI
operation consists of a control byte, an address byte (of which only the six LSBs are used internally), and either
one or two data bytes depending on the width of the controller. Bytes are transmitted MSB first.
There are a number of variations of usage on this four-wire interface as follows:
  Continuous clocking. During continuous clocking, assertion of the CS pin controls the data transfers. The CS
   pin must be asserted before the falling edge of SCLK on which the first bit of data is expected during a read
   cycle, and must remain low for the duration of the 8-bit transfer (command/address or data), going high after the
   last rising edge of SCLK after the transfer.
 Clock only during transfer. The clock is active during the actual byte transfers only. Each byte transfer consists
   of eight clock cycles in a return to 1 format.
 SDI/SDO wired operation. Independent of the clocking options described, the SDI and SDO pins can be treated
   as two separate lines or wired together if the master can tri-state its output during the data byte transfer of a
   read operation.
The SPI state machine resets when the CS pin is asserted during an operation on an SCLK cycle that is not a
multiple of eight. This provides a mechanism for the controller to force the state machine to a known state in the
case where the controller and the device are not synchronized.
The control byte has the following structure and is presented on the SDI pin MSB first.
     7          6           5          4             3           2         1          0
  BRCT         R/W          1          0          CID[0]      CID[1]    CID[2]      CID[3]
The bits are defined as follows:
   7       BRCT     Indicates a broadcast operation that is intended for all devices in the daisy chain. This is only
                    valid for write operations as it causes contention on the SDO pin during a read.
   6        R/W     Read/Write Bit.
                    1 = Read operation.
                    0 = Write operation.
   5         1      This bit must be 1 at all times.
   4         0      This bit must be 0 at all times.
  3:0     CID[0:3]  This field indicates the channel that is targeted by the operation. The 4-bit channel value is pro-
                    vided LSB first. The devices reside on the daisy chain such that device 0 is nearest to the con-
                    troller and device 15 is furthest away in the SDI/SDITHRU chain. See Figure 36.
                    As the CID information propagates down the daisy chain, each channel decrements the CID by
                    1. The device that receives a value of 0 in the CID field responds to the SPI transaction. See
                    Figure 37. If a broadcast to all devices connected to the chain is requested, the CID do not
                    decrement. In this case, the same 8- or 16-bit data is presented to all channels regardless of
                    the CID values.

In Figure 37 the CID field is 0. As this field is decremented in LSB to MSB order, the value decrements for each SDI
down the line. The BRCT and R/W bits remain unchanged as the control word passes through the entire chain. A
unique CID is presented to each device, and the device receiving a CID value of 0 is the target of the operation
(channel 0 in this case). Figure 38 illustrates that in broadcast mode, all bits pass through the chain without
permutation.

operations are performed as a 3-byte transfer. The CS pin is asserted between each byte. The CS pin must be
asserted before the first falling edge of SCLK after the DATA byte to indicate to the state machine that only one
byte should be transferred. The state of the SDI pin is ignored during the DATA byte of a read operation.

The Idle state is achieved by the MX and MR bits being held inactive (signal is high) for two or more frames. When
a transmission is initiated by a host device, an active state (signal is low) is present on the downstream MX bit. This
signals to the Si3050 that a transmission has begun on the Monitor channel and the Si3050 should begin accepting
data from host device. The Si3050, after reading the data on the Monitor channel, acknowledges the initial
transmission by placing the upstream MR bit in an active state. The data is received and the upstream MR
becomes active in the frame immediately following the downstream MX becoming active. The upstream MR then
remains active until either the next byte is received or an end of message is detected. The end of message is
signaled by the downstream MX being held inactive for two or more consecutive frames. Receipt of initial data is
signaled by the upstream MR bit’s transitioning from an inactive to an active state. Upon receiving
acknowledgement from the Si3050 that the initial data is received, the host device places the downstream MX bit in
the inactive state for one frame and then either transmit another byte by placing the downstream MX bit in an active
state again, or signal an end of message by leaving the downstream MX bit inactive for a second frame.
When the host is performing a write command, the host only manipulates the downstream MX bit, and the Si3050
only manipulates the upstream MR bit. If a read command is performed, the host initially manipulates the
downstream MX bit to communicate the command, but then manipulates the downstream MR bit in response to the
Si3050 responding with the requested data. Similarly, the Si3050 initially manipulates its upstream MR bit to
receive the read command, and then manipulates its upstream MX bit to respond with the requested data. If the
host is transmitting data, the Si3050 always transmits a $FF value on its Monitor data byte. While the Si3050 is
transmitting data, the host should always transmit a $FF value on its Monitor byte. If the Si3050 is transmitting data
and detects a value other than a $FF on the downstream Monitor byte, the Si3050 signals an Abort.
For read and write commands, an initial address must be specified. The Si3050 responds to a read or a write
command at this address, and then subsequently increment this address after every register access.

In this manner, multiple consecutive registers can be read or written in one transmission sequence. By correctly
manipulating the MX and MR bits, a transmission sequence can continue from the beginning specified address
until an invalid memory location is reached. To end a transmission sequence, the host processor must signal an
end-of-message (EOM) by placing the downstream MX and MR bits inactive for two consecutive frames. The
transmission also can be stopped by the Si3050 by signaling an Abort. This is signaled by placing the upstream
MR bit inactive for at least two consecutive cycles in response to the downstream MX bit going active. An abort is
signaled by the Si3050 for the following reasons:
   A read or write to an invalid memory address is attempted
   An invalid command sequence is received
 A data byte was not received for at least two consecutive frames
 A collision occurs on the Monitor data bytes while the Si3050 is transmitting data
When the Si3050 aborts because of an invalid command sequence, the state of the Si3050 does not change. If a
read or write to an invalid memory address is attempted, all previous reads or writes in that transmission sequence
are valid up to the read or write to the invalid memory address. If an EOM is detected before a valid command
sequence is communicated, the Si3050 returns to the idle state and remains unchanged.

Si3050 + Si3011/18/19
The data presented to the Si3050 in the downstream Monitor bits must be present for two consecutive frames to be
considered valid data. The Si3050 checks to ensure it receives the same data in two consecutive frames. If not, it
does not acknowledge receipt of the data byte and waits until it does receive two consecutive identical data bytes
before acknowledging to the transmitter that it received the data. If the transmitter attempts to signal transmission
of a subsequent data byte by placing the downstream MX bit in an inactive state while the Si3050 is still waiting to
receive a valid data byte transmission of two consecutive identical data bytes, the Si3050 signals an abort and
ends the transmission. Figure 45 shows a state diagram for the Receiver Monitor channel for the Si3050. Figure 46
on page 55 shows a state diagram for the Transmitter Monitor channel for the Si3050.

Si3050 + Si3011/18/19
5.40. Summary of Monitor Channel Commands
Communication with the Si3050 should be in the following format:
Byte 1: Device Address Byte
Byte 2: Command Byte
Byte 3: Register Address Byte
Bytes 4-n: Data Bytes
Bytes n+1, n+2: EOM
5.41. Device Address Byte
The Device Address byte identifies which device connected to the GCI highway receives the particular message.
This address should be the first byte sent to the Si3050 at the beginning of every transmission sequence. For Read
commands, the address sent to the Si3050 is the first byte transmitted in response to the Read command before
register data is transmitted. This Device Address byte has the following structure:
   1      0        0     A      B      0       0      C
The lowest programmable bit, C, has a special function. This bit enables a register read or write, or enables a
special Channel Identification Command (CID).
C = 1: Normal command follows.
C = 0: Channel Identification Command.
The CID is a special command to identify themselves by software. For this special command, the subsequent
command byte transmitted by the host processor must be $00 (binary), and have no address or data bytes. The
Si3050 in turn responds with a fixed 2-byte identification code:
   1      0        0     A      0      0       0      0
   1      0        1     1      1      1       1      0
Upon sending the 2-byte identification code, the Si3050 sends an EOM (MR = MX = 1) for two consecutive frames.
When A = 0, B must be 0 or the Si3050 signals an abort due to an invalid command. In this mode, bit C is the only
other programmable bit.
A = 0: Response to CID command from the device using channel B1 is placed in Monitor Data.

A = 1: Response to CID command from the device using channel B2 is placed in Monitor Data.
When C = 1, bits A and B are channel enable bits. When these bits are set to 1, the individual corresponding
channels receives the command in the next command byte. The channels whose corresponding bits are set to 0
ignores the subsequent command byte.
A = 1: Channel B1 receives the command.
A = 0: Channel B1 does not receive the command.
B = 1: Channel B2 receives the command.
B = 0: Channel B2 does not receive the command.
5.42. Command Byte
The Command byte has the following structure:
   RW                       CMD[6:0]
The RW bit is a register read/write bit.
RW = 0: A write is performed to the Si3050’s register.
RW = 1: A read is performed on the Si3050’s register.
The CMD[6:0] bits specify the actual command to be performed.
CMD[6:0] = 0000001: Read or write a register on the Si3050.
CMD[6:0] = 0000010 – 1111111: Reserved.
5.43. Register Address Byte
The Register Address byte has the following structure:
                     ADDRESS[7:0]
This byte contains the actual 8-bit address of the register to be read or written.
5.44. SC Channel
The SC channel consists of six C/I bits and two handshaking bits, MR and MX. One of these channels is contained
in every 4-byte sub-frame and is transmitted every frame. The handshaking bits are described in the above Monitor
Channel section. The definition of the six C/I bits depends on the direction the bits are being sent, either
transmitted to the GCI highway bus via the DTX pin or received from the GCI highway bus via the DRX pin.

Si3050 + Si3011/18/19
CIR1: OH
Data that is received must be consistent and match for at least two consecutive frames to be considered valid.
When a new command or status is communicated via the C/I bits, the data must be sent for at least two
consecutive frames to be recognized by the Si3050. The following steps describe the protocol of how C/I bits are
stored, detected, and validated. This is illustrated in Figure 49.
1. The current state of the C/I bits are stored in a primary register P. If the received C/I bits are identical to this
   current state, no action is taken.
2. Upon receipt of an SC channel with C/I bits that differ from the current state, these new C/I bits are immediately
   latched into a secondary register S.
3. The C/I bits in the SC channel received in the frame immediately after the SC channel just stored in S are
   compared with the C/I bits in the S register.
    a. If the C/I bits in these two channels are identical, then the C/I bits in the S register are loaded into the P
       register and are considered a valid change of C/I bits. The Si3050 then responds accordingly to the changed
       C/I bits.
    b. If a set of C/I bits is latched into the S register and the subsequent set of C/I bits received does not match
       either the S or P registers, then the newly received set of C/I bits are latched into the S register. This
       continues to occur as long as the subsequent set of C/I bits received differs from the C/I bits in the S and
       P registers.
    c. If the C/I bits in the SC channel received immediately after the SC channel just stored in S do not match the
       C/I bits stored in S, but DO match the C/I bits stored in P, then the single set of C/I bits stored in the S latch
       are invalidated, and the current state of the C/I bits in P remains unchanged.

 5:4   PWMM[1:0] Pulse Width Modulation Mode.
                    Used to select the type of signal output on the call progress AOUT pin.
                    00 = PWM output is clocked at 16.384 MHz as a delta-sigma data stream. A local density of
                    1s and 0s tracks the combined transmit and receive signals. Use this setting with the optional
                    call progress circuit shown in Figure 19 on page 20.
                    01 = Balanced conventional PWM output signal has high and low portions of the modulated
                    pulse that are centered on the 16 kHz sample clock.
                    10 = Conventional PWM output signal returns to logic 0 at regular 32 kHz intervals and rises
                    at a time in the 32 kHz period proportional to its instantaneous amplitude.
                    11 = Reserved.

                    0 = Pulse width modulation mode disabled (AOUT).
                    1 = Enable pulse width modulation mode for the call progress analog output (AOUT). This
                    mode sums the transmit and receive audio paths and presents this as a CMOS digital-level
                    output of PWM data. The circuit in Figure 19 on page 20 should be used.

                    0 = Digital loopback across the isolation barrier is disabled.
                    1 = Enables digital loopback mode across the isolation barrier. The line-side device must be
                    enabled and off-hook prior to setting this mode. The data path includes the TX and RX filters.
  0     Reserved    Read returns zero.

                     1 = Watchdog timer enabled. When set, this bit can be cleared only by a hardware reset. The
                     watchdog timer monitors register access. If no register access occurs within a 4 s window, the
                     DAA is put into an on-hook state. A read or write of a DAA register restarts the watchdog timer
                     counter. If the watchdog timer times out, the OH bit is cleared, placing the DAA into an
                     on-hook state. Setting the OH bit places the DAA back into an off-hook state.

   2        RDI      Ring Detect Interrupt Mode.
                     This bit operates in conjunction with the RDTM and RDTI bits. This bit selects whether one or
                     two interrupts are generated for every ring burst.
                     0 = An interrupt is generated at the beginning of every ring burst.
                     1 = An interrupt is generated at the beginning and end of every ring burst. The interrupt at the
                     beginning of the ring burst must be serviced (by writing 0 to the RDTI bit) before the end of the
                     ring burst in order for both interrupts to occur.

   7       RDTI     Ring Detect Interrupt.
                    0 = A ring signal is not occurring.
                    1 = A ring signal is detected. If the RDTM bit (Register 3) and INTE bit (Register 2) are set, a
                    hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to a 0 to be cleared.
                    The RDI bit (Register 2) determines if this bit is set only at the beginning of a ring pulse, or at
                    the both the beginning and end of a ring pulse. This bit should be cleared after clearing the
                    PDL bit (Register 6) as powering up the line-side device can cause this interrupt to be trig-
                    gered.
   6      ROVI      Receive Overload Interrupt.
                    0 = Normal operation.
                    1 = An excessive input level on the receive pin is detected. If the ROVM bit (Register 3) and
                    INTE bit (Register 2) are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must
                    be written to 0 to clear it. This bit is identical in function to the ROV bit (Register 17) and clear-
                    ing this bit also clears the ROV bit.
   5       FDTI     Frame Detect Interrupt.
                    0 = Frame detect is established on the ISOcap link.
                    1 = This bit is set when the ISOcap link does not have frame lock. If the FDTM bit (Register 3)
                    and INTE bit (Register 2) are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. When
                    set, this bit must be written to 0 to be cleared.
   4       BTDI     Billing Tone Detect Interrupt.
                    0 = Normal operation.
                    1 = The line-side power supply has been disrupted. If the BTDM bit (Register 3) and INTE bit
                    (Register 2) are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be writ-
                    ten to 0 to clear it.
   3      DODI      Drop Out Detect Interrupt.
                    0 = Normal operation.
                    1 = The line-side power supply has collapsed. (The DOD bit in Register 19 has fired.) If the
                    DODM bit (Register 3) and INTE bit (Register 2) are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the
                    AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to 0 to be cleared. This bit should be cleared after
                    clearing the PDL bit (Register 6) as powering up the line-side device can cause this interrupt
                    to be triggered.
   2      LCSOI     Loop Current Sense Overload Interrupt.
                    0 = Normal operation.
                    1 = The LCS bits have reached max value. If the LCSOM bit (Register 3) and the INTE bit are
                    set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to 0 to clear it.
                    Note: LCSOI does not necessarily imply that an overcurrent situation has occurred. An overcurrent
                            situation in the DAA is determined by the status of the OPD bit (Register 19). After the LCSOI
                            interrupt fires, the OPD bit should be checked to determine if an overcurrent situation exists.

         0 = The CO has not grounded TIP causing current to flow.
         1 = The CO has grounded TIP, causing current to flow. Once set, this bit must be written to 0
         to clear it. If the TDGM bit (Register 3) and INTE bit (Register 3) are set, a hardware interrupt
         occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. To clear the interrupt, write this bit to 0.
 0  POLI Polarity Reversal Detect Interrupt (Si3011 and Si3019 line-side only).
         0 = Bit 7 of the LVS register has not changed states.
         1 = Bit 7 of the LVS register has transitioned from 0 to 1, or from 1 to 0, indicating the polarity
         of TIP and RING is switched. If the POLM bit (Register 3) and INTE bit (Register 2) are set, a
         hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. To clear the interrupt, write this bit to 0.

 5:0      RMX[5:0]    Ring Assertion Maximum Count.
                      These bits set the maximum ring frequency for a valid ring signal within a 10% margin of
                      error. During ring qualification, a timer is loaded with the RAS[5:0] field upon a TIP/RING
                      event and decrements at a regular rate. When a subsequent TIP/RING event occurs, the
                      timer value is compared to the RMX[5:0] field and if it exceeds the value in RMX[5:0] then
                      the frequency of the ring is too high and the ring is invalidated. The difference between
                      RAS[5:0] and RMX[5:0] identifies the minimum duration between TIP/RING events to qual-
                      ify as a ring, in binary-coded increments of 2.0 ms (nominal). A TIP/RING event typically
                      occurs twice per ring tone period. At 20 Hz, TIP/RING events would occur every 1/
                      (2 x 20 Hz) = 25 ms. To calculate the correct RMX[5:0] value for a frequency range [f_min,
                      f_max], the following equation should be used:
                                                                                             1

                      To compensate for error margin and ensure a sufficient ring detection window, it is recom-
                      mended that the calculated value of RMX[5:0] be incremented by 1.

          Notes:
          General
             1. All dimensions shown are in millimeters (mm) unless otherwise noted.
             2. Dimensioning and Tolerancing is per the ANSI Y14.5M-1994 specification.
             3. This Land Pattern Design is based on the IPC-7351 guidelines.
          Solder mask design
             1. All metal pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance
                 between the solder mask and the metal pad is to be 60 mm minimum, all the
                 way around the pad.
          Stencil Design
             1. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls
                 should be used to assure good solder paste release.
             2. The stencil thickness should be 0.125mm (5 mils).
             3. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for all perimeter
                 pins.
             4. A 2 x 2 array of 0.90 mm square openings on 1.20 mm pitch should be used
                 for the center ground pad.
          Card Assembly
             1. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
             2. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020
                 specification for Small Body Components.

          1. All pads are to be non-solder mask defined (NSMD). Clearance between the solder
              mask and the metal pad is to be 60 m minimum, all the way around the pad.
       Stencil Design
          1. A stainless steel, laser-cut and electro-polished stencil with trapezoidal walls should be
              used to assure good solder paste release.
          2. The stencil thickness should be 0.125 mm (5 mils).
          3. The ratio of stencil aperture to land pad size should be 1:1 for the perimeter pads.
          4. A 1.45 x 1.45 mm square aperture should be used for the center pad. This provides
              approximately 70% solder paste coverage on the pad, which is optimum to assure
              correct component stand-off.
       Card Assembly
          1. A No-Clean, Type-3 solder paste is recommended.
          2. The recommended card reflow profile is per the JEDEC/IPC J-STD-020C specification
              for Small Body Components.
