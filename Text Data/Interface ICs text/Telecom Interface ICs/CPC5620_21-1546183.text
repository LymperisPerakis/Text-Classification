worldwide. Some public telephone networks, notably                                                         termination models. The reactive termination
in North America and Japan require resistive line                                                          application circuit (see Figure 3 on page 8) describes the
termination. Other telephone networks, as in Europe                                                        TBR-21 implementation. This circuit can be adapted
and elsewhere, require a reactive line termination.                                                        easily for other reactive termination needs.

7. Manufacturing Information
7.1 Moisture Sensitivity
            All plastic encapsulated semiconductor packages are susceptible to moisture ingression. IXYS Integrated
            Circuits Division classified all of its plastic encapsulated devices for moisture sensitivity according to the
            latest version of the joint industry standard, IPC/JEDEC J-STD-020, in force at the time of product
            evaluation. We test all of our products to the maximum conditions set forth in the standard, and guarantee
proper operation of our devices when handled according to the limitations and information in that standard as well as
to any limitations set forth in the information or standards referenced below.
Failure to adhere to the warnings or limitations as established by the listed specifications could result in reduced
product performance, reduction of operable life, and/or reduction of overall reliability.
This product carries a Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) rating as shown below, and should be handled according to
the requirements of the latest version of the joint industry standard IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033.
                                  Device                         Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL) Rating
                           CPC5620A / CPC5621A                                   MSL 3
7.2 ESD Sensitivity
            This product is ESD Sensitive, and should be handled according to the industry standard 
            JESD-625.
7.3 Reflow Profile
This product has a maximum body temperature and time rating as shown below. All other guidelines of J-STD-020
must be observed.
                                  Device                             Maximum Temperature x Time
                           CPC5620A / CPC5621A                            260°C for 30 seconds
7.4 Board Wash
IXYS Integrated Circuits Division recommends the use of no-clean flux formulations. However, board washing to
remove flux residue is acceptable. Since IXYS Integrated Circuits Division employs the use of silicone coating as an
optical waveguide in many of its optically isolated products, the use of a short drying bake could be necessary if a
wash is used after solder reflow processes. Chlorine-based or Fluorine-based solvents or fluxes should not be used.
Cleaning methods that employ ultrasonic energy should not be used
