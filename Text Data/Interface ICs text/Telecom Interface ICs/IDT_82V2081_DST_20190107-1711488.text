                                                 is sampled into the device on the active edge of TCLK. If TCLK is missing1 and the TCLK missing interrupt is not masked,
                                                 an interrupt will be generated.

                                    This pin outputs 1.544 MHz for T1/J1 mode or 2.048 MHz for E1 mode receive clock. Under LOS condition with AIS
                                    enabled (bit AISE=1), RCLK is derived from MCLK. In clock recovery mode, this signal provides the clock recovered from
                                    the RTIP/RRING signal. The receive data (RD in single rail mode or RDP and RDN in dual rail mode) is clocked out of
                                    the device on the active edge of RCLK. If clock recovery is bypassed, RCLK is the exclusive OR (XOR) output of the dual
                                    rail slicer data RDP and RDN. This signal can be used in applications with external clock recovery circuitry.
   MCLK        I       9       9    MCLK: Master Clock input
                                    A built-in clock system that accepts selectable 2.048MHz reference for E1 operating mode and 1.544MHz reference for
                                    T1/J1 operating mode. This reference clock is used to generate several internal reference signals:
                                    •      Timing reference for the integrated clock recovery unit.
                                    •      Timing reference for the integrated digital jitter attenuator.
                                    •      Timing reference for microcontroller interface.
                                    •      Generation of RCLK signal during a loss of signal condition.
                                    •      Reference clock to transmit All Ones, all zeros, PRBS/QRSS pattern as well as activate or deactivate Inband
                                           Loopback code if MCLK is selected as the reference clock. Note that for ATAO and AIS, MCLK is always used as
                                           the reference clock.
                                    •      Reference clock during the Transmit All Ones (TAO) condition or sending PRBS/QRSS in hardware control mode.
                                    The loss of MCLK will turn TTIP/TRING into high impedance status.
   LOS        O        7       7    LOS: Loss of Signal Output
                                    This is an active high signal used to indicate the loss of received signal. When LOS pin becomes high, it indicates the loss
                                    of received signal. The LOS pin will become low automatically when valid received signal is detected again. The criteria
                                    of loss of signal are described in 3.6 Los And AIS Detection.

SCAL[5:0] = 1101101 (default), One step change of this value of SCAL[5:0]
results in 2% scaling up/down against the pulse amplitude.
1. In T1 mode, when arbitrary pulse for short haul application is configured,
users should write ‘110110’ to SCAL[5:0] bits if no scaling is required.

     In hardware control mode, TERM and PULS[3:0] pins can be used to
select impedance matching for both receiver and transmitter. If TERM pin
is low, external impedance network will be used for impedance matching.
If TERM pin is high, internal impedance will be used for impedance match-

3.4.2     LINE MONITOR
     In both T1/J1 and E1 short haul applications, the non-intrusive monitor-
ing on channels located in other chips can be performed by tapping the mon-
itored channel through a high impedance bridging circuit. Refer to Figure-
9 and Figure-11.
     After a high resistance bridging circuit, the signal arriving at the RTIP/
RRING is dramatically attenuated. To compensate this attenuation, the
Monitor Gain can be used to boost the signal by 22 dB, 26 dB and 32 dB,                  Figure-9 Monitoring Receive Line in Another Chip
selected by MG[1:0] bits (RCF2, 0CH). For normal operation, the Monitor
Gain should be set to 0 dB.
     In hardware control mode, MONT pin can be used to set the Monitor
Gain. When MONT pin is low, the Monitor Gain is 0 dB. When MONT pin
is high, the Monitor Gain is 26 dB. Refer to 5 Hardware Control Pin Summary
for details.

3.9.2      ERROR DETECTION AND COUNTING
    Which type of the receiving errors (Received CV/BPV errors, excess
zero errors and PRBS logic errors) will be counted is determined by
ERR_SEL[1:0] bits (MAINT6, 13H). Only one type of receiving error can be
counted at a time except that when the ERR_SEL[1:0] bits are set to ‘11’,
both CV/BPV and EXZ errors will be detected and counted.
    The selected type of receiving errors is counted in an internal 16-bit Error
Counter. Once an error is detected, an error interrupt which is indicated by
corresponding bit in (INTS1, 1AH) will be generated if it is not masked. This
Error Counter can be operated in two modes: Auto Report Mode and Man-
ual Report Mode, as selected by the CNT_MD bit (MAINT6, 13H). In Single
Rail mode, once BPV or CV errors are detected, the CV pin will be driven
to high for one RCLK period.
    • Auto Report Mode
    In Auto Report Mode, the internal counter starts to count the received
errors when the CNT_MD bit (MAINT6, 13H) is set to ‘1’. A one-second timer
is used to set the counting period. The received errors are counted within
one second. If the one-second timer expires, the value in the internal coun-
ter will be transferred to (CNT0, 1BH) and (CNT1, 1CH), then the internal
counter will be reset and start to count received errors for the next second.                        Figure-16 Auto Report Mode
The errors occurred during the transfer will be accumulated to the next
round. The expiration of the one-second timer will set TMOV_IS bit (INTS1,
1AH) to ‘1’, and will generate an interrupt if the TIMER_IM bit (INTM1, 15H)
is set to ‘0’. The TMOV_IS bit (INTS1, 1AH) will be cleared after the interrupt
register is read. The content in the (CNT0, 1BH) and (CNT1, 1CH) should
be read within the next second. If the counter overflows, a counter overflow
interrupt which is indicated by CNT_OV_IS bit (INTS1, 1AH) will be gener-
ated if it is not masked by CNT_IM bit (INTM1, 15H).

      RST[7:0]           7-0         00H    Software reset. A write operation on this register will reset all internal registers to their default values, and the status
                                            of all ports are set to the default status. The content in this register can not be changed. After reset, all drivers output
