    MCLK        Input       17          G1    MCLK: Master Clock
                                              MCLK is an independent, free-running reference clock. It is a single reference for all operation modes
                                              and provides selectable1.544 MHz or 37.056 MHz for T1/J1 operating mode while 2.048 MHz or
                                              49.152 MHz for E1 operating mode.
                                              The reference clock is used to generate several internal reference signals:
                                              •     Timing reference for the integrated clock recovery unit.
                                              •     Timing reference for the integrated digital jitter attenuator.
                                              •     Timing reference for microcontroller interface.
                                              •     Generation of RCLKn signal during a loss of signal condition.
                                              •     Reference clock during Transmit All Ones (TAO) and all zeros condition. When sending PRBS/

                                              •     Reference clock for ATAO and AIS.
                                              The loss of MCLK will turn all the eight TTIP/TRING into high impedance status.

                                              ground; and if the 49.152 MHz (E1) or 37.056 MHz (T1/J1) is selected as the MCLK, this pin should

5.1 JTAG INSTRUCTIONS AND INSTRUCTION REG-
ISTER
    The IR (Instruction Register) with instruction decode block is used to
select the test to be executed or the data register to be accessed or both.
    The instructions are shifted in LSB first to this 3-bit register. See Table-
57 for details of the codes and the instructions related.
Table-57 Instruction Register Description

          000               Extest      The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the
                                        EXTEST instruction, the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be sam-
                                        pled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by shifting
                                        the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading patterns
                                        shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using the Update-DR state.
          100          Sample / Preload The sample instruction samples all the device inputs and outputs. For this instruction, the boundary scan register is placed
                                        between TDI and TDO. The normal path between IDT82V2088 logic and the I/O pins is maintained. Primary device inputs
                                        and outputs can be sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can
                                        then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state.
          110               Idcode      The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device's identification
                                        code can then be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.
          111               Bypass      The bypass instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used to
                                        bypass the device.

Table-59 TAP Controller State Description
          STATE                                                                              DESCRIPTION
     Test Logic Reset    In this state, the test logic is disabled. The device is set to normal operation. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register
                         with the IDCODE instruction. Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the
                         TMS input is held high for at least 5 rising edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high. The device processor auto-
                         matically enters this state at power-up.
       Run-Test/Idle     This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The
                         instruction register and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the control-
                         ler moves to the Select-DR state.
     Select-DR-Scan      This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruc-
                         tion retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Cap-
                         ture-DR state and a scan sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the
                         controller moves to the Select-IR-Scan state.
       Capture-DR        In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruc-
                         tion does not change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller
                         is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
         Shift-DR        In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage
                         toward its serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state
                         and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
         Exit1-DR        This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
                         state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR
                         state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                         state.
        Pause-DR         The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI
                         and TDO. For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test
                         sequence. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                         state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                         moves to the Exit2-DR state.
         Exit2-DR        This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
                         state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR
                         state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                         state.
        Update-DR        The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST
                         and SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched
                         into the parallel output of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output
                         changes only in this state. All shift-register stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and
                         the instruction does not change during this state.
      Select-IR-Scan     This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low
                         and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruc-
                         tion register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The
                         instruction does not change during this state.
        Capture-IR       In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of '100' on the rising edge of TCK. This sup-
                         ports fault-isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the
                         instruction does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters
                         the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
          Shift-IR       In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its
                         serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruc-
                         tion does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-
                         IR state if TMS is held high, or remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
         Exit1-IR        This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
                         state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR
                         state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                         state.

      Pause-IR     The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register
                   selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in
                   this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
       Exit2-IR    This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
                   state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state.
                   The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
      Update-IR    The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK.
                   When the new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction
                   retain their previous value.
