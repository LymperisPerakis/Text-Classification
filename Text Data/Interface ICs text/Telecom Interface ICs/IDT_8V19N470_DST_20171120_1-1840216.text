Principles of Operation
Overview
The device generates low-phase noise, synchronized clock output signals locked to an input reference frequency. The device contains two
PLLs with configurable frequency dividers. The first PLL (VCXO-PLL, suffix V) uses an external VCXO as the oscillator and provides jitter
attenuation. The external loop filter is used to set the VCXO-PLL bandwidth frequency in conjunction with internal parameters. The second,
low-phase noise PLL (FemtoClock NG, suffix F) multiplies the VCXO-PLL frequency to one of its two selectable VCO frequencies of
2949.12MHz or 2457.6MHz. The FemtoClock NG PLL is completely internal and provides a central reference timing reference point for all
output signals. From this point, fully synchronous dividers generate the output frequencies. The device has four output channels A – D, each
with one integer output divider A – D. The clock outputs are configurable with support for LVPECL, LVDS formats and a variable output
amplitude. In channels A – D, the clock phase can be adjusted in phase. For reduced power consumption, individual outputs, channels and
unused circuit blocks support a power-down state. The register map, accessible through a selectable 3/4-wire SPI interface with read-back
capability controls the main device settings and delivers device status information. For redundancy purpose, there are two selectable
reference frequency inputs and a configurable switch logic with manual, auto-selection and holdover support.
Phase-Locked Loop Operation
Frequency Generation
Table 2 displays the available frequency dividers for clock generation. The dividers must be set by the user to match input, VCXO and VCO
frequency and to achieve frequency and phase lock on both PLLs. The frequency of the external VCXO is chosen by the user, the internal
VCO frequency can be selected at frequencies of 2949.12MHz or 2457.6MHz. Table 3 – Table 7 shows example divider configurations for
typical wireless infrastructure applications.

MV and PV divider value range of 15 bits, the device supports a wide range of input and VCXO-frequencies. Two different input frequencies
may be applied to the clock inputs CLK_0 and CLK_1. The single PV divider has two correspond divider registers, PV0 and PV1. PV0 is loaded
into the PV divider when the CLK_0 input is selected and PV1 is loaded into the PV divider with the selection of the CLK_1 input. For clock
selection information, see Table 13. Both CLK_0 and CLK_1 inputs may be monitored for input activity. For information, see Monitoring.
In addition, the range of available input and feedback dividers allows to adjust the phase detector frequency independent of the used input and
VCXO frequencies as shown in Table 3 and Table 4. The VCXO-PLL charge pump current is controllable via internal registers and can be set
in 50µA steps from 50µA to 1.6mA. The VCXO-PLL may be bypassed (BYPV): when in bypass, the FemtoClock NG PLL locks to the
pre-divided input frequency for frequency synthesis.

FemtoClock NG PLL
The FemtoClock NG PLL is the second stage PLL and locks to the output signal of the VCXO-PLL (BYPV 0). It requires configuration of the
frequency doubler FDF or the pre-divider PF and the feedback divider MF to match the VCXO-PLL frequency to the selected VCO frequency
of 2949.12MHz or 2457.6MHz. Best phase noise is typically achieved by engaging the internal frequency doubler (FDF  1, 2). If engaged,
the signal from the first PLL stage is doubled in frequency, increasing the phase detector frequency of the FemtoClock NG PLL. Enabling the
frequency doubler disables the frequency pre-divider PF. If the frequency doubler is not used (FDF 0), the PF pre-divider has to be
configured. Typically PF is set to 1 to keep the phase detector frequency as high as possible. Set PF to other divider values to achieve
specific frequency ratios between first and second PLL stage. This PLL is internally configured to high-bandwidth.

Redundant Inputs
The two inputs are compatible with LVDS, LVPECL signal formats and also support single-ended signals (LVCMOS, see Applications
Information for applicable input interface circuits).
Monitoring
The two clock inputs of the device are individually and permanently monitored for activity. Inactivity is defined by a static input signal. Input
frequency changes are not monitored.
Loss of Input Signal (LOS)
In operation, a clock input is declared invalid (LOS) with the corresponding ST_CLK_n and LS_CLK_n indicator bits set after a specified
number of consecutive clock edges. If differential input signals are applied, the input will also detect an LOS condition in case of a zero
differential input voltage. The device supports LOS detect circuits, one for each input. The signal detect circuits compare the signals at the
CLK_0 and CLK_1 inputs to internally frequency-divided signals from the VCXO-PLL (see Figure 3 for details). For each loss detect circuit, the
loss-of-signal fault condition is declared upon three or more missing clock input edges. Both loss detect circuits operate independent of each
other, allowing correct LOS signaling for two different input frequencies. LOS requires configuration of the N_MON_n[14:0] frequency dividers
to individually match the input frequencies CLK_n to the VCXO frequency: fVCXO  N_MON_n  fCLK_n. For instance, if one of the input
frequencies is 15.36MHz and a 30.72MHz VCXO is used, set N_MON_n 2 (see Table 31 for configuration details). Then, LOS is declared
after three consecutive missing clock edges. LOS is signaled through the ST_CLK_n (momentary) and LS_CLK_n (sticky, resettable) status
bits and can reported as an interrupt signal on the nINT output. The LOS circuit requires the jitter attenuation mode of device (BYPV 0). LOS
does not detect frequency errors.

Input Re-Validation
A clock input is declared valid and the corresponding ST_CLK_n bit is reset after the clock input signal returns for an user-configurable
number of consecutive input periods. This re-validation of the selected input clock is controlled by the CNTV setting (verification pulse
counter).

Input Clock Selection
The device supports external, pin-controlled clock selection and internal, register controlled clock selection. The EXT_SEL[1:0] pins control
the input selection mode. In internal mode, automatic clock selection and manual register-controlled clock selection is available.
Definitions for Input Clock Selection
Manual input selection The CLK_n input is selected by the user by pin (external) or register control (internal).
Automatic input selection The CLK_n input is selected by an internal state machine, based on internal priorities, as response to the clock
input status.
External Input Selection Controls
The EXT_SEL[1:0] pins select CLK_0 or CLK_1 as the reference clock, enable switch control bits nMA[1:0], or set the device to holdover
mode.

Holdover
In holdover state, the output frequency and phase is derived from an internal, digital value based on previous frequency and phase
information. Holdover characteristics are defined in Table 54.
External-Controlled Holdover – No Expiration Counter
Applying the configuration EXT_SEL[1:0]  11 or (EXT_SEL[1:0]  10 and EN_nMA 0) sets the device in holdover. No clock input is
selected. Leaving holdover requires a change from either of the two configurations above.
Internal-Controlled, Manual Holdover
Input switch control is manual by setting the configuration to EXT_SEL[1:0]  10, EN_nMA = 1, and nM/A[1:0] 00. The INT_SEL bit
determines the selected reference clock input. If the selection is changed by the user, the device will enter holdover until the CNTH[7:0]
counter expires. Then, the new reference is selected (input switch). Application for this mode is external selection control.
▪   ST_REF: status of selected reference clock
▪   ST_CLK_n will both reflect the status of the corresponding input
▪   ST_SEL: the new selection after holdover
▪   nST_HOLD  0 for the duration of holdover
Automatic with Holdover
Configuration: EXT_SEL[1:0]  10, EN_nMA = 1, and nM/A[1:0] 11.
If an LOS event is detected on the active reference clock:
▪ Holdover begins immediately
▪ Corresponding ST_REF and LS_REF go low immediately
▪ Hold-off countdown begins immediately
During this time, both input clocks continue to be monitored and their respective ST_CLK, LS_CLK flags are active. LOS events will be
indicated on ST_CLK, LS_CLK when they occur.
If the active reference clock resumes and is validated during the hold-off countdown:
▪ its ST_CLK status flag will return high and the LS_CLK is available to be cleared by an SPI write of 1 to that register bit.
▪ No transitions will occur of the active REF clock; ST_SEL does not change
▪ Revertive bit has no effect during this time (whether 0 or 1)
When the hold-off countdown reaches zero:
▪ If the active reference has resumed and has been validated during the countdown, it will maintain being the active reference clock
    — ST_SEL does not change
    — ST_REF returns to 1
    — LS_REF can be cleared by an SPI write of 1 to that register
    — Holdover turns off and the VCXO-PLL attempts to lock to the active reference clock
▪ If the active reference has not resumed, but the other clock input CLK_n is validated, then
    — ST_SEL changes to the new active reference
    — ST_REF returns to 1
    — LS_REF can be cleared by an SPI write of 1 to that register
    — Holdover turns off

If there is no validated CLK:
▪ ST_SEL does not change
▪ ST_REF remains low
▪ LS_REF cannot be cleared by an SPI write of 1 to that register
▪ Holdover remains active
Revertive capability returns if REVS 1.
Hold-off Counter
A configurable down-counter applicable to the Automatic with Holdover and Manual with Holdover selection modes. The purpose of this
counter is a deferred, user-configurable input switch. The counter expires when a zero-transition occurs; this triggers a new reference clock
selection. The counter is clocked by the frequency-divided VCXO-PLL signal. The CNTR setting determines the hold-off counter frequency
divider and the CNTH setting the start value of the hold-off counter. For instance, set CNTR to a value of 131072 to achieve 937.5Hz (or a
period of 1.066ms at fVCXO 122.88MHz): the 8-bit CNTH counter is clocked by 937.5Hz and the user-configurable hold-off period range is
0ms
(CNTR 0x00) to 272ms (CNTR 0xFF). After the counter expires, it reloads automatically from the CNTH SPI register. After the LOS status
bit (LS_CLK_n) for the corresponding input CLK_n has been cleared by the user, the input is enabled for generating a new LOS event.
The CNTR counter is only clocked if the device is configured in the clock selection modes Automatic with Holdover and the selected reference
clock experiences an LOS event or in the Manual with Holdover mode with manual switching. Otherwise, the counter is automatically disabled
(not clocked).
Revertive Switching
Revertive switching: is only applicable to the two automatic switch modes shown in Table 13. Revertive switching enabled: Re-validation of the
primary clock will cause a new input selection to that clock (revertive switch). An input switch is only done if the re-validated input is the
primary clock.
Revertive switching disabled: Re-validation of a primary clock has no impact on the clock selection. Default setting is revertive switching
disabled.
VCXO-PLL Lock Detect (LOLV)
The VCXO-PLL lock detect circuit uses the signal phase difference at the phase detector as loss-of-lock criteria. Loss-of-lock is reported if the
actual phase difference is larger than a configurable phase detector window set by the LOCK_TH[14:0] configuration bits. A Loss-of-lock state
is reported through the nST_LOLV and nLS_LOLV status bits as shown in Table 17. The VCXO-PLL lock detect function requires to set
FVCV  0.
FemtoClock NG Loss-of-Lock (LOLF)
FemtoClock NG-PLL Loss-of-lock is signaled through the nST_LOLF (momentary) and nLS_LOLF (sticky, resettable) status bits and can
reported as hardware signal on the LOCK_V output as well as an interrupt signal on the nINT output.

Status Conditions and Interrupts
The device has an interrupt output to signal changes in status conditions. Settings for status conditions may be accessed in the Status
registers. The device has several conditions that can indicate faults and status changes in the operation of the device. These are shown in
Table 17 and can be monitored directly in the status registers. Status bits (named: ST_status_condition) are read-only and reflect the
momentary device status at the time of read-access. Several status bits are also copied into latched bit positions (named:
LS_status_condition). The latched version is controlled by the corresponding fault and status conditions and remains set (“sticky”) until reset
by the user by writing “1” to the status register bit. The reset of the status condition only has an effect if the corresponding fault condition is
removed, otherwise, the status bit will set again. Setting a status bit on several latched registers can be programmed to generate an interrupt
signal (nINT) via settings in the Interrupt Enable bits (named: IE_condition). A setting of “0” in any of these bits will mask the corresponding
latched status bits from affecting the interrupt status pin. Setting all IE bits to 0 has the effect of disabling interrupts from the device.

Interrupts are cleared by resetting the appropriate bit(s) in the latched register after the underlying fault condition has been resolved. When all
valid interrupt sources have been cleared in this manner, this will release the nINT output until the next unmasked fault.

Device Startup, Reset and Synchronization
At startup, an internal POR (power-on reset) resets the device and sets all register bits to their default value. The device forces the VCXO
control voltage at the LFV pin to half of the power supply voltage to center the VCXO-frequency. In the default configuration the QCLK_y
outputs are disabled at startup.
Recommended configuration sequence (in order):
▪ (Optional) set the value of the CPOL register bit to define the SPI read mode supported by the SPI controller. Set the LSBIT_1ST,
    SDO_ACT, ACS_ON and the corresponding mirrored bits in register 0x00 as appropriate for SPI read access to the device.
▪ Configure all PLL and output divider and delay circuits as well as other device configurations, such as the charge pump currents. Set the
    TRANSFER bit (register 0x0F, bit D0) for PLL registers wider than then 8 bit (see double buffered registers).
▪ Set the initialization bit INIT_CLK. This will initiate all divider and delay circuits and synchronize them to each other. The INIT_CLK bit will
    self-clear.
▪ Set both the RELOCK bit and PB_CAL bit. This step should not be combined with the previous step (setting INIT_CLK) in a multi SPI-byte
    register access. Both bits will self-clear.
▪ Clear the FVCV bit to release the VCXO control voltage and VCXO-PLL will attempt to lock to the input clock signal starting from its center
    frequency.
▪ Clear the status flags.
▪ (Optional and recommended) Optimize the internal precision bias current calibration process:
    — Read the contents of the STAT_PB[5:1] register (precision bias current in register 0x4E, ignore STAT_PB[0])
    — With a single-byte write access to register 0x63, apply the following bit pattern to OVERRIDE_CURR[5:0] and OVERRIDE_CAL:
         – OVERRIDE_CURR[5:1] (bit field location D[6:2] of register 0x63  STAT_PB[5:1] as read from above step
            OVERRIDE_CURR[0] (bit field location D[1] of register 0x63)  0
            OVERRIDE_CAL              (bit field location D[0] of register 0x63)  1
▪ Enable the outputs by accessing the output-enable registers in a separate SPI write access.

Changing Frequency Dividers and Phase Delay Values
Following procedure has to be applied for a change of a clock divider and phase delay value NA-D, and CLKA-D:
▪ (Optional) set the value of the CPOL register to define the SPI read mode, so that SPI settings can be validated by subsequent SPI read
    accesses.
▪ (Optional) disable the outputs whose frequency divider or delay value is changed.
▪ Configure the NA-D dividers and the delay circuits CLKA-D to the desired new values.
▪ Set the initialization bit INIT_CLK. This will initiate all divider and delay circuits and synchronize them to each other. The INIT_CLK bit will

▪ Set the RELOCK bit. This step should not be combined with the setting INIT_CLK in a multi SPI-byte register access. Bit will self-clear.
▪ (Optional) enable the outputs whose frequency divider was changed.
SPI Interface
The device has a selectable 3/4-wire serial control port capable of responding as a slave in an SPI configuration to allow read and write access
to any of the internal registers for device programming or read back. The SPI interface consists of the SCLK (clock), SDIO (serial data input
and output in 3-wire mode, input in 4-wire mode), SDO (output in 4-wire mode), nCS (chip select) and nRESET (SPI reset) pins. A data
transfer contains 16 bit (direction  15 bit address) and any integer multiple of 8 bits (input or output data) and is always initiated by the SPI
master on the bus. Internal register data is organized in SPI bytes of 8 bit each. This device supports most-significant bit (MSBit) and
least-significant (LSBit) first transfer bit positions, single byte and multi-byte data streaming modes with address auto-increment and
auto-decrement. For SPI logic diagrams, see Figure 4 to Figure 5.For the SPI timing diagram, see Figure 8.
Chip Select. If the nCS pin is at logic high, the SDIO/SDO data output pin is in high-impedance state and the SPI interface of the device is
disabled.
3/4-Wire Mode. In 3-wire mode, the SDIO pin acts as bidirectional input/output and the SDO pin is in high-impedance state. In 4-wire mode,
the SDIO pin is the SPI input and the SDO pin is the SPI output. The SPI interface mode is defined by the SDO_ACT bit in the SPI device
configuration register.
Active Clock Edge. In a write operation, data on SDIO will be clocked in on the rising edge of SCLK. In a read operation, data on SDIO/SDO
will be clocked out on the falling or rising edge of SCLK depending on the CPOL setting (CPOL 0: output data changes on the falling edge,
CPOL 1: output data changes on the rising edge).
Reset. By asserting the nRESET pin, the SPI engine is reset and all internal device registers reset to their default values. The SRESET bit in
the device SPI configuration register resets the registers 0x02 to 0x63 to their default values. The registers 0x00 and 0x01 are not reset by
asserting SRESET.
Logic levels. The SPI pins SDIO and SDO have selectable 1.8V/3.3V logic levels. The SELSV0 register bit controls the logic level.
SELSV0 0: 1.8V logic, and SELSV0 1: 3.3V logic.
Least Significant Bit Position. The device supports LSBit (least significant bit first) and MSBit (most significant bit first) transfers between
master and slave. If MSBit first is set, data is transferred in this order: transfer direction bit first, then the register address bits A14 to A0, then
the data bits of the first data byte D7 to D0. If LSBit first is set, the order is: address bits A0 to A14 first, then the transfer direction bit, then the
data bits of the first data byte D0 to D7.
Starting a Data Transfer requires the nCS pin to set and hold at logic low level during the entire transfer. Setting nCS  0 will enable the SPI
interface with the SDIO pin in data input mode. The master must initiate the first 16-bit transfer containing the transfer direction bit and the SPI
register address to access.
Transfer Direction Bit: Defines if the master reads data from the device or writes data to the device. R/nW (1 Read,0 Write). If MSB-first
is set, the transfer bit is presented by the master as the first bit in the transfer. If LSB-first is set, the transfer bit is the 16th bit presented by the
master. MSB-first is the default upon power-up: the initial data transfer must be in MSB-first order.
Address: The device supports a 15 bit address A[14:0] pointing to an internal register in the address space 0 to 0x7FFF. This device
implements registers at the addresses 0x00-0x63.

Read operation from an internal register: a read operation starts with a 16 bit transfer from the master to the slave: the SDIO signal is clocked
on the rising edge of SCLK. The transfer direction bit R/nW must be to 1 to indicate a read transfer, the other 15 bits is the address A[14:0] to
read from. After the first 16 bits are clocked into the SDIO pin, the SDIO I/O changes to output if 4-wire mode is set by SDO_ACT 0 (in 3-wire
mode set by SDO_ACT 1, the pin SDO is the output). The register content addressed by A[14:0] are the presented at the SPI output at the
next 8 SCLK falling (CPOL 1) or next eight SCLK rising (CPOL 1) clock cycles and transfer these to the master. Transfers must be
completed with de-asserting nCS after any multiple eight of SCLK cycles. If nCS is de-asserted at any other number of SCLKs, the SPI
behavior is undefined. Read operation transfers multiple bytes in streaming mode with the 15 bit register address auto-increment or
decrement. Single byte transfers are supported in streaming mode by de-asserting nCS after the first payload byte.
Write operation to a device register: During a write transfer, an SPI master transfers one or more bytes of data into the internal registers of
the device. A write transfer starts by asserting the nCS to pin low logic level. The transfer direction bit R/nW must be set to 0 to indicate a write
transfer, the other 15 bits are the address A[14:0] to write to. Bits D[7:0] contain 8 bits of transfer data, which is written into the register
specified by A[14:0] at the end of each 8-bit write transfer. Multiple, subsequent register transfers from the master to the slave are supported
in streaming mode by holding nCS asserted at logic low level during write transfers. Transfers must be completed with de-asserting nCS after
any multiple of eight SCLK cycles. If nCS is de-asserted at any other number of SCLKs, the SPI behavior is undefined. The 15 bit register
address will auto-increment or decrement (streaming mode). Single byte transfers are supported in streaming mode by de-asserting nCS after
the first payload byte.
Register Streaming Mode. Streaming mode is the transfer of multiple data bytes back to back. The address A[14:0] specifies the register
location of the first byte to transfer, for the following transfer, the address is automatically incremented or decremented. nCS must stay at logic
low level and SDIO/SDO will present multiple registers, e.g. (A), (A -1), (A -2), etc. with each eight SCLK cycles. During SPI Read operations,
the user may continue to hold nCS low and provide further bytes. The ASC_ON register defines if registers auto-increment (A), (A 1), (A 2),
etc. or auto-decrement (A), (A -1), (A -2), etc.
Address wrap-around: Applicable to streaming mode: The address will wrap-around the address range of 0x00 – 0x63. The SPI engine
auto-increments to address 0x00 after 0x63 and auto-decrements to address 0x63 after 0x00.
End of transfer: After nCS is de-asserted to logic 1, the SPI bus is available to transfers to other slaves on the SPI bus. The READ diagrams
(Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure 7) and WRITE diagram (Figure 4) display the transfer of a single byte of data from and into registers.
Mirrored Register Bits. The register bits D7 – D4 in the device SPI configuration register (0x00) are mirrored with the bits D3 – D0 in the same
register for a LSBit/MSBit First independent access. Setting a mirrored bit to the “1” state requires to set both bit and its <mirrored_bit> to 1.
Double Buffered Registers. PLL divider registers that are wider than 8 bit are double buffered for synchronous access. Synchronous
configuration of these registers requires to write the multiple-byte setting into the SPI registers first and then transfer the content into the
device registers by asserting the TRANSFER bit. The configuration only takes effect after the TRANSFER bit is asserted. Configuration data
can be read-back from SPI and device registers as specified by the RB_MODE bit.
Internal Debug Registers. Registers in the address range0x4F, 0x5C – 0x5D and 0x64 to 0xFF should not be used. Do not write into any
registers in the 0x4F, 0x5C – 0x5D and 0x64 to 0xFF address range.
Default SPI Modes: After power-up and reset by the nRESET pin, the SPI interface is in 3-wire mode with SDO in high-impedance, MSB-first
mode, streaming mode on with address auto-decrement. In read transfer mode, data is output on SDIO on the falling SCLK edge.

Register Descriptions
This section contains all addressable registers, sorted by function, followed for a detailed description of each bit field for each register. Several
functional blocks with multiple instances in this device have individual registers controlling their settings, but since the registers have an
identical format and bit meaning, they are described only once, with an additional table to indicate their addresses and default values. All
writable register fields will come up with the default values as indicated in the factory Default column.
Fixed read-only bits will have defaults as indicated in their specific register descriptions. Read-only status bits will reflect valid status of the
conditions they are designed to monitor once the internal power-up reset has been released. Unused registers and bit positions are Reserved.
Reserved bit fields may be used for internal debug test and debug functions.

    STR_OFF             R/W                0       SPI Streaming Mode (not implemented):
                                                   0  SPI streaming mode enabled
                                        Value:
                                                   1  SPI single byte transfer mode
                                   SPI streaming
                                   mode enabled    In SPI streaming mode, the device transfers SPI data back to back while
                                                   auto-decrementing (if ASC_ON  0) or auto-incrementing (if ASC_ON  1) the SPI
                                                   register address after each byte access. The device continues to read or write SPI
                                                   data as long as nCS remains asserted and the SPI streaming mode remains
                                                   enabled.
                                                   In SPI streaming mode, single byte data transfers are supported by setting nCS to
                                                   logic high state after the byte has been transferred.
                                                   In SPI single byte transfer mode, one byte of SPI data is transferred regardless of
                                                   nCS being de-asserted after the transfer. If this bit is set and nCS remains asserted,
                                                   the SPI state machine resets after the data byte is transferred as if nCS was
                                                   de-asserted and awaits the next transfer.
                                                   The device does not implement STR_OFF  1. For implemented SPI single byte

                                     0000_0001   The clock activity monitor compares the device input frequency (fIN) on CLK_1 to the
                                                 frequency of the VCXO divided by N_MON_1. For optimal operation of the activity

                                                 CLK_1.
                                                 E.g. for fIN122.88MHz at CLK_1 and fVCXO122.88MHz, set N_MON_1 1.

                                                 input is not monitored for activity.
                                                 For instance, if CLK_0 is selected as the current PLL reference clock, IN_BLOCK 1
                                                 causes the CLK_1 input to be turned off in order to reduce input signal interference.
                                                 IN_BLOCK should only be used with manual input reference control.

Temperature Considerations
The device supports applications in a natural convection environment as long as the junction temperature does not exceed the specified
junction temperature TJ. In applications where the heat dissipates through the PCB, JB is the correct metric to calculate the junction
temperature. The following calculation uses the junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter JB to calculate the junction
temperature (TJ). Care must be taken to not exceed the maximum allowed junction temperature TJ of 130 °C.
The junction temperature TJ is calculated using the following equation: T J = T B + P TOT   JB
where:
▪   TJ is the junction temperature at steady state conditions in °C.
▪   TB is the board temperature at steady state condition in °C, measured on or near the component lead.
▪   JB is the thermal characterization parameter to report the difference between TJ and TB.
▪   PTOT is the total device power dissipation.
Application power dissipation scenarios: Applications may use device settings that result in a lower power dissipation than the maximum
power scenario. The device is a multi-functional, high-speed device that targets a variety of applications. Since this device is highly
programmable with a broad range of settings and configurations, the power consumption will vary as settings and configurations are changed.
Table 58 shows the typical current consumption and total device power consumption along with the junction temperature for the test cases
shown in Table 48 and Table 49. The table also displays the maximum board temperature for the JB model.

Reducing power consumption: The output state (on/off) and the output amplitude have the largest impact on the device power consumption
and the junction temperature: setting the output amplitude to lower voltages and supplying the outputs by 1.8V reduces power consumption.
Unused and periodically unused outputs and inputs should be turned off in phases of inactivity to reduce power. For any given divider setting,
the clock frequency has no impact on the device power consumption of the device.

Applications Information
VCXO-PLL Loop Filter
Each of the two PLLs uses a loop filter with external components. The value of the external components depend on the desired loop bandwidth
for each PLL, the input clock frequency and in the case of the VCXO-PLL, on the external VCXO component. For the VCXO-PLL (first PLL
stage), a 2nd or 3rd order loop filter may be used. The loop filter of the VCXO-PLL is connected to the device through the LFV charge pump
input. The filter output is connected to the control voltage input of the external VCXO. The FemtoClock NG PLL (second PLL stage) may use a
2nd order loop filter. The LFF output of the device connects to filter input and LFFR to the filter output.
Typical loop filters are shown in Figure 16 (2nd order) in Figure 17 (3rd order) and are discussed below. Step by step calculations to determine
the value of the loop filter components values are shown.

Step-by-step calculation:
Step 1: Determine the desired loop bandwidth fC. fC must satisfy the following condition:
                              f PD
                              ----- » 20
                               fC
Where fPD is the input frequency of the VCXO-PLL phase detector frequency.
Step 2: Calculate RZ by:
                                  2  f C M V
                       R Z = --------------------------------------
                               I CP  K VCXO
Where ICP is the VCXO-PLL charge pump current and KVCXO is the gain of the VCXO component (consult the datasheet of the external VCXO
for its gain parameter). MV is the effective feedback divider:
                                       f VCXO
                            M V = -------------------    -
                                            f PD
fVCXO is the frequency of the external VCXO component.

Step 3: Calculate CZ by:
                                          
                           C Z = ---------------------
                                  2f C R Z
                                       fC
                                = ------
                                       fZ
α is ratio between the loop bandwidth and the filter zero. fZ is the filter zero. α should be greater than 3.
Step 4: Calculate CP by:
                                        CZ
                              C P = -------
                                        
                                       fP
                                = -----   -
                                       fC
fP is the pole and β is ratio between the pole and the loop bandwidth. β should be greater than 3.
Step 4: Verify that the phase margin PM is greater than 50°.
                                            b–1
                          PM = atan ------------

                             b = ------- + 1
                                  CP
Example calculation: The Block Diagram shows a 2nd order loop filter for the VCXO-PLL. In this example, the VCXO-PLL reference
frequency is 122.88MHz and an external VCXO component of 122.88MHz is used. The desired VCXO-PLL loop bandwidth f C is 40 Hz. To
achieve the desired loop bandwidth with small size loop filter components, set the PLL frequency pre-divider PV and the PLL feedback divider
MV to 1024. According to the step 1 instruction, fPD is 120kHz. This satisfies the condition fPD/fC >> 20. RZ is calculated 32.2k.
The VCXO gain KVCXO used for the device reference circuit is 10kHz/V. The charge pump current of the VCXO-PLL is configurable from 50µA
to 1200µA. The charge pump current is programmed to ICP 800uA. For α 8, CZ is calculated to be 0.99µF. CZ greater than this value
assures α > 12. For example, the actual chosen value is the standard capacitor value of 1µF. For β 5, CP is calculated 24.7nF. The standard
capacitor value of CP  27ps ensures β > 7.

                     RZ
Figure 17 shows a third-order loop filter. The filter is equivalent to the 2nd order filter in Figure 16 with the addition components RP2 and CP2.
The additional components RP2 and CP2 should be calculated as shown:
                                  CP  RZ
                         C P2 = --------------------

                          R P2  R Z  1.5
 is the ratio between the 1st pole and the 2nd pole.  should be greater than 3.
Example calculation for the 3rd order loop filter shown in Figure 17: Equivalent to the 2nd order loop filter calculation, RZ 33k, CZ 1µF,
and CP 27nF. RP2 should be in the range of 0.5 RZ < RP2 < 2.5  RZ, for instance 51k With   4, CP2 is 4.37nF (select 4.7µF).
FemtoClock NG PLL Loop Filter
Figure 18 shows a 2nd order loop filter for the FemtoClock NG PLL. This loop filter is equivalent to Figure 16 and uses the loop filter
components RZF (RZ), CZF (CZ) and CPZ (CP). The VCO frequency of the FemtoClock NG PLL is 2949.12MHz.

                               LFF
Example calculation for the 2nd order loop filter shown in Figure 18: the FemtoClock NG receives its reference frequency from the VCXO
output. With the PF pre-divider set to 1, the phase detector frequency is also 122.88MHz. The PLL feedback divider must be set to MF 24 in
order to locate the VCO frequencies in its center range. A target PLL loop bandwidth fC is 80kHz satisfies the condition in step 1. The gain of
the internal VCO is 30MHz/V and the charge pump current ICP is set to 3.6mA. Using the formula for RZ in step 2, RZF is calculated 103
(chose the standard value of 100; using the formula for CZ in step 3, CZF is calculated 88nF for α  4. A capacitor larger than 88nF should
be used for CZF to assure that the α is greater than 4, for instance the standard component capacitor value 100nF.
The recommended CPF value for the loop filter is 40pF (loop filter components are partially integrated). The selected 2nd order loop filter
components for this PLL are: RZF  100CZF  100nF, and CPF  40pF.

LVDS style outputs support fully differential terminations. LVDS does not require board level pull-down resistors for DC termination.
Figure 23 and Figure 24 show typical termination examples with DC coupling for the LVDS style driver. In these examples, the receiver is high
input impedance without built-in termination. LVDS-style with a differential termination is preferred for best common-mode rejection and lowest
device power consumption.

Power Supply Filtering
Please refer to the document 8V19N470 Hardware Design Guide for comprehensive information about power supply and isolation, loop filter design
for VCXO and VCO, schematics, input and output interfaces/terminations and an example schematics. This document shows a recommended
power supply filter schematic in which the device is operated at VDD_V  3.3V (The output supply voltages of VDDO_V  3.3V, 2.5V and 1.8V
are supported). This example focuses on power supply connections and is not configuration specific. Refer to the pin description and
functional tables in the datasheet to ensure that the logic control inputs are properly set for the application.
As with any high speed analog circuitry, the power supply pins are vulnerable to board supply or device generated noise. This device requires
an external voltage regulator for the VDD_V pins for isolation of board supply noise. This regulator (example component: PS7A8300RGT) is
indicated in the schematic by the power supply, VREG_3.3V. Consult the voltage regulator specification for details of the required
performance. To achieve optimum jitter performance, power supply isolation is required to minimize device generated noise. The VDD_LCF
terminal requires the cleanest power supply. The device provides separate power supplies to isolate any high switching noise from coupling
into the internal PLLs and into other outputs as shown. In order to achieve the best possible filtering, it is recommended that the placement of
the filter components be on the device side of the PCB as close to the power pins as possible. If space is limited the 0.1µF and 0.01µF
capacitors in each power pin filter should be placed on the device side. The other components can be on the opposite side of the PCB. Pull-up
and pull-down resistors to set configuration pins can all be placed on the PCB side opposite the device side to free up device side area if
necessary.
Power supply filter recommendations are a general guideline to be used for reducing external noise from coupling into the devices. The filter
performance is designed for a wide range of noise frequencies. This low-pass filter starts to attenuate noise at approximately 10kHz. If a
specific frequency noise component is known, such as switching power supplies frequencies, it is recommended that component values be
adjusted and if required, additional filtering be added. Additionally, good general design practices for power plane voltage stability suggests
adding bulk capacitance in the local area of all devices.
