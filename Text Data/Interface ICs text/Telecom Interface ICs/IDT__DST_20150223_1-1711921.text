DESCRIPTION
    The IDT82V2051E is a single channel E1 Line Interface Unit. The                   circuit is integrated in the chip, and different types of loopbacks can be set
IDT82V2051E performs clock/data recovery, AMI/HDB3 line decoding and                  according to the applications. Two different kinds of line terminating imped-

    TTIP      Analog             37        TTIP/TRING: Transmit Bipolar Tip/Ring
   TRING      output             36        These pins are the differential line driver outputs. They will be in high impedance state under the following conditions:
                                           •     THZ pin is high;
                                           •     THZ bit is set to 1;
                                           •     Loss of MCLK;
                                           •     Loss of TCLK (exceptions: Remote Loopback; transmit internal pattern by MCLK);
                                           •     Transmit path power down;
                                           •     After software reset; pin reset and power on.
    RTIP      Analog             41        RTIP/RRING: Receive Bipolar Tip/Ring
  RRING        input             40        These signals are the differential receiver inputs.
  TD/TDP           I              2        TD: Transmit Data
    TDN                           3        When the device is in single rail mode, the NRZ data to be transmitted is input on this pin. Data on TD pin is sampled into the
                                           device on the active edge of TCLK and is encoded by AMI or HDB3 line code rules before being transmitted. In this mode, TDN
                                           should be connected to ground.
                                           TDP/TDN: Positive/Negative Transmit Data
                                           When the device is in dual rail mode, the NRZ data to be transmitted for positive/negative pulse is input on these pins. Data
                                           on TDP/TDN pin is sampled into the device on the active edge of TCLK. The line code in dual rail mode is as follows:
                                                              TDP                     TDN            Output Pulse
                                                                0                      0          Space
                                                                0                      1          Positive Pulse
                                                                1                      0          Negative Pulse
                                                                1                      1          Space
   TCLK            I              1        TCLK: Transmit Clock input
                                           This pin inputs a 2.048 MHz transmit clock. The transmit data at TD/TDP or TDN is sampled into the device on the active edge
                                           of TCLK. If TCLK is missing1 and the TCLK missing interrupt is not masked, an interrupt will be generated.
  RD/RDP          O               5        RD: Receive Data output
  CV/RDN                          6        In single rail mode, this pin outputs NRZ data. The data is decoded according to AMI or HDB3 line code rules.
                                           CV: Code Violation indication
                                           In single rail mode, the BPV/CV code violation will be reported by driving the CV pin to high level for a full clock cycle. HDB3
                                           line code violation can be indicated if the HDB3 decoder is enabled. When AMI decoder is selected, bipolar violation will be indi-
                                           cated.
                                           In hardware control mode, the EXZ, BPV/CV errors in received data stream are always monitored by the CV pin if single rail
                                           mode is chosen.
                                           RDP/RDN: Positive/Negative Receive Data output
                                           In dual rail mode, this pin outputs the re-timed NRZ data when CDR is enabled, or directly outputs the raw RZ slicer data if CDR
                                           is bypassed.
                                           Active edge and level select:
                                           Data on RDP/RDN or RD is clocked with either the rising or the falling edge of RCLK. The active polarity is also selectable.
   RCLK           O               4        RCLK: Receive Clock output
                                           This pin outputs a 2.048 MHz receive clock. Under LOS condition with AIS enabled (bit AISE=1), RCLK is derived from MCLK.
                                           In clock recovery mode, this signal provides the clock recovered from the RTIP/RRING signal. The receive data (RD in single
                                           rail mode or RDP and RDN in dual rail mode) is clocked out of the device on the active edge of RCLK. If clock recovery is
                                           bypassed, RCLK is the exclusive OR (XOR) output of the dual rail slicer data RDP and RDN. This signal can be used in appli-
                                           cations with external clock recovery circuitry.
Notes:
1. TCLK missing: the state of TCLK continues to be high level or low level over 70 MCLK cycles.

   Name     Type      Pin No.                                                              Description
   MCLK        I         9    MCLK: Master Clock input
                              A built-in clock system that accepts a 2.048MHz reference clock. This reference clock is used to generate several internal ref-
                              erence signals:
                              •     Timing reference for the integrated clock recovery unit.
                              •     Timing reference for the integrated digital jitter attenuator.
                              •     Timing reference for microcontroller interface.
                              •     Generation of RCLK signal during a loss of signal condition.
                              •     Reference clock to transmit All Ones, all zeros and PRBS pattern. Note that for ATAO and AIS, MCLK is always used as
                                    the reference clock.
                              •     Reference clock during the Transmit All Ones (TAO) condition or sending PRBS in hardware control mode.
                              The loss of MCLK will turn TTIP/TRING into high impedance status.
   LOS        O          7    LOS: Loss of Signal Output
                              This is an active high signal used to indicate the loss of received signal. When LOS pin becomes high, it indicates the loss of
                              received signal. The LOS pin will become low automatically when valid received signal is detected again. The criteria of loss
                              of signal are described in 3.5 Los And AIS Detection.
    REF        I        43    REF: reference resister

                              parallel microcontroller interface.
  RXTXM1                      RXTXM[1:0]: Receive and transmit path operation mode select

   The transmit path system interface consists of TCLK pin, TD/TDP pin
and TDN pin. TCLK is a 2.048 MHz clock. If TCLK is missing for more than                                             0 .4 0

    The transmit data from the system side can be provided in two different
ways: Single Rail and Dual Rail. In Single Rail mode, only TD pin is used
for transmitting data and the T_MD[1] bit (TCF0, 05H) should be set to ‘0’.                                                                 TTIP
In Dual Rail Mode, both TDP pin and TDN pin are used for transmitting data,
the T_MD[1] bit (TCF0, 05H) should be set to ‘1’.                                                           IDT82V2051E                                                                             RLOAD     VOUT

   In Single Rail mode, the Encoder can be configured to be a HDB3
encoder or an AMI encoder by setting T_MD[0] bit (TCF0, 05H).                          Note: 1. For RLOAD = 75 Ω (nom), Vout (Peak) = 2.37 V (nom)

    In Dual Rail mode, the Encoder is by-passed. In Dual Rail mode, a logic
