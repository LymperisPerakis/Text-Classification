    4         TxON         I   Transmitter ON Input
                               Setting this input pin "High" turns on the Transmitter.
                               NOTES:
                                     1.   Even when the XRT75VL00 is configured in HOST mode, this pin still
                                          controls the TTIP and TRING outputs
                                     2.   When the Transmitter is turned off either in Host or Hardware mode,the
                                          TTIP and TRING outputs are Tri-stated.
                                     3.   This pin is internally pulled down
   46         TxClk        I   Transmit Clock Input for TPData and TNData
                               The frequency accuracy of this input clock must be of nominal bit rate ± 20 ppm.
                               The duty cycle can be 30%-70%.
                               The XRT75VL00 samples the TPData and TNData pins on the falling or rising
                               edge of TxClk signal based on the status of TxClkINV pin (in Hardware mode)
                               or the status of the bit in the Channel Register (in HOST mode).
   26      TxClkINV/       I   Transmit Clock Invert or Serial Clock Input:
              SClk             Function of this depends on whether the XRT75VL00 is configured to operate in
                               Hardware mode or Host mode.
                               In Hardware mode, setting this input pin “High” configures the Transmitter to
                               sample the TPData and TNData data on the rising edge of the TxClk.
                               NOTE: If the XRT75VL00 is configured in HOST mode, this pin functions as
                                        SClk input pin (please refer to the pin description for Microprocessor
                                        interface).
   48        TNData        I   Transmit Negative Data Input
                               If the XRT75VL00 is configured in Dual-rail mode, this pin is sampled on the
                               falling or rising edge of TxClk based on the status of the TClkINV pin (in Hard-
                               ware mode) or the status of the control bit in the Channel Register (in HOST
                               mode).
                               NOTES:
                                     1.   This input pin is ignored and should be tied to GND if the Transmitter
                                          Section is configured to accept Single-Rail data from the Terminal
                                          Equipment.
   47        TPData        I   Transmit Positive Data Input
                               The XRT75VL00 samples this pin on the falling or rising edge of TxClk based on
                               the status of the TClkINV pin (in Hardware mode) or the status of the control bit
                               in the Channel Register (in HOST mode).
   50         TTIP        O    Transmit TTIP Output
                               The XRT75VL00 uses this pin along with TRING to transmit a bipolar signal to
                               the line using a 1:1 transformer.

  51          TRING     O   Transmit Ring Output
                            The XRT75VL00 uses this pin along with TTIP to transmit a bipolar signal to the
                            line using a 1:1 transformer.
   1          TxLEV      I  Transmit Line Build-Out Enable/Disable Select
                            This input pin is used to enable or disable the Transmit Line Build-Out circuit.
                            Setting this pin to "High" disables the Line Build-Out circuit. In this mode, par-
                            tially-shaped pulses are output onto the line via the TTIP and TRING output
                            pins.

                              The Recovered Clock signal from the incoming line signal is output through this
                              pin.By default, the Receiver Section outputs data via RPOS and RNEG pins on
                              the rising edge of this clock signal.
                              Configure the Receiver Section to update data on the RPOS and RNEG pins on
                              the falling edge of RxClk by doing the following:
                              a) Operating in Hardware mode, pull the RxClkINV pin to “High”.
                              b) Operating in Host mode, write a “1” to RxClkINV bit field within the Receive
                              Control Register.

                              In Hardware mode, setting this input pin “High” configures the Receiver Sec-
                              tion to invert the RxClk output signals and outputs the recovered data via
                              RPOS and RNEG on the falling edge of RxClk.
                              NOTE: If the XRT75VL00 is configured in HOST mode, this pin functions as CS

                            Function of these pins depends on whether the XRT75VL00 is configured
                            in Single Rail or Dual Rail mode.
                            If the XRT75VL00 is configured in Dual Rail mode, a negative pulse is output
                            through RNEG.
                            In Hardware mode: Tie the pin SR/DR (pin 22) “High” to configure the
                            XRT75VL00 in Single Rail mode and tie “Low” to configure in Dual Rail mode.
                            In HOST mode: XRT75VL00 can be configured in Single Rail or Dual Rail by
                            setting or clearing the bit in the block control register.

                            If the XRT75VL00 is configured in Single Rail mode then:
                            Whenever the Receiver Section detects a Line Code violation, it pulses this
                            output pin “High”. This output pin remains “Low” at all other times.          It is
                            advisable to sample this output pin using the RxClk output signal.

               SDO          In Hardware mode, when this pin is tied “High” XRT75VL00 configures into
                            monitoring channel. In the monitoring mode, the Receiver is capable of monitor-
                            ing the signals with 20 dB flat loss plus 6 dB cable attenuation. This allows to
                            monitor very weak signal before declaring LOS.
                            In HOST Mode, XRT75VL00 can be configured to be a monitoring channel by
                            setting the bits in the receive control register.
                            NOTE: If the XRT75VL00 is configured in HOST mode, this pin functions as

 4.0    THE TRANSMITTER SECTION:
The Transmitter Section accepts TTL/CMOS level signals from the Terminal Equipment in the selectable data
formats.
• In Single-Rail or un-encoded Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) input data via TPData pin while the TNData pin
   must be grounded. The NRZ or Single-Rail mode is selected when the SR/DR input pin is “High” (in
   Hardware Mode) or bit 0 of the control register is “1” (in Host Mode). Figure 12 illustrates the Single-Rail or
   NRZ format.

• In Dual-Rail mode, data is input via TPData and TNData pins. TPData contains positive data and TNData
   contains negative data. The SR/DR input pin = “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or bit 0 of the control register = “0”
   (in Host Mode) enables the Dual-Rail mode. Figure 13 illustrates the Dual-Rail data format.

• Convert the CMOS level B3ZS or HDB3 encoded data into pulses with shapes that are compliant with the
   various industry standard pulse template requirements. Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the pulse
   template requirements.
• Encode the un-encoded NRZ data into either B3ZS format (for DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3) and
   convert to pulses with shapes and width that are compliant with industry standard pulse template
   requirements. Figure 7,Figure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the pulse template requirements.
 4.1     TRANSMIT CLOCK:
The Transmit Clock applied via TxClk pin, for the selected data rate (for E3 = 34.368 MHz, DS3 = 44.736 MHz
or STS-1 = 51.84 MHz), is duty cycle corrected by the internal PLL circuit to provide a 50% duty cycle clock to
the pulse shaping circuit. This allows a 30% to 70% duty cycle Transmit Clock be supplied and thus eliminates
the need to use an expensive oscillator.
 4.2     B3ZS/HDB3 ENCODER:
When the Single-Rail (NRZ) data format is selected, the Encoder Block encodes the data into either B3ZS
format (for either DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3).
  4.2.1     B3ZS Encoding:

An example of B3ZS encoding is shown in Figure 14. If the encoder detects an occurrence of three
consecutive zeros in the data stream, it is replaced with either B0V or 00V, where ‘B’ refers to Bipolar pulse that
is compliant with the Alternating polarity requirement of the AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion) line code and ‘V’
refers to a Bipolar Violation (e.g., a bipolar pulse that violates the AMI line code). The substitution of B0V or
00V is made so that an odd number of bipolar pulses exist between any two consecutive violation (V) pulses.
This avoids the introduction of DC component into the line signal.

  4.2.2      HDB3 Encoding:
An example of the HDB3 encoding is shown in Figure 15.If the HDB3 encoder detects an occurrence of four
consecutive zeros in the data stream, then the four zeros are substituted with either 000V or B00V pattern. The
substitution code is made in such a way that an odd number of bipolar (B) pulses exist between any
consecutive V pulses. This avoids the introduction of DC component into the analog signal.

NOTES:
     1.   When Dual-Rail data format is selected, the B3ZS/HDB3 Encoder is automatically disabled.
     2.   In Dual-Rail format, the Bipolar Violations in the incoming data stream is converted to valid data pulses.
     3.   Encoder and Decoder is enabled only in Single-Rail mode.
 4.3      TRANSMIT PULSE SHAPER:
The Transmit Pulse Shaper converts the B3ZS encoded digital pulses into a single analog Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI) pulse that meet the industry standard mask template requirements for STS-1 and DS3. See
Figure 8 and Figure 9.
For E3 mode, the pulse shaper converts the HDB3 encoded pulses into a single full amplitude square shaped
pulse with very little slope. This is illustrated in Figure 7.
                                                                25

The Pulse Shaper Block also consists of a Transmit Build Out Circuit, which can either be disabled or enabled
by setting the TxLEV input pin “High” or “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the TxLEV bit to “1” or “0” in the
control register (in Host Mode).
For DS3/STS-1 rates, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is used to shape the transmit waveform that ensures that
transmit pulse template requirements are met at the Cross-Connect system. The distance between the
transmitter output and the Cross-Connect system can be between 0 to 450 feet.
For E3 rate, since the output pulse template is measured at the secondary of the transformer and since there is
no Cross-Connect system pulse template requirements, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is always disabled.
 4.3.1     Guidelines for using Transmit Build Out Circuit:
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1, Cross-Connect system, is less than 225 feet,
enable the Transmit Build Out Circuit by setting the TxLEV input pin “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the
TxLEV control bit to “0” (in Host Mode).
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1 is greater than 225 feet, disable the Transmit
Build Out Circuit.
 4.3.2     Interfacing to the line:
The differential line driver increases the transmit waveform to appropriate level and drives into the 75Ω load as
shown in Figure 6.
4.4      Transmit Drive Monitor:
This feature is used for monitoring the transmit line for occurrence of fault conditions such as short circuit on
the line or defective line driver.The device can also be configured for internal tranmit driver monitoring.
To monitor the transmitter output of another chip, connect MTIP pin to the TTIP line via a 270 Ω resistor and
MRing pins to TRing line via 270 Ω resistor as shown in Figure 16
In order to configure the device for internal transmit driver monitoring, set the TxMON bit to “1” in the transmit
control register.

When the MTIP and MRing are connected to the TTIP and TRing lines, the drive monitor circuit monitors the
line for transitions. The DMO (Drive Monitor Output) will be asserted “Low” as long as the transitions on the line
are detected via MTIP and MRing.
If no transitions on the line are detected for 128 ± 32 TxClk periods, the DMO output toggles “High” and when
the transitions are detected again, DMO toggles “Low”.
NOTE: The Drive Monitor Circuit is only for diagnostic purposes and does not have to be used to operate the transmitter.
  4.5     Transmitter Section On/Off:
The transmitter section can be turned on or off. To turn on the transmitter in the Hardware mode, pull TxON pin
“High”. In the Host mode, write a “1” to the TxON control bit AND pull the TxON pin “High” to turn on the
transmitter.
When the transmitter is turned off, the TTIP and TRing are tri-stated.
NOTES:
      1.   This feature provides support for Redundancy.
      2.   If the XRT75VL00 is configured in Host mode, to permit a system designed for redundancy to quickly shut-off the
          defective line card and turn on the back-up line card, writing a “1” to the TxON control bit transfers the control to
          TxON pin.

 5.0 THE RECEIVER SECTION:
This section describes the detailed operation of the various blocks in the receiver. The receiver recovers the
TTL/CMOS level data from the incoming bipolar B3ZS or HDB3 encoded input pulses.
 5.1      AGC/Equalizer:
The Adaptive Gain Control circuit amplifies the incoming analog signal and compensates for the various flat
losses and also for the loss at one-half symbol rate. The AGC has a dynamic range of 30 dB.
The Equalizer restores the integrity of the signal and compensates for the frequency dependent attenuation of
up to 900 feet of coaxial cable (1300 feet for E3). The Equalizer also boosts the high frequency content of the
signal to reduce the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) so that, the slicer slices the signal at 50% of peak voltage to
generate Positive and Negative data.
The Equalizer can either be “IN” or “OUT” by setting the REQEN pin “High” or “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or
setting the REQEN control bit to “1” or “0” (in Host Mode).
 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EQUALIZER SETTINGS:
The Equalizer has two gain settings to provide optimum equalization. In the case of normally shaped DS3/
STS-1 pulses (pulses that meet the template requirements) that has been driven through 0 to 900 feet of cable,
the Equalizer can be left “IN” by setting the REQEN pin to “High” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the REQEN
control bit to “1” (in Host Mode).
However, for square-shaped pulses such as E3 or for DS3/STS-1 high pulses (that does not meet the pulse
template requirements), it is recommended that the Equalizer be left “OUT” for cable length less than 300 feet
by setting the REQEN pin “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or by setting the REQEN control bit to “0” (in Host
Mode).This would help to prevent over-equalization of the signal and thus optimize the performance in terms of
better jitter transfer characteristics.
NOTE: The results of extensive testing indicates that even when the Equalizer was left “IN” (REQEN = “HIGH”), regardless
         of the cable length, the integrity of the E3 signal was restored properly over 0 to 12 dB cable loss at Industrial
         Temperature.
The Equalizer also contain an additional 20 dB gain stage to provide the line monitoring capability of the
resistively attenuated signals which may have 20dB flat loss. This capability can be turned on by writing a “1” to
the RxMON bits in the control register or by setting the RxMON pin (pin 27) “High”.
  5.1.1      Interference Tolerance:
For E3 mode, ITU-T G.703 Recommendation specifies that the receiver be able to recover error-free clock and
data in the presence of a sinusoidal interfering tone signal. For DS3 and STS-1 modes, the same
                                                              28

 5.2      Clock and Data Recovery:
The Clock and Data Recovery Circuit extracts the embedded clock, from the sliced digital data stream and
provides the retimed data to the B3ZS (HDB3) decoder.
The Clock Recovery PLL can be in one of the following two modes:
TRAINING MODE:
In the absence of input signals at RTIP and RRing pins, or when the frequency difference between the
recovered line clock signal and the reference clock applied on the ExClk input pin exceed 0.5%, the clock
recovery unit enters into Training Mode and a Loss of Lock condition is declared by toggling RLOL output pin
“High” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the RLOL bit to “1” in the control registers (in Host Mode). Also, the clock
output on the RxClk pin is the same as the reference clock applied on ExClk pin.
DATA/CLOCK RECOVERY MODE:
In the presence of input line signals on the RTIP and RRing input pins and when the frequency difference
between the recovered clock signal and the reference clock signal is less than 0.5%, the clock that is output on
the RxClk out pin is the Recovered Clock signal.
 5.3      B3ZS/HDB3 Decoder:
The decoder block takes the output from clock and data recovery block and decodes the B3ZS (for DS3 or
STS-1) or HDB3 (for E3) encoded line signal and detects any coding errors or excessive zeros in the data
stream.
Whenever the input signal violates the B3ZS or HDB3 coding sequence for bipolar violation or contains three
(for B3ZS) or four (for HDB3) or more consecutive zeros, an active “High” pulse is generated on the RLCV
output pins to indicate line code violation.
NOTE: In Single- Rail (NRZ) mode, the decoder is bypassed.
 5.4      LOS (Loss of Signal) Detector:
  5.4.1     DS3/STS-1 LOS Condition:
A Digital Loss of Signal (DLOS) condition occurs when a string of 175 ± 75 consecutive zeros occur on the line.
When the DLOS condition occurs, the DLOS bit is set to “1” in the status control register. DLOS condition is
cleared when the detected average pulse density is greater than 33% for 175 ± 75 pulses.
Analog Loss of Signal (ALOS) condition occurs when the amplitude of the incoming line signal is below the
threshold as shown in the Table 10.The status of the ALOS condition is reflected in the ALOS status control

RLOS is the logical OR of the DLOS and ALOS states. When the RLOS condition occurs the RLOS output pin
is toggled “High” and the RLOS bit is set to “1” in the status control register.

DISABLING ALOS/DLOS DETECTOR:
For debugging purposes it is useful to disable the ALOS/DLOS detector. Writing a “1” to the ALOS and DLOS
bits disables the LOS detector on a per channel basis.
  5.4.2      E3 LOS Condition:
If the level of incoming line signal drops below the threshold as described in the ITU-T G.775 standard, the
LOS condition is detected. Loss of signal level is defined to be between 15 and 35 dB below the normal level. If
the signal drops below 35 dB for 175 ± 75 consecutive pulse periods, LOS condition is declared. This is
illustrated in Figure 19.

As defined in ITU-T G.775, an LOS condition is also declared between 10 and 255 UI (or E3 bit periods) after
the actual time the LOS condition has occurred. The LOS condition is cleared within 10 to 255 UI after
restoration of the incoming line signal. Figure 20 shows the LOS declaration and clearance conditions.

 5.4.3     Muting the Recovered Data with LOS condition:
When the LOS condition is declared, the clock recovery circuit locks into the reference clock applied to the
ExClk pin and output this clock on the RxClk output. The data on the RPOS and RNEG pins can be forced to
zero by pulling the LOSMUT pin “High” (in Hardware Mode) or by setting the LOSMUT bits in the individual
channel control register to “1” (in Host Mode).
NOTE: When the LOS condition is cleared, the recovered data is output on RPOS and RNEG pins.

  6.0 JITTER:
There are three fundamental parameters that describe circuit performance relative to jitter:
• Jitter Tolerance (Receiver)
• Jitter Transfer (Receiver/Transmitter)
• Jitter Generation
  6.1     JITTER TOLERANCE - RECEIVER:
Jitter tolerance is a measure of how well a Clock and Data Recovery unit can successfully recover data in the
presence of various forms of jitter. It is characterized by the amount of jitter required to produce a specified bit
error rate. The tolerance depends on the frequency content of the jitter. Jitter Tolerance is measured as the
jitter amplitude over a jitter spectrum for which the clock and data recovery unit achieves a specified bit error
rate (BER). To measure the jitter tolerance as shown in Figure 21, jitter is introduced by the sinusoidal
modulation of the serial data bit sequence.

Input jitter tolerance requirements are specified in terms of compliance with jitter mask which is represented as
a combination of points.Each point corresponds to a minimum amplitude of sinusoidal jitter at a given jitter
frequency.
  6.1.1      DS3/STS-1 Jitter Tolerance Requirements:
Bellcore GR-499 CORE, Issue 1, December 1995 specifies the minimum requirement of jitter tolerance for
Category I and Category II. The jitter tolerance requirement for Category II is the most stringent. Figure 22
shows the jitter tolerance curve as per GR-499 specification along with the measured performance for the
device.

 6.2      JITTER TRANSFER - RECEIVER/TRANSMITTER:
Jitter Transfer function is defined as the ratio of jitter on the output relative to the jitter applied on the input
versus frequency.
There are two distinct characteristics in jitter transfer: jitter gain (jitter peaking) defined as the highest ratio
above 0 dB; and jitter transfer bandwidth.The overall jitter transfer bandwidth is controller by a low bandwidth
loop,which is part of the XRT75VL00..
The jitter transfer function is a ratio between the jitter output and jitter input for a component, or system often
expressed in dB. A negative dB jitter transfer indicates the element removed jitter. A positive dB jitter transfer
indicates the element added jitter.A zero dB jitter transfer indicates the element had no effect on jitter.
Table 12 shows the jitter transfer characteristics and/or jitter attenuation specifications for various data rates:

The XRT75VL00 meets the above Jitter Specifications.
 6.3      JITTER GENERATION:
Jitter Generation is defined as the process whereby jitter appears at the output port of the digital equipment in
the absence of applied input jitter. Jitter Generation is measured by sending jitter free data to the clock and
data recovery circuit and measuring the amount of jitter on the output clock or the re-timed data. Since this is
essentially a noise measurement, it requires a definition of bandwidth to be meaningful. The bandwidth is set
according to the data rate. In general, the jitter is measured over a band of frequencies.
 6.4      Jitter Attenuator:
An advanced crystal-less jitter attenuator is included in the XRT75VL00. The jitter attenuator uses the internal
reference clock.
In Host mode, by clearing or setting the JATx/Rx bit in the control register selects the jitter attenuator either in
the Receive or Transmit path. In Hardware mode, JATx/Rx pin selects the jitter attenuator in Receive or
Transmit path.
The FIFO is either a 16-bit or 32-bit register. In Host mode, the bits JA0 and JA1can be set to appropriate
combination to select the different FIFO sizes or to disable the jitter attenuator. In Hardware mode, appropriate
setting of the pins JA0 and JA1 selects the different FIFO sizes or disable the jitter attenuator. Data is clocked
into the FIFO with the associated clock signal (TxClk or RxClk) and clocked out of the FIFO with the dejittered

clock. When the FIFO is within two bits of overflowing or underflowing, the FIFO limit status bit, FL is set to “1”
in the Alarm status register. Reading this bit clears the FIFO and resets the bit into default state.
NOTE: It is recommended to select the 16-bit FIFO for delay-sensitive applications as well as for removing smaller amounts
       of jitter.

 7.0 SERIAL HOST INTERFACE:
 A flexible serial microprocessor interface is incorporated in the XRT75VL00. The interface is generic and is
designed to support the common microprocessors/microcontrollers. The XRT75VL00 operates in Host mode
when the HOST/HW pin is tied “High”. The serial interface includes a serial clock (SClk), serial data input
(SDI), serial data output (SDO), chip select (CS) and interrupt output (INT). The serial interface timing is shown
in Figure 11.
The active low interrupt output signal (INT pin) indicates alarm conditions like LOS, DMO and FL to the
processor.
When the XRT75VL00 is configured in Host mode, the following input pins,TxLEV, TAOS, RLB, LLB, E3, STS-
1/DS3, REQEN, JATx/Rx, JA0 and JA1 are disabled and must be connected to ground.
 Table 14 below illustrates the functions of the shared pins in either Host mode or in Hardware mode.

NOTE: While configured in Host mode, the TxON input pin will be active if the TxON bit in the control register is set to “1”,
         and can be used to turn on and off the transmit output drivers. This permits a system designed for redundancy to
         quickly switch out a defective line card and switch-in the backup line card.

  8.0 DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES:
  8.1      PRBS Generator and Detector:
The XRT75VL00 contains an on-chip Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator and detector for
diagnostic purpose. This feature is only available in Host mode. With the PRBSEN bit = “1”, the transmitter will
send out PRBS of 223-1 in E3 rate or 215-1 in STS-1/DS3 rate. At the same time, the receiver PRBS detector is
also enabled. When the correct PRBS pattern is detected by the receiver, the RNEG/LCV pin will go “Low” to
indicate PRBS synchronization has been achieved. When the PRBS detector is not in sync the PRBSLS bit will
be set to “1” and RNEG/LCV pin will go “High”.
With the PRBS mode enabled, the user can also insert a single bit error by toggling “INSPRBS” bit. This is
done by writing a “1” to INSPRBS bit. The receiver at RNEG/LCV pin will pulse “High” for half RxClk cycle for
every bit error detected. Any subsequent single bit error insertion must be done by first writing a “0” to
INSPRBS bit and followed by a “1”.
When PRBS mode is enabled, the PRBS counter starts counting each single bit error. The PRBS counter is 16
bits wide. The current value in the counter can be read via two readback operations of the Serial I/O registers.
1) Either the Least Significant Byte (LSB, address 0x30) or the Most Significant Byte (MSB, address 0x31) can
be read first. The value of the un-read register will be copied into the Holding register (address 0x38) and both
the LSB and MSB registers will be reset to zero.
2) Read the Holding register and concatenate the result with the value from the first read operation to get the
full 16 bit counter value.
When the PRBS mode is first enabled, errors will be counted while the receiver logic is synchronizing to the
PRBS pattern. When RNEG/LCV goes “Low” indicating PRBS synchronization, reset the counter by reading
either the LSB or the MSB register.
Figure 25 shows the status of RNEG/LCV pin when the XRT75VL00 is configured in PRBS mode.

  8.2      LOOPBACKS:
The XRT75VL00 offers three loopback modes for diagnostic purposes. In Hardware mode, the loopback
modes are selected via the RLB and LLB pins. In Host mode, the RLB and LLB bits in the control registers
select the loopback modes.
  8.2.1      ANALOG LOOPBACK:
In this mode, the transmitter outputs (TTIP and TRING) are connected internally to the receiver inputs (RTIP
and RRING) as shown in Figure 26. Data and clock are output at RCLK, RPOS and RNEG pins for the
corresponding transceiver. Analog loopback exercises most of the functional blocks of the device including the
jitter attenuator which can be selected in either the transmit or receive path.
XRT75VL00 can be configured in Analog Loopback either in Hardware mode via the LLB and RLB pins or in
Host mode via LLB and RLB bits in the channel control registers.

 8.2.2       DIGITAL LOOPBACK:
The Digital Loopback function is available either in Hardware mode or Host mode. When the Digital Loopback
is selected, the transmit clock (TxClk) and transmit data inputs (TPDATA & TNDATA) are looped back and
output onto the RxClk, RPOS and RNEG pins as shown in Figure 27. The data presented on TxClk, TPDATA
and TNDATA are not output on the TTIP and TRING pins.This provides the capability to configure the
protection card (in redundancy applications) in Digital Loopback mode without affecting the traffic on the
primary card.
NOTE: Signals on the RTIP and RRING pins are ignored during digital loopback.

 8.2.3       REMOTE LOOPBACK:
With Remote loopback activated as shown in Figure 28,the receive data on RTIP and RRING is looped back
after the jitter attenuator (if selected in receive or transmit path) to the transmit path using RxClk as transmit
timing. The receive data is also output via the RPOS and RNEG pins.
During the remote loopback mode, if the jitter attenuator is selected in the transmit path, the receive data after
the Clock and Data Recovery Block is looped back to the transmit path and pass through the jitter attenuator
using RxClk as the transmit timing.
NOTE: Input signals on TxClk, TPDATA and TNDATA are ignored during Remote loopback.

8.3       TRANSMIT ALL ONES (TAOS):
Transmit All Ones (TAOS) can be set either in Hardware mode by pulling the TAOS pins “High” or in Host mode
by setting the TAOS control bits to “1” in the Channel control registers. When the TAOS is set, the Transmit
Section generates and transmits a continuous AMI all “1’s” pattern on TTIP and TRING pins. The frequency of
this “1’s” pattern is determined by TClk.TAOS data path is shown in Figure 29.
