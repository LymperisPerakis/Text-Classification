               12M          If any of the channels is configured in STS-1 mode, a reference clock 51.84
                            MHz is applied on this pin..
                            In Single Frequency Mode, a reference clock of 12.288 MHz ± 20 ppm is con-
                            nected to this pin and the internal clock synthesizer generates the appropriate
                            clock frequencies based on the configuration of the channels in E3, DS3 or
                            STS-1 modes.
     L15     SFM_EN      I  Single Frequency Mode Enable:
                            Tie this pin “High” to enable the Single Frequency Mode. A reference clock of
                            12.288 MHz ± 20 ppm is applied.
                            In the Single Frequency Mode (SFM) a low jitter output clock is provided for
                            each channel if the CLK_EN bit is set thus eliminating the need for a separate
                            clock source for the framer.
                            Tie this pin “Low” if single frequency mode is not selected. In this case, the
                            appropriate reference clocks must be provided.

                            This eliminates the need for a separate clock source for the framer.

                                 1. The maximum drive capability for the clockouts is 16 mA.
                                 2. This clock out is available both in SFM and non-SFM modes.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The XRT75R06 is a six channel fully integrated Line Interface Unit featuring EXAR’s R3 Technology
(Reconfigurable, Relayless Redundancy) for E3/DS3/STS-1 applications. The LIU incorporates 6 independent
Receivers, Transmitters and Jitter Attenuators in a single 217 Lead BGA package. Each channel can be
independently programmed to support E3, DS-3 or STS-1 line rates using one input clock reference of
12.288MHz in Single Frequency Mode (SFM). The LIU is responsible for providing the physical connection
between a line interface and an aggregate mapper or framing device. Along with the analog-to-digital
processing, the LIU offers monitoring and diagnostic features to help optimize network design implementation.
A key characteristic within the network topology is Automatic Protection Switching (APS).
EXAR’s proven expertise in providing redundany solutions has paved the way for R3 Technology.
  1.0 R3 TECHNOLOGY (RECONFIGURABLE, RELAYLESS REDUNDANCY)
Redundancy is used to introduce reliability and protection into network card design. The redundant card in
many cases is an exact replicate of the primary card, such that when a failure occurs the network processor
can automatically switch to the backup card. EXAR’s R3 technology has re-defined E3/DS-3/STS-1 LIU design
for 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy applications. Without relays and one Bill of Materials, EXAR offers multi-port,
integrated LIU solutions to assist high density aggregate applications and framing requirements with reliability.
The following section can be used as a reference for implementing R3 Technology with EXAR’s world leading
line interface units.
  1.1    Network Architecture
A common network design that supports 1:1 or 1+1 redundancy consists of N primary cards along with N
backup cards that connect into a mid-plane or back-plane architecture without transformers installed on the
network cards. In addition to the network cards, the design has a line interface card with one source of
transformers, connectors, and protection components that are common to both network cards. With this
design, the bill of materials is reduced to the fewest amount of components. See Figure 3. for a simplified
block diagram of a typical redundancy design.

 2.0 CLOCK SYNTHESIZER
The LIU uses a flexible user interface for accepting clock references to generate the internal master clocks
used to drive the LIU. The reference clock used to supply the microprocessor timing is generated from the DS-
3 or SFM clock input. Therefore, if the chip is configured for STS-1 only or E3 only, then the DS-3 input pin
must be connected to the STS-1 pin or E3 pin respectively. In DS-3 mode or when SFM is used, the STS-1
and E3 input pins can be left unconnected. If SFM is enabled by pulling the SFM_EN pin "High", 12.288MHz is
the only clock reference necessary to generate DS-3, E3, or STS-1 line rates and the microprocessor timing.
A simplified block diagram of the clock synthesizer is shown in Figure 4

 2.1     Clock Distribution
Network cards that are designed to support multiple line rates which are not configured for single frequency
mode should ensure that a clock is applied to the DS3Clk input pin. For example: If the network card being
supplied to an ISP requires E3 only, the DS-3 input clock reference is still necessary to provide read and write
access to the internal microprocessor. Therefore, the E3 mode requires two input clock references. If
however, multiple line rates will not be supported, i.e. E3 only, then the DS3Clk input pin may be hard wire
connected to the E3Clk input pin.

  3.0 THE RECEIVER SECTION
The receiver is designed so that the LIU can recover clock and data from an attenuated line signal caused by
cable loss or flat loss according to industry specifications. Once data is recovered, it is processed and
presented at the receiver outputs according to the format chosen to interface with a Framer/Mapper or ASIC.
This section describes the detailed operation of various blocks within the receive path. A simplified block
diagram of the receive path is shown in Figure 6.

  3.1     Receive Line Interface
Physical Layer devices are AC coupled to a line interface through a 1:1 transformer. The transformer provides
isolation and a level shift by blocking the DC offset of the incoming data stream. The typical medium for the
line interface is a 75Ω coxial cable. Whether using E3, DS-3 or STS-1, the LIU requires the same bill of
materials, see Figure 7.

 3.2     Adaptive Gain Control (AGC)
The Adaptive Gain Control circuit amplifies the incoming analog signal and compensates for the various flat
losses and also for the loss at one-half symbol rate. The AGC has a dynamic range of 30 dB. The peak
detector provides feedback to the equalizer before slicing occurs.
 3.3     Receive Equalizer
The Equalizer restores the integrity of the signal and compensates for the frequency dependent attenuation of
up to 900 feet of coaxial cable (1300 feet for E3). The Equalizer also boosts the high frequency content of the
signal to reduce Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) so that the slicer slices the signal at 50% of peak voltage to
generate Positive and Negative data. The equalizer can be disabled by programming the appropriate register.

  3.3.1     Recommendations for Equalizer Settings
The Equalizer has two gain settings to provide optimum equalization. In the case of normally shaped DS3/
STS-1 pulses (pulses that meet the template requirements) that has been driven through 0 to 900 feet of cable,
the Equalizer can be enabled. However, for square-shaped pulses such as E3 or for DS3/STS-1 high pulses
(that does not meet the pulse template requirements), it is recommended that the Equalizer be disabled for
cable length less than 300 feet. This would help to prevent over-equalization of the signal and thus optimize
the performance in terms of better jitter transfer characteristics. The Equalizer also contains an additional 20
dB gain stage to provide the line monitoring capability of the resistively attenuated signals which may have
20dB flat loss. The equalizer gain mode can be enabled by programming the appropriate register.
NOTE: The results of extensive testing indicate that even when the Equalizer was enabled, regardless of the cable length,
        the integrity of the E3 signal was restored properly over 0 to 12 dB cable loss at Industrial Temperature.
 3.4     Clock and Data Recovery
The Clock and Data Recovery Circuit extracts the embedded clock, RxClk_n from the sliced digital data stream
and provides the retimed data to the B3ZS (HDB3) decoder. The Clock Recovery PLL can be in one of the
following two modes:
  3.4.1     Data/Clock Recovery Mode
In the presence of input line signals on the RTIP_n and RRing_n input pins and when the frequency difference
between the recovered clock signal and the reference clock signal is less than 0.5%, the clock that is output on
the RxClk_n out pins is the Recovered Clock signal.
  3.4.2     Training Mode
In the absence of input signals at RTIP_n and RRing_n pins, or when the frequency difference between the
recovered line clock signal and the reference clock applied on the ExClk_n input pins exceed 0.5%, a Loss of
Lock condition is declared by toggling RLOL_n output pin “High” or setting the RLOL_n bit to “1” in the control
register. Also, the clock output on the RxClk_n pins are the same as the reference channel clock.

  3.5.1    DS3/STS-1 LOS Condition
A Digital Loss of SIgnal (DLOS) condition occurs when a string of 175 ± 75 consecutive zeros occur on the line.
When the DLOS condition occurs, the DLOS_n bit is set to “1” in the status control register. DLOS condition is
cleared when the detected average pulse density is greater than 33% for 175 ± 75 pulses. Analog Loss of
Signal (ALOS) condition occurs when the amplitude of the incoming line signal is below the threshold as shown
in the Table 1.The status of the ALOS condition is reflected in the ALOS_n status control register. RLOS is the
logical OR of the DLOS and ALOS states. When the RLOS condition occurs the RLOS_n output pin is toggled
“High” and the RLOS_n bit is set to “1” in the status control register.

  3.5.2    Disabling ALOS/DLOS Detection
For debugging purposes it is useful to disable the ALOS and/or DLOS detection. Writing a “1” to both
ALOSDIS_n and DLOSDIS_n bits disables the LOS detection on a per channel basis.

  3.5.3     E3 LOS Condition:
If the level of incoming line signal drops below the threshold as described in the ITU-T G.775 standard, the
LOS condition is detected. Loss of signal is defined as no transitions for 10 to 255 consecutive zeros. No
transitions is defined as a signal level between 15 and 35 dB below the normal. This is illustrated in Figure 9.
The LOS condition is cleared within 10 to 255 UI after restoration of the incoming line signal. Figure 10 shows
the LOS declaration and clearance conditions.

  3.5.5    Muting the Recovered Data with LOS condition:
When the LOS condition is declared, the clock recovery circuit locks into the reference clock applied to the
internal master clock outputs this clock onto the RxClk_n output pin. The data on the RxPOS_n and RxNEG_n
pins can be forced to zero by setting the LOSMUT_n bits in the individual channel control register to “1”.
NOTE: When the LOS condition is cleared, the recovered data is output on RxPOS_n and RxNEG_n pins.

The decoder block takes the output from the clock and data recovery block and decodes the B3ZS (for DS3 or
STS-1) or HDB3 (for E3) encoded line signal and detects any coding errors or excessive zeros in the data
stream. Whenever the input signal violates the B3ZS or HDB3 coding sequence for bipolar violation or
contains three (for B3ZS) or four (for HDB3) or more consecutive zeros, an active “High” pulse is generated on
the RLCV_n output pins to indicate line code violation.

 4.0 THE TRANSMITTER SECTION
The transmitter is designed so that the LIU can accept serial data from a local device, encode the data
properly, and then output an analog pulse according to the pulse shape chosen in the appropriate registers.
This section describes the detailed operation of various blocks within the transmit path. A simplified block
diagram of the transmit path is shown in Figure 14.

 4.1     Transmit Digital Input Interface
The method for applying data to the transmit inputs of the LIU is a serial interface consisting of TxClk, TxPOS,
and TxNEG. For single rail mode, only TxClk and TxPOS are necessary for providing the local data from a
Framer device or ASIC. Data can be sampled on either edge of the input clock signal by programming the
appropriate register. A typical interface is shown in Figure 15.

 4.2     Transmit Clock
The Transmit Clock applied via TxClk_n pins, for the selected data rate (for E3 = 34.368 MHz, DS3 = 44.736
MHz or STS-1 = 51.84 MHz), is duty cycle corrected by the internal PLL circuit to provide a 50% duty cycle
clock to the pulse shaping circuit. This allows a 30% to 70% duty cycle Transmit Clock to be supplied.
 4.3     B3ZS/HDB3 ENCODER
When the Single-Rail (NRZ) data format is selected, the Encoder Block encodes the data into either B3ZS
format (for either DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3).
 4.3.1      B3ZS Encoding
An example of B3ZS encoding is shown in Figure 19. If the encoder detects an occurrence of three
consecutive zeros in the data stream, it is replaced with either B0V or 00V, where ‘B’ refers to Bipolar pulse
that is compliant with the Alternating polarity requirement of the AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion) line code and
‘V’ refers to a Bipolar Violation (e.g., a bipolar pulse that violates the AMI line code). The substitution of B0V or
00V is made so that an odd number of bipolar pulses exist between any two consecutive violation (V) pulses.
This avoids the introduction of a DC component into the line signal.

 4.3.2      HDB3 Encoding
An example of the HDB3 encoding is shown in Figure 20. If the HDB3 encoder detects an occurrence of four
consecutive zeros in the data stream, then the four zeros are substituted with either 000V or B00V pattern. The
substitution code is made in such a way that an odd number of pulses exist between any consecutive V pulses.
This avoids the introduction of DC component into the analog signal.

 4.4      TRANSMIT PULSE SHAPER
The Transmit Pulse Shaper converts the B3ZS encoded digital pulses into a single analog Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI) pulse that meets the industry standard mask template requirements for STS-1 and DS3. For
E3 mode, the pulse shaper converts the HDB3 encoded pulses into a single full amplitude square shaped
pulse with very little slope. The Pulse Shaper Block also includes a Transmit Build Out Circuit, which can
either be disabled or enabled by setting the TxLEV_n bit to “1” or “0” in the control register. For DS3/STS-1
rates, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is used to shape the transmit waveform that ensures that transmit pulse
template requirements are met at the Cross-Connect system. The distance between the transmitter output and
the Cross-Connect system can be between 0 to 450 feet. For E3 rate, since the output pulse template is
measured at the secondary of the transformer and since there is no Cross-Connect system pulse template
requirements, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is always disabled. The differential line driver increases the
transmit waveform to appropriate level and drives into the 75Ω load as shown in Figure 21.

  4.4.1     Guidelines for using Transmit Build Out Circuit
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1, Cross-Connect system, is less than 225 feet,
enable the Transmit Build Out Circuit by setting the TxLEV_n control bit to “0”. If the distance between the
transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1 is greater than 225 feet, disable the Transmit Build Out Circuit.

When the MTIP_n and MRing_n are connected to the TTIP_n and TRing_n lines, the drive monitor circuit
monitors the line for transitions. The DMO_n (Drive Monitor Output) will be asserted “Low” as long as the
transitions on the line are detected via MTIP_n and MRing_n. If no transitions on the line are detected for 128
± 32 TxClk_n periods, the DMO_n output toggles “High” and when the transitions are detected again, DMO_n
toggles “Low”.
NOTE: The Drive Monitor Circuit is only for diagnostic purpose and does not have to be used to operate the transmitter.
 4.7     Transmitter Section On/Off
The transmitter section of each channel can either be turned on or off. To turn on the transmitter, set the input
pin TxON to “High” and write a “1” to the TxON_n control bit. When the transmitter is turned off, TTIP_n and
TRing_n are tri-stated.
NOTES:
     1.   This feature provides support for Redundancy.
     2. To permit a system designed for redundancy to quickly shut-off the defective line card and turn on the back-up line
         card, writing a “1” to the TxON_n control bits transfers the control to TxON pin.

There are three fundamental parameters that describe circuit performance relative to jitter
• Jitter Tolerance
• Jitter Transfer
• Jitter Generation
  5.1     JITTER TOLERANCE
Jitter tolerance is a measure of how well a Clock and Data Recovery unit can successfully recover data in the
presence of various forms of jitter. It is characterized by the amount of jitter required to produce a specified bit
error rate. The tolerance depends on the frequency content of the jitter. Jitter Tolerance is measured as the
jitter amplitude over a jitter spectrum for which the clock and data recovery unit achieves a specified bit error
rate (BER). To measure the jitter tolerance as shown in Figure 26, jitter is introduced by the sinusoidal
modulation of the serial data bit sequence. Input jitter tolerance requirements are specified in terms of
compliance with jitter mask which is represented as a combination of points. Each point corresponds to a
minimum amplitude of sinusoidal jitter at a given jitter frequency.

 5.2      JITTER TRANSFER
Jitter Transfer function is defined as the ratio of jitter on the output relative to the jitter applied on the input
versus frequency. There are two distinct characteristics in jitter transfer, jitter gain (jitter peaking) defined as
the highest ratio above 0dB and jitter transfer bandwidth. The overall jitter transfer bandwidth is controlled by a
low bandwidth loop, typically using a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO).
The jitter transfer function is a ratio between the jitter output and jitter input for a component, or system often
expressed in dB. A negative dB jitter transfer indicates the element removed jitter. A positive dB jitter transfer
indicates the element added jitter. A zero dB jitter transfer indicates the element had no effect on jitter. Table 9
shows the jitter transfer characteristics and/or jitter attenuation specifications for various data rates:

                                                       Category I and Category II
NOTE: The above specifications can be met only with a jitter attenuator that supports E3/DS3/STS-1 rates.
 5.3      Jitter Attenuator
An advanced crystal-less jitter attenuator per channel is included in the XRT75R06. The jitter attenuator
requires no external crystal nor high-frequency reference clock. By clearing or setting the JATx/Rx_n bits in
the channel control registers selects the jitter attenuator either in the Receive or Transmit path on per channel
basis. The FIFO size can be either 16-bit or 32-bit. The bits JA0_n and JA1_n can be set to appropriate
combination to select the different FIFO sizes or to disable the Jitter Attenuator on a per channel basis. Data is
clocked into the FIFO with the associated clock signal (TxClk or RxClk) and clocked out of the FIFO with the
dejittered clock. When the FIFO is within two bits of overflowing or underflowing, the FIFO limit status bit, FL_n
is set to “1” in the Alarm status register. Reading this bit clears the FIFO and resets the bit into default state.
NOTE: It is recommended to select the 16-bit FIFO for delay-sensitive applications as well as for removing smaller amounts
         of jitter. Table 10 specifies the jitter transfer mask requirements for various data rates:

 5.3.1       JITTER GENERATION
Jitter Generation is defined as the process whereby jitter appears at the output port of the digital equipment in
the absence of applied input jitter. Jitter Generation is measured by sending jitter free data to the clock and
data recovery circuit and measuring the amount of jitter on the output clock or the re-timed data. Since this is
essentially a noise measurement, it requires a definition of bandwidth to be meaningful. The bandwidth is set
according to the data rate. In general, the jitter is measured over a band of frequencies.

 6.0 DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES
 6.1      PRBS Generator and Detector
The XRT75R06 contains an on-chip Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator and detector for
diagnostic purpose. With the PRBSEN_n bit = “1”, the transmitter will send out PRBS of 223-1 in E3 rate or
215-1 in STS-1/DS3 rate. At the same time, the receiver PRBS detector is also enabled. When the correct
PRBS pattern is detected by the receiver, the RNEG/LCV pin will go “Low” to indicate PRBS synchronization
has been achieved. When the PRBS detector is not in sync the PRBSLS bit will be set to “1” and RNEG/LCV
pin will go “High”.
With the PRBS mode enabled, the user can also insert a single bit error by toggling “INSPRBS” bit. This is
done by writing a “1” to INSPRBS bit. The receiver at RNEG/LCV pin will pulse “High” for one RxClk cycle for
every bit error detected. Any subsequent single bit error insertion must be done by first writing a “0” to
INSPRBS bit and followed by a “1”.
Figure 30 shows the status of RNEG/LCV pin when the XRT75R06 is configured in PRBS mode.
NOTE: In PRBS mode, the device is forced to operate in Single-Rail Mode.

6.2      LOOPBACKS
The XRT75R06 offers three loopback modes for diagnostic purposes. The loopback modes are selected via
the RLB_n and LLB_n bits n the Channel control registers select the loopback modes.
 6.2.1      ANALOG LOOPBACK
In this mode, the transmitter outputs TTIP_n and TRing_n are internally connected to the receiver inputs
RTIP_n and RRing_n as shown in Figure 31. Data and clock are output at RxClk_n, RxPOS_n and RxNEG_n
pins for the corresponding transceiver. Analog loopback exercises most of the functional blocks of the device
including the jitter attenuator which can be selected in either the transmit or receive path.
NOTES:
      1. In the Analog loopback mode, data is also output via TTIP_n and TRing_n pins.
      2. Signals on the RTIP_n and RRing_n pins are ignored during analog loopback.

Transmit All Ones (TAOS) can be set by setting the TAOS_n control bits to “1” in the Channel control registers.
When the TAOS is set, the Transmit Section generates and transmits a continuous AMI all “1’s” pattern on
TTIP_n and TRing_n pins. The frequency of this ones pattern is determined by TxClk_n. the TAOS data path
is shown in Figure 34. TAOS does not operate in Analog loopback or Remote loopback modes, however will
function in Digital loopback mode.

 7.0 MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE BLOCK
The Microprocessor Interface section supports communication between the local microprocessor (µP) and the
LIU. The XRT75R06 supports a parallel interface asynchronously or synchronously timed to the LIU. The mi-
croprocessor interface is selected by the state of the Pmode input pin. Selecting the microprocessor interface
mode is shown in Table 11.

The local µP configures the LIU by writing data into specific addressable, on-chip Read/Write registers. The
µP provides the signals which are required for a general purpose microprocessor to read or write data into
these registers. The µP also supports polled and interrupt driven environments. A simplified block diagram of
the microprocessor is shown in Figure 35.

 7.1 THE MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE BLOCK SIGNALS
The LIU may be configured into different operating modes and have its performance monitored by software
through a standard microprocessor using data, address and control signals. These interface signals are de-
scribed below in Table 12. The microprocessor interface can be configured to operate in Asynchronous mode
or Synchronous mode.

                         pin is pulled “Low” (if CS is “Low”) the LIU is informed that a write operation has been
                         requested and begins the process of the write cycle.
      RDY           O    Ready Output This active low signal is provided by the LIU device. It indicates that the current
                         read or write cycle is complete, and the LIU is waiting for the next command.
       INT          O    Interrupt Output This active low signal is provided by the LIU to alert the local mP that a
                         change in alarm status has occured. This pin is Reset Upon Read (RUR) once the alarm sta-
                         tus registers have been cleared.
     RESET           I   Reset Input This active low input pin is used to Reset the LIU.

 7.2 ASYNCHRONOUS AND SYNCHRONOUS DESCRIPTION
Whether the LIU is configured for Asynchronous or Synchronous mode, the following descriptions apply. The
synchronous mode requires an input clock (PCLK) to be used as the microprocessor timing reference. Read
and Write operations are described below.
Read Cycle (For Pmode = "0" or "1")
Whenever the local µP wishes to read the contents of a register, it should do the following.
 1. Place the address of the target register on the address bus input pins Addr[7:0].
 2. While the µP is placing this address value on the address bus, the address decoding circuitry should
     assert the CS pin of the LIU, by toggling it "Low". This action enables communication between the µP and
     the LIU microprocessor interface block.
 3. Next, the µP should indicate that this current bus cycle is a Read operation by toggling the RD input pin
     "Low". This action enables the bi-directional data bus output drivers of the LIU.
 4. After the µP toggles the Read signal "Low", the LIU will toggle the RDY output pin "Low". The LIU does this
     to inform the µP that the data is available to be read by the µP, and that it is ready for the next command.
 5. After the µP detects the RDY signal and has read the data, it can terminate the Read Cycle by toggling the
     RD input pin "High".
 6. The CS input pin must be pulled "High" before a new command can be issued.
Write Cycle (For Pmode = "0" or "1")
Whenever a local µP wishes to write a byte or word of data into a register within the LIU, it should do the follow-
ing.
 1. Place the address of the target register on the address bus input pins Addr[7:0].
 2. While the µP is placing this address value on the address bus, the address decoding circuitry should
     assert the CS pin of the LIU, by toggling it "Low". This action enables communication between the µP and
     the LIU microprocessor interface block.
 3. The µP should then place the byte or word that it intends to write into the target register, on the bi-direc-
     tional data bus D[7:0].
 4. Next, the µP should indicate that this current bus cycle is a Write operation by toggling the WR input pin
     "Low". This action enables the bi-directional data bus input drivers of the LIU.
 5. After the µP toggles the Write signal "Low", the LIU will toggle the RDY output pin "Low". The LIU does this
     to inform the µP that the data has been written into the internal register location, and that it is ready for the
     next command.
 6. The CS input pin must be pulled "High" before a new command can be issued.
