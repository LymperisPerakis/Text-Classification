Brief Description
   The CMX589A is a single-chip synchronous data pump/modem designed for Wireless Data Applications.
   Employing Gaussian filtering for Minimum shift Keying (GMSK) baseband modulation applications, the
   CMX589A features a wide range of available data rates from 4k to 200k bps. Data Rates and the choice of
   BT (0.3 or 0.5) are pin programmable to provide for different system requirements.
   The Tx and Rx digital data interfaces are bit serial, synchronized to generated Tx and Rx data clocks.
   Separate Tx and Rx Powersave inputs allow full or half-duplex operation. Rx input levels can be set by
   suitable AC and DC level adjusting circuitry built with external components around an on-chip Rx Input
   Amplifier.
   Acquisition, Lock, and Hold of Rx data signals are made easier and faster by the use of Rx Control Inputs
   to clamp, detect, and /or hold input data levels and can be set by the µProcessor as required. The Rx S/N
   output provides an indication of the quality of the received signal.
   The CMX589A may be used with a 3.0V to 5.5V power supply and is available in the following packages:
   24-pin TSSOP (CMX589AE2), 24-pin SSOP (CMX589AD5), 24-pin SOIC (CMX589AD2), and 24-pin PDIP
   (CMX589AP4).

Recommended External Component Notes:
1. The RC network formed by R1 and C1 is required between the Tx Out pin and the input to the modulator.
    This network, which can form part of any DC level shifting and gain adjustment circuitry, forms an
    important part of the transmit signal filtering. The ground connection to the capacitor C1 should be
    positioned to give maximum attenuation of high-frequency noise into the modulator.
    The component values should be chosen so that the product of the resistance and the capacitance is:
                                 For a BT of 0.3      R1.C1 = 0.34/bit rate (bps)
                                 For a BT of 0.5      R1.C1 = 0.22/bit rate (bps)

2. R3, R4 and C6 form the gain components for the Rx Input signal. R3 should be chosen as required by the
    signal input level.
3. For bit rate ≤ 64kbps, R4 = 100kΩ. For bit rate > 64kbps, R4 = 10kΩ.
4. The values chosen for C2 and C3 (including stray capacitance), should be suitable for the applied VDD
    and the frequency of X1.
    As a guide: C2 = C3 = 33pF at 1.0MHz falling to 18pF at the maximum frequency.
    At 3.0V, C2 = C3 = 33pF falling to 18pF at 5.0MHz the equivalent series resistance of X1 should be less
    than 2.0KΩ falling to 150Ω at the maximum frequency. Stray capacitance on the Xtal/Clock circuit pins
    must be minimized.
                                                                                    1
5. For bit rate ≤ 64kbps, C6 = 22pF. For bit rate > 64kbps, C6 =
                                                                       3 × bit rate × 2π × 10kΩ
    e.g. for 128kbps, C6 = 41.1pF.
6. C7 and C8 should both be .015µF for a data rate of 8kbps, and inversely proportional to the data rate for
    other data rates, e.g. 0.030µF at 4kbps, 1800pF at 64kbps, 680pF at 192kbps.
7. The tolerance of C9 is not very critical because it primarily serves as a dc blocking capacitor.
8. The CMX589A can operate correctly with the Xtal frequencies between 1.0MHz and 16.0MHz
    (VDD = 5.0V) and 1.0MHz to 5.0MHz (VDD = 3.0V). External clock frequencies up to 25.6MHz
    (VDD ≥ 4.5V) are also supported (See Table 4 for examples.) For best results, a crystal oscillator design
    should drive the clock inverter input with signal levels of at least 40% of VDD, peak to peak. Tuning fork
    crystals generally cannot meet this requirement. To obtain crystal oscillator design assistance, consult
    your crystal manufacturer. Operation of this device without a Xtal or Clock input may cause device
    damage.

4 General Description
4.1    Clock Oscillator Divider
The Tx and (nominal) Rx data rates are determined by division of the frequency present at the XTALN pin as
generated by the on-chip Xtal oscillator, with external components, or supplied from an external source.
The division ratio is controlled by the logic level inputs on ClkDivA and ClkDivB pins as shown in Table 4,
together with an indication of how various standard data rates may be derived from common µP Xtal
frequencies.

4.2    Receive
4.2.1   Rx Signal Path Description
The function of the Rx circuitry is to:
1. Set the incoming signal to a usable level.
2. Clean the signal by filtering.
3. Provide dc level thresholds for clock and data extraction.
4. Provide clock timing information for data extraction and external circuits.
5. Provide Rx data in a binary form.
6. Assess signal quality and provide Signal-to-Noise information.

GMSK Modem                                                                                                CMX589A
The output of the radio receiver's Frequency Discriminator should be fed to the CMX589A's Rx Filter by a
suitable gain and DC level adjusting circuit. This circuit can be built with external components around the on-
chip Rx Input Amplifier. The gain should be set so that the signal level at the Rx Feedback pin is nominally
1V peak to peak (for VDD=5.0V) centered around VBIAS when receiving a continuous 1111000011110000..
data pattern.
Positive going signal excursions at Rx Feedback pin will produce a logic ‘0’ at the Rx Data Output. Negative
going excursions will produce a logic ‘1’.
The received signal is fed through the lowpass Rx Filter, which has a -3dB corner frequency of 0.56 times the
data bit-rate, before being applied to the Level Measure and Clock and Data extraction blocks.
The Level Measuring block consists of two voltage detectors, one of which measures the amplitude of the
positive parts of the received signal. The other measures the amplitude of the negative portions. (Positive
refers to signal levels higher than VDD/2, and negative to levels lower than VDD/2.) External capacitors are
used by these detectors, via the Doc1 and Doc2 pins, to form voltage ‘hold’ or ‘integrator’ circuits. These two
levels are then used to establish the optimum DC level decision-thresholds for the Clock and Data extraction,
depending upon the Rx signal amplitude and any DC offset.
4.2.2     Rx Circuit Control Modes
The operating characteristics of the Rx Level Measurement and Clock Extraction circuits are controlled, as
shown in Table 6, by logic level inputs applied to the PLLacq, Rx HOLDN and RxDCacq pins to suit a
particular application, or to cope with changing reception conditions, reference Figure 5.
In general, a data transmission will begin with a preamble, for example, 1100110011001100, to allow the
receive modem to establish timing and level-lock as quickly as possible. After the Rx carrier has been
detected, and during the time that the preamble is expected, the RxDCacq and PLLacq Inputs should be
switched from a logic ‘0’ to a logic ‘1’ so that the Level Measuring and Clock Extraction modes are operated
and sequenced as shown.
The Rx HOLDN input should normally be held at a logic ‘1’ while data is being received, but may be driven to
a logic ‘0’ to freeze the Level Measuring Clock Extraction circuits during a fade. If a fade lasts for less than
200 bit periods, normal operation can be resumed by returning the Rx HOLDN input to a logic ‘1’ at the end of
the fade. For longer fades, it may be better to reset the Level Measuring circuits by placing the RxDCacq to a
logic ‘1’ for 10 to 20 bit periods.
Rx HOLDN has no effect on the Level Measuring circuits while RxDCacq is at a logic ‘1’, and has no effect on
the PLL while PLLacq is at a logic ‘1’.
A logic ‘0’ on Rx HOLDN does not disable the Rx Clock output, and the Rx Data Extraction and S/N Detector
circuits will continue to operate.

4.2.3     Rx Clock Extraction
Synchronized by a PLL circuit to zero-crossings of the incoming data, the Rx Clock Extraction circuitry
controls the Rx Clock output. The Rx Clock is also used internally by the Data Extraction circuitry. The PLL
parameters can be varied by the Rx Circuit Control inputs PLLacq and Rx HOLDN to operate in one of four
PLL modes as described in Table 5 and Table 6.
4.2.4     Rx Data Extraction
The Rx Data Extraction circuit decides whether each received bit is a 1 or 0 by sampling the received signal,
after filtering, and comparing the sample values to an adaptive threshold derived from the Level Measuring
circuit. This threshold is adapted from bit to bit to compensate for intersymbol interference caused by the and
limiting of the overall transmission path and the Gaussian premodulation filter. Extracted data is output from
the Rx Data pin, and should be sampled externally on the rising edge of the Rx CLK.

4.2.5    Rx S/N Detection
The Rx S/N Detector system classifies the incoming zero-crossings as GOOD or BAD depending upon the
time when each crossing actually occurs with respect to its expected time as determined by the Clock
Extraction PLL. This information is then processed to provide a logic level output at the Rx S/N pin. A high
level indicates a series of GOOD crossings; a low level indicates a BAD crossing.
By averaging this output, it is possible to derive a measure of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio and hence the
Bit-Error-Rate of the received signal.

Note: Figure 6 indicates typical performance, independent of bit rate (although the applied noise bandwidth is
considered to match the bit rate used), radio performance (e.g. IF filter distortion), supply voltage (higher bit
rates require VDD ≥ 4.5V), and other ‘real world’ factors.

4.3.1     Tx Signal Path Description
The binary data applied to the Tx Data input is retimed within the chip on each rising edge of the Tx Clock and
then converted to a 1-volt peak-to-peak binary signal centred at VBIAS (for VDD= 5.0V)
If the Tx Enable input is high, then this internal binary signal will be connected to the input of the Lowpass Tx
Filter, and the output of the filter connected to the Tx Out pin.

A ‘low’ input to the Tx Enable will connect the input of the Tx Filter to VBIAS, and disconnect the Tx Out pin
from the filter, connecting it instead to VBIAS through a high resistance (nominally 500kΩ).
The Tx Filter has a lowpass frequency response, which is approximately gaussian in shape as shown in Figure
9, to minimize amplitude and phase distortion of the binary signal while providing sufficient attenuation of the
high frequency-components which would otherwise cause interference into adjacent radio channels. The actual
filter bandwidth to be used in any particular application will be determined by the overall system requirements.
The attenuation-vs.-frequency response of the transmit filtering provided by the CMX589A has been designed to
meet the specifications for most GMSK modem systems that are -3dB bandwidth switchable between 0.3 and
0.5 times the data bit-rate (BT).
Note: An external RC network is required between the Tx Out pin and the input to the Frequency Modulator
(see Figure 2 and Figure 3). This network, which can form part of any DC level shifting and gain adjustment
circuitry, forms an important part of the transmit signal filtering. The ground connection to capacitor C1
should be positioned to give maximum attenuation of high-frequency noise into the modulator.
The signal at Tx Out is centered around VBIAS, going positive for logic ‘1’ (high) level inputs to the Tx Data
input and negative for logic ‘0’ (low) inputs.
When the transmit circuits are put into a powersave mode (by a logic ‘1’ to the Tx PS pin) the output voltage
of the Tx Filter will go to high impedance.

When power is subsequently restored to the Tx filter, its output will take several bit-times to settle. The Tx
Enable input can be used to prevent these abnormal voltages from appearing at the Tx Out pin.

4.4     Data Formats
The receive section of the CMX589A works best with data which has a reasonably random structure --the
data should contain approximately the same number of ‘ones’ as ‘zeroes’ with no long sequences (>100 bits)
of consecutive ones or zeroes. Also, long sequences (>100 bits) of 10101010 ... patterns should be avoided.
For this reason, it is recommended that data be made random in some manner before transmission, for
example by exclusive-ORing it with the output of a binary pseudo-random pattern generator.
Where data is transmitted in bursts, each burst should be preceded by a preamble designed to allow the
receive modem to establish timing and level lock as quickly as possible. This preamble for BT=0.3 should be
at least 16 bits long, and should preferably consist of alternating pairs of ones and zeros i.e.
110011001100....; the eye of pattern 10101010 .... has the most gradual slope and will yield poor peak levels
for the Rx circuits. For BT=0.5 the eye pattern of 10101010... has reduced intersymbol interference and may
be used as the preamble (DC Acq pin should be held high during preamble). See Figure 5.
4.5     Acquisition and Hold Modes
The RXDCacq and PLLacq inputs must be pulsed High for about 16 bits at the start of reception to ensure that
the DC measurement and timing extraction circuits lock-on to the received signal correctly. Once lock has
been achieved, the above inputs should be taken Low again.
In most applications, there will be a DC step in the output voltage from the receiver FM discriminator due to
carrier frequency offsets as channels are changed or when the remote transmitter is turned on.
The CMX589A can tolerate DC offsets in the received signal of at least ±10% of VDD with respect to VBIAS,
(measured at the Rx Feedback pin). However, to ensure that the DC offset compensation circuit operates
correctly and with minimum delay, the Low to High transition of the RXDCacq and PLLacq inputs should occur
after the mean input voltage to the CMX589A has settled to within about 0.1V of its final value.
Note: This can place restrictions on the value of any series signal coupling capacitor.

GMSK Modem                                                                                               CMX589A
As well as using the Rx Hold input to freeze the Level Measuring and Clock Extraction circuits during a signal
fade, it may also be used in systems which use a continuously transmitting control channel to freeze the Rx
circuitry during transmission of a data packet, allowing reception to resume afterwards without losing bit
synchronization. To achieve this, the CMX589A Xtal clock needs to be accurate enough that the derived
RxClock output does not drift by more than about 0.1 bit time from the actual received data-rate during the
time that the RxHold input is ‘Low’.
However; the RXDCacq input may need to be pulsed High for 2 bit durations to re-establish the level
measurements if the RxHold input is Low for more that a few hundred bit-times (exact number depends on
system crystal tolerances).
The voltages on the Doc1 and Doc2 pins reflect the average peak positive and negative excursions of the
(filtered) receive signal, and could therefore be used to derive a measure of the data signal amplitude.
Note: These pins are driven from very high-impedance circuits, so that the DC load presented by any
external circuitry should exceed 10MΩ to VBIAS.
5 Application
5.1     Radio Channel Requirements
To achieve legal adjacent channel performance at high bit-rates, a radio with an accurate carrier frequency
and an accurate modulation index is required. For optimum channel utilization, (e.g. low BER and high data-
rates) attention must be paid to the phase and frequency response of both the IF and baseband circuitry.
5.1.1     Bit Rate, BT, and Bandwidth
The maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a radio channel depends on the following:
          Channel spacing
          Allowable adjacent channel interference
          Tx filter bandwidth
          Peak carrier deviation (Modulation Index)
          Tx and Rx carrier frequency accuracies
          Modulator and Demodulator linearity
          Rx IF filter frequency and phase characteristics
          Use of error correction techniques
          Acceptable error-rate
As a guide to MOBITEX operation, a raw data-rate of 8kbps at 12.5kHz channel spacing may be achievable -
depending on local regulatory requirements- using a ±2kHz maximum deviation, a BT of 0.3, and no more
than 1.5kHz discrepancy between Tx and Rx carrier frequencies. Forward error correction (FEC) could then
be used with interleaving to reduce the effect of burst errors.
Reducing the data-rate to 4.8kbps would allow the BT to be increased to 0.5, improving the error-rate
performance.
5.1.2     FM Modulator, Demodulator and IF
For optimum performance, the eye pattern of the received signal (when receiving random data) applied to the
CMX589A should be as close as possible to the Transmit eye pattern examples shown in Figure 10.
Of particular importance are general symmetry, cleanliness of the zero-crossings, and for a BT of 0.3, the
relative amplitude of the inner eye opening.
To achieve this, attention must be paid to:
          Linearity and frequency/phase response of the Tx frequency modulator. Unless the transmit data is
          especially encoded to remove low frequency components, the modulator frequency response should
          extend down to a few hertz. This is because two-point modulation is necessary for synthesized
          radios.
          Bandwidth and phase response of the Rx IF filters.
          Accuracy of the Tx and Rx carrier frequencies -any difference will shift the received signal towards
          one of the skirts of the IF filter response.

GMSK Modem                                                                                             CMX589A
        Ideally, the Rx demodulator should be DC coupled to the CMX589A Rx Signal In pin (with a DC bias
        added to center the signal at the Rx Feedback pin at VDD/2 [VBIAS]). However, AC coupling can be
        used provided that:
        The 3dB cut-off frequency is 20Hz or below (i.e. a 0.1µF capacitor in series with 100kΩ).
        The data does not contain long sequences of consecutive ones or zeroes.
        Sufficient time is allowed after a step change at the discriminator output (resulting from channel
        changing or the appearance of a RF carrier) for the voltage into the CMX589A to settle before the
        RXDCacq line is strobed.
5.1.3   Two-Point Modulation
When designing the CMX589A into a radio that uses a frequency synthesizer, a two-point modulation
technique is recommended. This is both to prevent the radio's PLL circuitry from counteracting the
modulation process, and to provide a clean flat modulation response down to DC.
Figure 12 shows a suggested basic configuration to provide a two-point modulation drive from the CMX589A
Tx Output using the FX019 or MX019 Digitally Controlled Quad Amplifier Array. The FX019/MX019 elements
provide individual set-up, calibration and dynamic control of modulation levels. Level setting control of the
amplifiers/attenuators of the FX019/MX019 is via an 8-bit data word. Note that the FX019/MX019 frequency
response only supports data rates as high as 8kbps.
With reference to Figure 12:
        The buffer amplifier is required to prevent loading of the CMX589A external RC circuit.
        Stage B, with R1/R2, provides suitable signal and DC levels for the VCO varactor; C1 is RF
        decoupling. The drive level should be adjusted (digitally) to provide the desired deviation.
        Stage C, with R3/R4, provides the Reference Oscillator drive (application dependent). This
        parameter is set by adjusting for minimum AC signal on the PLL control voltage with a low-frequency
        modulating signal (inside the PLL bandwidth) applied.
        Stage D could be used with the components shown if a negative reference drive is required.
        Stage A provides buffering and overall level control.

5.2    AC Coupling of Tx and Rx Signals
In practical applications, it is possible to arrange AC coupling between the CMX589A Tx Output and the
frequency modulator to cut-off at a very low frequency, such as 5.0Hz. AC coupling between the receive
discriminator and the input of the CMX589A may need a shorter time-constant to avoid problems from voltage
steps at the output of the discriminator when changing channels or when the distant transmitter turns on.
For these reasons, as well as to maintain reasonable BER, the optimum –3dB cut-off frequencies are around
5.0Hz in the Tx path and 20.0Hz in the Rx path.
Figure 13 shows the typical static Bit-Error-Rate performance of the CMX589A operating under nominal
conditions for various degrees of AC coupling at the Rx input and the Tx output.
                       Data Rate = 8kbps         VDD = 5.0V      TAMB = 25°C    Tx BT = 0.3
                           Figure 13: Effect of AC Coupling on Typical Bit-Error Rate
Any AC Coupling at the receive input will transform any step in the voltage at the discriminator output to a
slowly decaying pulse which can confuse the modem’s level measuring circuits. As illustrated in Figure 14,
the time for this step to decay to 37% of its original value is ‘RC’ where:
                                                              1
                                 RC =
                                       2π(the 3dB cutoff frequency of the RC network)
which is 32ms, or 256 bit times at 8kbps, for a 5Hz network.
