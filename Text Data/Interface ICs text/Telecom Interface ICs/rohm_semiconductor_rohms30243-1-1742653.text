  DTMF receiver for telephones
  BU8872 / BU8872FS
The BU8872 and BU8872FS are DTMF receiver ICs developed for use in telephone answering machines, and convert
16 different types of DTMF signals into 4-bit binary serial data. In addition to a compact 8-pin DIP (BU8872) or 16-pin
SSOP (BU8872FS) package, these receivers feature a wide dynamic range, eliminating the need for an external input
amplifier. Expertise from a number of companies has been incorporated into these products to enable guard time control
through a host microcomputer.

Circuit operation
A DTMF signal is supplied to the INPUT pin and applied
to a pair of 6th-order bandpass filters, which separate the
DTMF signal into its high (COL) and low (ROW) frequen-
cies. The separated tones are converted into square
waves and fed to a digital detector. (See the block dia-
gram.)
The digital detector checks the two tones to see if they
are within the valid DTMF frequency bands. If they are,
it sends a DETECT signal to the steering circuit, and
sends the appropriate column and row address signals
to a code converter.
The code converter encodes the received and detected
DTMF signal, and outputs an ENABLE signal to the
steering circuit.
Based on the DETECT and ENABLE signals, the steer-
ing circuit outputs an Early Steering (ESt) signal, which
sets the ESt pin to HIGH, indicating that a valid DTMF
signal has been detected.
If a series of pulses is input at the ACK pin while ESt is
HIGH, a decoded DTMF signal is output to the SD pin as
a binary code. (See Figure 2 for the overall timing.)
If a pulse sequence is input at the ACK pin, the data is
latched at the rising edge of the first pulse by a parallel-
serial converter, and at the same time, the LSB is output
from the SD pin. Following this, three bits of data are out-
put from the SD pin for each bit of each pulse in the pulse
sequence input from the ACK pin. As a result, a total of
four bits of data are output for the four pulses. (See Fig-
ure 3 for the ACK and SD timing.)
If the pulse sequence input to the ACK pin consists of
three or fewer pulses, the next DTMF input cannot be de-
coded properly. Any ACK pulses in excess of four are ig-
nored until ESt goes HIGH again.
Table 1 shows the format of serial data output from the
SD pin.

FOperation notes
(1) To prevent latch-ups, we recommend inserting a bypass capacitor (a capacitor between VDD and GND) close to
the VDD pin of the device.
(2) If using a pin-type ceramic resonator, connect a CH class capacitor between the OSCIN and OSCOUT pins and
the GND.
(3) This LSI is not equipped with the power-on reset function. Also, since the internal circuit (flip-flop circuit) becomes
unstable at the rising edge of the power supply, the internal circuit is initialized as shown below by the first DTMF se-
quence received after the rising edge of the power supply. Therefore, input four dummy ACK pulses before the DTMF
reception.

(4) ESt output
The ESt guard time is determined by the CPU of the host
computer, but to reduce the load on the host computer,
the guard time can be set using an external circuit, as
shown below.
