      Figure 7 shows the classical protection circuit using the LCP22 crowbar concept. This
      topology has been developed to protect two-battery voltage SLICs. It allows both positive
      and negative firing thresholds to be programmed. The LCP22 has two gates (Gn and Gp).
      Gn is biased to negative battery voltage -Vbat, while Gp is biased to the positive battery
      voltage +Vb.
      When a negative surge occurs on one wire (L1 for example), a current IGn flows through the
      base of the transistor T1 and then injects a current in the gate of the thyristor Th1 which
      turns-on. All the surge current flows through the ground. After the surge, when the current
      flowing through Th1 becomes less negative than the negative holding current IH-, Th1
      switches off. This holding current IH- is temperature dependent as per Figure 4
      When a positive surge occurs on one wire (L1 for example), a current IGp flows through the
      base of the transistor T2 and then injects a current in the gate of the thyristor Th2 which
      fires. All the surge current flows through the ground. After the surge, when the current
      flowing through Th2 becomes less positive than the positive holding current IH+, Th2
      switches off. This holding current IH+, typically 20 mA at 25 °C, is temperature dependent
      and the same Figure 4 also applies.
      The capacitors Cn and Cp are used to speed up the crowbar structure firing during the fast
      rise or fall edges. This allows minimization of the dynamic breakover voltage at the SLIC TIP
      and RING inputs during fast surges. Please note that these capacitors are generally
      available around the SLIC. To be efficient they have to be as close as possible to the LCP22
      gate pins (Gn and Gp) and to the reference ground track (or plan). The optimized value for
      Cn and Cp is 220 nF.
      The series resistors Rs shown in Figure 7 represent the fuse resistors or the PTCs which
      are needed to withstand the power contact or the power induction tests imposed by the
      country standards. Taking this factor into account, the actual lightning surge current flowing
      through the LCP22 is equal to:
            I surge = Vsurge / (Rg + Rs)
      With
            V surge = peak surge voltage imposed by the standard.
            Rg = series resistor of the surge generator
            Rs = series resistor of the line card (e.g. PTC)

            For a line card with 50 Ω of series resistors which has to be qualified under GR-1089 1000 V
            10/1000 µs surge, the present current through the LCP22 is equal to:
                 I surge = 1000 / (10 + 50) = 17 A
            The LCP22 topology is particularly optimized for the new telecom applications such as fiber
            in the loop, WLL systems, and decentralized central office, for example.

            Figure 8 shows the classical protection topology for SLIC using both positive and negative
            battery voltages. With such a topology the SLIC is protected against surge over +Vb and
            lower than -Vbat. In this case, +Vb can be programmed up to +120 V while -Vbat can be
            programmed down to -120 V.
