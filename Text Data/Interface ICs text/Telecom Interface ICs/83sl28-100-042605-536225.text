SERIAL MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE
     NAME     PIN    TYPE                                      DESCRIPTION
       CS     89       I    Chip Select Input
                            Active low signal. This signal enables the serial microprocessor interface by
                            pulling chip select "Low". The serial interface is disabled when the chip select
                            signal returns "High".
     SCLK     90       I    Serial Clock Input
                            The serial clock input samples SDI on the rising edge and updates SDO on the
                            falling edge. See the Serial Microprocessor section of this datasheet for more
                            details.
       SDI    92       I    Serial Data Input
                            The serial data input pin is used to supply an address and data string to pro-
                            gram the internal registers within the device. See the Serial Microprocessor
                            section of this datasheet for more details.
      SDO     91      O     Serial Data Output
                            The serial data output pin is used to retrieve the internal contents of a selected
                            register in readback mode. See the Microprocessor section of this datasheet
                            for more details.
     Reset    28       I    Hardware Reset Input
                            Active low signal. When this pin is pulled "Low" for more than 10µS, all internal
                            registers and state machines are set to their default state.
                            NOTE: This pin must be pulled "High" to VDD for normal operation.
       INT    100     O     Interrupt Output
                            Active low signal. This signal is asserted "Low" when a change in alarm status
                            occurs. Once the status registers have been read, the interrupt pin will return
                            "High". GIE (Global Interrupt Enable) must be set "High" in the appropriate
                            global register to enable interrupt generation.
                            NOTE: This pin is an open-drain output that requires an external 10KΩ pull-up
                                     resistor.
   HW/Host    81       I    Hardware / Host Mode Select Input
                            This pin is used to select the mode of operation. By default, the LIU is config-
                            ured for Host mode. To select Hardware mode, this pin must be pulled "High".
                            NOTE: Internally pulled "Low" with a 50kΩ resistor.

    RCLK5      119            signal is absent, RCLK maintains its timing by using an internal master clock
    RCLK4     123             as its reference. RPOS/RNEG data can be updated on either edge of RCLK
                              selected by RCLKinv in the appropriate global register.

  RNEG/LCV5    117            mode, this pin is a Line Code Violation indicator. If a line code violation or a bi-
  RNEG/LCV4   121             polar violation occur, the LCV pin will pull "High" for a minimum of one RCLK
                              cycle. LCV will remain "High" until there are no more violations.

  1.0 RECEIVE PATH LINE INTERFACE
The receive path of the XRT83SL28 LIU consists of 8 independent E1 receivers. The following section
describes the complete receive path from RTIP/RRING inputs to RCLK/RPOS/RNEG outputs. A simplified
block diagram of the receive path is shown in Figure 4.

  1.1    Internal Termination
The input stage of the receive path accepts standard E1 coaxial cable or E1 twisted pair inputs through RTIP
and RRING. The physical interface is optimized by placing the terminating impedance inside the LIU. This
allows one bill of materials for all modes of operation reducing the number of external components necessary
in system design. The receive termination impedance is selected by programming TERSEL[1:0] to match the
line impedance. The XRT83SL28 has the ability to switch the internal termination to "High" impedance for
redundancy applications. See Redundancy in the Applications Section of this datasheet. Selecting the internal
impedance is shown in Table 1. A typical connection diagram is shown in Figure 5.

 1.2      Peak Detector/Data Slicer
In the receive path, the line signal is coupled into the RTIP and RRing pins via a 1:1 transformer and are
converted into digital pulses by an adaptive data slicer. Clock and data signals are recovered from the output of
the slicer with the help of a digital PLL that provides excellent jitter accommodation for high input jitter
tolerance.
 1.3      Clock and Data Recovery
The receive clock (RCLK) is recovered by the clock and data recovery circuitry. An internal PLL locks on the
incoming data stream and outputs a clock that’s in phase with the incoming signal. In the absence of an
incoming signal, RCLK maintains its timing by using MCLK as its reference. The recovered data can be
updated on either edge of RCLK. By default, data is updated on the rising edge of RCLK. To update data on
the falling edge of RCLK, set RCLKinv to "1" in the appropriate global register. Figure 6 is a timing diagram of
the receive data updated on the rising edge of RCLK. Figure 7 is a timing diagram of the receive data updated
on the falling edge of RCLK. The timing specifications are shown in Table 2.

 1.5      General Alarm Detection and Interrupt Generation
The receive path detects RLOS and AIS. These alarms can be individually masked to prevent the alarm from
triggering an interrupt. To enable interrupt generation, the Global Interrupt Enable (GIE) bit must be set "High"
in the appropriate global register. Any time a change in status occurs (if the alarms are enabled), the interrupt
pin will pull "Low" to indicate an alarm has occurred. Once the status registers have been read, the INT pin will
return "High". The status registers are Reset Upon Read (RUR).
NOTE: The interrupt pin is an Open-Drain output that requires a 10kΩ pull-up resistor.

 1.5.1      RLOS (Receiver Loss of Signal)
The XRT83SL28 supports both G.775 or ETSI-300-233 RLOS detection scheme.
In G.775 mode, RLOS is declared when the received signal is less than 320mV for 32 consecutive pulse
periods (typical). The device clears RLOS when the receive signal achieves 12.5% ones density with no more
than 15 consecutive zeros in a 32 bit sliding window and the signal level exceeds 550mV (typical).
In ETSI-300-233 mode the device declares RLOS when the input level drops below 320mV (typical) for more
than 2048 pulse periods (1msec). The device exits RLOS when the input signal exceeds 550mV (typical) and
has transitions for more than 32 pulse periods with 12.5% ones density with no more than 15 consecutive
zero’s in a 32 bit sliding window. ETSI-300-233 RLOSS detection method is only available in Host mode.
 1.5.2      AIS (Alarm Indication Signal)
The XRT83SL28 adheres to ITU-T G.775 or ETSI-300-233 specifications for an all ones pattern detection by
programming the appropriate channel register. The alarm indication signal is set to "1" if an all ones pattern is
detected. In G.775 mode, AIS is defined as 2 or less zeros in 2 consecutive double frame (512-bit window)
periods. AIS will clear when the incoming signal has 3 or more zeros in the same time period. In ETSI-300-233
mode, AIS is defined as less than 3 zeros in a 512-bit window. AIS detection scheme per ESTI-300-233 is only
available in Host mode.
 1.5.3      LCV (Line Code Violation Detection)
In HDB3 mode, the LCV pin will be set to "High" if the receiver detects excessive zero’s, bipolar violations or
HDB3 code violations. If the device is configured in AMI mode, any bipolar violations will cause the LCV pin to
go "High".
 1.6     Receive Jitter Attenuator
The jitter attenuator can be configured in the receive path to reduce phase and frequency jitter in the recovered
clock. The jitter attenuator uses a data FIFO (First In First Out) with a programmable depth of 32-bit or 64-bit. If
the LIU is used for line synchronization (loop timing systems), the JA should be enabled. When the Read and
Write pointers of the FIFO are within 2-Bits of over-flowing or under-flowing, the bandwidth of the jitter
attenuator is widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. When this condition
occurs, the jitter attenuator will not attenuate input jitter until the Read/Write pointer’s position is outside the 2-
Bit window. The bandwidth is set to 2Hz when the JA is configured in the Receive or Transmit path. The JA has
a typical clock delay equal to ½ of the FIFO bit depth.
NOTE: If the LIU is used in a multiplexer/mapper application where stuffing bits are typically removed, the JA can be
        configured in the transmit path to smooth out the gapped clock. See the Transmit Section of this datasheet.

 1.7     HDB3 Decoder
In single rail mode, RPOS is the output of decoded AMI or HDB3 signals and RNEG is the LCV output. HDB3
data is defined as any block of 4 successive zeros replaced with OOOV or BOOV, so that two successive V
pulses are of opposite polarity to acheive zero DC offsey. If the HDB3 decoder is selected, the receive path
removes the V and B pulses so that the original data is output to RPOS.
 1.8     ARAOS (Automatic Receive All Ones)
The XRT83SL28 has the ability to send an All Ones signal to RPOS if ARAOS is enabled in the appropriate
channel register. If ARAOS is enabled and an RLOS condition occurs, the Receiver outputs will generate a
single rail All Ones pattern. When RLOS clears, the All Ones pattern ends and the Receive path returns to
normal operation. For TAOS in the transmit direction, see the Transmit Section of this datasheet. A simplified
block diagram of the ATAOS function is shown in Figure 9.

 2.1     TCLK/TPOS/TNEG Digital Inputs
In dual rail mode, TPOS and TNEG are the digital inputs for the transmit path. In single rail mode, TNEG can
be tied to ground unless Hardware mode is selected (see the Hardware Pin Description). The XRT83SL28 can
be programmed to sample the inputs on either edge of TCLK. By default, data is sampled on the falling edge of
TCLK. To sample data on the rising edge of TCLK, set TCLKinv to "1" in the appropriate global register.
Figure 13 is a timing diagram of the transmit input data sampled on the falling edge of TCLK. Figure 14 is a
timing diagram of the transmit input data sampled on the rising edge of TCLK. The timing specifications are
shown in Table 3.

 2.2     HDB3 Encoder
In single rail mode, the LIU can encode the TPOS input signal to AMI or HDB3 data. If HDB3 encoding is
selected, any sequence with four or more consecutive zeros in the input will be replaced with 000V or B00V,
where "B" indicates a pulse conforming to the bipolar rule and "V" representing a pulse violating the rule. An
example of HDB3 encoding is shown in Table 4.

 2.3     Transmit Jitter Attenuator
The XRT83SL28 LIU is ideal for multiplexer or mapper applications where the network data crosses multiple
timing domains. As the higher data rates are de-multiplexed to E1 data, stuffing bits are typically removed
which can leave gaps in the incoming data stream. The JA can be configured in the transmit path with a 32-Bit
or 64-Bit FIFO that is used to smooth the gapped clock into a steady E1 output. The maximum gap width the
JA in the Transmit path can tolerate is shown in Table 5.

NOTE: If the LIU is used in a loop timing system, the JA should be configured in the receive path. See the Receive Section
        of this datasheet.

 2.4     TAOS (Transmit All Ones)
The XRT83SL28 has the ability to transmit all ones on a per channel basis by programming the appropriate
channel register. If TAOS is enabled, the Transmitter outputs will generate an All Ones pattern regardless of
the Transmit Input data. The Remote Loop Back mode has priority over TAOS. Figure 15 is a diagram showing
the all ones signal at TTIP and TRING.

         TAOS
 2.5     ATAOS (Automatic Transmit All Ones)
Unlike TAOS, ATAOS is used to generate an All Ones signal only when an RLOS condition occurs. If ATAOS is
enabled, any channel that experiences an RLOS condition will automatically cause the transmitter on that
channel to send an all ones pattern to the line. When RLOS clears, the All Ones pattern ends and the Transmit
path returns to normal operation. For TAOS on the receive output pins, see ARAOS in the Receive Section of
this datasheet. A simplified block diagram of the ATAOS function is shown in Figure 16.

 2.6     Transmitter Power down in Hardware mode
In Hardware mode, if TCLK is pulled "Low" for 16 MCLK cycles the transmitter outputs at TTIP/TRING are tri-
stated. If TCLK is pulled "High" for 16 MCLK cycles the transmitter will send an All Ones signal to the line,
using MCLK as reference.
 2.7     DMO (Driver Monitor Output)
The driver monitor circuit is used to detect transmit driver failures by monitoring the activities at TTIP/TRING
outputs. Driver failure may be caused by a short circuit in the primary transformer or system problems at the
transmit inputs. If the transmitter of a channel has no output for more than 128 TCLK cycles, DMO goes "High"
until a valid transmit pulse is detected. If the DMO interrupt is enabled, the change in status of DMO will cause
the interrupt pin to go "Low". Once the status register is read, the interrupt pin will return "High" and the status
register will be reset (RUR).

 2.8     Line Termination (TTIP/TRING)
The output stage of the transmit path generates standard bipolar signals to the line for both E1 (75 Ohm)
coaxial cable and E1 (120 Ohm) twisted pair. The XRT83L28 has built-in output impedance matching for both
75 Ohm and 120 Ohm operations. This eliminates the need to change any external components while
switching from 75 Ohm to 120 Ohm operation. The transmitter interface only requires one 0.68µF DC blocking
capacitor with a 1:2 transformer as shown in Figure 17.

This applications section describes common E1 system considerations along with references to application
notes available for reference where applicable.
 3.1    Loopback Diagnostics
The XRT83SL28 supports several loopback modes for diagnostic testing. The following section describes the
local analog loopback, remote loopback, and digital loopback.
  3.1.1    Local Analog Loopback
With local analog loopback activated, the transmit output data at TTIP/TRING is internally looped back to the
analog inputs at RTIP/RRING. External inputs at RTIP/RRING are ignored while valid transmit output data
continues to be sent to the line. A simplified block diagram of local analog loopback is shown in Figure 18.

NOTE: TAOS takes priority over the transmit input data at TPOS/TNEG.
  3.1.2    Remote Loopback
With remote loopback activated, the receive input data at RTIP/RRING is internally looped back to the transmit
output data at TTIP/TRING. The transmit input data at TCLK/TPOS/TNEG are ignored while valid receive
output data continues to be sent to the system. A simplified block diagram of remote loopback is shown in
Figure 19.

With digital loopback activated, the transmit input data at TCLK/TPOS/TNEG is looped back to the receive

 3.2      Line Card Redundancy
Telecommunication system design requires signal integrity and reliability. When an E1 primary line card has a
failure, it must be swapped with a backup line card while maintaining connectivity to a backplane without losing
data. System designers can achieve this by implementing common redundancy schemes with the
XRT83SL28 LIU. EXAR offers features that are tailored to redundancy applications while reducing the number
of components and providing system designers with solid reference designs.
RLOS and DMO
If an RLOS or DMO condition occurs, the XRT83SL28 reports the alarm to the individual status registers on a
per channel basis. However, for redundancy applications, RLOS and DMO pins can be used to initiate an
automatic switch to the back up card.
Typical Redundancy Schemes
• 1:1 One backup card for every primary card (Facility Protection)
• 1+1 One backup card for every primary card (Line Protection)
• ·N+1 One backup card for N primary cards
  3.2.1      1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy Without Relays
The 1:1 facility protection and 1+1 line protection have one backup card for every primary card. When using
1:1 or 1+1 redundancy, the backup card has its transmitters tri-stated and its receivers in high impedance. This
eliminates the need for external relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
For 1+1 line protection, the receiver inputs on the backup card have the ability to monitor the line for bit errors
while in high impedance. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
  3.2.2      Transmit Interface with 1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy
The transmitters on the backup card should be tri-stated. Select the appropriate impedance for the desired
mode of operation, E1 75Ω or 120Ω. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for blocking DC bias. See
Figure 21. for a simplified block diagram of the transmit section for a 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy.

  3.2.3     Receive Interface with 1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy
The receivers on the backup card should be programmed for "High" impedance. Since there is no external
resistor in the circuit, the receivers on the backup card will not load down the line interface. This key design
feature eliminates the need for relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
Select the impedance for the desired mode of operation, E1 75Ω or 120Ω. To swap the primary card, set the
backup card to internal impedance, then the primary card to "High" impedance. See Figure 22. for a simplified
block diagram of the receive section for a 1:1 redundancy scheme.

  3.2.4     N+1 Redundancy Using External Relays
N+1 redundancy has one backup card for N primary cards. Due to impedance mismatch and signal
contention, external relays are necessary when using this redundancy scheme. The relays create complete
isolation between the primary cards and the backup card. This allows all transmitters and receivers on the
primary cards to be configured in internal impedance, providing one bill of materials for all interface modes of
operation. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.

  3.2.5    Transmit Interface with N+1 Redundancy
For N+1 redundancy, the transmitters on all cards can be programmed for internal impedance. The
transmitters on the backup card do not have to be tri-stated. To swap the primary card, close the desired
relays. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for blocking DC bias. See Figure 23 for a simplified
block diagram of the transmit section for an N+1 redundancy scheme.

 3.3     Power Failure Protection
For 1:1 or 1+1 line card redundancy in E1 applications, power failure could cause a line card to change the
characteristics of the line impedance, causing a degradation in system performance. The XRT83SL28 is
designed to ensure reliability during power failures. The LIU has patented high impedance circuits that allow
the receiver inputs and the transmitter outputs to be in "High" impedance when the LIU experiences a power
failure or when the LIU is powered off.
NOTE: For power failure protection, a transformer must be used to couple to the line interface. See the TAN-56 application
        note for more details.
 3.4     Overvoltage and Overcurrent Protection
Physical layer devices such as LIUs that interface to telecommunications lines are exposed to overvoltage
transients posed by environmental threats. An Overvoltage transient is a pulse of energy concentrated over a
small period of time, usually under a few milliseconds. These pulses are random and exceed the operating
conditions of CMOS transceiver ICs. Electronic equipment connecting to data lines are susceptible to many
forms of overvoltage transients such as lightning, AC power faults and electrostatic discharge (ESD). There
are three important standards when designing a telecommunications system to withstand overvoltage
transients.
• UL1950 and FCC Part 68
• Telcordia (Bellcore) GR-1089
• ITU-T K.20, K.21 and K.41
NOTE: For a reference design and performance, see the TAN-54 application note for more details.
 3.5     Non-Intrusive Monitoring
In non-intrusive monitoring applications, the transmitters are shut off by setting TxON "Low". The receivers
must be actively receiving data without interfering with the line impedance. The XRT83SL28’s internal
termination ensures that the line termination meets E1 specifications for 75Ω or 120Ω while monitoring the data
stream. System integrity is maintained by placing the non-intrusive receiver in "High" impedance, equivalent to
that of a 1+1 redundancy application. A simplified block diagram of non-intrusive monitoring is shown in
Figure 25.

 4.0 SERIAL MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE BLOCK
The serial microprocessor uses a standard 3-pin serial port with CS, SCLK, and SDI for programming the LIU.
Optional pins such as SDO, INT, and RESET allow the ability to read back contents of the registers, monitor
the LIU via an interrupt pin, and reset the LIU to its default configuration by pulling reset "Low" for more than
10µS. A simplified block diagram of the Serial Microprocessor is shown in Figure 26.

 4.1     Serial Timing Information
The serial port requires 16 bits of data applied to the SDI (Serial Data Input) pin. The Serial Microprocessor
samples SDI on the rising edge of SCLK (Serial Clock Input). The data is not latched into the device until all 16
bits of serial data have been sampled. A timing diagram of the Serial Microprocessor is shown in Figure 27.

 4.2     16-Bit Serial Data Input Description
The serial data input is sampled on the rising edge of SCLK. In read-back mode, the serial data output is
updated on the falling edge of SCLK. The serial data must be applied to the LIU LSB first. The 16 bits of serial
data are described below.
  4.2.1     R/W (SCLK1)
The first serial bit applied to the LIU informs the microprocessor that a Read or Write operation is desired. If the
R/W bit is set to “0”, the microprocessor is configured for a Write operation. If the R/W bit is set to “1”, the
microprocessor is configured for a Read operation.
  4.2.2     A[5:0] (SCLK2 - SCLK7)
The next 6 SCLK cycles are used to provide the address to which a Read or Write operation will occur. A0
(LSB) must be sent to the LIU first followed by A1 and so forth until all 6 address bits have been sampled by
SCLK.
  4.2.3     X (Dummy Bit SCLK8)
The dummy bit sampled by SCLK8 is used to allow sufficient time for the serial data output pin to update data
if the read-back mode is selected by setting R/W = “1”. Therefore, the state of this bit is ignored and can hold
either “0” or “1” during both Read and Write operations.
  4.2.4     D[7:0] (SCLK9 - SCLK16)
The next 8 SCLK cycles are used to provide the data to be written into the internal register chosen by the
address bits. D0 (LSB) must be sent to the LIU first followed by D1 and so forth until all 8 data bits have been
sampled by SCLK. Once 16 SCLK cycles have been complete, the LIU holds the data until CS is pulled “High”
whereby, the serial microprocessor latches the data into the selected internal register.
 4.3     8-Bit Serial Data Output Description
The serial data output is updated on the falling edge of SCLK9 - SCLK16 if R/W is set to “1”. D0 (LSB) is
provided on SCLK9 to the SDO pin first followed by D1 and so forth until all 8 data bits have been updated. The
SDO pin allows the user to read the contents stored in individual registers by providing the desired address on
the SDI pin during the Read cycle.
