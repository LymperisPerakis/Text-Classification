 Notes:
     1. See Figure 26 on page 37.
     2. Measured at TIP and RING with 600  termination at 1 kHz, as shown in Figure 1.
     3. With FULL = 1, the transmit and receive full scale level of +3.2 dBm can be achieved with a 600  ac termination, while
         the transmit and receive level in dBm varies with reference impedance, the DAA will transmit and receive 1 dBV into all
         reference impedances in “FULL” mode. With FULL2 = 1, the transmit and receive full scale level of +6.0 dBm can be
         achieved with a 600  ac termination. In “FULL2” mode, the DAA will transmit and receive +1.5 dBV into all reference
         impedances.
     4. Receive full scale level produces –0.9 dBFS at SDO.
     5. DR = 20 x log (RMS VFS/RMS VIN).+ 20 x log (RMS VIN/RMS noise). The RMS noise measurement excludes
         harmonics. VFS is the 0 dBm full-scale level.
     6. Measurement is 300 to 3400 Hz. Applies to both transmit and receive paths. VIN = 1 kHz, –3 dBFS, Fs = 10300 Hz.
     7. When using the Si3010 line-side, the typical DR values will be approximately 10 dB lower.
     8. THD = 20 x log (RMS distortion/RMS signal). VIN = 1 kHz, –3 dBFS, Fs = 10300 Hz.
     9. When using the Si3010 line-side, the typical THD values will be approximately 10 dB higher.
     10. DRCID = 20 x log (RMS VCID/RMS VIN) + 20 x log(RMS VIN/RMS noise). VCID is the 6 V full-scale level for the typical
         application circuit in Figure 17. With the enhanced CID circuit, the VCID full-scale level is 1.5 V peak, and DRCID
         increases to 62 dB.

 Notes:
     1. See Figure 26 on page 37.
     2. Measured at TIP and RING with 600  termination at 1 kHz, as shown in Figure 1.
     3. With FULL = 1, the transmit and receive full scale level of +3.2 dBm can be achieved with a 600  ac termination, while
         the transmit and receive level in dBm varies with reference impedance, the DAA will transmit and receive 1 dBV into all
         reference impedances in “FULL” mode. With FULL2 = 1, the transmit and receive full scale level of +6.0 dBm can be
         achieved with a 600  ac termination. In “FULL2” mode, the DAA will transmit and receive +1.5 dBV into all reference
         impedances.
     4. Receive full scale level produces –0.9 dBFS at SDO.
     5. DR = 20 x log (RMS VFS/RMS VIN).+ 20 x log (RMS VIN/RMS noise). The RMS noise measurement excludes
         harmonics. VFS is the 0 dBm full-scale level.
     6. Measurement is 300 to 3400 Hz. Applies to both transmit and receive paths. VIN = 1 kHz, –3 dBFS, Fs = 10300 Hz.
     7. When using the Si3010 line-side, the typical DR values will be approximately 10 dB lower.
     8. THD = 20 x log (RMS distortion/RMS signal). VIN = 1 kHz, –3 dBFS, Fs = 10300 Hz.
     9. When using the Si3010 line-side, the typical THD values will be approximately 10 dB higher.
     10. DRCID = 20 x log (RMS VCID/RMS VIN) + 20 x log(RMS VIN/RMS noise). VCID is the 6 V full-scale level for the typical
         application circuit in Figure 17. With the enhanced CID circuit, the VCID full-scale level is 1.5 V peak, and DRCID
         increases to 62 dB.

 Notes:
     1. All timing (except Rise and Fall time) is referenced to the 50% level of the waveform. Input test levels are
         VIH = VD – 0.4 V, VIL = 0.4 V. Rise and fall times are referenced to the 20% and 80% levels of the waveform.
     2. The minimum RESET pulse width is the greater of 250 ns or 10 MCLK cycle times.
     3. M0 and M are typically connected to VD or GND and should not be changed during normal operation.

Notes:
   1. Value for C3 above is recommended for use with the Si3018. In voice appliations, a C3 value of 3.9 nF (250 V, X7R,
       20%) is recommended to improve return loss performance.
   2. C30-31 and R30-33 can be substitued for R7-8 to implent the enhanced caller ID circuit.
   3. Several diode configurations are acceptable, with the main requirement being VRRM > 350 and IF > 225 mA, e.g., part
       number HD04-T in a MiniDIP package by Diodes, Inc., two MMBD3004S-7-F diode pairs by Diodes, Inc. in an SOT-23
       package, or four 1N4004 diodes.
   4. Murata BLM18AG601SN1B may be substituted for R15-R16 (0 ) to decrease emissions.

Registers 20 and 21 allow the receive and transmit paths to be attenuated linearly. When these registers are set to
all 0s, the receive and transmit paths are muted. These registers affect the call progress output only and do not
affect transmit and receive operations on the telephone line.
The PWMM[1:0] bits (Register 1, bits 5:4) select one of the three different PWM output modes for the AOUT signal,
including a delta-sigma data stream, a conventional 32 kHz return to zero PWM output, and balanced 32 kHz PWM
output.

  Notes:
      1. The off-hook counter and calibrations prevent transmission or reception of data for 402.75 ms (default) for the line
          voltage to settle.
      2. The caller alert signal (CAS) tone transmits from the CO to signal an incoming call.
      3. The device is taken on-hook to read the line voltage in the LVS bits to detect parallel handsets. In this mode, no data
          is transmitted on the SDO pin.
      4. When the device returns off-hook, the normal off-hook counter is reduced to 8 ms. If the CALD and RCALD bits are
          set, then the automatic calibrations are not performed.
      5. After allowing the off-hook counter to expire (8 ms), normal transmission and reception can continue. If CID data
          reception is required, send the appropriate signal to the CO at this time.
      6. This example uses the OH bit to put the Si3056 into an off-hook state. The OFHK pin can also be used to accomplish
          this. To use the OFHK pin instead of the OH bit, simply enable the OHE bit (Register 5, bit 1) and drive the OFHK pin
          low during the preceding sequence. This has the same effect as setting the OH bit.

  0         SB      Serial Digital Interface Mode.
                    0 = Operation is in 15-bit mode, and the LSB of the data field indicates that a secondary
                    frame is required.
                    1 = The serial port is operating in 16-bit mode and requires a secondary frame sync signal,
                    FC, to initiate control data reads/writes.

                     an on-hook state. A write of a DAA register restarts the watchdog timer counter. If the
                     watchdog timer times out, the OH and OHE bits are cleared, placing the DAA into an on-hook
                     state. Setting the OH bit or setting the OHE bit and asserting the OFHK pin places the DAA

  7     RDTI    Ring Detect Interrupt.
                0 = A ring signal is not occurring.
                1 = A ring signal is detected. If the RDTM (Register 3) and INTE (Register 2) bits are set a hard-
                ware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to a 0 to be cleared. The RDI
                bit (Register 2) determines if this bit is set only at the beginning of a ring pulse, or at the end of a
                ring pulse as well. This bit should be cleared after clearing the PDL bit (Register 6) because pow-
                ering up the line-side device may cause this interrupt to be triggered.
  6     ROVI    Receive Overload Interrupt.
                0 = An excessive input level on the receive pin is not occurring.
                1 = An excessive input level on the receive pin is detected. If the ROVM and INTE bits are set a
                hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to 0 to clear it. This bit is
                identical in function to the ROV bit (Register 17). Clearing this bit also clears the ROV bit.
  5     FDTI    Frame Detect Interrupt.
                0 = Frame detect is established on the communications link.
                1 = This bit is set when the communications link does not have frame lock. If the FDTM and INTE
                bits are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. Once set, this bit must be written
                to a 0 to be cleared.
  4     BTDI    Billing Tone Detect Interrupt.
                0 = A billing tone has not occurred.
                1 = A billing tone has been detected. If the BTDM and INTE bits are set, a hardware interrupt
                occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to 0 to clear it.
  3     DODI    Drop Out Detect Interrupt.
                0 = The line-side power supply has not collapsed.
                1 = The line-side power supply has collapsed (The DOD bit in Register 19 has fired). If the
                DODM and INTE bits are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be
                written to 0 to be cleared. This bit should be cleared after clearing the PDL bit (Register 6)
                because powering as the line-side device can cause this interrupt to be triggered.
  2    LCSOI    Loop Current Sense Overload Interrupt.
                0 = The LCS bits have not reached max value (all ones).
                1 = The LCS bits have reached max value. If the LCSOM bit (Register 3) and the INTE bit are
                set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the AOUT/INT pin. This bit must be written to 0 to be cleared.
                LCSOI does not necessarily imply that an overcurrent situation has occurred. An overcurrent sit-
                uation in the DAA is determined by the status of the OPD bit (Register 19). After the LCSOI inter-
                rupt fires, the OPD bit should be checked to determine if an overcurrent situation exists.

                0 = The LCS bits have not changed value.

                must be written to a 0 to be cleared.
  0     POLI    Polarity Reversal Detect Interrupt.
                0 = Bit 7 of the LVS register does not change states.
                1 = Bit 7 of the LVS register changes from a 0 to a 1, or from a 1 to a 0, indicating the polarity of
                TIP and RING is switched. If the POLM and INTE bits are set, a hardware interrupt occurs on the
                AOUT/INT pin. To clear the interrupt, write this bit to 0.

                    as when the line is disconnected, this bit is set to 1. Additionally, when on-hook and the line-
                    side device is enabled, this bit is set to 1.

 5:0      RMX[5:0]    Ring Assertion Maximum Count.
                      These bits set the maximum ring frequency for a valid ring signal within a 10% margin of
                      error. During ring qualification, a timer is loaded with the RAS[5:0] field upon a TIP/RING
                      event and decrements at a regular rate. When a subsequent TIP/RING event occurs, the
                      timer value is compared to the RMX[5:0] field and if it exceeds the value in RMX[5:0] then
                      the frequency of the ring is too high and the ring is invalidated. The difference between
                      RAS[5:0] and RMX[5:0] identifies the minimum duration between TIP/RING events to qual-
                      ify as a ring, in binary-coded increments of 2.0 ms (nominal). A TIP/RING event typically
                      occurs twice per ring tone period. At 20 Hz, TIP/RING events would occur every 1/
                      (2 x 20 Hz) = 25 ms. To calculate the correct RMX[5:0] value for a frequency range [f_min,
                      f_max], the following equation should be used:
                                                                                             1

                      To compensate for error margin and ensure a sufficient ring detection window, it is recom-
                      mended that the calculated value of RMX[5:0] be incremented by 1.

                    Eight-bit value returning the loop voltage. Each bit represents 1 V of loop voltage. This regis-
                    ter operates in on-hook and off-hook modes. Bit seven of this register indicates the polarity of
                    the TIP/RING voltage. When this bit changes state, it indicates that a polarity reversal has
                    occurred. The value returned is represented in 2s compliment format.

                    near-end echo. This register represents the eighth tap in the 8-tap filter. When this register is
                    set to all 0s, this filter stage does not effect on the hybrid response. See "5.13.Transhybrid
                    Balance" on page 29 for more information on selecting coefficients for the programmable
                    hybrid.

APPENDIX—UL1950 3RD EDITION
Although designs using the Si3056 comply with the UL1950 3rd edition and pass all overcurrent and overvoltage
tests, there are still several issues to consider.
Figure 38 shows two designs that can pass the UL1950 overvoltage tests and electromagnetic emissions. The top
schematic shows the configuration in which the ferrite beads (FB1 and FB2) are on the unprotected side of the
sidactor (RV1). For this configuration, the current rating of the ferrite beads needs to be 6 A. However, the higher
current ferrite beads are less effective in reducing electromagnetic emissions.
The bottom schematic of Figure 38 shows the configuration in which the ferrite beads (FB1 and FB2) are on the
protected side of the sidactor (RV1). For this design, the ferrite beads can be rated at 200 mA.
In a cost-optimized design, compliance to UL1950 does not always require overvoltage tests. Plan ahead to know
which overvoltage tests apply to the system. System-level elements in the construction, such as fire enclosure and
spacing requirements, need to be considered during the design stages. Consult with a professional testing agency
during the design of the product to determine which tests apply to the system.
