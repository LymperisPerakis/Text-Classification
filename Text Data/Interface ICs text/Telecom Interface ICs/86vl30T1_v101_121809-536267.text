                                                This bit is used to force a Line Code Violation (LCV) on the transmit

                                                A “0” to “1” transition on this bit will cause a single LCV to be inserted

                                                This bit is used to program the individual channel to operate in either
                                                T1 or E1 mode.
                                                0 = Configures the selected channel to operate in E1 mode.

                                                synchronize its “transmit output” frame alignment with the 8kHz signal
                                                that is derived from the MCLK PLL, as described below.
                                                0 - Disables the “Sync all Transmit Framers to 8kHz” feature.
                                                1 - Enables the “Sync all Transmit Framers to 8kHz” feature.
                                                NOTE: This bit is only active if the MCLK PLL is used as the “Timing

                                           This bit is used to configure the device in J1 mode. Once the device
                                           is configured in J1 mode, the following two changes will happen:
                                               1. CRC calculation is done in J1 format. The J1 CRC6 calcula-
                                                   tion is based on the actual values of all 4632 bits in a T1 multi-
                                                   frame including Fe bits instead of assuming all Fe bits to be a
                                                   one in T1 format.

                                                   preted per the J1 standard. (J1-SF or J1-ESF)
                                           0 - Configures the device in T1 mode. (Default)
                                           1 - Configures the device in J1 mode.
                                           NOTE: Users can select between J1-SF or J1-ESF by setting this bit

       One Second                  This bit is used to enforce the one-second yellow alarm rule according to the yel-
       Rule                        low alarm (RAI) transmission duration per the ANSI standards.
                                   If the one second alarm rule is enforced, the following will happen:
                                       1. RAI will be transmitted for at least one second for both ESF and SF.
                                       2. There must be a minimum of one second delay between termination
                                           of the first RAI and the initiation of a subsequent RAI.
                                       3. ALARM_ENB bit (see description of bit 6 of this register) controls the
                                           duration of RAI.
                                       4. YEL[0] & YEL[1] (see description of bits 5-4 of this register) controls the
                                           format of RAI.
                                   If the one second alarm rule is NOT enforced, the following will happen:
                                       1. RAI will be transmitted for at least one second for ESF and SF.
                                       2. Minimum one second delay between termination of the first RAI and the
                                           initiation of the subsequent RAI is NOT enforced.
                                       3. YEL[0] and YEL[1] bits (see description of bits 5-4 of this register) are used
                                           to control the duration AND the format of RAI transmission.
                                   0 - The one-second yellow alarm rule is NOT enforced.
                                   1 - The one-second yellow alarm rule is enforced.
                                   NOTE: When setting this bit to ‘0’, yellow alarm transmission will be backward
                                             compatible with the XRT86L38 device. XRT86L38 does not support the
                                             one-second yellow alarm rule.

                                   This bit is used to control the duration of yellow alarm (RAI) when the one-second
                                   yellow alarm rule is enforced (bit 7 of this register set to’1’).
                                   When the one-second yellow alarm rule is not enforced (bit 7 of this register set
                                   to’0’), the duration of the RAI is controlled by the YEL[0] and YEL[1] bits (bits 5-4
                                   of this register).
                                   If the one-second alarm rule is enforced:
                                   0 - Stop the transmission of yellow alarm (see description of bits 5-4).
                                   1 - Start the transmission of yellow alarm (see description of bits 5-4).
                                   NOTE: This bit has no function if the one second alarm rule is not enforced.

                                          (TxSYNC) as the transmit multi-frame boundary (TxMSYNC) in high
                                          speed or multiplexed modes. In 1.544MHz clock mode (base rate),
                                          the TxMSYNC is used as the transmit superframe boundary, in other
                                          clock modes (i.e. high speed or multiplexed modes), TxMSYNC is
                                          used as an input transmit clock for the backplane interface.
                                          0 = Configures the TxSYNC as a single frame boundary.

                                   either “Slip-Buffer” Mode, or as a “FIFO”, as depicted below.
                                   0 - Configures the Transmit Slip Buffer to function as a “Slip-Buffer”.
                                   1 - Configures the Transmit Slip Buffer to function as a “FIFO”.
                                   NOTE: Transmit slip buffer is only used in high-speed or multiplexed mode

                                         This bit enables the transmit DMA_0 (Write) interface. After a transmit
                                         DMA is enabled, DMA transfers are only requested when the transmit

                                         or cell.
                                         The DMA write channel is used by the external DMA controller to
                                         transfer data from the external memory to the HDLC buffers within the
                                         T1 Framer. The DMA Write cycle starts by T1 Framer asserting the
                                         DMA Request (REQ0) ‘low’, then the external DMA controller should
                                         drive the DMA Acknowledge (ACK0) ‘low’ to indicate that it is ready to
                                         start the transfer. The external DMA controller should place new data
                                         on the Microprocessor data bus each time the Write Signal is Strobed
                                         low if the WR is configured as a Write Strobe. If WR is configured as a
                                         direction signal, then the external DMA controller would place new
                                         data on the Microprocessor data bus each time the Read Signal (RD)
                                         is Strobed low.

                                        The DMA read channel is used by the T1 Framer to transfer data from

                                   ured appropriately.
                                   RxChn[1] becomes the Receive Fractional Data Output pin (RxFrTD_n) for
                                   fractional data output. Fractional data can now be output to the RxFrTD pin if

                                   RxChn[2] outputs the serial channel number
                                   RxChn[3] outputs an 8kHz clock signal.
                                   RxCHN[4] outputs the received recovered clock signal (1.544MHz for T1)

                                   This bit enables or disables the multiplexed mode on the receive side. When
                                   multiplexed mode is enable, data of four channels from the line side are multi-

                                   back-plane interface on RxSER. The backplane speed will become either
                                   12.352MHz or 16.384MHz once multiplexed mode is enabled.
                                   0 = Disables the multiplexed mode.

                                         This bit is used to insert a single BERT error to the transmit or
                                         receive output depending on whether BERT switch function is
                                         enabled or not. (bit 3 in register 0x0121).
                                         If the BERT Switch function is disabled, T1 transmit framer will insert
                                         a single BERT error and output to the line interface if this bit is
                                         enabled.
                                         If the BERT Switch function is enabled, T1 receive framer will insert
                                         a single BERT error and output to the receive back plane interface if
                                         this bit is enabled.
                                         A ‘0’ to ‘1’ transition will cause one output bit inverted in the BERT
                                         stream.

                                         BERT switch function is enabled or not. (bit 3 in register 0x0121).
                                         If the BERT Switch function is disabled and if this bit is enabled, T1
                                         transmit framer will invert the BERT data before it outputs to the line
                                         interface, and the T1 receive framer will invert the incoming BERT
                                         data before it receives it.
                                         If the BERT Switch function and this bit are both enabled, T1 receive
                                         framer will invert the BERT data before it outputs to the line inter-
                                         face, and the T1 transmit framer will invert the incoming BERT data
                                         before it receives it.
                                         0 - Transmit and Receive Framer will NOT invert the Transmit and
                                         Receive BERT data.
                                         1 - Transmit and Receive Framer will invert the Transmit and
                                         Receive BERT data.

                                    This bit configures the Transmit HDLC Controller Block #3 to unconditionally
                                    transmit a repeating string of Flag Sequence octets (0X7E) in the data link
                                    channel to the Remote terminal. In normal conditions, the Transmit HDLC
                                    Controller block will repeatedly transmit the Flag Sequence octet whenever
                                    there is no MOS message to transmit to the remote terminal equipment.
                                    However, if the user invokes this “Transmit Idle Sequence” feature, then the
                                    Transmit HDLC Controller block will UNCONDITIONALLY transmit a repeat-
                                    ing stream of the Flag Sequence octet (thereby overwriting all outbound
                                    MOS data-link messages).
                                    0 - Configures the Transmit HDLC Controller Block # 3 to transmit data-link

                                    1 - Configures the Transmit HDLC Controller block # 3 to transmit a repeat-
                                    ing string of Flag Sequence Octets (0x7E).
                                    NOTE: This bit is ignored if the Transmit HDLC3 controller is operating in the
                                              BOS Mode - bit 0 (MOS/BOS) within this register is set to 0.

                                    to compute and append FCS octets to the “back-end” of each outbound
                                    MOS data-link message.
                                    0 - Configures the Transmit HDLC Controller block # 3 to NOT compute and
                                    append the FCS octets to the back-end of each outbound MOS data-link

                                    NOTE:      This bit is ignored if the transmit HDLC3 controller has been
                                              configured to operate in the BOS mode - bit 0 (MOS/BOS) within this

       BUFSel                             This bit has different functions, depending upon whether the user is
                                          writing to or reading from this register, as depicted below.
                                          If the user is writing data into this register bit:
                                          0 - Configures the Transmit HDLC3 Controller to read out and trans-

                                          Data Link channel to the remote terminal equipment.
                                          If the user is reading data from this register bit:
                                          0 - Indicates that “Transmit HDLC3 Buffer # 0" is the next available
                                          buffer. In this case, if the user wishes to write in the contents of a

 1.2     T1 BOC Receiver
If enabled, the T1 BOC receiver will monitor the FDL bits for SSM messages with various features being
supported. Some of these features are Change of Status Alarm, 3 independent pre-set codes for matching
validation (each having its own alarm), filter settings for consecutive pattern qualification, and many more.
NOTE: If the receive BOC is enabled. the part will still report BOS and MOS messages as described in the register
        descriptions.
 1.3     T1 BOC Transmitter
The T1 BOC transmitter will automatically insert an SSM message in the correct FDL bit positions if enabled.
Once the message is stored in the TFDL register, Bit 0=1 sends the message, automatically followed by the
Abort Sequence.

BITS [6:5] - Receive Match Filter Bits
    These bits are used to set the number of consecutive error free patterns that must be received before the receive Match
    Event is set. This filter can be set to any message, not just a Valid SSM message. This filter does NOT apply to the
    RFDL valid message or alarm indication. The RFDL alarm and valid register have their own filter. See BITS [2:1] of this
    register.

BIT 4 - Receive BOC Enable
    This bit is used to enable the BOC receiver. If this bit is set to "0", only standard BOS messages will be processed by
    the HDLC controller. For clarification, BOC messages can only be processed through the FDL bits.
    } 0 - Disabled

BIT 3 - BOC Reset
    This bit is used to reset the receive BOC controller. The function of this bit is to reset all the BOC register values to their
    default values, except the BOC Interrupt registers. This register bit is automatically set back to ’0’ so that the user only
    needs to write ’1’ to send a subsequent reset.
    } 1 - Reset BOC
BITS [2:1] - Receive BOC Filter Bits
    These bits are used to set the number of consecutive error free patterns that must be received before the receive BOC
    alarm indication is set and the RFDL Valid Register is updated. This filter does NOT apply to the RFDL Matching Event
    registers. The 3 RFDL Matching Event Registers have a separate filter that applies equally to all three matching
    registers. Therefore, there are a total of 2 filters.

                                           Writing a “0” to this register bit will disable the T1 Framer Block for
                                           interrupt generation, then all T1 Framer interrupts will be disabled
                                           for interrupt generation.

                                           The Remote Loop-Back condition is removed only when the
                                           XRT86VL30 receives the Loop-Down code for more than 5 seconds

                                           chrnonous waveform as described in Section 13 of ITU-T G.703,
                                           except with frequency equal to 1.544MHz. This register bit takes pri-
                                           ority over every other LIU setting on the transmit path.

                                           When this bit is set to ’1’, the CDR block of the receiver is configured
                                           to accept a waveform as described in Section 13 of ITU-T G.703
                                           except with frequency equal to 1.544MHz.

                                           NOTE:     1. For the RxSync(Sect 13) mode, bit 1 in this register
                                                    (0xFE1) must be set to ’1’ to enable ExLOS. This only
                                                    applies to the receiver.
                                           NOTE: 2. If RLOS is required to meet G.775 in this mode (and not
                                                    ExLOS), then the CLOS[5:0] bits in Register 0x0F07 can be
                                                    used. See Register 0x0F07 for more details.

                                           This bit permits the user to configure the Receive T1 Block to auto-
                                           matically pull its Recovered Data Output pins to GND anytime (and
                                           for the duration that) the Receive T1 LIU Block declares the LOS
                                           defect condition.
                                           In other words, if this feature is enabled, the Receive T1 LIU Block
                                           will automatically “mute” the Recovered data that is being routed to
                                           the Receive T1 Framer block anytime (and for the duration that) the
                                           Receive T1 LIU Block declares the LOS defect condition.
                                           0 – Disables the “Muting upon LOS” feature.
                                           1 – Enables the “Muting upon LOS” feature.
                                           NOTE: The receive clock is not muted when this feature is enabled.

                                           When Extended LOS is enabled, the Receive T1 LIU Block will
