XRT83VSH316
16-Channel T1/E1/J1 Short-Haul Line Interface Unit
Ideal for Cost-Sensitive Transport Applications Including
Multi-service Provisioning Platforms and Routers
T      he XRT83VSH316 is a fully integrated 16-channel short-
       haul line interface unit (LIU) that operates from a 1.8V Inner
Core and 3.3V I/O power supplies. Using internal termination, the
LIU provides one bill of materials to operate in T1, E1, or J1 mode
independently on a per channel basis with minimum external com-
ponents. The LIU features are programmed through a standard par-
allel microprocessor interface or SPI (Serial Mode). EXAR’s LIU
has patented high impedance circuits that allow the transmitter out-
puts and receiver inputs to be high impedance when experiencing a
power failure or when the LIU is powered off. Key design features
within the LIU optimize 1:1 or 1+1 redundancy and non-intrusive
