and Figure 5&Figure 6 (COAX).
    After the high resistance bridging circuit, the signal arriving at RTIP/
RRING of the monitoring link is dramatically attenuated. To compensate
this bridge resistive attenuation, Monitor Gain can be used to boost the
signal by 22 dB, as selected by the MG[1:0] bits (b1~0, T1/J1-02AH).
For normal operation, the Monitor Gain should be set to 0 dB, i.e., the
Monitor Gain of the monitored link should be 0 dB.
    The monitoring link can be configured to any of the External or
Partially Internal Impedance Matching mode. Here the external r or
internal IM is used for voltage division, not for impedance matching. That
is, the r (IM) and the R make up of a resistance bridge. The resistive

3.5        CLOCK AND DATA RECOVERY
      The Clock and Data Recovery is used to recover the clock signal
from the received data. It is accomplished by Digital Phase Locked Loop
(DPLL). The recovered clock tracks the jitter in the data output from the
Data Slicer and keeps the phase relationship between data and clock
during the absence of the incoming pulse.
      When Loss of Signal (LOS) is detected (Chapter 3.7.3 LOS Detec-
tion) on the link selected for REFA_OUT, this pin outputs MCLK (deliv-
ered from OSCI input) or a high level signal as selected by the
REFH_LOS bit.

       The FIFO is used as a pool to buffer the jittered input data, then the         RJA_E

erance is expected, while the 32-bit FIFO is used in delay sensitive
applications.                                                                        RJA_IS                 Interrupt Status 1                  03B

data stored in the FIFO. The DPLL can only attenuate the incoming jitter            RJITT[6:0] Receive Jitter Measure Value Indication          039
whose frequency is above Corner Frequency (CF). The jitter whose fre-
quency is lower than the CF passes through the DPLL without any atten-
uation. In T1/J1 applications, the CF of the DPLL can be 5 Hz or 1.26
Hz, as selected by the RJA_BW bit. In E1 applications, the CF of the
DPLL can be 6.77 Hz or 0.87 Hz, as selected by the RJA_BW bit. The
lower the CF is, the longer time is needed to achieve synchronization.
       If the incoming data moves faster than the outgoing data, the FIFO
will overflow. If the incoming data moves slower than the outgoing data,
the FIFO will underflow. The overflow or underflow is captured by the
RJA_IS bit. When the RJA_IS bit is ‘1’, an interrupt will be reported on
the INT pin if enabled by the RJA_IE bit.
       To avoid overflow or underflow, the JA-Limit function can be
enabled by setting the RJA_LIMT bit. When the JA-Limit function is
enabled, the speed of the outgoing data will be adjusted automatically if
the FIFO is close to its full or emptiness. The criteria of speed adjust-
ment start are listed in Table 6. Though the JA-Limit function can reduce
the possibility of FIFO overflow and underflow, the quality of jitter attenu-
ation is deteriorated.

3.8.2        E1 MODE
      In E1 mode, the Frame Processor searches for Basic Frame syn-
chronization, CRC Multi-frame synchronization, and Channel Associated
Signaling (CAS) Multi-frame synchronization in the received data
stream. Figure 11 shows the searching process.
      Once the frame is synchronized, the Frame Processor keeps on
monitoring the received data stream. If there are any framing bit errors,
CAS Multi-Frame alignment pattern errors, CRC Multi-Frame alignment
pattern errors or CRC errors, the Frame Processor will indicate these
errors. The status of loss of frame, loss of Signaling Multi-Frame and
loss of CRC Multi-Frame can also be detected and declared based on
user-selectable criteria. A software reset can also make the Frame Pro-
cessor reframe.
      The Frame Processor can extract the data stream in TS16, and
output the extracted data on a separate pin. The Frame Processor also
extracts the contents of the International bits (from both the FAS and the
NFAS frames), the National bits and the Extra bits (from TS16 in the
frame 0 of the Signaling Multi-Frame), and stores these data in registers.
The CRC Sub Multi-Frame alignment 4 bit codeword in the National bit
positions Sa4 to Sa8 can also be extracted and stored in registers, and
updated every CRC Sub Multi-Frame.
      The Framer Processor identifies the Remote Alarm bit (bit 3 of TS0
of NFAS frames) and Remote Signaling Multi-Frame Alarm (bit 6 of
TS16 of the frame 0 of the Signaling Multi-Frame). The ‘de-bounced’
Remote Alarm and Remote Signaling Multi-Frame Alarm can be indi-
cated if the corresponding bit has been a certain logic for 1 or 4 consec-
utive times. The AIS (Alarm Indication Signal) Alarm can also be
detected. The Frame Processor can also declare a Red Alarm if the out-
of-frame condition has persisted for at least 100 ms.
      An interrupt output is provided to indicate status changes and the
occurrence of some events. The interrupts may be generated every
Basic Frame, CRC Sub Multi-Frame, CRC Multi-Frame or Signaling
Multi-Frame.
      The Frame Processor can also be bypassed by setting the UNFM
bit.

      The algorithm used to search for the E1 Basic Frame alignment
pattern (as shown in Figure 12) meets the ITU-T Recommendation
G.706 4.1.2 and 4.2.
      Generally, it is performed by detecting a successive FAS/NFAS/
FAS sequence. If STEP 2 is not met, a new searching will start after the
following frame is skipped. If STEP 3 is not met, a new searching will
start immediately in the next frame. Once the Basic Frame alignment
pattern is detected in the received PCM data stream, the Basic Frame
synchronization is found and the OOFV bit will be set to ‘0’ for indication.

nization is declared with a ‘0’ in the OOCMFV bit only if at least two CRC
Multi-Frame alignment patterns are found within 8 ms, with the interval
time of each pattern being a multiple of 2 ms. Then if the received CRC
Multi-Frame alignment signal does not meet its pattern, it will be indi-
cated by the CMFERI bit.
      If the 2 CRC Multi-Frame alignment patterns can not be found
within 8ms with the interval time being a multiple of 2 ms, an offline
search for the Basic Frame alignment pattern will start which is indicated
in the OOOFV bit. The process is the same as shown in Figure 12. This
offline operation searches in parallel with the pre-found Basic Frame
synchronization searching process. After the new Basic Frame synchro-
nization is found by this offline search, the 8 ms timer is restarted to
check whether the two CRC Multi-Frame alignment patterns are found
within 8 ms, with the interval time of each pattern being a multiple of 2
ms again. If the condition can not be met, the procedure will go on until

      Bit offset and timeslot offset are both supported in all the operating
modes. The offset is between the framing pulse on the TSFS/MTSFS
pin and the start of the corresponding frame input on the TSD/MTSD
pin. The signaling bits on the TSIG/MTSIG pin are always per-timeslot
aligned with the data on the TSD/MTSD pin.
      Refer to Chapter 3.18.1.4 Offset for the base line without offset in
different operating modes and the configuration of the offset.
      In Non-multiplexed mode, the timeslot offset can be configured
from 0 to 31 timeslots (0 & 31 are included). In Multiplexed mode, the
timeslot offset can be configured from 0 to 127 timeslots (0 & 127 are
included).

      The Yellow alarm signal will be manually inserted in the data
stream to be transmitted when the XYEL bit is set, or the Yellow alarm
signal will be inserted automatically by setting the AUTOYELLOW bit
when Red alarm is declared in the received data stream. The Yellow

3.20.1.1.5         Interrupt Summary
      At the first bit of each basic frame, the BFI bit will be set. In this con-
dition, if the BFE bit is enabled, an interrupt will be reported by the INT
pin.
      At the first bit of each SF/ESF/T1 DM/SLC-96 multiframe, the MFI
bit will be set. In this condition, if the MFE bit is enabled, an interrupt will
be reported by the INT pin.

       The Bit Oriented Message (BOM) can only be transmitted in the
ESF format in T1/J1 mode.
       The BOM pattern is ‘111111110XXXXXX0’ which occupies the DL of
the F-bit in the ESF format. The six ‘X’s represent the code that is pro-
grammed in the XBOC[5:0] bits. The BOM is transmitted only if the

3.20.5         INBAND LOOPBACK CODE GENERATOR (T1/J1 ONLY)
       The Inband Loopback Code Generator can only transmit inband
loopback code in a framed or unframed T1/J1 data stream.
       The length and the content of the inband loopback code are pro-
grammed in the CL[1:0] bits and the IBC[7:0] bits respectively. The code
can only be transmitted when the IBCDEN bit is enabled. In framed
mode, which is configured by the IBCDUNFM bit, the bits in all 24 chan-
nels are overwritten with the inband loopback code and the F-bit is not
changed. In unframed mode, which is configured by the IBCDUNFM bit,
all the bits in 24 channels and the F-bit are overwritten with the inband
loopback code.

3.23        TRANSMIT JITTER ATTENUATOR
      The Transmit Jitter Attenuator can be chosen to be used or not.
This selection is made by the TJA_E bit.                                         Table 59: Related Bit / Register In Chapter 3.23
      The Jitter Attenuator consists of a FIFO and a DPLL, as shown in                 Bit                      Register                 Address (Hex)

data is clocked out of the FIFO by a de-jittered clock. The depth of the
FIFO can be 32 bits, 64 bits or 128 bits, as selected by the TJA_DP[1:0]            TJA_BW     Transmit Jitter Attenuation Configuration     021

      The DPLL is used to generate a de-jittered clock to clock out the            TJITT[6:0] Transmit Jitter Measure Value Indication       038
data stored in the FIFO. The DPLL can only attenuate the incoming jitter
whose frequency is above Corner Frequency (CF). The jitter which fre-
quency is lower than the CF passes through the DPLL without any atten-
uation. In T1/J1 applications, the CF of the DPLL can be 5 Hz or 1.26
Hz, as selected by the TJA_BW bit. In E1 applications, the CF of the
DPLL can be 6.77 Hz or 0.87 Hz, as selected by the TJA_BW bit. The
lower the CF is, the longer time is needed to achieve synchronization.
      If the incoming data moves faster than the outgoing data, the FIFO
will overflow. If the incoming data moves slower than the outgoing data,
the FIFO will underflow. The overflow or underflow is captured by the
TJA_IS bit. When the TJA_IS bit is ‘1’, an interrupt will be reported on
the INT pin if enabled by the TJA_IE bit.
      To avoid overflowing or underflowing, the JA-Limit function can be
enabled by setting the TJA_LIMT bit. When the JA-Limit function is
enabled, the speed of the outgoing data will be adjusted automatically if
the FIFO is close to its full or emptiness. The criteria of speed adjust-
ment start are listed in Table 6. Though the LA-Limit function can reduce
the possibility of FIFO overflow and underflow, the quality of jitter attenu-
ation is deteriorated.
      Selected by the TJITT_TEST bit, the real time interval between the
read and write pointer of the FIFO or the peak-peak interval between the
read and write pointer of the FIFO can be indicated in the TJITT[6:0]
bits. When the TJITT_TEST bit is ‘0’, the current interval between the
read and write pointer of the FIFO will be written into the TJITT[6:0] bits.
When the TJITT_TEST bit is ‘1’, the current interval is compared with
the old one in the TJITT[6:0] bits and the larger one will be indicated by
the TJITT[6:0] bits.

by the UI[1:0] bits, and each UI is divided into 16 sub-phases addressed
by the SAMP[3:0] bits. The pulse amplitude of each phase is repre-
sented by a binary byte, within the range from +63 to -63, stored in the
WDAT[6:0] bits in signed magnitude form. The maximum number +63
(D) represents the positive maximum amplitude of the transmit pulse
while the most negative number -63 (D) represents the maximum nega-
tive amplitude of the transmit pulse. Thus, up to 64 bytes are used. For
each channel, a 64 bytes RAM is available.
      There are twelve standard templates which are stored in a local
ROM. One of them can be selected as reference and made some
changes to get the desired waveform.
      To do this, the first step is to choose a set of waveform value, which
is the most similar to the desired pulse shape, from the following 12
tables (Table 62 to Table 73), and set the SCAL[5:0] bits to the corre-
sponding standard value. Table 62 to Table 73 list the sample data and
the standard scaling value of each of the 12 templates.
      Modifying the corresponding sample data can get the desired
transmit pulse shape. By increasing or decreasing by ‘1’ from the stan-
dard value in the SCAL[5:0] bits, the pulse amplitude can be scaled up
or down at the percentage ratio against the standard pulse amplitude if
necessary. For different pulse shapes, the value of the SCAL[5:0] bits
and the scaling percentage ratio are different. The values are listed in
Table 62 to Table 73.

3.25        LINE DRIVER
      The Line Driver can be set to High-Z for redundant application.
      The following ways will set the drivers to High-Z:
      1. Setting the THZ pin to high will set the Line Driver to High-Z;
      2. When there is no clock input on the OSCI pin, the Line Driver will
be High-Z (no clock means this: the input on the OSCI pin is in high/low
level, or the duty cycle is less than 30% or larger than 70%);
      3. After software reset, hardware reset or power on, the Line Driver
will be High-Z;
      4. Setting the T_HZ bit to ‘1’ will set the Line Driver to High-Z;
      5. In Transmit Clock Master mode, if the XTS bit is ‘1’, the source of
the transmit clock is from the recovered clock from the line side. When
the recovered clock from the line side is lost, the Line Driver will be High-
Z;
      6. In Transmit Clock Slave mode, if the XTS bit is ‘0’, the source of
the transmit clock is from the backplane timing clock. When the back-
plane timing clock is lost (i.e., no transition for more than 72 T1/E1/J1
cycles), the Line Driver will be High-Z. However, there is an exception in
this case. That is, if the link is in Remote Loopback mode, the Line
Driver will not be High-Z.
      7. When the transmit path is power down, the Line Driver will be
High-Z.
      By these ways, the TTIP and TRING pins will enter into high imped-
ance state immediately.
      Controlled by the DFM_ON bit, the output driver short-circuit pro-
tection can be enabled. The driver’s output current (peak to peak) is lim-
ited to 110 mA typically. When the output current exceeds the limitation,
the transmit driver failure will be captured by the DF_S bit. Selected by
the DF_IES bit, a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the DF_S bit or any transi-
tion from ‘0’ to ‘1’ or from ‘1’ to ‘0’ on the DF_S bit will set the DF_IS bit.
When the DF_IS bit is ‘1’, an interrupt on the INT pin will be reported if
enabled by the DF_IE bit.

3.26       TRANSMITTER IMPEDANCE MATCHING
      In T1/J1 mode, the transmitter impedance matching can be real-
ized by using internal impedance matching circuit. 100 , 110 , 75 
or 120  internal impedance matching circuit can be selected by the
T_TERM[1:0] bits. The external impedance circuitry is not supported in
T1/J1 mode.
      In E1 mode, the transmitter impedance matching can be realized
by using internal impedance matching circuit or external impedance
matching circuit. When the T_TERM[2] bit is ‘0’, the internal impedance
matching circuit is enabled. 100 , 110 , 75  or 120  internal
impedance matching circuit can be selected by the T_TERM[1:0] bits.
When the T_TERM[2] bit is ‘1’, the internal impedance matching circuit
is disabled, and different external resistors should be used to realize dif-
ferent impedance matching.
      Figure 2 shows the appropriate components to connect with the
cable. Table 75 lists the recommended impedance matching values for
the transmitter.

3.27.2         LOOPBACK
      System Loopback, Payload Loopback, Local Digital Loopback 1 &
2, Remote Loopback and Analog Loopback are all supported in the
82P2281. Their routes are shown in the Functional Block Diagram.
3.27.2.1         System Loopback
      The System Loopback can only be implemented when the Receive
System Interface and the Transmit System Interface are in different
Non-multiplexed operating modes (one in Clock Master mode and the
other in Clock Slave mode). However, in T1/J1 mode, when either the
receive path or the transmit path is in T1/J1 mode E1 rate, the System
Loopback is not supported.
      Distinguished by the loopback direction, the System Loopback can
be divided into System Remote Loopback and System Local Loopback.
When the data and signaling bits from the transmit path are looped to
the receive path, it is System Remote Loopback. When the data and sig-
naling bits from the receive path are looped to the transmit path, it is
System Local Loopback.
3.27.2.1.1         System Remote Loopback
      Enabled by the SRLP bit, the System Remote Loopback is imple-
mented. The data and signaling bits to be transmitted on the TSD and
TSIG pins are internally looped to the RSD and RSIG pins. When the
receive path is in Receive Clock Master mode and the transmit path is in
Transmit Clock Slave mode, the clock signal and the framing pulse from
the system side on the TSCK and TSFS pins are looped to the RSCK
and RSFS pins respectively. When the transmit path is in Transmit Clock
Master mode and the receive path is in Receive Clock Slave mode, the
clock signal and the framing pulse from the system side on the RSCK
and RSFS pins are looped to the TSCK and TSFS pins respectively.
      In System Remote Loopback mode, the data stream to be transmit-
ted is still output to the line side, while the data stream received from the
line side is replaced by the System Remote Loopback data.
3.27.2.1.2         System Local Loopback
      Enabled by the SLLP bit, the System Local Loopback is imple-
mented. The received data and signaling bits to be output on the RSD
and RSIG pins are internally looped to the TSD and TSIG pins. When
the receive path is in Receive Clock Master mode and the transmit path
is in Transmit Clock Slave mode, the recovered clock signal and framing
pulse on the RSCK and RSFS pins are looped to the TSCK and TSFS
pins respectively. When the transmit path is in Transmit Clock Master
mode and the receive path is in Receive Clock Slave mode, the TSCK
and TSFS pins are looped to the RSCK and RSFS pins respectively.
      In System Local Loopback mode, the data stream received from
the line side is still output to the system through the RSD and RSIG pins,
while the data stream to be transmitted through the TSD and TSIG pins
are replaced by the System Local Loopback data.
                                                                              101                                    September 30, 2019

3.28        INTERRUPT SUMMARY
      When the INT pin is asserted low, it means at least one interrupt
has occurred in the device. Reading the Timer Interrupt Indication regis-
ter and the Interrupt Module Indication registers will find whether the
timer interrupt occurs or in which function block the interrupt occurs.
      If the TMOVI bit in the Timer Interrupt Indication register is ‘1’ and
the TMOVE bit in the Timer Interrupt Control register is enabled, the one
second timer of the device generates an interrupt. Then the source is
served after it is found.
      The Interrupt Module Indication bits will be ‘1’ if there are interrupts
in the corresponding function block. To find the eventual interrupt
sources, the Interrupt Indication and Status bits in the block are polled if
their Interrupt Enable bits are enabled. Then the sources are served
after they are found.

       Default
       A write operation to this register will generate a software reset.
       The software reset can only be applied when the clock on the OSCI pin is available.
       The software reset will set all the registers except the T1/J1 Or E1 Mode register (020H) to their default values. If the setting is changed in the T1/
J1 Or E1 Mode register (020H), a software reset must be applied.

TJITT_TEST:
      = 0: The real time interval between the read and write pointer of the FIFO is indicated in the TJITT[6:0] bits (b6~0, T1/J1-038H). That is, the cur-
rent interval between the read and write pointer of the FIFO will be written into the TJITT[6:0] bits (b6~0, T1/J1-038H).
      = 1: The peak-peak interval between the read and write pointer of the FIFO is indicated in the TJITT[6:0] bits (b6~0, T1/J1-038H). That is, the cur-
rent interval is compared with the old one in the TJITT[6:0] bits (b6~0, T1/J1-038H) and the larger one will be indicated by the TJITT[6:0] bits (b6~0,
T1/J1-038H); otherwise, the value in the TJITT[6:0] bits (b6~0, T1/J1-038H) will not be changed.
TJA_LIMT:
      When the read and write pointer of the FIFO are within 2/3/4 bits (corresponding to the FIFO depth) of overflowing or underflowing, the bandwidth
of the JA can be widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. This bit selects whether the bandwidth is normal or wid-
ened.
      = 0: Normal bandwidth is selected.
      = 1: Widen bandwidth is selected. In this case, the JA will not attenuate the input jitter until the read/write pointer’s position is outside the 2/3/4
bits window.
TJA_E:
      = 0: Disable the Transmit Jitter Attenuator.
      = 1: Enable the Transmit Jitter Attenuator.
TJA_DP[1:0]:
      These two bits select the Jitter Attenuation Depth.
      = 00: The Jitter Attenuation Depth is 128-bit.
      = 01: The Jitter Attenuation Depth is 64-bit.
      = 10 / 11: The Jitter Attenuation Depth is 32-bit.
TJA_BW:
      This bit select the Jitter Transfer Function Bandwidth.
      = 0: 5 Hz.
      = 1: 1.26 Hz.

     The following setting lists the standard values of normal amplitude in different operating modes. Each step change (one increasing or decreasing
from the standard value) will scale the amplitude of the D/A output by a certain offset. These bits are only effective when user programmable arbitrary
waveform is used.
     = 000100: Normal amplitude in T1 long haul LBO/-22.5 dB operating mode. Each step change scales about 25% offset.

RJA_LIMT:
      When the read and write pointer of the FIFO are within 2/3/4 bits (corresponding to the FIFO depth) of overflowing or underflowing, the bandwidth
of the JA can be widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. This bit selects whether the bandwidth is normal or wid-
ened.
      = 0: Normal bandwidth is selected.
      = 1: Widen bandwidth is selected. In this case, the JA will not attenuate the input jitter until the read/write pointer’s position is outside the 2/3/4
bits window.
RJA_E:
      = 0: Disable the Receive Jitter Attenuator.
      = 1: Enable the Receive Jitter Attenuator.
RJA_DP[1:0]:
      These two bits select the Jitter Attenuation Depth.

DDSC:
      This bit selects the synchronization criteria of T1 DM format.
      = 0: If a correct DDS pattern is received before the first F-bit of a single correct Frame Alignment Pattern and there is no mimic pattern, the T1 DM
synchronization is acquired.
      = 1: If a single correct Frame Alignment Pattern is received, and twelve correct DDS patterns before each F-bit of the correct Frame Alignment
Pattern are all detected, and there is no mimic pattern, the T1 DM synchronization is acquired.
MIMICC:
      This bit selects the synchronization criteria in SF format and ESF format.
      In SF format:
      = 0: When two consecutive Frame Alignment Patterns are received error free in the data stream, the SF is synchronized. In this case, the exis-
tence of mimic patterns is ignored.
      = 1: When two consecutive Frame Alignment Patterns are received error free in the data stream without mimic pattern, the SF is synchronized.
      In ESF format:
      = 0: When a single correct Frame Alignment Pattern and a single correct CRC-6 are found in the same frame, the ESF is synchronized. In this
case, the existence of mimic patterns is ignored.
      = 1: When four consecutive Frame Alignment Patterns are detected error free in the received data stream without mimic pattern, the ESF is syn-
chronized.
M2O[2:1]:
      In SF format, these two bits define the threshold of the F Bit Error numbers in N-bit sliding F bits window. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out
of synchronization.
      In ESF format, these two bits define the threshold of the Frame Alignment Bit Error numbers in N-bit sliding Frame Alignment bits window.
Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.
      In T1 DM format, these two bits define the threshold of the 7-bit pattern error numbers in N-pattern sliding 7-bit patterns window. The 7-bit pattern
consists of the 6-bit DDS pattern and its following F-bit. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.
      In SLC-96 format, these two bits define the threshold of the Ft bit error numbers in N-bit sliding Ft bits window or the Fs bit error numbers in N-bit
sliding Fs bits in Frame (2n) (0<n<12 and n=36) window. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.

HA[7:0]:
     In HDLC mode, when high byte address comparison or both bytes address comparison is required, the high byte address position (the byte fol-
lowing the opening flag) is compared with the value in these bits, or with ‘0xFC’ or ‘0xFE’. The HA[1] bit (the ‘C/R’ bit position) is excluded to compare.

    The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
EOM:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit indicates an entire HDLC packet is stored in the FIFO and starts the packet transmission.
ABORT:
    = 0: Disable the manual abort sequence insertion.
    = 1: The abort sequence (‘01111111’) is manually inserted to the current HDLC packet.
    This bit is self-cleared after the abortion.
THDLCM:
    = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
    = 1: Reserved.
TRST:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Transmitter. The reset will clear the FIFO.

UDRUNI:
     When the FIFO is empty and the last transmitted byte is not the end of the current HDLC packet, the under-run occurs. This bit indicates whether
the under-run occurs.
     = 0: No under-run occurs.
     = 1: Under-run occurs.
     This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.
RDYI:
     = 0: There is no status change on the RDY bit (b0, T1/J1-0B0H / 0B1H / 0B2H).

       Default
       A write operation to this register will generate a software reset.
       The software reset can only be applied when the clock on the OSCI pin is available.
       The software reset will set all the registers except the T1/J1 Or E1 Mode register (020H) to their default values. If the setting is changed in the T1/
J1 Or E1 Mode register (020H), a software reset must be applied.

tive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than
16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, E1-029H)) for 32 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than
(Q + 4 dB) and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods.
      = 1: The I.431/ETSI is selected. In short haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than 800 mVpp for 2048 con-
secutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less
than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, E1-029H)) for 2048 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater
than (Q + 4 dB) and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods.

BPV_INS:
     A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit generates a single Bipolar Violation (BPV) Error to be inserted to the data stream to be transmitted.
     This bit must be cleared and set again for the next BPV error insertion.
EXZ_DEF:
     This bit selects the Excessive Zero (EXZ) Error criteria.
     = 0: The ANSI is selected. In AMI line code rule, the EXZ error is defined as more than 15 consecutive zeros in the data stream. In HDB3 line
code rule, the EXZ error is defined as more than 3 consecutive zeros in the data stream.

ters when there is a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the CNT_TRF bit.
     = 1: The Auto Report mode is selected. The internal 16-bit EXZ counter transfers its content to the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers
every one second automatically.
CNT_TRF:
     This bit is valid when the CNT_MD bit is ‘0’.
     A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit updates the content in the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers with the value in the internal 16-bit
EXZ counter.
     This bit must be cleared and set again for the next updating.

      These bits give a binary number to define the timeslot offset. The timeslot offset is between the framing pulse on the TSFS/MTSFS pin and the
start of the corresponding frame input on the TSD/MTSD pin. The signaling bits on the TSIG/MTSIG pin are always per-timeslot aligned with the data
on the TSD/MTSD pin.
      In Non-multiplexed mode, the timeslot offset can be configured from 0 to 31 timeslots (0 & 31 are included). In Multiplexed mode, the timeslot off-

HA[7:0]:
     In HDLC mode, when high byte address comparison or both bytes address comparison is required, the high byte address position (the byte fol-
lowing the opening flag) is compared with the value in these bits, or with ‘0xFC’ or ‘0xFE’. The HA[1] bit (the ‘C/R’ bit position) is excluded to compare.

     The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
LA[7:0]:
     In HDLC mode, when low byte address comparison is required, the high byte address position (the byte following the opening flag) is compared
with the value in these bits. When both bytes address comparison is required, the low byte address position (the byte following the high byte address
position) is compared with the value in these bits.

    The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
EOM:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit indicates an entire HDLC packet is stored in the FIFO and starts the packet transmission.
ABORT:
    = 0: Disable the manual abort sequence insertion.
    = 1: The abort sequence (‘01111111’) is manually inserted to the current HDLC packet.
    This bit is self-cleared after the abortion.
THDLCM:
    = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
    = 1: Reserved.
TRST:
    A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Transmitter. The reset will clear the FIFO.

   000        EXTEST      The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the EXTEST instruction,
                          the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be sampled by loading the boundary scan
                          register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR
                          state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading patterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using
                          the Update-DR state.
   010       SAMPLE /     The sample/preload instruction is used to allow scanning of the boundary-scan register without causing interference to the normal opera-
             PRELOAD      tion of the on-chip system logic. Data received at system input pins is supplied without modification to the on-chip system logic; data from
                          the on-chip system logic is driven without modification through the system output pins. SAMPLE allows a snapshot to be taken of the data
                          flowing from the system pins to the on-chip system logic or vice versa, without interfering with the normal operation of the assembled
                          board. PRELOAD allows an initial data pattern to be placed at the latched parallel outputs of boundary-scan register cells prior to selection
                          of another boundary-scan test operation.
   001        IDCODE      The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device’s identification code can then
                          be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.
   111        BYPASS      The BYPASS instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used to bypass the
                          device.
   011         CLAMP      This instruction allows the state of the signals driven from device pins to be determined from the boundary-scan register while the bypass
                          register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO. The signals driven from the device pins will not change while the CLAMP
                          instruction is selected.
   010         HIGHZ      Use of the HIGHZ instruction places the device in a state in which all of its system logic outputs are placed in an inactive drive state (e.g.,
                          high impedance). In this state, and in-circuit test system may drive signals onto the connections normally driven by a device output without
                          incurring the risk of damage to the device.

             Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held high for at least 5 rising
             edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high.
  Run-Test/ This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The instruction reg-
     Idle    ister and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Select-DR
             state.
 Select-DR- This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its
    Scan     previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR state and a scan
             sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Select-IR-Scan
             state.
   Capture- In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction does not
     DR      change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising
             edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
   Shift-DR In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward its serial
             output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to
             TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
  Exit1-DR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Pause-DR The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI and TDO.
             For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test sequence. The test data reg-
             ister selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this
             state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-DR state.
  Exit2-DR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
 Update-DR The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST and SAM-
             PLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched into the parallel output
             of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output changes only in this state. All shift-reg-
             ister stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Select-IR- This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising
    Scan     edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction register is initiated. If
             TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction does not change during this
             state.
 Capture-IR In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of '100' on the rising edge of TCK. This supports fault-iso-
             lation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruction does not change
             during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or the
             Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
   Shift-IR In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its serial output
             on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change
             during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or
             remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
   Exit1-IR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.

  Pause-IR The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected by the cur-
           rent instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low.
           When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
  Exit2-IR This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR state, which
           terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state. The test data register
           selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
 Update-IR The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. When the new
           instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction retain their previous value.

7.4        DIGITAL I/O TIMING CHARACTERISTICS
     The capacitive loading for timing measurement is:
     100 pF for BUS: D[7:0],
     50 pF for other pins.
     The timing can be applied to both clock edges as defined by active clock edge selection.
     Delays are measured according to the cross of 50% of the rising/falling edge.
     The duty cycle for TSCKn/MTSCK & RSCKn/MRSCK is from 40% to 60%.
     If you are using a bits application in G.703 CH13 mode, for the duty cycle of RSCK refer to AN-1029.
