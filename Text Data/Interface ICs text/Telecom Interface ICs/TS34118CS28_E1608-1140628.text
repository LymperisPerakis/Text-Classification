PIN DESCRIPTION
  PIN NO.     NAME                                          FUNCTION
      1         FO   Filter output. Output impedance is less than 50Ω
      2          FI  Filter input. Input impedance is greater than 1MΩ.
                     Chip Disable. A logic low (<0.8V) sets normal operation. A logic high (>2.0V)
      3         CD
                     disables the IC to conserve power. Input impedance is nominally 90kΩ.
                     A supply voltage of +2.8V to +6.5V is required, at ≈ 5.0mA. As VCC falls from 3.5V to
      4         VCC  2.8V, an AGC circuit reduces the receive attenuator gain by ≈25dB (when in the
                     receive mode).
                     Output of the second hybrid amplifier. The gain is internally set at –1.0 to provide a
      5       HTO+
                     differential output, in conjunction with HTO-, to the hybrid transformer.
      6        HTO-  Output of the first hybrid amplifier. The gain of the amp is set by external resistors.
      7         HTI  Input and summing node for the first hybrid amplifier. DC level is ≈ VB.
      8        TXO   Output of the transmit attenuator. DC level is approximately VB.
                     Input to the transmit attenuator. Max. Signal level is 350mVrms. Input impedance is
      9         TXI
                     10kΩ.
                     Output of the microphone amplifier. The gain of the amplifier is set by external
     10        MCO
                     resistors.
     11        MCI   Input and summing node of the microphone amplifier. DC level is≈ VB.
                     Mute input. A logic low (<0.8V) sets normal operation. A logic high (>2.0V) mutes
     12        MUT   the microphone amplifier without affecting the rest of the circuit. Input impedance is
                     nominally 90kΩ.
                     Volume control input. When VCI=VB, the receive attenuator is at maximum gain
     13         VCI  when in the receive mode. When VCI=0.3VB, the receive gain is down 35dB. Does
                     not affect the transmit mode.
     14         CT   An RC at this pin sets the response time for the circuit to switch modes.
                     An output voltage ≈ VCC/2. This voltage is a system ac ground, and biases the
     15         VB

     18       TLO2

     19       RLO2   Receive level detector on the mike/speaker side.
     20        RLI2  Receive level detector on the mike/speaker side.
                     Input to the receive attenuator and dial tone detector. Max input level is 350mVrms.
     21         RXI
                     Input impedance is ≈10kΩ.
     22        RXO   Receive attenuator. DC level is approximately VB.

APPLICATION INFORMATION
The fundamental difference between the operation of a speakerphone and a handset is that of half-duplex versus
full duplex. The handset is full duplex since con-version can occur in both directions (transmit and receive)
simultaneously. A speakerphone has higher gain levels in both paths and attempting to converse full duplex results
in oscillatory problems due to the loop that exists within the system. The loop is formed by the receive and transmit
paths, the hybrid, and the acoustic coupling (speaker to microphone). The only practical and economical solution
used to data is to design the speakerphone to function in a half-duplex mode – i.e. only one person speaks at a
time, while the other listens. To achieve this required a circuit which can detect who is talking, switch on the
appropriate path (transmit or receive) and switch off (attenuate) the other path. In this way, the loop gain is
maintained less than unity. When the talkers exchange function, the circuit must quickly detect this, and switch the
circuit appropriately. By providing speech level detectors the circuit operates in a “hands free” mode, eliminating
the need for a “push to talk” switch.
The handset by the way has the same loop as the speakerphone. But since the gains are considerably lower, and
since the acoustic compiling from the earpiece to the mouthpiece is almost nonexistent (the receiver is normally
held against a person’s eat.) oscillations don’t occur.
The TS341118 provides the necessary level detectors, attenuators, and switching control for a properly operating
speakerphone. The detection sensitivity and timing are externally controllable. Additionally, the TS34118 provides
background nodule monitor’s which make the circuit insensitive to room and line noise, hybrid amplifier, and other
associated functions, please refer to the Block Diagram (Figure 2) when reading the following sections.
Attenuators
The transmit and receive attenuators are complementary in function. i .e. when one is at maximum gain (+6.0dB),
the other is at maximum attenuation (-4.5dB), and vice versa. They sum of their gains remains constant (within a
nominal error hand of ±0.1dB) at a typical value of ~40dB (see Figure 10). Their purpose is to control the transmit
and receive paths to provide the half-duplex operation required in a speakerphone.
The attenuators are non-inverting, and have a –3.0dB (from max gain) frequency of 10kHz. The input impedance of
each attenuator (TXI and RXI) is nominally 10kΩ (see Figure 3), and the input signal should be limited to
350mVrms (990mVp-p) to prevent distortion. That maximum recommended input signal is independent of the
volume control setting. The diode clamp on the inputs the input swing, and therefore the maximum negative output
swing. This is the reason for VRXOL and VTXOL specification being defined as they are in the Electrical Characteristics.
The output impedance is 10Ω until the output current limit typically 2.5mA) is reached.
                                           Figure 3. Attenuator Input Stage
The attenuators are controlled by the single output of the Control Block, which is measurable at the CT pin (pin 14).
When the CT pin is at +240mV with respect to VB, the circuit is in the receive mode (receive attenuator is at
+6.0dB). When the CT voltage is at -240mV with respect to VB, the circuit is in the transmit mode (transmit
attenuator is at +6.0dB). The circuit is in an idle mode when the CT voltage is equal to VB. Causing the attenuators
gain to be halfway between their fully on and fully off positions (-20dB each). Monitoring the CT voltage (with
respect to VB) is the most direct method of monitoring the circuit’s mode.
The inputs to the Control Block are seven, 2 from the comparators operated by the level detectors, 2 from the
background noise monitors, the volume control, the dial-tone detector, and the AGC circuit. These seven inputs are
described below.

Level Detectors
There are four level detectors-two on the receive side and two on the transmit side. Refer to Figure 4. The terms in
parentheses from one system, and the other terms from one system. Each level detector is a high gain amplifier
with back-to-bank diodes in the feedback path, resulting in non-linear gain, which permits operation over a wide
dynamic range of speech levels. The sensitivity of each level detector is determined by the external resistor and
capacitor at each input (TLI1, TLI2, RLI1 and RLI2). Each output charge an external capacitor through a diode and
limiting resistor, thus providing a do representation of the input as signal level. The outputs have a quick rise time
(determined by the capacitor and an internal 350Ω resistor), and a slow decay time set by an internal current
source and the capacitor. The capacitors on the four outputs should have the same value (±10%) to prevent timing
problems. Referring to Figure 2, on the receives side, one level detector (RLI1) is at the receive input receiving thus
same signal as at Tip and Ring, and the other (PLI2) is at the output of the speaker amplifier. On the transmit side,
one level detector (TLI2) is at the output of the microphone amplifier, while the other (TLI1) is at the hybrid output.
Outputs RLO1 and TLO1 feed a comparator, the output of which goes to the Attenuator Control Block. Likewise,
outputs RLO2 and TLO2 feed a second comparator which also goes to the Attenuator Control Block. The touch
table for the effects of the level detectors on the Control Block is given in the section describing the Control Block.
                                                 Figure 4. Level Detector
Volume Control
The volume control input at VCI (pin 13) is sensed as a voltage with respect to VB. The volume control affects the
attenuators only in the receive mode. It has no effect in the idle or transmit modes.
When in the receive mode, the gain of the receive attenuator will be +6.0dB, and the gain of the transmit attenuator
will be –46dB only when VCI is equal to VB. As VCI is reduced below VB, the gain of the receive attenuator is
reduced (see Figure 14), and the gain of the transmit attenuator is increased such that their sum remains constant.
Changing the voltage at VCI changes the voltage at CT (see the Attenuator Control Block section), which in turn
controls the attenuators.
The volume control setting does not affect the maximum attenuator input signal at which noticeable distortion
occurs. The bias current at VCI is typically 60nA out of the pin, and does not vary significantly with the VCI voltage
or with VCC.

Background Noise Monitors
The purpose of the background noise monitors is to distinguish speech (which consists of bursts) from background
noise (a relatively constant signal level). There are two background noise monitors-one for the receive path and
one for the transmit path. Referring to Figure 4, the receive background noise monitor is operated on by the RLI1-
PLO1 level detector, while the transmit background noise monitor is operated on by the TLI2-TLO2 level detector.
They monitor the background noise by storing a dc voltage representative of the respective noise levels in
capacitors at CPR and CPT. The voltages at these pins have slow rise times (determined by the external RC), but
fast decay times. If the signal at RLI1 (or TLI2) changes slowly, the voltage at CPR (or CPT) will remain more
positive than the voltage at the non-inverting input of the monitor’s output comparator. When speech is present, the
voltage on the non-inverting input of the comparator will rise quicker than the voltage at the inverting input (due to
the burst characteristic of speech), causing its output to change. This output is sensed by the Attenuator Control
Block. The 36mV offset at the comparator’s input keeps the comparator from changing state unless the speech
level exceeds the background noise by≈4.0dB. The time constant of the external RC (≈4.7 seconds) determines the
response time to background noise variations.
Dial Tone Detectors
The dial tone detector is a comparator with one side connected to the receive input (RXI) and the other input
connected to VB with a 15mV offset (see Figure 5). If the circuit is in the receive mode, and the incoming signal is
greater than 15mV (10mVrms), the comparator’s output will change, disabling the receive idle mode. The receive
attenuator will then be at a setting determined solely by the volume control.
The purpose of this circuit is to prevent the dial tone (which would be considered as continuous noise) from fading
away as the circuit would have the tendency to switch to the idle mode. By disabling the receive idle mode, the dial
tone remains at the normally expected full level.

Attenuator Control Block
The Attenuator Control Block has the seven inputs described above:
-The output of the comparator operated by RLO2 and TLO2 (microphone/speaker side) - designated C1.
-The output of the comparator operated by RLO1 and TLO1 (TIP/Ring side) – designated C2.
-The output of the transmit background noise monitor – designated C3.
-The output of the receive background noise monitor
-designated C4.
-The volume control.
-The dial tone detector.
-The AGC circuit.
The single output of the Control Block controls the two attenuators. The effect of C1-C4 is as follows:

X=Don’t Care; y=C3 and C4 are not both 0. A definition of the above terms:
1) ”Transmit” means the transmit attenuator is fully on (+6.0dB), and the receive attenuator is at max. Attenuation
   (- 46dB).
2) ”Receive” means both attenuators are controlled by the volume control. At max. Volume, the receive attenuator
    is fully on (+6.0dB), and the transmit attenuator is at max. Attenuation (-46dB).
3) ”Fast Idle” means both transmit and receive speech is present in approximately equal levels. The attenuators are
   quickly switched (30ms) to idle until one speech level dominates the other.
4) ”Slow Idle” means speech has ceased in both transmit and receive paths. The attenuators are then slowly
    switched (1 second) to the idle mode.
5) Switch to the full transmit or receive modes from any other mode is at the fast rate (≈30ms).
A summary of the truth table is as follows:
1) The circuit will switch to transmit if: a) both transmit level detectors sense higher signal levels relative to the
   respective receive level detectors (TLI1 versus RLI1, TLI2 versus RLI2), and b) the transmit background noise
   monitor indicates the presence of speech.
2) The circuit will switch to receive if: a) both receive level detectors sense higher signal levels relative to the
   respective transmit level detectors, and b) the receive background noise monitor indicates the presence of
  speech.
3) The circuit will switch to the fast idle mode if the level detectors disagree on the relative strengths of the signal
  levels, and at least one of the background noise monitors indicates speech. For example, referring to the Block
  Diagram (Figure 2), if there is sufficient signal at the microphone amp output (TLI2) to override the speaker signal
  (RLI2), and there is sufficient signal at the receive input (RLI1) to override the signal at the hybrid output (TLI1),
  and either or both background monitors indicate speech, then the circuit will be in the fast idle mode. Two
  conditions which can cause the fast idle mode to occur are a) when both talkers are attempting to gain control of
  the system by talking at the same time, and b)when one talker is in a very noisy environment, forcing the other
  talker to continually override that noise level. In general, the fast idle mode will occur infrequently.

Attenuator Control Block
4) The circuit will switch to the slow idle mode when a) both talkers are quiet (no speech present), or b) when one
   talker’s speech level is continuously overridden by noise at the other speaker’s location.
    The time required to switch the circuit between transmit, receive, fast idle and slow idle is determined in part by
    the components at the CT pin (pin 14). (see the section on Switch Time for a more complete explanation of the
    switching time components). A schematic of the CT circuitry is shown in Figure 6, and operates as follows:
   - RT is typically 120kΩ, and CT is typically 5.0μF.
    - To switch to the receive mode, I1 is turned on (I2 is off), charging the external capacitor to +240mV above VB.
    (An internal clamp prevents further charging of the capacitor.)
    - To switch to the transmit mode, I2 is turned on (I1 is off) bringing down the voltage on the capacitor to –240mV
    with respect to VB.
   - To switch to idle quickly (fast idle), the current sources are turned off, and the internal 2.0kΩ resistor is
      switched in, discharging the capacitor to VB with a time constant = 2.0K×CT.
   - To switch to idle slowly (slowly idle), the current sources are turned off, the switch at the internal 2.0KΩ resistor
      is open, and the capacitor discharges to VB through the external resistor RT with a time constant = RT × CT.

Microphone Amplifier
The microphone amplifier (pins 10,11) has the non-inverting input internally connected to VB, while the inverting
input and the output are pinned out. Unlike most op-amps, the amplifier has an all-NPN output stage, which
maximizes phase margin and gain-bandwidth. This feature ensures stability at gains less than unity, as well as with
a wide range of reactive loads. The open loop gain is typically 80dB (f<100Hz), and the gain-bandwidth is typically
1.0MHz (see Figure 16). The maximum p-p output swing is typically 1V less than VCC with an output impedance of
<10Ω until current limited is reached (typically 1.5mA).Input bias current at MCI is typically 40nA out of the pin.
The muting function (Pin 12), when activated, will reduce the gain of the amplifier to ≈-39dB (with RMI=5.0kΩ) by
shorting output to the inverting input (see Figure 7). The mute input has a threshold of ≈1.5V, and the voltage at
this pin must be kept within the range of ground and VCC (see Figure 17). If the mute function is not used, the pin
should be grounded.

Hybrid Amplifiers
The two hybrid amplifiers (at HTO+, HTO-, and HTI), in conjunction with an external transformer, provide the two-to
four wire converter for interfacing to the telephone line. The gain of the first amplifier (HTI to HTO-) is set by
external resistors (gain=-RHF/PHI in Figure 2), and its output drives the second amplifier, the gain of which is
internally set at –1.0. Unlike most op-amps, the amplifiers have all-NPN output stage, which maximizes phase
margin and gain-bandwidth. This feature ensures stability at gains less than unity, as well as with a wide range of
reactive loads. The open loop gain of the first amplifier is typically 80dB , and the gain bandwidth of each amplifier
is ≈1.0MHz (see Figure 16). The maximum p-p output swing of each amplifier is typically 1.2V less than VCC with an
output impedance of <10Ωuntil current limiting is reached (typically 8.0mA). The output current capability is
guaranteed to be a minimum of 5mA. The bias current at HTI is typically 30nA out of the pin.
The connections to the coupling transformer are shown in the Block Diagram (Figure 2). Balancing network
necessary to match the line impedance.
Filter
The operation of the filter circuit is determined by the external components. The circuit within the TS34118, from
pins FI to FO is a buffer with a high input impedance (>1.0MΩ), and a low output impedance (<50Ω). The
configuration of the external components determines whether the circuit is a high-pass filter (as shown in Figure 2),
a low-pass filter, or a band-pass filter.
As a high pass filter, with the components shown in Figure 8, the filter will keep out 60Hz (and 120Hz) hum which
can be picked up by the external telephone lines.
                                              Figure 8. High Pass Filter
As a low pass filter (Figure 9), it can be used to roll off the high end frequencies in the receive circuit, which aids in
protecting against acoustic feedback problems. With an appropriate choice of an input coupling capacitor to the low
pass filter is formed

Power Supply, VB, and Chip Disable
The power supply voltage at VCC (pin 4) is to be between 3.5 and 6.5V for normal operation, with reduced operation
possible down to 2.8V. The power supply current is shown in Figure 18 for both the power-up and power-down
mode. The output voltage at VB (pin 15) is ≈ (VCC-0.7)/2, and provides the ac ground for the system. The output
impedance at VB is ≈400Ω and in conjunction with the external capacitor at VB, forms a low pass filter for power
supply rejection with different capacitors. The choice of capacitor is application dependent base on whether the
circuit is powered by the telephone line or a power supply. Since VB biases the microphone and hybrid amplifiers,
the amount of supply rejection at their outputs is directly related to the rejection at VB, as well as their respective
gains. Depicts this graphically. The Chip Disable (pin 3) permits powering down the IC to conserve power and/or
for muting purposes. With CD≤0.8V, normal operation is in effect. With CD ≥ 2V and ≤ VCC, the IC is powered down.
In the powered down mode, the microphone and the hybrid amplifiers are disable, and their outputs go to a high
impedance state. Additionally, the bias is removed from the level detectors. The bias is not removed from the filter
(pins 1,2). The attenuators (pin 8,9, 21, 22), or from pin 13,14, and 15 (the attenuators are disabled, however, and
will not pass a signal). The input impedance at CD is typically 90kΩ, has a threshold of ≈ 1.5V, and the voltage at
this pin must be kept within the range of ground and VCC. If CD is not used, the pin should be grounded.
Switching Time
The switching time of the TS34118 circuit is dominated by the components at CT (pin 14, refer to Figure 6), and
secondarily by the capacitors at the level detector outputs (RLO1, RLO2, TLO1, TLO2).
The time to switch to receive or to transmit from idle is determined by the capacitor at CT, together with the internal
current sources (refer to Figure 6). The switching time is:
       ΔT=ΔV × CT / I
For the typical cause where ΔV=240mV, I=60μA. And CT is 50μF, ΔT=20ms. If the circuit switches directly from
receive to transmit (or vice-versa), the total switching time would be 40ms.
The switching time from either receive or transmit to idle depends on which type of idle mode is in effect. If the
circuit is going to “fast idle”, the time constant is determined by the CT capacitor, and the internal 2.0kΩ resistor
(Figure 6). With CT = 5μF, the time constant is ≈30ms (for 95% change). Fast idle is an infrequent occurrence,
however, occurring when both speakers are talking and competing for control of the circuit. The switching time from
idle back to either transmit or receive is described above.
If the circuit is switching to “slow idle”, the time constant is determined by the CT capacitor and RT, the external
resistor (see Figure 6). With CT = 5μF, and RT = 120KΩ, the time constant is ≈600ms, giving a switching time of ≈
1.8 seconds (for 95% change). The switching period to slow idle begins when both speakers have stopped talking.
The switching time back to the original mode will depend on how soon that speaker begins speaking again. The
sooner the speaking time starts during the 1.8 seconds period, the quicker the switching time since a smaller
voltage excursion is required. That switching time is determined by the internal current sources as described above.
The above switching times occur, however, after the level detectors have detected the appropriate signal levels,
since their outputs operate the Attenuator Control Block. Referring to Figure 4, the rise time of the level detector’s
outputs to new speech is quick by comparison (≈1.0ms), determined by the internal 350Ω resistor and the
external capacitor (typically 2μF). The output’s decay time is determined by the external capacitor, and an internal
4μF current source giving a decay rate of ≈60ms for 120mV excursion at RLO or TLO. However, the overall
response time of the circuit is not a constant since it depends on the relative strength of the signals at the different
level detectors, as well as the timing of the signals with respect to each other. The capacitors at the four outputs
(RLO1, RLO2, TLO1, TLO2) must be equal value (±10%) to prevent problems in timing and level response. The
rise time of the level detector’s outputs is not significant since it is so short. The decay time, however, provides a
significant part of the “hold time” necessary to hold the circuit during the normal pauses in speech. The
components at the inputs of the level detectors (RLI1, RLI2, TLI1,TLI2) do not affect the switching time, but rather
affect the relative signal levels required to switch the circuit, as well as the frequency response of the detectors.

Design Equations
Referring to Figure 10(the coupling capacitors have been omitted for simplicity), the following definitions will be
used (all measurements are at 1kHz)
- GMA is the gain of the microphone amplifier measured from the microphone output to TXI (typically 35V/V, or
    31dB);
- GTX is the gain of the transmit attenuator, measured from TXI to TXO;
- GHA is the gain of hybrid amplifiers, measured from TXO to the HTO-/HTO+ differential output (typically 10.2V/V,
    or 20.1dB);
- GHT is the gain from HTO-/HTO+ to Tip/Ring for transmit signals, and includes the balance network (measured
    at 0.4V/V, or –8.0dB);
- GST is the side tone gain, measured from HTO-/HTO+ to the filter input (measured at 0.18V/V , or –15dB);
- GHR is the gain from Tip/Ring to the filter input for receive signals (measured at 0.833V/V or –1.6dB);
- GFO is the gain of the filter stage, measured from the input of the filter to RXI, typically 0dB at 1.0KHz;
- GRX is the gain of the receive attenuator measured from RXI to RXO;
- GSA is the gain of the speaker amplifier, measured from RXO to the differential output of the TS34119 (typical
    22V/V or 26.8dB);
- GAC is the acoustic coupling, measured from the speaker differential voltage to the microphone output voltage.
Transmit Gain
The transmit gain, from the microphone output (VM) to tip and Ring, is determined by the output characteristics of
the microphone, and the desired transmit level. For example, a typical electret microphone will produce
≈0.35mVrms under normal speech conditions. To achieve 100mVrms at Tip / Ring, an overall gain of 285V/V is
necessary. The gain of the transmit attenuator is fixed at 2.0 (+6.0dB), and the gain through the hybrid normally 0.4
(-8.0dB). Therefore a gain of 357V/V is required of the microphone and hybrid amplifiers. It is desirable to have the
majority f that gain in the microphone amplifier for three reasons:
     1. The low level signals from the microphone should be amplifier as soon as possible to minimize signal/noise
          problems.
     2. To provide a reasonable signal level to the TLI2 level detector; and 3) to minimize any gain applied to
          broadband noise generated within the attenuator. However, to cover the normal voice band, the
          microphone amplifier’s gain should not exceed 48dB. For the circuit of Figure 10, the gain of the
          microphone amplifier was set at 35V/V (31dB), and the differential gain of the hybrid amplifiers was set at
          10.2V/V (20.1dB).
Receive Gain
The overall receive gain depends on the incoming signal level, and the desired output power at the speaker.
Normal receive levels (independent of the peaks) at Tip/Ring can be 35mVrms (-27dBm). Although on long lines
That level can be down to 8.0mVrms (-40dBm).The speaker power is:
               10dBm/10 × 0.6
       PSPK =                                  (Equation 1)
                       Rs
Where RS is the speaker impedance, and the dBm term is the incoming signal level increased by the gain of the
receive path. Experience has shown that≈30dB gain is a satisfactory amount for the majority of applications. Using
the above numbers and Equation 1, it would appear that the resulting power to the speaker is extremely low.
However, Equation 1 does not consider the peaks in normal speech, which can be 10 to 15 times the rms value.
Considering the peaks, the overall average power approaches 20-30mV on long lines, and much more on short
lines.
Referring to Figure 10, the gain from Tip/Ring to the filter input was measured at 0.833V/V (-1.6dB), the filter’s gain
is unity, and the receive attenuator’s gain is 2.0V/V (+6.0dB) at maximum volume. The speaker amplifier’s gain is
set at 22V/V (26.8dB), which puts the overall gain at ≈31.2dB.

Loop Gain
The total loop gain must add up to less than zero dB to obtain a stable circuit. This can be expressed as:
    GMA+GTX+GHA+GST+GFO+GRX+GSA+GAC<0               (Equation 2)
Using the typical numbers mentioned above, and knowing that GTX+GRX=-40dB, the required acoustic coupling
can be determined:
    GAC<-[31+20.1+(-15)+0+(-40)+26.8]=-22.9dB (Equation 3)
An acoustic loss of at least 23 dB is necessary to prevent instability and oscillations, commonly referred to as
“singing.” However, the following equations show that greater acoustic loss is necessary to obtain proper level
detection and switching.
Switching Threshold
To switch comparator C1, currents I1 and I3 need to be determined. Referring to Figure 11, with a receive signal
VL applied to Tip/Ring, a current I3 will flow through R3 into RLI2 according to the following equation:
           VL                          G SA 
      I3 =
                  G    × G    × G    ×         (Equation 4)
                                          2 
                     HR     FO     RX
           R3    
Where the terms in the brackets are the V/V gain terms. The speaker amplifier gain is divided by two since GSA is
the differential gain of the amplifier, and V3 is obtained from one the side of the output. The current I1, coming from
the microphone circuit, is defined by:
           VM × G MA
      I1 =                (Equation 5)
                R1
Where VM is the microphone voltage. Since the switching threshold occurs when I1=I3, combining the above two
equations yields:
                                                (Equation 6)
                                 Figure 10. Basic Block Diagram For Design Purpose
This is the general equation defining the microphone voltage necessary to switch comparator C1 when a received
signal VL is present. The highest VM occurs when the receive attenuator is at maximum gain (+6.0dB). Using the
typical numbers for Equation 6 yields:
      VM = 0.52VL (Equation 7)
To switch comparator C2, currents I2 and I4 need to be determined. With sound applied to the
microphone, a voltage VM is creased by the microphone, resulting in a current I2 into TLI1:
           VM                    G 
      I2 =
                  G MA × G TX × HA            (Equation 8)

Switching Threshold
Since GHA is the differential gain of the hybrid amplifiers, it is divided by two to obtain the voltage V2 applied to R2.
Comparator C2 switches when I4=I2. I4 is defined by:
            VL
       I4 =      [G HR × G FO ]                 (Equation 9)
            R4
Setting I4=I2, and combining the above equations results in:
                  R4 [G MA × G TX × G HA ]
       VL = VM ×     ×                          (Equation 10)
                  R2     [G HR × G FO × 2]
This equation defines the line voltage at Tip/Ring necessary to switch comparator C2 in the presence of a
microphone voltage. The highest VL occurs when the circuit is in the transmit mode (GTX = +6.0dB). Using the
typical numbers for Equation 10 yields:
     VL=840VM (or VM=0.0019 VL)              (Equation 11)
At idle, where the gain of the two attenuators is –20dB (0.1V/V), Equations 6 and 10 yield the same result:
    VM=0.024VL (Equation 12)
Equations 7, 11 and 12 define the thresholds for switching, and are represented in the following graph:
                                             Figure 11. Switching Threshold
The “M” terms are the slopes of the lines (0.52,0.024, and 0.0019) which are the coefficients of the three equations.
The MRX line represents the receive to transmit threshold in that it defines the microphone signal level necessary
to switch to transmit in the presence of a given receive signal level. The MTX line represents the transmit to receive
threshold, The MI line represents the idle condition, and defines the threshold level on one side (transmit or receive)
necessary to overcome noise on the other. Some comments on the above graph:
 - Acoustic coupling and side tone coupling were not included in Equations 7 and 12. Those couplings will affect the
   actual performance of the final speakerphone due to their interaction with speech at the microphone, and the
   receive signal coming in at Tip/Ring. The effects of those couplings are difficult to predict due to their associated
   phase shifts and frequency response. In some cases the coupling signal will add, and other times subtract from
   the incoming signal. The physical design of the speakerphone enclosure, as well as the specific phone line to
   which it is connected , will affect the acoustic and side tone couplings, respectively.
 - The MRX line helps define the maximum acoustic coupling allowed in a system, which can be found from the
   following equation:
                          R1
          GAC-MAX =                             (Equation 13)

Switching Threshold (Continue)
Helps determine the minimum slope of that line. Using the component values in Equation 13 yields a GAC-MAX of
–37dB. Experience has shown, however, that an acoustic coupling loss of >40dB is desirable.
 - The MTX line helps define the maximum side tone coupling (GST) allowed in the system, which can be found
from the following equation:
                   R4
      GST =                                   (Equation 14)
             2 × R2 × G FO
Using the component values in Equation 14 yields a maximum side tone of 0dB. Experience has shown, however,
that a minimum of 6.0dB loss is preferable.
The above equations can be used to determine the resistor values for the level detector inputs. Equation 6 can be
used to determine the R1/R3 ratio, and Equation 10 can be used to determine the R4/R2 ratio. In Figure 10, R1-R4
each represent the combined impedance of the resistor and coupling capacitor at each level detector input. The
magnitude of each RC’s impedance should be kept within the range of 2.0K-15KΩ in the voice band (due to the
typical signal levels present) to obtain the best performance from the level detectors. The specific R and C at each
location will determine the frequency response of that level detector.
Dial Tone Detector
The threshold for the dial tone detector is internally set at 15mV (10mVrms) below VB (see Figure 5). That
threshold can be reduced by connecting a resistor from RXI to ground. The resistor value is calculated from:
                V       
      R=  10K  B −1
                 €V     
Where VB is the voltage at Pin 15, and ΔV is the amount of threshold reduction. By connecting a resistor from Vcc
to RXI, the threshold can be increased. The resistor value is calculated from:
                 V − VB 
      R=  10K  CC          − 1
                 €V           
Where ΔV is the amount of threshold increase.
Background Noise Monitors
For testing or circuit analysis purposes, the transmit or receive attenuators can be set to the “on” position, by
disabling the background noise monitors, and applying a signal so as to activate the level detectors. Grounding the
CPR pin will disable the receive background noise monitor, thereby indicating the “presence of speech” to the
attenuator control block. Grounding CPT does the same for the transmit path.
Additionally, the receive background noise monitor is automatically disabled by the dial tone detector whenever the
receive signal exceeds the detector’s threshold.
RFI Interference
Potential radio frequency interference problems should be addressed early in the electrical and mechanical design
of the speakerphone. RFI may enter the circuit through Tip and Ring, through the microphone wiring to the
microphone amplifier, or through any of the PC board trances. The most sensitive pins on the TS34118 are the
inputs to the level detectors (RLI1, RLI2, TLI1, TLI2) since, when there is no speech present, the inputs are high
impedance and these op amps are in a near open loop condition. The board traces to these pins should be kept
short, and the resistor and capacitor for each of these pins should be physically close to the pins. Any other high
impedance input pin (MCI, HTI, FI, VLC) should be considered sensitive to RFI signals.

Transmit / Receive Detection Priority
Although the TS34118 was designed to have an idle mode such that the attenuators are halfway between their full
on and full off positions, the idle mode can be biased towards the transmit or the receive side. With this done,
gaining control of the circuit from idle will be easier for that side towards which it is biased since that path will have
less attenuation at idle.
By connecting a resistor from CT (pin 14) to ground, the circuit will be biased towards the transmit side. The
resistor value is calculated from:
                 VB 
       R=  RT       −1
                 €V    
Where R is the added resistor, RT is the resistor normally between pins 14 and 15 (typically 120Ω), and ΔV is the
difference between VB and the voltage at C7 at idle C refer to (Figure 10)
By connecting a resistor from CT (pin 14) to Vcc, the circuit will be biased towards the transmit side. The resistor
value is calculated from:
                 V − VB 
       R=  R T  CC        − 1
                 €V           
R, RT, and ΔV are the same as above. Switching time will be somewhat affected in each case due to the different
voltage excursions required to get to transmit and receive from idle. For practical considerations, the ΔV shift
should not exceed 100mV.
Volume Control
If a potentiometer with a standard linear taper is used for the volume control, In situations where this may be
objectionable, a potentiometer with an audio taper (commonly used in radio volume controls) will provide a more
linear relationship as indicated in Figure 12. The slight non-linearity at each end of the graph is due to the physical
construction of the potentiometer, and will vary among different manufactures.

The Final Analysis
Proper operation of a speakerphone is a combination of proper mechanical (acoustic) design as well as proper
electronic design. The acoustics of the enclosure must be considered early in the design of a speakerphone. In
general, electronics cannot compensate for poor acoustics, low speaker quality, or any combination of the two.
Proper acoustic separation of the speaker and microphone, as described in the Design Equations, is essential. The
physical location of the microphone, along with the characteristics of the selected microphone, will play a large role
in the quality of the transmitted sound. The microphone and speaker vendors can usually provide additional
information on the use of their products. In the final analysis, the circuits shown in this datasheet will have to be
“fine tuned” to match the acoustics of the enclosure, the specific hybrid, and the specific microphone and speaker
selected. The component values shown in this datasheet should be considered as starting points only. The gains of
the transmit and receive paths are easily adjusted at the microphone and speaker amplifiers, respectively, The
switching response can then be fine turned by varying (in small steps) the components at the level detector inputs
until satisfactory operation is obtained for both long and short lines
