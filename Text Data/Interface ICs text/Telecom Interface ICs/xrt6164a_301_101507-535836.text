GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The XRT6164A is a CMOS analog chip intended for general purpose line interface applications at bit rates up to
1.544Mbps (T1). It contains both receive and transmit circuitry in a 16-pin dual-in-line plastic (PDIP) package. The
receiver is designed for short line applications having a cable loss up to 10dB measured at the half bit rate. The
transmitter has open collector line driver outputs that are capable of handling up to 40mA. When used in conjunction
with either XRT6165 or XRT6166, the chip set provides a 64Kbps codirectional interface as specified in CCITT G.703.
