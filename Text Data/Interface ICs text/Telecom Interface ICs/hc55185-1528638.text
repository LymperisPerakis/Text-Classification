NOTES:
  1. Add "96" suffix for tape and reel. Please refer to TB347 for details on reel specifications.
  2. These Intersil Pb-free plastic packaged products employ special Pb-free material sets, molding compounds/die attach materials, and 100% matte
     tin plate plus anneal (e3 termination finish, which is RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations). Intersil
     Pb-free products are MSL classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-
     020.
  3. For Moisture Sensitivity Level (MSL), please see device information page for HC55185. For more information on MSL please see tech brief

NOTES:
  5. Characterized with 2 x 10s, and 10 x 1000s first level lightning surge waveforms (GR-1089-CORE).
  6. JA is measured with the component mounted on a low effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See Tech Brief TB379 for details.
  7. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. See
     Tech Brief TB379.
  8. For JC, the “case temp” location is the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside.

NOTES:
 9. These parameters are controlled via design or process parameters and are not directly tested. These parameters are characterized upon initial
    design release and upon design changes which would affect these characteristics.
10. Differential Ringing Gain is measured with VRS = 0.795VRMS for -100V devices, VRS = 0.663 VRMS for -85V devices and VRS = 0.575VRMS
    for -75V devices.
11. Longitudinal Balance is tested per IEEE455-1985, with 368 per Tip and Ring terminal.
12. The power dissipation is based on actual device measurements and will be less than worst case calculations based on data sheet supply current
    limits.
13. For Unbalanced Ringing the Tip terminal is offset to 0V and the Ring terminal is centered at Vbh/2 + 0.5V.
14. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design.

 PLCC  QFN    SYMBOL                                                        DESCRIPTION
   1    29       TIP TIP power amplifier output.
   2    30     BGND  Battery Ground - To be connected to zero potential. All loop current and longitudinal current flow from this ground.
                     Internally separate from AGND but it is recommended that it is connected to the same potential as AGND.
   3    31      VBL  Low battery supply connection.
   4    32      VBH  High battery supply connection for the most negative battery.
   5     1      SW+  Uncommitted switch positive terminal.
   6     2      SW-  Uncommitted switch negative terminal.
   7     3     SWC   Switch control input. This TTL compatible input controls the uncommitted switch, with a logic “0” enabling the switch
                     and logic “1” disabling the switch. The logic control is disabled in the Power Denial state, forcing the switch to the open
                     state
   8     4       F2  Mode Control Input - MSB. F2-F0 for the TTL compatible parallel control interface for controlling the various modes of
                     operation of the device.
   9     5       F1  Mode control input.
  10     6       F0  Mode control input.
  11     7       E0  Detector Output Selection Input. This TTL input controls the multiplexing of the SHD (E0 = 1) and GKD (E0 = 0) comparator
                     outputs to the DET output based upon the state at the F2-F0 pins (see the Device Operating Modes table shown on page 2).
  12     9      DET  Detector Output - This TTL output provides on-hook/off-hook status of the loop based upon the selected operating
                     mode. The detected output will either be switch hook, ground key or ring trip (see the Device Operating Modes table
                     shown on page 2).
  13    10      ALM  Thermal Shutdown Alarm. This pin signals the internal die temperature has exceeded safe operating temperature
                     (approximately 175°C) and the device has been powered down automatically.
  14    11     AGND  Analog ground reference. This pin should be externally connected to BGND.
  15    12     BSEL  Selects between high and low battery, with a logic “1” selecting the high battery and logic “0” the low battery.
  16    13       TL  Programming pin for the transient current limit feature, set by an external resistor to ground.
  17    14      POL  External capacitor on this pin sets the polarity reversal time.
  18    15      VRS  Ringing Signal Input - Analog input for driving 2-wire interface while in Ring Mode.
  19    17      VRX  Analog Receive Voltage - 4-wire analog audio input voltage. AC couples to CODEC.
  20    18      VTX  Transmit Output Voltage - Output of impedance matching amplifier, AC couples to CODEC.
  21    19      VFB  Feedback voltage for impedance matching. This voltage is scaled to accomplish impedance matching.
  22    20       -IN Impedance matching amplifier summing node.
  23    21      VCC  Positive voltage power supply, usually +5V.
  24    22      CDC  DC Biasing Filter Capacitor - Connects between this pin and VCC.
  25    23      RTD  Ring trip filter network.
  26    24      ILIM Loop Current Limit programming resistor.
  27    25       RD  Switch hook detection threshold programming resistor.
  28     27    RING  RING power amplifier output.

     and E1 include mold mismatch and are measured at the extreme
     material condition at the body parting line.
  4. To be measured at seating plane -C- contact point.
  5. Centerline to be determined where center leads exit plastic body.
  6. “N” is the number of terminal positions.
