8. Functional description
                       Both transmission and reception stages are controlled either by the master clock of the
                       microcontroller or by the on-chip reference oscillator connected to a crystal. This ensures
                       the accuracy of the transmission carrier and the exact trimming of the digital filter, thus
                       making the performance totally independent of application disturbances such as
                       component spread, temperature, supply drift and so on.
                       The interface with the power network is made by means of an LC network (see Figure 15).
                       The device includes a power output stage that feeds a 120 dBμV (RMS) signal on a
                       typical 30 Ω load.
                       To reduce power consumption, the IC is disabled by a power-down input (pin PD): in this
                       mode, the on-chip oscillator remains active and the clock continues to be supplied at
                       pin CLK_OUT. For low-power operation in reception mode, this pin can be dynamically
                       controlled by the microcontroller, see Section 8.4 “Power-down mode”.
                       When the circuit is connected to an external clock generator (see Figure 6), the clock
                       signal must be applied at pin OSC1 (pin 7); OSC2 (pin 8) must be left open-circuit.
                       Figure 7 shows the use of the on-chip clock circuit.
                       All logic inputs and outputs are compatible with TTL/CMOS levels, providing an easy
                       connection to a standard microcontroller I/O port.
                       The digital part of the IC is fully scan-testable. Two digital inputs, SCANTEST and TEST1,
                       are used for production test: these pins must be left open-circuit in functional mode
                       (correct levels are internally defined by pull-up or pull-down resistors).
                   8.1 Transmission mode
                       To provide strict stability with respect to environmental conditions, the carrier frequency is
                       generated by scanning the ROM memory under the control of the microcontroller clock or
                       the reference frequency provided by the on-chip oscillator. High frequency clocking rejects
                       the aliasing components to such an extent that they are filtered by the coupling
                       LC network and do not cause any significant disturbance. The data modulation is applied
                       through pin DATA_IN and smoothly applied by specific digital circuits to the carrier
                       (shaping). Harmonic components are limited in this process, thus avoiding unacceptable
                       disturbance of the transmission channel (according to CISPR16 and EN50065-1
                       recommendations). A −55 dB Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is reached when the typical
                       LC coupling network (or an equivalent filter) is used.
                       The DAC and the power stage are set in order to provide a maximum signal level of
                       122 dBμV (RMS) at the output.
                       The output of the power stage (TX_OUT) must always be connected to a decoupling
                       capacitor, because of a DC level of 0.5VDD at this pin, which is present even when the
                       device is not transmitting. This pin must also be protected against overvoltage and
                       negative transient signals. The DC level of TX_OUT can be used to bias a unipolar
                       transient suppressor, as shown in the application diagram (see Figure 15).
                       Direct connection to the mains is done through an LC network for low-cost applications.
                       However, an HF signal transformer could be used when power-line insulation has to be
                       performed.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                    TDA5051A
                                                                                                                   Home automation modem
                       Remark: In transmission mode, the receiving part of the circuit is not disabled and the
                       detection of the transmitted signal is normally performed. In this mode, the gain chosen
                       before the beginning of the transmission is stored, and the AGC is internally set to
                       −6 dB as long as DATA_IN is LOW. Then, the old gain setting is automatically restored.
                   8.2 Reception mode
                       The input signal received by the modem is applied to a wide range input amplifier with
                       AGC (−6 dB to +30 dB). This is basically for noise performance improvement and signal
                       level adjustment, which ensures a maximum sensitivity of the ADC. An 8-bit conversion is
                       then performed, followed by digital band-pass filtering, to meet the CISPR16
                       normalization and to comply with some additional limitations met in current applications.
                       After digital demodulation, the baseband data signal is made available after pulse
                       shaping.
                       The signal pin (RX_IN) is a high-impedance input which has to be protected and
                       DC decoupled for the same reasons as with pin TX_OUT. The high sensitivity (82 dBμV)
                       of this input requires an efficient 50 Hz rejection filter (realized by the LC coupling
                       network), which also acts as an anti-aliasing filter for the internal digital processing;
                       (see Figure 15).
                   8.3 Data format
                8.3.1 Transmission mode
                       The data input (DATA_IN) is active LOW: this means that a burst is generated on the line
                       (pin TX_OUT) when DATA_IN pin is LOW.
                       Pin TX_OUT is in a high-impedance state as long as the device is not transmitting.
                       Successive logic 1s are treated in a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) mode, see pulse shapes
                       in Figure 8 and Figure 9.
                8.3.2 Reception mode
                       The data output (pin DATA_OUT) is active LOW; this means that the data output is LOW
                       when a burst is received. Pin DATA_OUT remains LOW as long as a burst is received.
                   8.4 Power-down mode
                       Power-down input (pin PD) is active HIGH; this means that the power consumption is
                       minimum when pin PD is HIGH. Now, all functions are disabled, except clock generation.

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 25) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all

                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 25.
