DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The DS21348 is a complete selectable E1 or T1 line interface unit (LIU) for short-haul and long-haul
applications. Throughout the data sheet, J1 is represented wherever T1 exists. Receive sensitivity adjusts
automatically to the incoming signal and can be programmed for 0dB to 12dB or 0dB to 43dB for E1
applications and 0dB to 30dB or 0dB to 36dB for T1 applications. The device can generate the necessary
G.703 E1 waveshapes in 75Ω or 120Ω applications and DSX-1 line build-outs or CSU line build-outs of
0dB, -7.5dB, -15dB, and -22.5dB for T1 applications. The crystal-less on-board jitter attenuator requires
only a 2.048MHz MCLK for both E1 and T1 applications (with the option of using a 1.544MHz MCLK
in T1 applications). The jitter attenuator FIFO is selectable to either 32 bits or 128 bits in depth and can
be placed in either the transmit or receive data paths. An X 2.048MHz output clock synthesized to RCLK
is available for use as a backplane system clock (where n = 1, 2, 4, or 8).
The DS21348 has diagnostic capabilities such as loopbacks and PRBS pattern generation/detection. 16-
bit loop-up and loop-down codes can be generated and detected. The device can be controlled through an
8-bit parallel muxed or nonmuxed port, serial port, or used in hardware mode. The device fully meets all
of the latest E1 and T1 specifications including ANSI T1.403-1999, ANSI T1.408, AT&T TR 62411,
ITU G.703, G.704, G.706, G.736, G.775, G.823, I.431, O.151, O.161, ETSI ETS 300 166, JTG.703,

1. INTRODUCTION
The analog AMI/HDB3 waveform off of the E1 line or the AMI/B8ZS waveform off of the T1 line is
transformer coupled into the RTIP and RRING pins of the DS21348. The user has the option to use
internal termination, software selectable for 75Ω/100Ω/120Ω applications, or external termination. The
device recovers clock and data from the analog signal and passes it through the jitter attenuation MUX
outputting the received line clock at RCLK and bipolar or NRZ data at RPOS and RNEG. The DS21348
contains an active filter that reconstructs the analog received signal for the nonlinear losses that occur in
transmission. The receive circuitry is also configurable for various monitor applications. The device has a
usable receive sensitivity of 0dB to -43dB for E1 and 0dB to -36dB for T1, which allows the device to
operate on 0.63mm (22AWG) cables up to 2.5km (E1) and 6k feet (T1) in length. Data input at TPOS and
TNEG is sent via the jitter attenuation mux to the waveshaping circuitry and line driver. The DS21348
will drive the E1 or T1 line from the TTIP and TRING pins via a coupling transformer. The line driver
can handle both CEPT 30/ISDN-PRI lines for E1 and long-haul (CSU) or short-haul (DSX-1) lines for
T1.

                           Address Bus. In nonmultiplexed bus operation (BIS1 = 0, BIS0 =
  A0 to A4   11 to 7   I   1), serves as the address bus. In multiplexed bus operation (BIS1 =
                           0, BIS0 = 0), these pins are not used and should be tied low.
                           Address Latch Enable (Address Strobe). When using the parallel
                           port (BIS1 = 0) in multiplexed bus mode (BIS0 = 0), serves to
 ALE (AS)        4     I
                           demultiplex the bus on a positive-going edge. In nonmultiplexed bus
                           mode (BIS0 = 1), should be tied low.
                           Bus Interface Select Bits 0 and 1. Used to select bus interface
 BIS0/BIS1    32/33    I
                           option. See Table 2-1 for details.
                           Backplane Clock. A 16.384MHz, 8.192MHz, 4.096MHz, or
                           2.048MHz clock output that is referenced to RCLK selectable via
  BPCLK         31    O
                           CCR5.7 and CCR5.6. In hardware mode, defaults to 16.384MHz
                           output.
                           Chip Select, Active Low. This active-low signal must be low to
     CS          1     I
                           read or write to the device.
                           Data Bus/Address/Data Bus. In nonmultiplexed bus operation
 D0/AD0 to                 (BIS1 = 0, BIS0 = 1), serves as the data bus. In multiplexed bus
            19 to 12 I/O
  D7/AD7                   operation (BIS1 = 0, BIS0 = 0), serves as an 8-bit multiplexed
                           address/data bus.
                           Hardware Reset, Active Low. Bringing HRST low resets the
   HRST         29     I
                           DS21348, setting all control bits to their default state of all zeros.
                           Interrupt, Active Low. Flags host controller during conditions and
    INT         23    O    change of conditions defined in the Status Register. Active low,
                           open drain output.
                           Master Clock. A 2.048MHz (±50ppm) clock source with TTL
                           levels is applied at this pin. This clock is used internally for both
   MCLK         30     I
                           clock/data recovery and for jitter attenuation. Use of a T1 1.544MHz
                           clock source is optional.
    N/A         —      I   Not Assigned. Should be tied low.
                           PRBS Bit Error Output. The receiver will constantly search for a
                           215-1 or a 220-1 PRBS depending on the ETS bit setting (CCR1.7).
                           Remains high if out of synchronization with the PRBS pattern. Goes
                           low when synchronized to the PRBS pattern. Any errors in the
   PBEO         24    O
                           received pattern after synchronization will cause a positive going
                           pulse (with same period as E1 or T1 clock) synchronous with
                           RCLK. PRBS bit errors can also be reported to the ECR1 and ECR2
                           registers by setting CCR6.2 to a logic 1.

                  set high to select Motorola bus timing, set low to select Intel bus
                  timing. This pin controls the function of the RD (DS), ALE (AS),
 PBTS     44    I
                  and WR (R/W) pins. If PBTS = 1 and BIS1 = 0, then these pins

                   Master Clock. A 2.048MHz (±50ppm) clock source with TTL
                   levels is applied at this pin. This clock is used internally for both
                   clock/data recovery and for jitter attenuation. Use of a T1 1.544MHz
  MCLK     30    I
                   clock source is optional. G.703 requires an accuracy of ±50ppm for
                   both T1 and E1. TR62411 and ANSI specs require an accuracy of
                   ±32ppm for T1 interfaces.
                   Monitor Mode Select Bits 0 and 1 [H/W Mode]. These inputs
MM0/MM1  18/19   I

  NRZE      3    I
                   1 = NRZ data at RPOS and TPOS or TNEG; RNEG outputs a
                   positive going pulse when device receives a BPV, CV, or EXZ.
                   PRBS Bit Error Output. The receiver will constantly search for a
                   QRSS (T1) or a 215-1 (E1) PRBS depending whether T1 or E1
                   mode is selected. Remains high if out of synchronization with the
   PBEO    24   O  PRBS pattern. Goes low when synchronized to the PRBS pattern.
                   Any errors in the received pattern after synchronization will cause a
                   positive going pulse (with same period as E1 or T1 clock)
                   synchronous with RCLK.

  RNEG     39   O
                   mode, data will be output on RPOS while a received error will cause
                   a positive-going pulse synchronous with RCLK at RNEG. See
                   Section 6.4 for details.
                   Receive Positive Data. Updated on the rising edge (CES = 0) or the

 3. HARDWARE MODE
 In hardware mode (BIS1 = 1, BIS0 = 1), pins 1–19, 23, 25, 31, and 44 are redefined to be used for
 initializing the DS21348. BPCLK (pin 31) defaults to a 16.384MHz output when in hardware mode. The
 RCL/LOTC (pin 25) is designated to RCL when in hardware mode. JABDS (CCR4.2) defaults to logic 0.
 The RHBE (CCR2.3) and THBE (CCR2.2) control bits are combined and controlled by HBE at pin 11
 while the RSCLKE (CCR5.3) and TSCLKE (CCR5.2) bits are combined and controlled by SCLKE at
 pin 4. TCES (CCR2.1) and RCES (CCR2.0) are combined and controlled by CES at pin 12. The
 transmitter functions are combined and controlled by TX1 (pin 15) and TX0 (pin 14). The loopback
 functions are controlled by LOOP1 (pin 17) and LOOP0 (pin 16). All other control bits default to the
 logic 0 setting.

Note 1:     Register addresses 16h to 1Fh do not exist.
Note 2:     In the Serial Port Mode, the LSB is on the right hand side.
Note 3:     In the Serial Port Mode, data is read and written LSB first.
Note 4:     In the Serial Port Mode, the A bit (the LSB) determines whether the access is a read (A = 1) or a write (A = 0).
Note 5:     In the Serial Port Mode, the B bit (the MSB) determines whether the access is a burst access (B = 1) or a single register
            access (B = 0).

3.2 Parallel Port Operation
When using the parallel interface on the DS21348 (BIS1 = 0) the user has the option for either
multiplexed bus operation (BIS1 = 0, BIS0 = 0) or non-multiplexed bus operation (BIS1 = 0, BIS0 = 1).
The DS21348 can operate with either Intel or Motorola bus timing configurations. If the PBTS pin is tied
low, Intel timing will be selected; if tied high, Motorola timing will be selected. All Motorola bus signals
are listed in parentheses (). See the timing diagrams in Section 11 for more details.
3.3 Serial Port Operation
Setting BIS1 = 1 and BIS0 = 0 enables the serial bus interface on the DS21348. Port read/write timing is
unrelated to the system transmit and receive timing, allowing asynchronous reads or writes by the host.
See Section 11 for the AC timing of the serial port. All serial port accesses are LSB first. See Figure 3-1,
Figure 3-2, Figure 3-3, and Figure 3-4 for more details.
Reading or writing to the internal registers requires writing one address/command byte prior to
transferring register data. The first bit written (LSB) of the address/command byte specifies whether the
access is a read (1) or a write (0). The next 5 bits identify the register address. Bit 7 is reserved and must
be set to 0 for proper operation.
The last bit (MSB) of the address/command byte is the burst mode bit. When the burst bit is enabled
(B = 1) and a READ operation is performed, addresses 0 through 15h are read sequentially, starting at
address 0h. And when the burst bit is enabled and a WRITE operation is performed, addresses 0 through
16h are written sequentially, starting at address 0h. Burst operation is stopped once address 15h is read.
See Figure 3-5 and Figure 3-6 for more details.
All data transfers are initiated by driving the CS input low. When Input Clock-Edge Select (ICES) is low,
input data is latched on the rising edge of SCLK and when ICES is high, input data is latched on the
falling edge of SCLK. When Output Clock-Edge Select (OCES) is low, data is output on the falling edge
of SCLK and when OCES is high, data is output on the rising edge of SCLK. Data is held until the next
falling or rising edge. All data transfers are terminated if the CS input transitions high. Port control logic
is disabled and SDO is tri-stated when CS is high.

                     cycle to load the error counter registers with the latest counts and reset
                     the counters. The user must wait a minimum of two clocks cycles (976ns
                     for E1 and 1296ns for T1) before reading the error count registers to
                     allow for a proper update. See Section 4 and Figure 1-2 for details.

   CLDS      CCR2.4    Custom Line Driver Select. Setting this bit to a one will redefine the
                       operation of the transmit line driver. When this bit is set to a one and
                       CCR4.5 = CCR4.6 = CCR4.7 = 0, then the device will generate a square
                       wave at the TTIP and TRING outputs instead of a normal waveform.
                       When this bit is set to a one and CCR4.5 = CCR4.6 = CCR4.7 ≠ 0, then
                       the device will force TTIP and TRING outputs to become open drain
                       drivers instead of their normal push-pull operation. This bit should be set
                       to zero for normal operation of the device. Contact the factory for more
                       details on how to use this bit.

                    bit must be set to a one to allow the device to transmit data. The
                    transmission of this data pattern is always timed off of the JACLK (See

  LIRST     CCR3.2  Line Interface Reset. Setting this bit from a zero to a one will initiate an
                    internal reset that resets the clock recovery state machine and re-centers
                    the jitter attenuator. Normally this bit is only toggled on power-up. Must
                    be cleared and set again for a subsequent reset.
  IBPV      CCR3.1  Insert BPV. A 0 to 1 transition on this bit will cause a single BiPolar
                    Violation (BPV) to be inserted into the transmit data stream. Once this bit
                    has been toggled from a 0 to a 1, the device waits for the next occurrence
                    of three consecutive ones to insert the BPV. This bit must be cleared and
                    set again for a subsequent error to be inserted (Figure 1-3).
   IBE      CCR3.0  Insert Bit Error. A 0 to 1 transition on this bit will cause a single logic
                    error to be inserted into the transmit data stream. This bit must be cleared
                    and set again for a subsequent error to be inserted (Figure 1-3).

4.1 Device Power-Up and Reset
The DS21348 will reset itself upon power-up setting all writeable registers to 00h and clear the status and
information registers. CCR3.7 (TUA1) = 0 results in the LIU transmitting unframed all ones. After the
power supplies have settled following power-up, initialize all control registers to the desired settings, then
toggle the LIRST bit (CCR3.2). At anytime, the DS21348 can be reset to the default settings by bringing
HRST (pin 29) low (level triggered) or by powering down and powering up again.

  LLB     CCR6.7  Local Loopback. In Local Loopback (LLB), transmit data will be looped back
                  to the receive path passing through the jitter attenuator if it is enabled. Data in
                  the transmit path will act as normal. See Figure 1-1 and Section 6.2.2 for
                  details.
                  0 = loopback disabled
                  1 = loopback enabled
  RLB     CCR6.6  Remote Loopback. In Remote Loopback (RLB), data output from the
                  clock/data recovery circuitry will be looped back to the transmit path passing
                  through the jitter attenuator if it is enabled. Data in the receive path will act as
                  normal while data presented at TPOS and TNEG will be ignored.
                  See Figure 1-1 and Section 6.2.1 for details.

 ARLBE    CCR6.5  Automatic Remote Loopback Enable and Reset. When this bit is set high,
                  the device will automatically go into remote loopback when it detects loop up
                  code programmed into the Receive Loop-Up Code Definition Registers
                  (RUPCD1 and RUPCD2) for a minimum of 5 seconds and it will also set the
                  RIR2.1 status bit. Once in a RLB state, it will remain in this state until it has
                  detected the loop code programmed into the Receive Loop-Down Code
                  Definition Registers (RDNCD1 and RDNCD2) for a minimum of 5 seconds at
                  which point it will force the device out of RLB and clear RIR2.1. The
                  automatic RLB circuitry can be reset by toggling this bit from a 1 to a 0. The
                  action of the automatic remote loopback circuitry is logically ORed with the
                  RLB (CCR6.6) control bit (i.e., either one can cause a RLB to occur).
  ALB     CCR6.4  Analog Loopback. In Analog Loopback (ALB), signals at TTIP and TRING
                  will be internally connected to RTIP and RRING. The incoming signals, from
                  the line, at RTIP and RRING will be ignored. The signals at TTIP and TRING
                  will be transmitted as normal. See Figure 1-1 and Section 6.2.3 for more details.

                  1 = loopback enabled
  RJAB    CCR6.3  RCLK Jitter Attenuator Bypass. This control bit allows the receive recovered
                  clock and data to bypass the jitter attenuation while still allowing the BPCLK
                  output to use the jitter attenuator. See Figure 1-1 and Section 7.3 for details.

5. STATUS REGISTERS
There are three registers that contain information on the current real-time status of the device, Status
Register (SR) and Receive Information Registers 1 and 2 (RIR1/RIR2). When a particular event has
occurred (or is occurring), the appropriate bit in one of these three registers will be set to a one. Some of
the bits in SR, RIR1, and RIR2 are latched bits and some are real time bits. The register descriptions
below list which status bits are latched and which are real time bits. For latched status bits, when an event
or an alarm occurs the bit is set to a one and will remain set until the user reads that bit. The bit will be
cleared when it is read and it will not be set again until the event has occurred again. Two of the latched
status bits (RUA1 and RCL) will remain set after reading if the alarm is still present.
The user will always precede a read of any of the three status registers with a write. The byte written to
the register will inform the DS21348 which bits the user wishes to read and have cleared. The user will
write a byte to one of these registers with a one in the bit positions to be read and a zero in the other bit
positions. When a one is written to a bit location, that location will be updated with the latest information.
When a zero is written to a bit position, that bit position will not be updated and the previous value will
be held. A write to the status and information registers will be immediately followed by a read of the
same register. The read result should be logically ANDed with the mask byte that was just written and
this value should be written back into the same register to insure that bit does indeed clear. This second
write step is necessary because the alarms and events in the status registers occur asynchronously with
respect to their access via the parallel port. This write-read-write scheme allows an external
microcontroller or microprocessor to individually poll certain bits without disturbing the other bits in the
register. This operation is key in controlling the DS21348 with higher-order software languages.
The bits in the SR register have the unique ability to initiate a hardware interrupt via the INT output pin.
Each of the alarms and events in the SR can be either masked or unmasked from the interrupt pin via the
Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). The interrupts caused by the RCL, RUA1, and LOTC bits in SR act
differently than the interrupts caused by the other status bits in SR. The RCL, RUA1 and LOTC bits will
force the INT pin low whenever they change state (i.e., go active or inactive). The INT pin will be
allowed to return high (if no other interrupts are present) when the user reads the alarm bit that caused the
interrupt to occur even if the alarm is still present. The other status bits in SR can force the INT pin low
when they are set. The INT pin will be allowed to return high (if no other interrupts are present) when the
user reads the event bit that caused the interrupt to occur.

6. DIAGNOSTICS
6.1 In-Band Loop Code Generation and Detection
The DS21348 can generate and detect a repeating bit pattern that is from one to eight or sixteen bits in
length. To transmit a pattern, the user will load the pattern to be sent into the Transmit Code Definition
(TCD1 and TCD2) registers and select the proper length of the pattern by setting the TC0 and TC1 bits in
the In-Band Code Control (IBCC) register. When generating a 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bit pattern both the
transmit code registers (TCD1 and TCD2) must be filled with the proper code. Generation of a 1, 3, 5, or
7-bit pattern only requires TCD1 to be filled. Once this is accomplished, the pattern will be transmitted as
long as the TLCE control bit (CCR3.3) is enabled. As an example, if the user wished to transmit the
standard “loop up” code for Channel Service Units which is a repeating pattern of ...10000100001... then
80h would be loaded into TCD1 and the length would set using TC1 and TC0 in the IBCC register to 5
bits.
The DS21348 can detect two separate repeating patterns to allow for both a “loop up” code and a “loop
down” code to be detected. The user will program the codes to be detected in the Receive Up Code
Definition (RUPCD1 and RUPCD2) registers and the Receive Down Code Definition (RDNCD1 and
RDNCD2) registers and the length of each pattern will be selected via the IBCC register. The DS21348
will detect repeating pattern codes with bit error rates as high as 1x10-2. The code detector has a nominal
integration period of 48ms, hence, after about 48ms of receiving either code, the proper status bit (LUP at
SR.7 and LDN at SR.6) will be set to a one. Normally codes are sent for a period of 5 seconds. It is
recommended that the software poll the DS21348 every 100ms to 1000ms until 5 seconds has elapsed to
insure that the code is continuously present.

6.2 Loopbacks
6.2.1 Remote Loopback (RLB)
 When RLB (CCR6.6) is enabled, the DS21348 is placed into remote loopback. In this loopback, data
from the clock/data recovery state machine will be looped back to the transmit path passing through the
jitter attenuator if it is enabled. The data at the RPOS and RNEG pins will be valid while data presented
at TPOS and TNEG will be ignored. See Figure 1-1 for details.
If the Automatic Remote Loop Back Enable (CCR6.5) is set to a one, the DS21348 will automatically go
into remote loop back when it detects the loop-up code programmed in the Receive Up Code Definition
Registers (RUPCD1 and RUPCD2) for a minimum of 5 seconds. When the DS21348 detects the loop
down code programmed in the Receive Loop-Down Code Definition registers (RDNCD1 and RDNCD2)
for a minimum of 5 seconds, the DS21348 will come out of remote loop back. The ARLB can also be
disabled by setting ARLBE to a zero.
6.2.2 Local Loopback (LLB)
When LLB (CCR6.7) is set to a one, the DS21348 is placed into Local Loopback. In this loopback, data
on the transmit-side will continue to be transmitted as normal. TCLK and TPOS/TNEG will pass through
the jitter attenuator (if enabled) and be output at RCLK and RPOS/RNEG. Incoming data from the line at
RTIP and RRING will be ignored. If Transmit Unframed All Ones (CCR3.7) is set to a one while in LLB,
TTIP and TRING will transmit all ones while TCLK and TPOS/TNEG will be looped back to RCLK and
RPOS/RNEG. See Figure 1-1 for more details.
6.2.3 Analog Loopback (ALB)
Setting ALB (CCR6.4) to a one puts the DS21348 in Analog Loopback. Signals at TTIP and TRING will
be internally connected to RTIP and RRING. The incoming signals at RTIP and RRING will be ignored.
The signals at TTIP and TRING will be transmitted as normal. See Figure 1-1 for more details.
6.2.4 Dual Loopback (DLB)
Setting both CCR6.7 and CCR6.6 to a one, LLB and RLB respectively, puts the DS21348 into Dual
Loopback operation. The TCLK and TPOS/TNEG signals will be looped back through the jitter
attenuator (if enabled) and output at RCLK and RPOS/RNEG. Clock and data recovered from RTIP and
RRING will be looped back to the transmit-side and output at TTIP and TRING. This mode of operation
is not available when implementing hardware operation. See Figure 1-1 for more details.

6.3 PRBS Generation and Detection
Setting TPRBSE (CCR3.4) = 1 enables the DS21348 to transmit a 215 - 1 (E1) or a 220 - 1 (T1) Pseudo-
Random Bit Sequence (PRBS) depending on the ETS bit setting in CCR1.7. The receive-side of the
DS21348 will always search for these PRBS patterns independent of CCR3.4. The PRBS Bit Error
Output (PBEO) will remain high until the receiver has synchronized to one of the two patterns (64 bits
received without an error) at which time PBEO will go low and the PRBSD bit in the Status Register
(SR) will be set. Once synchronized, any bit errors received will cause a positive going pulse at PBEO,
synchronous with RCLK. This output can be used with external circuitry to keep track of bit error rates
during the PRBS testing. Setting CCR6.0 (ECRS) = 1 will allow the PRBS errors to be accumulated in
the 16-bit counter in registers ECR1 and ECR2. The PRBS synchronizer will remain in sync until it
experiences 6 bit errors or more within a 64-bit span. Both PRBS patterns comply with the ITU-T O.151
specifications.
6.4 Error Counter
Error Count Register 1 (ECR1) is the most significant word and ECR2 is the least significant word of a
user selectable 16-bit counter that records incoming errors including BiPolar Violations (BPV), Code
Violations (CV), Excessive Zero violations (EXZ) and/or PRBS Errors. See Table 6-3 and Table 6-4 and
Figure 1-2 for details.

6.4.1 Error Counter Update
A transition of the ECUE (CCR1.4) control bit from 0 to 1 will update the ECR registers with the current
values and reset the counters. ECUE must be set back to zero and another 0 to 1 transition must occur for
subsequent reads/resets of the ECR registers. Note that the DS21348 can report errors at RNEG when in
NRZ mode (CCR1.6 = 1) by outputting a pulse for each error occurrence. The counter saturates at 65,535
and will not rollover.

6.5 Error Insertion
When IBPV (CCR3.1) is transitioned from a zero to a one, the device waits for the next occurrence of
three consecutive ones to insert a BPV. IBPV must be cleared and set again for another BPV error
insertion. See Figure 1-3 for details on the insertion of the BPV into the datastream.
When IBE (CCR3.0) is transitioned from a zero to a one, the device will insert a logic error. IBE must be
cleared and set again for another logic error insertion. See Figure 1-3 for details on the insertion of the
logic error into the datasteam.

7. ANALOG INTERFACE
7.1 Receiver
The DS21348 contains a digital clock recovery system. The DS21348 couples to the receive E1 or T1
twisted pair (or coaxial cable in 75Ω E1 applications) via a 1:1 transformer. See Table 7-3 for transformer
details. Figure 7-1, Figure 7-2, and Figure 7-3 along with Table 7-1 and Table 7-2 show the receive
termination requirements. The DS21348 has the option of using internal termination resistors.
The DS21348 is designed to be fully software-selectable for E1 and T1 without the need to change any
external resistors for the receive-side. The receive-side will allow the user to configure the DS21348 for
75Ω, 100Ω, or 120Ω receive termination by setting the RT1 (CCR5.1) and RT0 (CCR5.0) bits. When
using the internal termination feature, the Rr resistors should be 60Ω each. See Figure 7-1 for details. If
external termination is required, RT1 and RT0 should be set to 0 and both Rr resistors in Figure 7-1 will
need to be 37.5Ω, 50Ω, or 60Ω each depending on the line impedance.
The resultant E1 or T1 clock derived from the 2.048/1.544 PLL (JACLK in Figure 1-1) is internally
multiplied by 16 via another internal PLL and fed to the clock recovery system. The clock recovery
system uses the clock from the PLL circuit to form a 16 times oversampler which is used to recover the
clock and data. This oversampling technique offers outstanding performance to meet jitter tolerance
specifications shown in Figure 7-6.
Normally, the clock that is output at the RCLK pin is the recovered clock from the E1 AMI/HDB3 or T1
AMI/B8ZS waveform presented at the RTIP and RRING inputs. When no signal is present at RTIP and
RRING, a Receive Carrier Loss (RCL) condition will occur and the RCLK will be derived from the
JACLK source. See Figure 1-1. If the jitter attenuator is placed in the receive path (as is the case in most
applications), the jitter attenuator restores the RCLK to an approximate 50% duty cycle. If the jitter
attenuator is either placed in the transmit path or is disabled, the RCLK output can exhibit slightly shorter
high cycles of the clock. This is due to the highly oversampled digital clock recovery circuitry. See the
Receive AC Timing Characteristics in Section 11 for more details.
The receive-side circuitry also contains a clock synthesizer which outputs a user configurable clock (up to
16.384MHz) synthesized to RCLK at BPCLK (pin 31). See Table 4-3 for details on output clock
frequencies at BPCLK. In hardware mode, BPCLK defaults to a 16.384MHz output.
The DS21348 has a bypass mode for the receive side clock and data. This allows the BPCLK to be
derived from RCLK after the jitter attenuator while the clock and data presented at RCLK, RPOS, and
RNEG go unaltered. This is intended for applications where the receive side jitter attenuation will be
done after the LIU. Setting RJAB (CCR6.3) to a logic 1 will enable the bypass. Be sure that the jitter
attenuator is in the receive path (CCR4.3 = 0). See Figure 1-1 for details.
The DS21348 will report the signal strength at RTIP and RRING in 2.5dB increments via RL3-RL0
located in the Receive Information Register 2. This feature is helpful when trouble shooting line
performance problems. See Table 5-2 for details.
Monitor applications in both E1 and T1 require various flat gain settings for the receive-side circuitry.
The DS21348 can be programmed to support these applications via the Monitor Mode control bits MM1
and MM0. When the monitor modes are enabled, the receiver will tolerate normal line loss up to -6dB.
See Table 4-4 for details.
                                                    49 of 76


                                                                                        DS21348/DS21Q348
7.2 Transmitter
The DS21348 uses a set of laser-trimmed delay lines along with a precision Digital-to-Analog Converter
(DAC) to create the waveforms that are transmitted onto the E1 or T1 line. The waveforms created by the
DS21348 meet the latest ETSI, ITU, ANSI, and AT&T specifications. The user will select which
waveform is to be generated by setting the ETS bit (CCR1.7) for E1 or T1 operation, then programming
the L2/L1/L0 bits in Common Control Register 4 for the appropriate application. See Table 7-1 and
Table 7-2 for the proper L2/L1/L0 settings.
A 2.048MHz or 1.544MHz TTL clock is required at TCLK for transmitting data at TPOS and TNEG.
ITU specification G.703 requires an accuracy of ±50ppm for both T1 and E1. TR62411 and ANSI specs
require an accuracy of ±32ppm for T1 interfaces. The clock can be sourced internally by RCLK or
JACLK. See CCR1.2, CCR1.1, CCR1.0, and Figure 1-3 for details. Due to the nature of the design of the
transmitter in the DS21348, very little jitter (less than 0.005UIP-P broadband from 10Hz to 100kHz) is
added to the jitter present on TCLK. Also, the waveforms created are independent of the duty cycle of
TCLK. The transmitter in the DS21348 couples to the E1 or T1 transmit twisted pair (or coaxial cable in
some E1 applications) via a 1:2 step-up transformer. In order for the device to create the proper
waveforms, the transformer used must meet the specifications listed in Table 7-3.
The DS21348 has automatic short-circuit limiter which limits the source current to 50mA (RMS) into a
1Ω load. This feature can be disabled by setting the SCLD bit (CCR2.5) = 1. When the current limiter is
activated, TCLE (SR.2) will be set even if short circuit limiter is disabled. The TPD bit (CCR4.0) will
power-down the transmit line driver and tri-state the TTIP and TRING pins. The DS21348 can also detect
when the TTIP or TRING outputs are open circuited. When an open circuit is detected, TOCD (SR.1)
will be set.
7.3 Jitter Attenuator
The DS21348 contains an on-board jitter attenuator that can be set to a depth of either 32 or 128 bits via
the JABDS bit (CCR4.2). In hardware mode the depth is 128 bits and cannot be changed. The 128-bit
mode is used in applications where large excursions of wander are expected. The 32-bit mode is used in
delay sensitive applications. The characteristics of the attenuation are shown in Figure 7-7Figure 7-7. The
jitter attenuator can be placed in either the receive path or the transmit path by appropriately setting or
clearing the JAS bit (CCR4.3). Also, the jitter attenuator can be disabled (in effect, removed) by setting
the DJA bit (CCR4.1). For the jitter attenuator to operate properly, a 2.048MHz or 1.544MHz clock must
be applied at MCLK. ITU specification G.703 requires an accuracy of ±50ppm for both T1 and E1.
TR62411 and ANSI specs require an accuracy of ±32ppm for T1 interfaces. There is an on-board PLL for
the jitter attenuator, which will convert the 2.048MHz clock to a 1.544 MHz rate for T1 applications.
Setting JAMUX (CCR1.3) to a logic 0 bypasses this PLL. On-board circuitry adjusts either the recovered
clock from the clock/data recovery block or the clock applied at the TCLK pin to create a smooth jitter-
free clock, which is used to clock data out of the jitter attenuator FIFO. It is acceptable to provide a
gapped/bursty clock at the TCLK pin if the jitter attenuator is placed on the transmit side. If the incoming
jitter exceeds either 120UIP-P (buffer depth is 128 bits) or 28UIP-P (buffer depth is 32 bits), then the
DS21348 will divide the internal nominal 32.768MHz (E1) or 24.704MHz (T1) clock by either 15 or 17
instead of the normal 16 to keep the buffer from overflowing. When the device divides by either 15 or 17,
it also sets the Jitter Attenuator Limit Trip (JALT) bit in the Receive Information Register 1 (RIR1).

7.4 G.703 Synchronization Signal
The DS21348 can receive a 2.048MHz square-wave synchronization clock as specified in Section 13 of
ITU G.703(10/98). To use the DS21348 in this mode, set the Receive Synchronization Clock Enable
(CCR5.3) = 1. The DS21348 can also transmit the 2.048MHz square-wave synchronization clock as
specified in Section 10 of G.703. To transmit the 2.048MHz clock, set the Transmit Synchronization
Clock Enable (CCR5.2) = 1.

   return loss is required for T1 applications.
3) The Rr resistors should be set to 60Ω each if the internal receive-side termination feature is enabled.
   When this feature is disabled, Rr = 37.5Ω for 75Ω or 60Ω for 120Ω E1 systems, or 50Ω for 100Ω
   T1 lines.

NOTES:
1) The package is mounted on a four-layer JEDEC-standard test board.
2) Theta-JA (θJA) is the junction to ambient thermal resistance, when the package is mounted on a four-
   layer JEDEC-standard test board.
3) While Theta-JC (θJC) is commonly used as the thermal parameter that provides a correlation between the
   junction temperature (Tj) and the average temperature on top center of four of the chip-scale BGA
   packages (TC), the proper term is Psi-JT. It is defined by:
                              (TJ - TC) / overall package power
   The method of measurement of the thermal parameters is defined in EIA/JEDEC-standard document
   EIA-JESD51-2.
