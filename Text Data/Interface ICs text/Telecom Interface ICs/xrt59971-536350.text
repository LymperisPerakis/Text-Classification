                           The exact signal that should be applied to this input pin depends upon

   • When applying a pulse (to either the TxPOS_x or
      TxNEG_x input pin), apply an RZ pulse to the
      appropriate input pin. This RZ pulse should only
      have a width of one-half the bit-period. Addition,
      the RZ pulse should occupy only the first half of
      the bit-period. The TxPOS_x and TxNEG_x input
      pins must be at 0V, during the second half of
      every bit-period.
