                                              Pulling pin TDNn high for more than 16 consecutive TCLK clock cycles will configure the corresponding
                                              channel into Single Rail mode 1 (see Table-2 on page 14 and Table-3 on page 14).
                                              TCLKn: Transmit Clock for Channel 0~7
                                              The clock of 1.544 MHz (for T1 mode) or 2.048 MHz (for E1 mode) for transmit is input on this pin. The
                                              transmit data at TDn/TDPn or TDNn is sampled into the device on the falling edges of TCLKn.
                                              Pulling TCLKn high for more than 16 MCLK cycles, the corresponding transmitter is set in Transmit All
                                              Ones (TAOS) state (when MCLK is clocked). In TAOS state, the TAOS generator adopts MCLK as the
                                              clock reference.
                                              If TCLKn is low, the corresponding transmit channel is set into power down state, while driver output ports
                                              become high-Z.
                                              Different combinations of TCLKn and MCLK result in different transmit mode. It is summarized as the fol-

                                              RDn: Receive Data for Channel 0~7
                                              In Single Rail mode, the received NRZ data is output on this pin. The data is decoded by AMI or B8ZS/
   RD0/RDP0                   40         P2   HDB3 line code rule.
   RD1/RDP1                   33         M2

   RD3/RDP3                   70         P13  In Single Rail mode, the bipolar violation, code violation and excessive zeros will be reported by driving pin
   RD4/RDP4                  111         A13  CVn high for a full clock cycle. However, only bipolar violation is indicated when AMI decoder is selected.
   RD5/RDP5                  104         C13
   RD6/RDP6                    5         C2   RDPn/RDNn: Positive/Negative Receive Data for Channel 0~7
   RD7/RDP7        O         142         A2   In Dual Rail Mode with clock recovery, these pins output the NRZ data. A high signal on RDPn indicates
                                              the receipt of a positive pulse on RTIPn/RRINGn while a high signal on RDNn indicates the receipt of a
   CV0/RDN0     High-Z        41         P3   negative pulse on RTIPn/RRINGn.
   CV1/RDN1                   34         M3   The output data at RDn or RDPn/RDNn are clocked out on the falling edges of RCLK when the CLKE input
   CV2/RDN2                   76         M12  is low, or are clocked out on the rising edges of RCLK when CLKE is high.
   CV3/RDN3                   69         P12  In Dual Rail Mode without clock recovery, these pins output the raw RZ sliced data. In this data recovery
   CV4/RDN4                  112         A12  mode, the active polarity of RDPn/RDNn is determined by pin CLKE. When pin CLKE is low, RDPn/RDNn
   CV5/RDN5                  105         C12  is active low. When pin CLKE is high, RDPn/RDNn is active high.
   CV6/RDN6                    4         C3   In hardware mode, RDn or RDPn/RDNn will remain active during LOS. In host mode, these pins will either
   CV7/RDN7                  141         A3   remain active or insert alarm indication signal (AIS) into the receive path, determined by bit AISE in regis-
                                              ter GCF.
                                              RDn or RDPn/RDNn is set into high-Z when the corresponding receiver is powered down.

                                              RCLKn: Receive Clock for Channel 0~7
    RCLK1                     32         M1
                                              In clock recovery mode, this pin outputs the recovered clock from signal received on RTIPn/RRINGn. The
    RCLK2                     78         M14
                   O                          received data are clocked out of the device on the rising edges of RCLKn if pin CLKE is high, or on falling

                                              edges of RCLKn if pin CLKE is low.
    RCLK4                    110         A14
                High-Z                        In data recovery mode, RCLKn is the output of an internal exclusive OR (XOR) which is connected with
    RCLK5                    103         C14
                                              RDPn and RDNn. The clock is recovered from the signal on RCLKn.
    RCLK6                      6         C1
                                              If Receiver n is powered down, the corresponding RCLKn is in high-Z.
    RCLK7                    143         A1
                                              MCLK: Master Clock
                                              This is an independent, free running reference clock. A clock of 1.544 MHz (for T1 mode) or 2.048 MHz
                                              (for E1 mode) is supplied to this pin as the clock reference of the device for normal operation.
                                              In receive path, when MCLK is high, the device slices the incoming bipolar line signal into RZ pulse (Data
     MCLK          I          10         E1   Recovery mode). When MCLK is low, all the receivers are powered down, and the output pins RCLKn,
                                              RDPn and RDNn are switched to high-Z.
                                              In transmit path, the operation mode is decided by the combination of MCLK and TCLKn (see TCLKn pin
                                              description for details).
                                              NOTE: Wait state generation via RDY/ACK is not available if MCLK is not provided.

     LOS1                     35         K3   A high level on this pin indicates the loss of signal when there is no transition over a specified period of
     LOS2                     75         K12  time or no enough ones density in the received signal. The transition will return to low automatically when

                                              In hardware control mode, A4 must be connected to GND. MC[3:0] are used to select one transmitter or
                                              receiver of channel 1 to 7 for non-intrusive monitoring. Channel 0 is used as the monitoring channel. If a
                                              transmitter is monitored, signals on the corresponding pins TTIPn and TRINGn are internally transmitted
                                              to RTIP0 and RRING0. If a receiver is monitored, signals on the corresponding pins RTIPn and RRINGn
                                              are internally transmitted to RTIP0 and RRING0. The monitored is then output to RDP0 and RDN0 pins.
                                              In host mode operation, the signals monitored by channel 0 can be routed to TTIP0/RING0 by activating
                                              the remote loopback in this channel. Refer to 2.20 G.772 Monitoring for more details.

                                              When pin MODE1 is high or in serial host mode, these pins should be tied to GND.

                                         The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the
                                         EXTEST instruction, the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be
       000                Extest         sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by
                                         shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading
                                         patterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using the Update-DR state.
                                         The sample instruction samples all the device inputs and outputs. For this instruction, the boundary scan register is placed
                                         between TDI and TDO. The normal path between IDT82V2048S logic and the I/O pins is maintained. Primary device

                                         inputs and outputs can be sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled val-
                                         ues can then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state.
                                         The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device's identifica-

                                         tion code can then be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.
                                         The bypass instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used

                                         to bypass the device.

4.2.1 DEVICE IDENTIFICATION REGISTER (IDR)
    The IDR can be set to define the producer number, part number and
the device revision, which can be used to verify the proper version or
revision number that has been used in the system under test. The IDR is
32 bits long and is partitioned as in Table-20. Data from the IDR is
shifted out to TDO LSB first.

Table-22 TAP Controller State Description
        State                                                                                 Description
                      In this state, the test logic is disabled. The device is set to normal operation. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register
                      with the IDCODE instruction.
  Test Logic Reset
                      Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held high for at least 5
                      rising edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high. The device processor automatically enters this state at power-up.
                      This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The
    Run-Test/Idle     instruction register and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                      moves to the Select-DR state.
                      This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction
                      retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR
   Select-DR-Scan
                      state and a scan sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller
                      moves to the Select-IR-Scan state.
                      In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction
     Capture-DR       does not change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in
                      this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
                      In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward
       Shift-DR       its serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising
                      edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
                      This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
      Exit1-DR        state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR
                      state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                      The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI
                      and TDO. For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test
      Pause-DR        sequence. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                      state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                      moves to the Exit2-DR state.
                      This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
      Exit2-DR        state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state.
                      The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                      The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST
                      and SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched into
     Update-DR        the parallel output of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output changes
                      only in this state. All shift-register stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and the instruc-
                      tion does not change during this state.
                      This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and
                      a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction reg-
   Select-IR-Scan
                      ister is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction
                      does not change during this state.
                      In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of ‘100’ on the rising edge of TCK. This sup-
                      ports fault-isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruc-
     Capture-IR
                      tion does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-
                      IR state if TMS is held high, or the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
                      In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its
                      serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction
       Shift-IR
                      does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR
                      state if TMS is held high, or remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
                                                                                       44

                  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
      Exit1-IR    state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state.
                  The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                  The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected
     Pause-IR     by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state as
                  long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
                  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
      Exit2-IR    state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state.
                  The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                  The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK.
     Update-IR    When the new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction
                  retain their previous value.
