1.1      Brief Description
The CMX605 is an integrated telecom tone generator and DTMF encoder/decoder designed for ISDN
interfaces, Wireless Local Loop and Analogue to Digital Phone Conversion systems. The tone generator
covers an extensive range of pre-programmed tones used in analogue phone systems (POTS). Three
outputs are provided: ‘Ringing signals’, ‘In-band tones or FSK data’, and ‘12kHz/16kHz Metering pulses’.
Simple software control facilitates the interface to a wide range of commonly used µCs and SLICs,
enabling a comprehensive analogue telephone line presentation.
The DTMF encoder/decoder presents the digital line interface with DTMF dialling information received
from the telephone user and generates the appropriate DTMF tones for the POTS interface. DTMF tone
pairs can be encoded along with each tone singly or with other dual tone signals, such as those used in
CIDCW systems and ‘On Hook’ signalling systems.
Other tone standards supported are: Fax and Modem ‘answer’ and ‘originate’, ITU (CCITT) ‘R1’ and ‘R2’
signals, and sufficient tones for simple melody generation. Communication to and from the host
µController is performed by a ‘C-BUS’ serial interface, which is compatible with the ‘SPI’ interface.

              and VBIAS decoupling and protecting the receive path from extraneous in-band signals are very
              important. It is recommended that the printed circuit board is laid out with a ground plane in the
              CMX605 area to provide a low impedance connection between the VSS pin and the VDD and
              VBIAS decoupling capacitors.

Digital Line to POTS Interface                                                                         CMX605
1.5        General Description
The CMX605 is a telecom tone generator and DTMF tone encoder/decoder. It has separate output ports
for the three different classes of signals encoded. These include Ringing signal, In-band tones or FSK
data at 1200bps and High frequency metering pulses (SPM tones). It has a transmit level attenuator for
In-band tones or FSK data and an envelope control for SPM tones. It also has an uncommitted amplifier
and uses the industry standard 3.58MHz Xtal for its oscillator. These functions are controlled over a ‘C-
BUS‘ serial µC interface, which also carries the transmit FSK data and the DTMF decoded data.
The CMX605 should initially be reset by issuing a ‘C-BUS’ RESET command. Individual functions may be
disabled or enabled by the use of bits 5, 6 and 7 in the SETUP Register. See Section 1.5.9.
Approximately 50ms should be allowed for the Tx dc level to settle at VBIAS before enabling the Tx
functions (set bit 6 of the MODE Register to ‘1’) after the CMX605 has been reset.
1.5.1      Xtal Osc and Clock Dividers
Frequency and timing accuracy of the CMX605 is determined by a 3.579545MHz clock present at the
XTAL/CLOCK pin. This may be generated by the on-chip oscillator inverter using the external components
C1, C2 and X1 of Figure 2, or may be supplied from an external source to the XTAL/CLOCK input. If the
clock is supplied from an external source, C1, C2 and X1 should not be fitted.
If the clock is provided by an external source which is not always running, then the CMX605 should be
reset when the clock is not available. Resetting the CMX605 will also turn off the on-chip oscillator. Failure
to reset the device may cause a rise in the supply current drawn by the CMX605.
1.5.2      Uncommitted Amplifier
This amplifier, with suitable external components, can be used either for adjusting the received signal to
the correct amplitude for the DTMF decoder or for adjusting the transmit signal level (for the line hybrid).
1.5.3      Tone/FSK Encoder and Tone Encoder
When bit 5 of the MODE Register is set to ‘1’ then these blocks generate FSK signals as determined by bit
0 of the SETUP Register and the Tx data bits from the UART block, as shown in the table below:
 SETUP Register              Tone/FSK Generator        FSK Signal Frequency        FSK Signal Frequency
          Bit 0                                              ‘0’ (Space)                   ‘1’ (Mark)
           0                   V23 1200bps FSK                 2100Hz                       1300Hz
           1                 Bell 202 1200bps FSK              2200Hz                       1200Hz
When bit 5 of the MODE Register is set to ‘0’, these blocks generate single or dual tones from the range
shown in the tables on the following pages. Bit 6 of the MODE Register is then used to enable or disable
the block’s output to the Tx Signal Control, RING and TONEFSK outputs. There are four tone fields
addressed by bits 0 and 1 of the MODE Register.

1.5.4      SPM Generator
This block operates independently and has its own output pin. It can transmit 12kHz or 16kHz and is
controlled by bit 4 of the SETUP Register. Bit 7 of the MODE Register is used to enable or disable this
block. The signal has a rise and fall time each of about 4.5ms. The SPM signal rises from the bias level
to 0dBm in 16 steps of 2dB magnitude, and falls from 0dBm to bias level in 16 steps of 2dB magnitude.
1.5.5      Transmit Signal Control
This block adjusts the amplitude of the FSK transmit signal output level, the level skew between DTMF
tones and the signal routing to the output ports.
Output signal levels are proportional to VDD. The nominal output signal levels (at 0dB attenuation and VDD
= 5.0V) are:
                                     Single Tone                        0dBm

The RING signal is digital: a square wave with amplitude of  VDD peak to peak. When the RING signal is
not selected, the RING output pin is connected to VSS.
The level attenuator provides for level adjustment from 0dB to -14dB in -2dB steps. The typical level is
determined by bits 2 to 4 of the MODE Register as shown in the table below:

1.5.6      Tx UART
This block connects the µC, via the ‘C-BUS’ interface, to the FSK Encoder.
The block can be programmed to convert transmit data from 8-bit bytes to asynchronous data characters
by adding Start and Stop bits. The transmit data is then passed to the FSK Encoder.
Data to be transmitted should be loaded by the µC into the TX DATA Register when the Tx Data Ready bit
(bit 6) of the STATUS Register goes high. It will then be treated by the Tx UART block in one of two ways,
depending on the setting of bit 1 of the SETUP Register:
           If bit 1 of the SETUP Register is ‘0’ (Tx Sync mode) then the 8 bits from the TX DATA Register will
           be transmitted sequentially at 1200bps, lsb (D0) first.
           If bit 1 of the SETUP Register is ‘1’ (Tx Async mode) then bits will be transmitted as asynchronous
           data characters at 1200 bps according to the following format:

                    One Stop bit (Mark)
Failure to load the TX DATA Register with a new value when required will result in bit 7 (Tx Data
Underflow) of the STATUS Register being set to ‘1’. If the ‘Tx Async’ mode of operation is selected then a
continuous Mark (‘1’) signal will be transmitted until a new value is loaded into TX DATA. If the ‘Tx Sync’
mode is selected then the byte already in the TX DATA Register will be re-transmitted.

Register are set to ‘0’ and no interrupts are generated. When enabled (set to ‘1’), a status change of the
decoder will generate an interrupt and bit 5 of the STATUS Register will be set to ‘1’. The validity of the
data is indicated by bit 4 of the STATUS Register. The decode truth table is shown below:

A status change of the decoder and the generation of an interrupt will occur both when a tone is first
decoded and also when a tone, which was previously present, is no longer decoded. In the latter case, Bit
4 of the STATUS Register will be set to “0” to indicate that no tone was detected.

1.5.8      ‘C-BUS’ Interface
This block provides for the transfer of data and control or status information between the CMX605’s
internal registers and the µC over the ‘C-BUS’ serial bus. Each transaction consists of a single Register
Address byte sent from the µC which may be followed by a single data byte sent from the µC to be written
into one of the CMX605’s Write Only Registers, or a single byte of data read out from one of the
CMX605’s Read Only Registers, as illustrated in Figure 4.
Data sent from the µC on the Command Data (COMDATA) line is clocked into the CMX605 on the rising
edge of the Serial Clock (SERCK) input. Reply Data (REPDATA) sent from the CMX605 to the µC is valid
when the Serial Clock is high. The interface is compatible with the most common µC serial interfaces such
as SCI, SPI and Microwire, and may also be easily implemented with general purpose µC I/O pins
controlled by a simple software routine. See Figure 8 for detailed ‘C-BUS’ timing requirements.

Notes:
  1.     Accessing the RESET Register over the ‘C-BUS’ clears all of the bits in the SETUP, MODE,
         TX DATA, TX TONES and STATUS registers. This will initialise the device and put it into zero-
         power mode. Please allow 50ms for the oscillator, VBIAS and internal circuits to stabilize when
         coming out of zero-power mode.
         Note that this is a single-byte ‘C-BUS’ transaction consisting solely of the address byte value $01.
  2.     If any of bits 5, 6 or 7 of the STATUS Register is ‘1’ then the IRQN output will be pulled low.
  3.     Reading the STATUS Register clears the IRQN output and also clears bit 5 of the STATUS
         Register, if set. Bits 6 and 7 of the STATUS Register are cleared on writing to the TX DATA
         Register.

1.6        Application Notes
           When using the Tone/FSK bit (bit 6) of the MODE Register, each tone starts from VBIAS, and
           returns to VBIAS before ending:
                                      Figure 5 Tone Starting and Stopping
           When switching between tones in the same column (bits 4 - 7 or bits 0 - 3) of the TX TONES
           Register), the transition will be phase continuous. However, switching to the “OFF” state will
           immediately take the output of that tone generator to VBIAS.

1.6.2      C-BUS Timing
           The relationship between bytes loaded onto the C-BUS and the transmission of FSK bytes is
           shown diagrammatically in Figures 7a and 7b for asynchronous and synchronous data transfer,
           respectively.
           The diagrams assume that a General Reset command has already been given. They also show
           the timing for the completion of data transfer, after it has been disabled in the MODE register.
           Please note that the C-BUS timing is not shown to the same scale as the FSK output (it has been
           magnified by at least 20 times to make it visible on the same scale).
