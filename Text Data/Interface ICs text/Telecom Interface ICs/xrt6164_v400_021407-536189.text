GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The XRT6164 is a CMOS analog chip intended for general purpose line interface applications at bit rates up to
1.544Mbps (T1). It contains both receive and transmit circuitry in a 16-pin dual-in-line plastic package. The receiver
is designed for short line applications having a cable loss up to 10dB measured at the half bit rate. The transmitter
has open collector line driver outputs that are capable of handling up to 40mA. When used in conjunction with either
XRT6165 or XRT6166, the chip set provides a 64Kbps codirectional interface as specified in CCITT G.703.
