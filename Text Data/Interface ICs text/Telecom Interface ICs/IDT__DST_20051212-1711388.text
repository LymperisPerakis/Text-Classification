  TD2/TDP2                           23        When the device is in single rail mode, the NRZ data to be transmitted is input on this pin. Data on TDn pin is sampled into
                                               the device on the active edge of TCLKn and is encoded by AMI, HDB3 or B8ZS line code rules before being transmitted. In
    TDN1                             36        this mode, TDNn should be connected to ground.

                                               When the device is in dual rail mode, the NRZ data to be transmitted for positive/negative pulse is input on these pins. Data
                                               on TDPn/TDNn pin is sampled into the device on the active edge of TCLKn. The active polarity is also selectable. Refer to

                                               is sampled into the device on the active edge of TCLKn. If TCLKn is missing3 and the TCLKn missing interrupt is not masked,
                                               an interrupt will be generated.
Notes:
1. The footprint ‘n’ (n = 1~2) represents one of the two channels.
2. The name and address of the registers that contain the preceding bit. Only the address of channel 1 register is listed, the rest addresses are represented by ‘...’. Users can find
    these omitted addresses in the Register Description section.
3. TCLKn missing: the state of TCLKn continues to be high level or low level over 70 MCLK cycles.

   Name      Type     Pin No.                                                               Description
 RD1/RDP1     O          34    RDn: Receive Data output for Channel 1~2
 RD2/RDP2                26    In single rail mode, this pin outputs NRZ data. The data is decoded according to AMI, HDB3 or B8ZS line code rules.
 CV1/RDN1                33    CVn: Code Violation indication
 CV2/RDN2                27    In single rail mode, the BPV/CV errors in received data stream will be reported by driving the CVn pin to high level for a full
                               clock cycle. B8ZS/HDB3 line code violation can be indicated if the B8ZS/HDB3 decoder is enabled. When AMI decoder is
                               selected, bipolar violation will be indicated.
                               In hardware control mode, the EXZ, BPV/CV errors in received data stream are always monitored by the CVn pin if single rail
                               mode is chosen.
                               RDPn/RDNn: Positive/Negative Receive Data output for Channel 1~2
                               In dual rail mode, these pins output the re-timed NRZ data when CDR is enabled, or directly outputs the raw RZ slicer data
                               if CDR is bypassed.
                               Active edge and level select:
                               Data on RDPn/RDNn or RDn is clocked with either the rising or the falling edge of RCLKn. The active polarity is also select-
                               able. Refer to 3.4.8 RECEIVE PATH SYSTEM INTERFACE for details.
   RCLK1      O          35    RCLKn: Receive Clock output for Channel 1~2
   RCLK2                 25    This pin outputs 1.544 MHz for T1/J1 mode or 2.048 MHz for E1 mode receive clock. Under LOS conditions with AIS enabled
                               (bit AISE=1), RCLKn is derived from MCLK.
                               In clock recovery mode, this signal provides the clock recovered from the RTIPn/RRINGn signal. The receive data (RDn in
                               single rail mode or RDPn and RDNn in dual rail mode) is clocked out of the device on the active edge of RCLKn.
                               If clock recovery is bypassed, RCLKn is the exclusive OR (XOR) output of the dual rail slicer data RDPn and RDNn. This signal
                               can be used in applications with external clock recovery circuitry.
   MCLK        I         30    MCLK: Master Clock input
                               A built-in clock system that accepts selectable 2.048 MHz reference for E1 operating mode and 1.544 MHz reference for T1/
                               J1 operating mode. This reference clock is used to generate several internal reference signals:
                               •      Timing reference for the integrated clock recovery unit.
                               •      Timing reference for the integrated digital jitter attenuator.
                               •      Timing reference for microcontroller interface.
                               •      Generation of RCLKn signal during a loss of signal condition.
                               •      Reference clock to transmit All Ones, all zeros, PRBS/QRSS pattern as well as activate or deactivate Inband Loop-
                                      back code if MCLK is selected as the reference clock. Note that for ATAO and AIS, MCLK is always used as the refer-
                                      ence clock.
                               •      Reference clock during Transmit All Ones (TAO) condition or sending PRBS/QRSS in hardware control mode.
                               The loss of MCLK will turn TTIP/TRING into high impedance status.
   LOS1       O          32    LOSn: Loss of Signal Output for Channel 1~2
   LOS2                  28    These pins are used to indicate the loss of received signals. When LOSn pin becomes high, it indicates the loss of received
                               signal in channel n. The LOS pin will become low automatically when valid received signal is detected again. The criteria of
                               loss of signal are described in 3.6 LOS AND AIS DETECTION.
    REF        I         71    REF: reference resister
                               An external resistor (3kΩ, 1%) is used to connect this pin to ground to provide a standard reference current for internal circuit.

    RST        I         21    RST: Hardware Reset
                               The chip is forced to reset state if a low signal is input on this pin for more than 100ns. MCLK must be active during reset.
    THZ        I         20    THZ: Transmitter Driver High Impedance Enable
                               This signal enables or disables all transmitter drivers on a global basis. A low level on this pin enables the driver while a high
                               level on this pin places all drivers in high impedance state. Note that the functionality of the internal circuits is not affected by
                               this signal.
                                                                    JTAG Signals
   TRST        I          1    TRST: JTAG Test Port Reset
            Pullup             This is the active low asynchronous reset to the JTAG Test Port. This pin has an internal pull-up resistor. To ensure determin-
                               istic operation of the test logic, TMS should be held high while the signal applied to TRST changes from low to high.
                               For normal signal processing, this pin should be connected to ground.
                               If JTAG is not used, this pin must be connected to ground.
    TMS        I          2    TMS: JTAG Test Mode Select
            Pullup             This pin is used to control the test logic state machine and is sampled on the rising edge of TCK. TMS has an internal pull-
                               up resistor.
                               If JTAG is not used, this pin may be left unconnected.
    TCK        I          3    TCK: JTAG Test Clock
                               This is the input clock for JTAG. The data on TDI and TMS are clocked into the device on the rising edge of TCK while the
                               data on TDO is clocked out of the device on the falling edge of TCK. When TCK is idle at low state, all the stored-state devices
                               contained in the test logic will retain their state indefinitely.
                               If JTAG is not used, this pin may be left unconnected.
    TDO       O          4     TDO: JTAG Test Data Output
                               This output pin is high impedance normally and is used for reading all the serial configuration and test data from the test logic.
                               The data on TDO is clocked out of the device on the falling edge of TCK.
                               If JTAG is not used, this pin should be left unconnected.
    TDI        I          5    TDI: JTAG Test Data Input
            Pullup             This pin is used for loading instructions and data into the test logic and has an internal pull-up resistor. The data on TDI is
                               clocked into the device on the rising edge of TCK.
                               If JTAG is not used, this pin may be left unconnected.

   The IDT82V2042E supports the digital Boundary Scan Specification as                         (TDI) pin, and shifted out of the registers via the Test Data Output (TDO)
described in the IEEE 1149.1 standards.                                                        pin. Both TDI and TDO are clocked at a rate determined by TCK.
    The boundary scan architecture consists of data and instruction regis-                         The JTAG boundary scan registers include BSR (Boundary Scan Reg-

6.1      JTAG INSTRUCTIONS AND INSTRUCTION REG-
          ISTER
   The IR (Instruction Register) with instruction decode block is used to
select the test to be executed or the data register to be accessed or both.
   The instructions are shifted in LSB first to this 3-bit register. See Table-
52 for details of the codes and the instructions related.
Table-52 Instruction Register Description
      IR CODE           INSTRUCTION                                                                 COMMENTS
         000                Extest      The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the EXTEST
                                        instruction, the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be sampled by load-
                                        ing the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by shifting the boundary
                                        scan register using the Shift-DR state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading patterns shifted in through
                                        input TDI into the boundary scan register using the Update-DR state.
         100           Sample / Preload The sample instruction samples all the device inputs and outputs. For this instruction, the boundary scan register is placed
                                        between TDI and TDO. The normal path between IDT82V2042E logic and the I/O pins is maintained. Primary device inputs
                                        and outputs can be sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then
                                        be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state.
         110               Idcode       The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device's identification
                                        code can then be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.
          111              Bypass       The bypass instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used to
                                        bypass the device.

6.2.1    DEVICE IDENTIFICATION REGISTER (IDR)                                                The BR consists of a single bit. It can provide a serial path between the

   The IDR can be set to define the producer number, part number and the
device revision, which can be used to verify the proper version or revision             6.2.3     BOUNDARY SCAN REGISTER (BSR)

and is partitioned as in Table-53. Data from the IDR is shifted out to TDO              digital I/O pins. The BSR is a 98 bits long shift register and is initialized and
LSB first.                                                                              read using the instruction EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. Each pin is

Table-54 TAP Controller State Description
         STATE                                                                             DESCRIPTION
    Test Logic Reset In this state, the test logic is disabled. The device is set to normal operation. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register
                     with the IDCODE instruction. Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS
                     input is held high for at least 5 rising edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high. The device processor automatically
                     enters this state at power-up.
      Run-Test/Idle  This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The
                     instruction register and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                     moves to the Select-DR state.
    Select-DR-Scan   This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction
                     retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR
                     state and a scan sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller
                     moves to the Select-IR-Scan state.
      Capture-DR     In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction
                     does not change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in
                     this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
        Shift-DR     In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward
                     its serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising
                     edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
        Exit1-DR     This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
                     state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR state.
                     The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
       Pause-DR      The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI
                     and TDO. For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test
                     sequence. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                     state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves
                     to the Exit2-DR state.
        Exit2-DR     This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
                     state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state.
                     The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
       Update-DR     The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST
                     and SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched
                     into the parallel output of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output
                     changes only in this state. All shift-register stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and
                     the instruction does not change during this state.
     Select-IR-Scan  This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and
                     a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction reg-
                     ister is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction
                     does not change during this state.
       Capture-IR    In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of '100' on the rising edge of TCK. This supports
                     fault-isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruction
                     does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR
                     state if TMS is held high, or the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
         Shift-IR    In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its
                     serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction
                     does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR
                     state if TMS is held high, or remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
        Exit1-IR     This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
                     state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state.
                     The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
        Pause-IR     The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected
                     by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state
                     as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.

       STATE                                                                          DESCRIPTION
       Exit2-IR    This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
                   state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state.
                   The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
      Update-IR    The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK.
                   When the new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction retain
                   their previous value.
