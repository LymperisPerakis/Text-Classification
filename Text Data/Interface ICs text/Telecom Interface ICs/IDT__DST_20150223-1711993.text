                                              In parallel Motorola host mode, this pin is active low. During a write operation (R/W = 0), the data on D[7:0]

                                              In hardware control mode, A4 must be connected to GND. MC[3:0] are used to select a transmitter or
                                              receiver of channel 1 to 7 for non-intrusive monitoring. Channel 0 is used as the monitoring channel. If a
                                              transmitter is monitored, signals on the corresponding pins TTIPn and TRINGn are internally transmitted
                                              to RTIP0 and RRING0 pins. If a receiver is monitored, signals on the corresponding pins RTIPn and
                                              RRINGn are internally transmitted to RTIP0 and RRING0 pins. The monitored is then output to RDP0 and
                                              RDN0 pins.
                                              Performance Monitor Configuration determined by MC[3:0] is shown below. Note that if MC[2:0] = 000, the

                                              When pin MODE1 is low, the parallel host interface operates with separate address and data bus. In this

2.3       CLOCK EDGES
    The active edge of SCLK is selectable. If pin CLKE is high, the active
edge of SCLK is the falling edge. On the contrary, if CLKE is low, the
active edge SCLK is the rising edge. Pin SDO is always active high, and
the output signals are valid on the active edge of SCLK. See Table-3
Active Clock Edge and Active Level for details. Pin CLKE is used to set
the active level for RDPn/RDNn raw slicing output: high for active high
polarity and low for active low. It should be noted that data on pin SDI
are always active high and are sampled on the rising edges of SCLK.
The data on pin TDPn or TDNn are also always active high but are
sampled on the falling edges of TCLKn, despite the level on CLKE.

2.18.2 SERIAL HOST INTERFACE
    By pulling pin MODE2 to VDDIO/2, the device operates in the serial
host Mode. In this mode, the registers are accessible through a 16-bit
word which contains an 8-bit command/address byte (bit R/W and 5-
address-bit A1~A5, A6 and A7 bits are ignored) and a subsequent 8-bit
data byte (D7~D0), as shown in Figure-10. When bit R/W is set to ‘1’,
data is read out from pin SDO. When bit R/W is set to ‘0’, data on pin
SDI is written into the register whose address is indicated by address
bits A5~A1. Refer to Figure-10 Serial Host Mode Timing.

                                         The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the
                                         EXTEST instruction, the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be
       000                Extest         sampled by loading the boundary scan register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by
                                         shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading
                                         patterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register using the Update-DR state.
                                         The sample instruction samples all the device inputs and outputs. For this instruction, the boundary scan register is placed
                                         between TDI and TDO. The normal path between IDT82V2048L logic and the I/O pins is maintained. Primary device

                                         ues can then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR state.
                                         The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device's identifica-

                                         The bypass instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used

Table-16 TAP Controller State Description
        State                                                                                 Description
                      In this state, the test logic is disabled. The device is set to normal operation. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register
                      with the IDCODE instruction.
  Test Logic Reset
                      Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held high for at least 5
                      rising edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high. The device processor automatically enters this state at power-up.
                      This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The
    Run-Test/Idle     instruction register and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                      moves to the Select-DR state.
                      This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction
                      retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR
   Select-DR-Scan
                      state and a scan sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller
                      moves to the Select-IR-Scan state.
                      In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction
     Capture-DR       does not change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in
                      this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
                      In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward
       Shift-DR       its serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising
                      edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
                      This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
      Exit1-DR        state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR
                      state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                      The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI
                      and TDO. For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test
      Pause-DR        sequence. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this
                      state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller
                      moves to the Exit2-DR state.
                      This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR
      Exit2-DR        state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state.
                      The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                      The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST
                      and SAMPLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched into
     Update-DR        the parallel output of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output changes
                      only in this state. All shift-register stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and the instruc-
                      tion does not change during this state.
                      This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and
                      a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction reg-
   Select-IR-Scan
                      ister is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction
                      does not change during this state.
                      In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of ‘100’ on the rising edge of TCK. This sup-
                      ports fault-isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruc-
     Capture-IR
                      tion does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-
                      IR state if TMS is held high, or the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
                      In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its
                      serial output on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction
       Shift-IR
                      does not change during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR
                      state if TMS is held high, or remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
                                                                                       33

                  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
      Exit1-IR    state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state.
                  The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                  The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected
     Pause-IR     by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state as
                  long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
                  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR
      Exit2-IR    state, which terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state.
                  The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
                  The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK.
     Update-IR    When the new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction
                  retain their previous value.
