 Transmit Path Data Signals
 TXPER          LVTTL output,                 Transmit path parity error. Active HIGH. Asserted (HIGH) if parity checking is enabled
                changes relative to           (PARCTL  LOW) and a parity error is detected at the encoder. This output is HIGH for one
                REFCLK[3]                    transmit character-clock period to indicate detection of a parity error in the character
                                              presented to the encoder.
                                              If a parity error is detected, the character in error is replaced with a C0.7 character to force a
                                              corresponding bad-character detection at the remote end of the link. This replacement takes
                                              place regardless of the encoded/un-encoded state of the interface.
                                              When BIST is enabled for the specific transmit channel, BIST progress is presented on this
                                              output. Once every 511 character times (plus a 16-character Word Sync Sequence when the
                                              receive channel is clocked by REFCLK, i.e., RXCKSEL = LOW), the TXPER signal pulses
                                              HIGH for one transmit-character clock period (if RXCKSEL = MID) or seventeen
                                              transmit-character clock periods (if RXCKSEL = LOW or HIGH) to indicate a complete pass
                                              through the BIST sequence. For RXCKSEL = LOW or HIGH, If TXMODE[1:0] = LL, then no
                                              Word Sync Sequence is sent in BIST, and TXPER pulses HIGH for one transmit-character
                                              clock period.
                                              This output also provides an indication of a phase-align buffer underflow/overflow condition.
                                              When the phase-align buffer is enabled (TXCKSEL  LOW, or TXCKSEL = LOW and
                                              TXRATE = HIGH), and an underflow/overflow condition is detected, TXPER is asserted and
                                              remains asserted until either an atomic Word Sync Sequence is transmitted or TXRST is
                                              sampled LOW to recenter the phase-align buffer.
 TXCT[1:0]      LVTTL input,                  Transmit control. These inputs are captured on the rising edge of the transmit interface clock
                synchronous,                  as selected by TXCKSEL, and are passed to the encoder or transmit shifter. They identify
                sampled by                    how the TXD[7:0] characters are interpreted. When the encoder is enabled, these inputs
                TXCLK or                     determine if the TXD[7:0] character is encoded as data, a special character code, a K28.5 fill
                REFCLK[3]                    character or a Word Sync Sequence. When the encoder is bypassed, these inputs are
                                              interpreted as data bits. See Table 1 for details.
 TXD[7:0]       LVTTL input,                  Transmit data inputs. These inputs are captured on the rising edge of the transmit interface
                synchronous,                  clock as selected by TXCKSEL, and passed to the encoder or transmit shifter.
                sampled by                    When the encoder is enabled (TXMODE[1]  LOW), TXD[7:0] specify the specific data or
                TXCLK or                     command character to be sent. When the encoder is bypassed, these inputs are interpreted
                REFCLK[3]                    as data bits of the 10-bit input character. See Table 1 for details.
 TXOP           LVTTL input,                  Transmit path odd parity. When parity checking is enabled (PARCTL  LOW), the parity
                synchronous,                  captured at this input is XORed with the data on the TXD bus (and sometimes TXCT[1:0]) to
                internal pull-up,             verify the integrity of the captured character. See Table 2 for details.
                sampled by
                TXCLK or
                REFCLK[3]
 SCSEL          LVTTL input,                  Special character select. Used in some transmit modes along with TXCTx[1:0] to encode
                synchronous,                  special characters or to initiate a Word Sync Sequence. When the transmit path is configured
                internal pull-down,           to select TXCLK to clock the input register (TXCKSEL = MID or HIGH), SCSEL is captured
                sampled by                    relative to TXCLK.
                TXCLK or
                REFCLK[3]
 Note
  3. When REFCLK is configured for half-rate operation (TXRATE = HIGH), this input is sampled (or the outputs change) relative to both the rising and falling edges of
     REFCLK.

 TXRST                LVTTL input,                 Transmit clock phase reset. Active LOW. When sampled LOW, the transmit phase-align
                      asynchronous,                buffer is allowed to adjust its data-transfer timing (relative to the selected input clock) to allow
                      internal pull-up,            clean transfer of data from the input register to the encoder or transmit shifter. When TXRST
                      sampled by                   is sampled HIGH, the internal phase relationship between the TXCLK and the internal
                      REFCLK[4]                   character-rate clock is fixed and the device operates normally.
                                                   When configured for half-rate REFCLK sampling of the transmit character stream (TXCKSEL
                                                   = LOW and TXRATE = HIGH), assertion of TXRST is only used to clear phase-align buffer
                                                   faults caused by highly asymmetric reference clock periods or reference clocks with excessive
                                                   cycle-to-cycle jitter. During this alignment period, one or more characters may be added to or
                                                   lost from all the associated transmit paths as the transmit phase-align buffers are adjusted.
                                                   TXRST must be sampled LOW by a minimum of two consecutive rising edges of REFCLK to
                                                   ensure the reset operation is initiated correctly on all channels. This input is ignored when
                                                   both TXCKSEL and TXRATE are LOW, since the phase align buffer is bypassed. In all other
                                                   configurations, TXRST should be asserted during device initialization to ensure proper
                                                   operation of the phase-align buffer. TXRST should be asserted after the assertion and
                                                   deassertion of TRSTZ, after the presence of a valid TXCLK and after allowing enough time
                                                   for the TXPLL to lock to the reference clock (as specified by parameter tTXLOCK).
 Transmit Path Clock and Clock Control
 TXCKSEL              3-level select static        Transmit clock select. Selects the clock source used to write data into the transmit input
                      control input[5]             register of the transmit channel. When LOW, the input register is clocked by REFCLK.[4]
                                                   When HIGH or MID, TXCLK is the input register clock for TXD[7:0] and TXCT[1:0].
                                                   When TXRATE=HIGH, configuring TXCKSEL = HIGH or MID is an invalid mode of operation.
 TXCLKO              LVTTL output                 Transmit clock output. This true and complement output clock is synthesized by the transmit
                                                   PLL and is synchronous to the internal transmit character clock. It has the same frequency
                                                   as REFCLK (when TXRATE = LOW), or twice the frequency of REFCLK (when
                                                   TXRATE = HIGH). This output clock has no direct phase relationship to REFCLK.
 TXRATE               LVTTL input,                 Transmit PLL clock rate select. When TXRATE = HIGH, the transmit PLL multiplies
                      static control input,        REFCLK by 20 to generate the serial bit-rate clock.
                      internal pull-down           When TXRATE = LOW, the transmit PLL multiplies REFCLK by 10 to generate the serial
                                                   bit-rate clock. See Table 9 for a list of operating serial rates.
                                                   When REFCLK is selected to clock the receive parallel interfaces (RXCKSEL = LOW), the
                                                   TXRATE input also determines if the clocks on the RXCLK and RXCLKC outputs are full
                                                   or half-rate. When TXRATE = HIGH (REFCLK is half-rate), the RXCLK± and RXCLKC+ output
                                                   clocks are also half-rate clocks and follow the frequency and duty cycle of the REFCLK input.
                                                   When TXRATE = LOW (REFCLK is full-rate), the RXCLK± and RXCLKC+ output clocks are
                                                   also full-rate clocks and follow the frequency and duty cycle of the REFCLK input.
                                                   When TXRATE=HIGH, configuring TXCKSEL = HIGH or MID is an invalid mode of operation.
 TXCLK                LVTTL clock input,           Transmit path input clock. This clock must be frequency-coherent to TXCLKO, but may
                      internal pull-down           be offset in phase. The internal operating phase of the input clock (relative to REFLCK or
                                                   TXCLKO+) is adjusted when TXRST = LOW and locked when TXRST = HIGH.
 Transmit Path Mode Control
 TXMODE[1:0] 3-level select[5]                     Transmit operating mode. These inputs are interpreted to select one of nine operating
                      static control inputs        modes of the transmit path. See Table 3 for a list of operating modes.
 Notes
  4. When REFCLK is configured for half-rate operation (TXRATE = HIGH), this input is sampled (or the outputs change) relative to both the rising and falling edges of
     REFCLK.
  5. 3-level select inputs are used for static configuration. They are ternary (not binary) inputs that make use of non-standard logic levels of LOW, MID, and HIGH. The
     LOW level is usually implemented by direct connection to VSS (ground). The HIGH level is usually implemented by direct connection to VCC (power). When not
     connected or allowed to float, a 3-level select input will self-bias to the MID level.

                                               When the decoder is enabled (DECMODE = HIGH or MID), RXST[2:0] provide status of the

 Receive Path Clock and Clock Control
 RXCLK         3-state,                       Receive character clock output. When configured such that the output data path is clocked
                LVTTL output clock             by the recovered clock (RXCKSEL = MID), these true and complement clocks are the receive
                                               interface clocks which are used to control timing of output data (RXD[7:0], RXST[2:0] and
                                               RXOP). This clock is output continuously at either the dual-character rate (1/20th the serial
                                               bit-rate) or character rate (1/10th the serial bit-rate) of the data being received, as selected by
                                               RXRATE.
                                               When configured such that the output data path is clocked by REFCLK instead of recovered
                                               clock (RXCKSEL = LOW), the RXCLK output drivers present a buffered and delayed form
                                               of REFCLK. In this mode, RXCLK and RXCLKC+ are buffered forms of REFCLK that are
                                               slightly different in phase, but follow the frequency and duty cycle of REFCLK. This phase
                                               difference allows the user to select the optimal set-up/hold timing for their specific interface.
 RXCLKC+        3-state, LVTTL                 Delayed REFCLK+ when RXCKSEL = LOW. Delayed form of REFCLK+, used for transfer
                output                         of output data to a host system. This output is only enabled when the receive parallel interface
                                               is configured to present data relative to REFCLK (RXCKSEL = LOW). When RXCKSEL =
                                               LOW, the RXCLKC+ follows the frequency and duty cycle of REFCLK+.
 RXRATE         LVTTL input                    Receive clock rate select. When LOW, the RXCLK recovered clock outputs are
                static control input,          complementary clocks operating at the recovered character rate. Data for the receive channel
                internal pull-down             should be latched on either the rising edge of RXCLK+ or falling edge of RXCLK–.
                                               When HIGH, the RXCLK recovered clock outputs are complementary clocks operating at
                                               half the character rate. Data for the receive channel should be latched alternately on the rising
                                               edge of RXCLK+ and RXCLK–.
                                               When the output register is operated with REFCLK clocking (RXCKSEL = LOW), RXRATE is
                                               not interpreted and RXCLK± follows the frequency and duty cycle of REFCLK.
 RFEN           LVTTL input,                   Reframe enable. Active HIGH. When HIGH, the Framer in the receive channel is enabled to
                asynchronous,                  frame per the presently enabled framing mode and selected framing character.
                internal pull-down
 Note
  6. When REFCLK is configured for half-rate operation (TXRATE = HIGH), this input is sampled (or the outputs change) relative to both the rising and falling edges of
     REFCLK.

 RXMODE               3-level select[7]            Receive operating mode. This input selects one of two RXST channel status reporting
                      static control input         modes and is only interpreted when the decoder is enabled (DECMODE  LOW). See
                                                   Table 19 for details.
 FRAMCHAR             3-level select[7]            Framing character select. Used to select the character or portion of a character used for
                      static control input         character framing of the received data streams.
                                                   When MID, the framer looks for both positive and negative disparity versions of the eight-bit
                                                   comma character.
                                                   When HIGH, the framer looks for both positive and negative disparity versions of the K28.5
                                                   character.
                                                   Configuring FRAMCHAR = LOW is reserved for component test.
 RFMODE               3-level select static        Reframe mode select. Used to select the type of character framing used to adjust the
                      control input[7]             character boundaries (based on detection of one or more framing characters in the data
                                                   stream. This signal operates in conjunction with the type of framing character selected.
                                                   When LOW, the low-latency framer is selected. This will frame on each occurrence of the
                                                   selected framing character(s) in the received data stream. This mode of framing stretches the
                                                   recovered character-rate clock for one or multiple cycles to align that clock with the recovered
                                                   data.
                                                   When MID, the Cypress-mode multi-byte parallel framer is selected. This requires a pair of
                                                   the selected framing character(s), on identical 10-bit boundaries, within a span of 50 bits (five
                                                   characters), before the character boundaries are adjusted. The recovered character clock
                                                   remains in the same phase regardless of character offset.
                                                   When HIGH, the alternate-mode multi-byte parallel framer is selected. This requires detection
                                                   of the selected framing character(s) in the received data stream, on identical 10-bit
                                                   boundaries, on four directly adjacent characters. The recovered character clock remains in
                                                   the same phase regardless of character offset.
 PARCTL               3-level select static        Parity check/Generate control. Used to control the parity check and generate functions.
                      control input[7]             When LOW, parity checking is disabled, and the RXOP output is disabled (high Z).
                                                   When MID, and the 8B/10B encoder and decoder are enabled (TXMODE[1]  LOW,
                                                   DECMODE  LOW), TXD[7:0] inputs are checked (along with TXOP) for valid ODD parity,
                                                   and ODD parity is generated for the RXD[7:0] outputs and presented on RXOP. When the
                                                   8B/10B encoder and decoder are disabled (TXMODE[1]  LOW, DECMODE  LOW), the
                                                   TXD[7:0] and TXCT[1:0] inputs are checked (along with TXOP) for valid ODD parity, and ODD
                                                   parity is generated for the RXD[7:0] and RXST[1:0] outputs and presented on RXOP.
                                                   When HIGH, parity generation and checking are enabled. The TXD[7:0] and TXCT[1:0] inputs
                                                   are checked (along with TXOP) for valid ODD parity, and ODD parity is generated for the
                                                   RXD[7:0] and RXST[2:0] outputs and presented on RXOP.
                                                   See Table 2 and Table 15 for details.
 DECMODE              3-level select static        Decoder mode select. When LOW, the decoder is bypassed and raw 10-bit characters are
                      control input[7]             passed to the output register. When the decoder is bypassed, RXCKSEL must be MID.
                                                   When MID, the Cypress Decoder table for special code characters is used. When HIGH, the
                                                   alternate Decoder table for special code characters is used. See Table 21 for a list of the
                                                   special codes supported in both encoded modes.
 RXCKSEL              3-level select[7]            Receive clock mode. Selects the receive clock source used to transfer data to the output
                      static control input         registers and configures the elasticity buffer in the receive path.
                                                   When LOW, the output register is clocked by REFCLK. RXCLK and RXCLKC+ present
                                                   buffered and delayed forms of REFCLK.
                                                   When MID, the RXCLK output follows the recovered clock as selected by RXRATE and the
                                                   elasticity buffer is bypassed. When the 10B/8B decoder and elasticity buffer are bypassed
                                                   (DECMODE=LOW), RXCKSEL must be MID.
                                                   Configuring RXCKSEL = HIGH is an invalid mode of operation.
 Note
  7. 3-level select inputs are used for static configuration. They are ternary (not binary) inputs that make use of non-standard logic levels of LOW, MID, and HIGH. The
     LOW level is usually implemented by direct connection to VSS (ground). The HIGH level is usually implemented by direct connection to VCC (power). When not

 SPDSEL               3-level select,[8]           Serial rate select. This input specifies the operating bit-rate range of both transmit and
                      static control input         receive PLLs. LOW = 195–400 MBaud, MID = 400–800 MBaud, HIGH = 800–1500 MBaud.
                                                   When SPDSEL=LOW, setting TXRATE=HIGH (half-rate reference clock) is invalid.
 REFCLK              Differential LVPECL Reference clock. This clock input is used as the timing reference for the transmit PLL. It is
                      or single-ended              also used as the centering frequency of the range controller block of the receive CDR PLLs.
                      LVTTL input clock            This input clock may also be selected to clock the transmit and receive parallel interfaces.
                                                   When driven by a single-ended LVCMOS or LVTTL clock source, the clock source may be
                                                   connected to either the true or complement REFCLK input, with the alternate REFCLK input
                                                   left open (floating). When driven by an LVPECL clock source, the clock must be a differential
                                                   clock, using both inputs. When TXCKSEL = LOW, REFCLK is also used as the clock for the
                                                   parallel transmit data (input) interface. When RXCKSEL = LOW and decoder is enabled, the
                                                   elasticity buffer is enabled and REFCLK is used as the clock source for the parallel receive
                                                   data (output) interface.
                                                   If the elasticity buffer is used, framing characters will be inserted or deleted to/from the data
                                                   stream to compensate for frequency differences between the reference clock and recovered
                                                   clock. When addition happens, a K28.5 will be appended immediately after a framing
                                                   character is detected in the elasticity buffer. When deletion happens, a framing character will
                                                   be removed from the data stream when detected in the elasticity buffer.
 TRSTZ                LVTTL input,                 Device reset. Active LOW. Initializes all state machines and counters in the device.
                      internal pull-up             When sampled LOW by the rising edge of REFLCK, this input resets the internal state
                                                   machines and sets the elasticity buffer pointers to a nominal offset. When the reset is removed
                                                   (TRSTZ sampled HIGH by REFCLK), the status and data outputs will become deterministic
                                                   in less than 16 REFCLK cycles. The BISTLE, OELE, and RXLE latches are reset by TRSTZ.
                                                   If the elasticity buffer or the phase-align buffer are used, TRSTZ should be applied after
                                                   power-up to initialize the internal pointers into these memory arrays.

 IN1                 LVPECL differential          Primary differential serial data inputs. These inputs accept the serial data stream for
                      Input, with internal         deserialization and decoding. The IN1serial stream is passed to the receiver clock and data
                      DC restoration               recovery (CDR) circuit to extract the data content when INSEL = HIGH.
 IN2                 LVPECL differential          Secondary differential serial data inputs. These inputs accept the serial data stream for
                      input, with internal         deserialization and decoding. The IN2serial stream is passed to the receiver CDR circuit to

 INSEL                LVTTL input,                 Receive input selector. Determines which external serial bit stream is passed to the receiver
                      asynchronous                 CDR. When HIGH, the IN1 input is selected. When LOW, the IN2 input is selected.

 LPEN                 LVTTL input,                 Loop-back-enable. Active HIGH. When asserted (HIGH), the transmit serial data is internally
                      asynchronous,                routed to the receiver CDR circuit.All enabled serial drivers are forced to differential logic “1.”
                      internal pull-down           All serial data inputs are ignored.
  8. 3-level select inputs are used for static configuration. They are ternary (not binary) inputs that make use of non-standard logic levels of LOW, MID, and HIGH. The
     LOW level is usually implemented by direct connection to VSS (ground). The HIGH level is usually implemented by direct connection to VCC (power). When not
     connected or allowed to float, a 3-level select input will self-bias to the MID level.

 Pin Name      I/O Characteristics Signal Description
 OELE          LVTTL input,        Serial driver output enable latch enable. Active HIGH. When OELE = HIGH, the signals on
               asynchronous,       the BOE[1:0] inputs directly control the OUTx differential drivers. When the BOE[x] input is
               internal pull-up    HIGH, the associated OUTx differential driver is enabled. When the BOE[x] input is LOW,
                                   the associated OUTx differential driver is powered down. When OELE returns LOW, the last
                                   values present on BOE[1:0] are captured in the internal output enable latch. The specific
                                   mapping of BOE[1:0] signals to transmit output enables is listed in Table 14. If the device is
                                   reset (TRSTZ is sampled LOW), the latch is reset to disable both outputs.
 BISTLE        LVTTL input,        Transmit and receive BIST latch enable. Active HIGH. When BISTLE = HIGH, the signals
               asynchronous,       on the BOE[1:0] inputs directly control the transmit and receive BIST enables. When the
               internal pull-up    BOE[x] input is LOW, the associated transmit or receive channel is configured to generate or
                                   compare the BIST sequence. When the BOE[x] input is HIGH, the associated transmit or
                                   receive channel is configured for normal data transmission or reception. When BISTLE
                                   returns LOW, the last values present on BOE[1:0] are captured in the internal BIST enable
                                   latch. The specific mapping of BOE[1:0] signals to transmit and receive BIST enables is listed
                                   in Table 14. When the latch is closed, if the device is reset (TRSTZ is sampled LOW), the latch
                                   is reset to disable BIST on both the transmit and receive channels.
 RXLE          LVTTL input,        Receive channel power-control latch enable. Active HIGH. When RXLE = HIGH, the
               asynchronous,       signal on the BOE[0] input directly controls the power enable for the receive PLL and analog
               internal pull-up    logic. When the BOE[0] input is HIGH, the receive channel PLL and analog logic are active.
                                   When the BOE[0] input is LOW, the receive channel PLL and analog logic are placed in a
                                   non-functional power saving mode. When RXLE returns LOW, the last value present on
                                   BOE[0] is captured in the internal RX PLL enable latch. The specific mapping of BOE[1:0]
                                   signals to the receive channel enable is listed in Table 14. When the latch is closed, if the
                                   device is reset (TRSTZ is sampled LOW), the latch is reset to disable the receive channel.
 BOE[1:0]      LVTTL input,        BIST, serial output, and receive channel enables. These inputs are passed to and through
               asynchronous,       the output enable latch when OELE = HIGH, and captured in this latch when OELE returns
               internal pull-up    LOW. These inputs are passed to and through the BIST enable latch when BISTLE = HIGH,
                                   and captured in this latch when BISTLE returns LOW. These inputs are passed to and through
                                   the receive channel enable latch when RXLE = HIGH, and captured in this latch when RXLE
                                   returns LOW.
               LVTTL output,       Link fault indication output. Active LOW. LFI is the logical OR of four internal conditions:
 LFI           asynchronous         1. Received serial data frequency outside expected range
                                    2. Analog amplitude below expected levels
                                    3. Transition density lower than expected
                                    4. Receive channel disabled.

 Notes
  16. REFCLK has no phase or frequency relationship with the recovered clock(s) and only acts as a centering reference to reduce clock synchronization time. REFCLK
      must be within ±1500 PPM (±0.15%) of the remote transmitter’s PLL reference (REFCLK) frequency. Although transmitting to a HOTLink II receiver necessitates the
      frequency difference between the transmitter and receiver reference clocks to be within ±1500-PPM, the stability of the crystal needs to be within the limits specified
      by the appropriate standard when transmitting to a remote receiver that is compliant to that standard. For example, to be IEEE 802.3z Gigabit Ethernet compliant,
      the frequency stability of the crystal needs to be within ±100 PPM.
  17. When REFCLK is configured for half-rate operation (TXRATE = HIGH), this input is sampled (or the outputs change) relative to both the rising and falling edges of
      REFCLK.
  18. The peak amplitudes listed in this table are for typical waveforms that have generally 3–4 transitions for every ten bits. In a worse case environment the signals may
      have a sign-wave appearance (highest transition density with repeating 0101...). Signal peak amplitudes levels within this environment type could increase the values
      in the table above by approximately 100 mV.
  19. When a disabled receive channel is reenabled, the status of the LFI output and data on the parallel outputs may be indeterminate for up to 2 ms.

 Notes
  20. REFCLK has no phase or frequency relationship with the recovered clock(s) and only acts as a centering reference to reduce clock synchronization time. REFCLK
      must be within ±1500 ppm (±0.15%) of the remote transmitter’s PLL reference (REFCLK) frequency. Although transmitting to a HOTLink II receiver necessitates the
      frequency difference between the transmitter and receiver reference clocks to be within ±1500 ppm, the stability of the crystal needs to be within the limits specified
      by the appropriate standard when transmitting to a remote receiver that is compliant to that standard. For example, to be IEEE 802.3z Gigabit Ethernet compliant,
      the frequency stability of the crystal needs to be within ±100 ppm.
  21. The standard definition of a Comma contains only seven bits. However, since all valid Comma characters within the 8B/10B character set also have the 8th bit as
      an inversion of the 7th bit, the compare pattern is extended to a full eight bits to reduce the possibility of a framing error.
  22. When receive BIST is enabled on a channel, the low-latency framer must not be enabled. The BIST sequence contains an aliased K28.5 framing character, which
      would cause the receiver to update its character boundaries incorrectly.

 Notes
  26. Tested one output at a time, output shorted for less than one second, less than 10% duty cycle.
  27. This is the minimum difference in voltage between the true and complement inputs required to ensure detection of a logic-1 or logic-0. A logic-1 exists when the
      true (+) input is more positive than the complement () input. A logic-0 exists when the complement () input is more positive than true (+) input.
  28. The common mode range defines the allowable range of REFCLK+ and REFCLKwhen REFCLK+ = REFCLK. This marks the zero-crossing between the true
      and complement inputs as the signal switches between a logic-1 and a logic-0.

Notes
 29. This is the minimum difference in voltage between the true and complement inputs required to ensure detection of a logic-1 or logic-0. A logic-1 exists when
     the true (+) input is more positive than the complement () input. A logic-0 exists when the complement () input is more positive than true (+) input.
 30. The common mode range defines the allowable range of INPUT+ and INPUT when INPUT+ = INPUT. This marks the zero-crossing between the true and
     complement inputs as the signal switches between a logic-1 and a logic-0.
 31. Not applicable for AC-coupled interfaces. For AC-coupled interfaces, VDIFFS requirement still needs to be satisfied.
 32. Maximum ICC is measured with VCC = MAX, with all Serial Drivers enabled, parallel outputs unloaded, sending a alternating 01 pattern to the Serial Input Receiver.
 33. Typical ICC is measured under similar conditions except with VCC = 3.3V, TA = 25°C, parallel outputs unloaded, RXCKSEL = MID, and with one Serial Line
     Driver sending a continuous alternating 01 pattern to the Serial Input Receiver.
 34. Cypress uses constant current (ATE) load configurations and forcing functions. This figure is for reference only. 5pF differential load reflects tester capacitance,
     and is recommended at low data rates only.
 35. The LVTTL switching threshold is 1.4V. All timing references are made relative to the point where the signal edges crosses this threshold voltage.

Notes
 36. Tested initially and after any design or process changes that may affect these parameters, but not 100% tested.
 37. The ratio of rise time to falling time must not vary by greater than 2:1.
 38. For a given operating frequency, neither rise or fall specification can be greater than 20% of the clock-cycle period or the data sheet maximum time.
 39. Parallel data output specifications are only valid if all inputs or outputs are loaded with similar DC and AC loads.
 40. The duty cycle specification is a simultaneous condition with the tREFH and tREFL parameters. This means that at faster character rates the REFCLK duty cycle
     cannot be as large as 30%–70%.

Notes
 41. REFCLK has no phase or frequency relationship with the recovered clock(s) and only acts as a centering reference to reduce clock synchronization time. REFCLK
     must be within ±1500 ppm (±0.15%) of the remote transmitter’s PLL reference (REFCLK) frequency. Although transmitting to a HOTLink II receiver necessitates
     the frequency difference between the transmitter and receiver reference clocks to be within ±1500 ppm, the stability of the crystal needs to be within the limits
     specified by the appropriate standard when transmitting to a remote receiver that is compliant to that standard. For example, to be IEEE 802.3z Gigabit Ethernet
     compliant, the frequency stability of the crystal needs to be within ±100 ppm.
 42. Tested initially and after any design or process changes that may affect these parameters, but not 100% tested.
 43. Since this timing parameter is greater than the minimum time period of REFCLK it sets an upper limit to the frequency in which REFCLKx can be used to clock
     the receive data out of the output register. For predictable timing, users can use this parameter only if REFCLK period is greater than sum of tRREFDA and set-up
     time of the upstream device. When this condition is not true, RXCLKC± or RXCLKA± (a buffered or delayed version of REFCLK when RXCKSELx = LOW) could
     be used to clock the receive data out of the device.
 44. While sending continuous K28.5s, outputs loaded to a balanced 100 load, measured at the cross point of the differential outputs over the operating range.
 45. While sending continuous K28.7s, after 100,000 samples measured at the cross point of differential outputs, time referenced to REFCLK input, over the operating
     range.
 46. Total jitter is calculated at an assumed BER of 1E 12. Hence: Total Jitter (tJ) = (tRJ * 14) + tDJ.
 47. Also meets all Jitter Generation and Jitter Tolerance requirements as specified by SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M, CPRI, ESCON, FICON, Fibre Channel and
     DVB-ASI.
 48. Receiver UI (Unit Interval) is calculated as 1/(fREF * 20) (when RXRATE = HIGH) or 1/(fREF * 10) (when RXRATE = LOW) if no data is being received, or 1/(fREF * 20)(when
     RXRATE = HIGH) or 1/(fREF * 10) (when RXRATE = LOW) of the remote transmitter if data is being received. In an operating link this is equivalent to tB

Notes
 49. When REFCLK is configured for half-rate operation (TXRATE = HIGH) and data is captured using REFCLK instead of TXCLK clock (TXCKSEL = LOW), data
     is captured using both the rising and falling edges of REFCLK.
 50. The TXCLKO output is at twice the rate of REFCLK when TXRATE = HIGH and same rate as REFCLK when TXRATE = LOW. TXCLKO does not follow the duty
     cycle of REFCLK.
 51. The rising edge of TXCLKO output has no direct phase relationship to the REFCLK input.

 52. The rising edge of TXCLKO output has no direct phase relationship to the REFCLK input.
 53. RXCLK and RXCLK+ are delayed versions of REFCLK when RXCKSEL = LOW, and are different in phase from each other.
 54. When operated with a half-rate REFCLK, the setup and hold specifications for data relative to RXCLK are relative to both rising and falling edges of the clock output

Notes
 55. All codes not shown are reserved.
 56. Notation for Special Character Code Name is consistent with Fibre Channel and ESCON naming conventions. Special Character Code Name is intended to
     describe binary information present on I/O pins. Common usage for the name can either be in the form used for describing Data patterns (i.e., C0.0 through
     C31.7), or in hex notation (i.e., Cnn where nn = the specified value between 00 and FF).
 57. Both the Cypress and alternate encodings may be used for data transmission to generate specific Special Character Codes. The decoding process for received
     characters generates Cypress codes or Alternate codes as selected by the DECMODE configuration input.
 58. These characters are used for control of ESCON interfaces. They can be sent as embedded commands or other markers when not operating using ESCON protocols.
 59. The K28.5 character is used for framing operations by the receiver. It is also the pad or fill character transmitted to maintain the serial link when no user data is available.
 60. Care must be taken when using this Special Character code. When a K28.7(C7.0) or SVS(C0.7) is followed by a D11.x or D20.x,an alias K28.5 sync character
     is created. These sequences can cause erroneous framing and should be avoided while RFEN = HIGH.
 61. C2.1 = Transmit either K28.5+ or +K28.5 as determined by Current RD and modify the Transmission Character that follows, by setting its least significant bit
     to 1 or 0. If Current RD at the start of the following character is plus (+) the LSB is set to 0, and if Current RD is minus () the LSB becomes 1. This modification
     allows construction of X3.230 “EOF” frame delimiters wherein the second data byte is determined by the Current RD.
     For example, to send “EOFdt” the controller could issue the sequence C2.1D21.4 D21.4D21.4, and the HOTLink Transmitter will send either
     K28.5D21.4D21.4D21.4 or K28.5D21.5 D21.4D21.4 based on Current RD. Likewise to send “EOFdti” the controller could issue the sequence
     C2.1D10.4D21.4D21.4, and the HOTLink Transmitter will send either K28.5D10.4D21.4 D21.4 or K28.5D10.5D21.4 D21.4 based on Current RD.
     The receiver will never output this Special Character, since K28.5 is decoded as C5.0, C1.7, or C2.7, and the subsequent bytes are decoded as data.
 62. C0.7 = Transmit a deliberate code rule violation. The code chosen for this function follows the normal Running Disparity rules. The receiver will only output this
     Special Character if the Transmission Character being decoded is not found in the tables.
 63. C1.7 = Transmit Negative K28.5 (K28.5+) disregarding Current RD. The receiver will only output this Special Character if K28.5 is received with the wrong
     running disparity. The receiver will output C1.7 if K28.5 is received with RD+, otherwise K28.5 is decoded as C5.0 or C2.7.
 64. C2.7 = Transmit Positive K28.5 (+K28.5) disregarding Current RD. The receiver will only output this Special Character if K28.5 is received with the wrong
     running disparity. The receiver will output C2.7 if +K28.5 is received with RD, otherwise K28.5 is decoded as C5.0 or C1.7.
 65. C4.7 = Transmit a deliberate code rule violation to indicate a Running Disparity violation. The receiver will only output this Special Character if the Transmission
     Character being decoded is found in the tables, but Running Disparity does not match. This might indicate that an error occurred in a prior byte.
 66. Supported only for data transmission. The receive status for these conditions will be reported by specific combinations of receive status bits.
