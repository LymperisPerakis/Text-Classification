1.       DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The DS26514 is an 4-port monolithic device featuring independent transceivers that can be software configured for
T1, E1, or J1 operation. Each transceiver is composed of a line interface unit, framer, two HDLC controllers, elastic
store, and a TDM backplane interface. The DS26514 is controlled via an 8-bit parallel port or the SPI port. Internal
impedance matching and termination is provided for both transmit and receive paths, reducing external component
count.
Each LIU is composed of a transmit interface, receive interface, and a jitter attenuator. The transmit interface is
responsible for generating the necessary waveshapes for driving the network and providing the correct source
impedance depending on the type of media used. T1 waveform generation includes DSX-1 line build-outs as well
as CSU line build-outs of 0dB, -7.5dB, -15dB, and -22.5dB. E1 waveform generation includes G.703 waveshapes
for both 75Ω coax and 120Ω twisted cables. The receive interface provides network termination and recovers clock
and data from the network. The receive sensitivity adjusts automatically to the incoming signal level and can be
programmed for 0dB to -43dB or 0dB to -12dB for E1 applications and 0dB to -15dB or 0dB to -36dB for T1
applications. The jitter attenuator removes phase jitter from the transmitted or received signal. The crystal-less jitter
attenuator requires only a T1 or E1 clock rate, or multiple thereof, for both E1 and T1 applications, and can be
placed in either transmit or receive data paths.
On the transmit side, clock, data, and frame-sync signals are provided to the framer by the backplane interface
section. The framer inserts the appropriate synchronization framing patterns, alarm information, calculates and
inserts the CRC codes, and provides the B8ZS/HDB3 (zero code suppression) and AMI line coding. The receive-
side framer decodes AMI, B8ZS, and HDB3 line coding, synchronizes to the data stream, reports alarm
information, counts framing/coding/CRC errors, and provides clock, data, and frame-sync signals to the backplane
interface section.
There are two HDLC controllers per transceiver. Both transmit and receive paths have access to the two HDLC
controllers. One of the HDLC controllers can be assigned to some or all timeslots of the T1/E1 frame. This
controller has a FIFO depth of 256 bytes. The second controller is smaller and can be assigned to at most one
time slot, or a portion of a time slot, or to the FDL (T1) or the Sa bits (E1). This controller has a 64-byte FIFO.
The backplane interface provides a versatile method of sending and receiving data from the host system. Elastic
stores provide a method for interfacing to asynchronous systems, converting from a T1/E1 network to a 2.048MHz,
4.096MHz, 8.192MHz, 16.384MHz, or N x 64kHz system backplane. The elastic stores also manage slip conditions
(asynchronous interface). An interleave bus option (IBO) is provided to allow up to four transceivers (single
DS26514) to share a high-speed backplane. The DS26514 also contains an internal clock adapter useful for the
creation of a synchronous, high-frequency backplane timing source.
The microprocessor port provides access for configuration and status of all the DS26514’s features. Diagnostic
capabilities include loopbacks, PRBS pattern generation/detection, and 16-bit loop-up and loop-down code
generation and detection.

5.      ACRONYMS AND GLOSSARY
This data sheet assumes a particular nomenclature of the T1 and E1 operating environment. In each 125µs T1
frame, there are 24 8-bit channels plus a framing bit. It is assumed that the framing bit is sent first followed by
channel 1. For T1 and E1 each channel is made up of 8 bits, which are numbered 1 to 8. Bit 1, the MSB, is
transmitted first. Bit 8, the LSB, is transmitted last.
Locked refers to two clock signals that are phase- or frequency-locked or derived from a common clock (i.e., a
1.544MHz clock can be locked to a 2.048MHz clock if they share the same 8kHz component).

                                      driver tip outputs. These pins can be high impedance if:
      TTIP2          H1, H2
                                      If TXENABLE is low, TTIPn/TRINGn will be high impedance. Note that if
      TTIP3          J1 J2            TXENABLE is low, the register settings for control of TTIPn/TRINGn are ignored

      TTIP4          T1, T2   Output, and output is high impedance.
                               High   The differential outputs of TTIPn and TRINGn can provide internal matched
                            Impedance impedance for E1 75Ω, E1 120Ω, T1 100Ω, or J1 110Ω. The user can turn off
                                      internal termination.
                                      Note: The two pins shown for each transmit bipolar tip (e.g., pins A1 and A2 for
                                      TTIP1) should be tied together.
     TRING1          A3, B3           Transmit Bipolar Ring for Transceiver 1 to 4. These pins are differential line
                                      driver ring outputs. These pins can be high impedance if:
     TRING2          G3, H3
                                      If TXENABLE is low, TTIPn/TRINGn will be high impedance. Note that if
     TRING3          J3, K3           TXENABLE is low, the register settings for control of TTIPn/TRINGn are ignored
                              Analog
     TRING4          R3, T3   Output, and output is high impedance.
                               High   The differential outputs of TTIPn and TRINGn can provide internal matched
                            Impedance impedance for E1 75Ω, E1 120Ω, T1 100Ω, or J1 110Ω. The user can turn off
                                      internal termination.
                                      Note: The two pins shown for each transmit bipolar ring (e.g., pins A3 and B3 for
                                      TRING1) should be tied together.
                                      Transmit Enable. If this pin is pulled low, all transmitter outputs (TTIPn and
                                      TRINGn) are high impedance. The register settings for three-state control of
                                      TTIPn/TRINGn are ignored if TXENABLE is low. If TXENABLE is high, the
   TXENABLE/                          particular driver can be three-stated by the register settings.

     TSER2           E7             TCLKn when the transmit-side elastic store is disabled. These pins are sampled
                                    on the falling edge of TSYSCLKn when the transmit-side elastic store is enabled.
     TSER3           R4
                            Input   In IBO mode, data for multiple framers can be used in high-speed multiplexed
     TSER4           N7             scheme. This is described in Section 9.8.2. The table there presents the
                                    combination of framer data for each of the streams.
                                    TSYSCLKn is used as a reference when IBO is invoked. See Table 9-8.
     TCLK1           C5             Transmit Clock 1 to 4. A 1.544MHz or a 2.048MHz primary clock. Used to clock
     TCLK2           D7             data through the transmit side of the transceiver. TSERn data is sampled on the
                                    falling edge of TCLKn. TCLKn is used to sample TSERn when the elastic store is
     TCLK3           P5
                                    not enabled or IBO is not used. When the elastic store is enabled, TCLKn is
     TCLK4           L8             used as the internal transmit clock for the framer side or the elastic store
                                    including the transmit framer and LIU. With the elastic store enabled,
                            Input   TCLKn can be either synchronous or asynchronous to TSYSCLKn which
                                    either prevents or allows for slips. When IBO mode is enabled, TCLKn
                                    must be synchronous to TSYSCLKn which prevents slips in the elastic
                                    store.
                                    Note: This clock must be provided for proper device operation. The only
                                    exception is when the TCR3 register is configured to source TCLK
                                    internally from RCLK.
                                    Transmit System Clock 1. 1.544MHz, 2.048MHz, 4.096MHz, 8.192MHz, or
                                    16.384MHz clock. Only used when the transmit-side elastic store function is
                                    enabled. Should be tied low in applications that do not use the transmit-side
   TSYSCLK1          P13    Input   elastic store. The clock can be 4.096MHz, 8.912MHz, or 16.384MHz when IBO
                                    mode is used. TSYSCLK1 does not have an internal pulldown resistor. Note: If
                                    the GTCR1.528MD bit is set, TSYSCLK1 becomes the master TSYSCLK for all

                     F3             16.384MHz clock. Only used when the transmit-side elastic store function is
AL/RSIGF/FLOS2
   TSYSCLK3/                        enabled. Should be tied low in applications that do not use the transmit-side

                                    LOS (loss of signal) detected by the LIU front-end and framer LOS is LOS
                                    detection by the corresponding framer; the same pins can reflect receive-

                                    Transceiver Clock Control Register 1 (GTCCR1).
                                    AL/RSIGF/FLOS[8:2] is available only by setting the GTCR1.528MD bit to 1.
    TSYNC1/                         Transmit Synchronization 1 to 4. A pulse at these pins establishes either frame

                                    Transmit System Synchronization Out. If configured as an output and the
                                    transmit elastic store is enabled, an 8kHz pulse synchronous to the BPCLK1 will
                                    be generated. This pulse in combination with BPCLK1 can be used as an IBO
                                    master. TSSYNCIOn can be used as a source to RSYNCn and TSSYNCIOn of
                                    another DS26514 or RSYNC and TSSYNC of other Dallas Semiconductor parts.
                                    Note: TSSYNCIO[8:1] are not used when GTCR1.528MD is set. When
                                    GTCR1.528MD is set, the TSSYNCIO pin (N13) is used.

9.       FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
9.1      Processor Interface
Microprocessor control of the DS26514 is accomplished through the 28 hardware pins of the microprocessor port.
The 8-bit parallel data bus can be configured for Intel or Motorola modes of operation with the bus type select
(BTS) pin. When the BTS pin is a logic 0, bus timing is in Intel mode, as shown in Figure 13-2 and Figure 13-3.
When the BTS pin is a logic 1, bus timing is in Motorola mode, as shown in Figure 13-4 and Figure 13-5. The
address space is mapped through the use of 13 address lines, A[12:0]. Multiplexed mode is not supported on the
processor interface.
The chip-select bar (CSB) pin must be brought to a logic-low level to gain read and write access to the
microprocessor port. With Intel timing selected, the read-data bar (RDB) and write-read bar (WRB) pins are used to
indicate read and write operations and latch data through the interface. With Motorola timing selected, the read-
write bar (RWB) pin is used to indicate read and write operations while the data-strobe bar (DSB) pin is used to
latch data through the interface.
The interrupt output pin (INTB) is an open-drain output that asserts a logic-low level upon a number of software
maskable interrupt conditions. This pin is normally connected to the microprocessor interrupt input.
9.1.1    SPI Serial Port Mode
The external processor bus can be configured to operate in SPI serial bus mode. See Section 9.1.2 for detailed
timing diagrams.
When SPI_SEL = 1, SPI bus mode is implemented using four signals: clock (SPI_SCLK), master out-slave in data
(SPI_MOSI), master in-slave out data (SPI_MISO), and chip select (CSB). Clock polarity and phase can be set by
the D[7]/SPI_CPOL and D[6]/SPI_CPHA pins.
The order of the address and data bits in the serial stream is selectable using the D[5]/SPI_SWAP pin. The R/W bit
is always first and B bit is always last in the initial control word and are not effected by the D[5]/SPI_SWAP pin
setting.
SPI mode is not recommended for HDLC operations because of the bandwidth constraints of SPI.
9.1.2    SPI Functional Timing Diagrams
Note: The transmit and receive order of the address and data bits are selected by the D[5]/SPI_SWAP pin. The
R/W (read/write) MSB bit and B (burst) LSB bit position is not affected by the D[5]/SPI_SWAP pin setting.
9.1.2.1 SPI Transmission Format and CPHA Polarity
When SPI_CPHA = 0, CSB may be deasserted between accesses. An access is defined as one or two control
bytes followed by a data byte. CSB cannot be deasserted between the control bytes, or between the last control
byte and the data byte. When SPI_CPHA = 0, CSB may also remain asserted between accesses. If it remains
asserted and the BURST bit is set, no additional control bytes are expected after the first control byte(s) and data
are transferred. If the BURST bit is set, the address will be incremented for each additional byte of data transferred
until CSB is deasserted. If CSB remains asserted and the BURST bit is not set, a control byte(s) is expected
following the data byte, and the address for the next access will be received from that. Anytime CSB is deasserted,
the BURST access is terminated.
When SPI_CPHA = 1, CSB may remain asserted for more than one access without being toggled high and then
low again between accesses. If the BURST bit is set, the address should increment and no additional control bytes
are expected. If the BURST bit is not set, each data byte will be followed by the control byte(s) for the next access.
Additionally, CSB may also be deasserted between accesses when SPI_CPHA = 1. In the case, any BURST
access is terminated and the next byte received when CSB is reasserted will be a control byte.
The following diagrams describe the functionality of the SPI port for the four combinations of SPI_CPOL and
SPI_CPHA. They indicate the clock edge that samples the data and the level of the clock during no-transfer events
(high or low). Since the SPI port of the DS26514 acts as a slave device, the master device provides the clock. The

user must configure the SPI_CPOL and SPI_CPHA pins to describe which type of clock that the master device is
providing.

9.2     Clock Structure
The user should provide a system clock to the MCLK input of 2.048MHz, 1.544MHz, or a multiple of up to 8x the T1
and E1 frequencies. To meet many specifications, the MCLK source should have ±50ppm accuracy.
9.2.1   Backplane Clock Generation
The DS26514 provides facility for provision of BPCLK1 at 2.048MHz, 4.096MHz, 8.192MHz, 16.384MHz (see
Figure 9-9). The Global Transceiver Clock Control Register 1 (GTCCR1) is used to control the backplane clock
generation. This register is also used to program REFCLKIO as an input or output. REFCLKIO can be an output
sourcing MCLKT1 or MCLKE1 as shown in Figure 9-9.
This backplane clock and frame pulse (TSSYNCIOn) can be used by the DS26514 and other IBO-equipped
devices as an “IBO Bus Master.” Hence, the DS26514 provides the 8kHz sync pulse and 4MHz, 8MHz, and 16MHz
clock. This can be used by the link layer devices and frames connected to the IBO bus.

                                   REFCLKIO
The reference clock for the backplane clock generator can be as follows:
   • External Master Clock. A prescaler can be used to generate T1 or E1 frequency.
   • External Reference Clock REFCLKIO. This allows for multiple DS26514s to use the backplane clock from
        a common reference.
   • Internal LIU recovered RCLKs 1 to 4.
   • The clock generator can be used to generate BPCLK1 of 2.048MHz, 4.096MHz, 8.192MHz, or 16.384MHz
        for the IBO.
   • If MCLK or RCLKn is used as a reference, REFCLKIO can be used to provide a 2.048MHz or 1.544MHz
        clock for external use.

9.2.2    CLKO Output Clock Generation
This clock output is derived from MCLK based upon the setting of the CLKOSEL[2:0] bits in the GTCCR3
register.The reference for the PLL is not the input clock on MCLK, but the scaled version of MCLK (1.544MHz or
2.048MHz). The LTRCR.T1J1E1S bit also selects the proper PLL for use in generating the appropriate frequency.
This clock output pin is provided as an additional feature to eliminate the need for another board oscillator.

9.3      Resets and Power-Down Modes
A hardware reset is issued by forcing the RESETB pin to logic low. The RESETB input pin resets all framers, LIUs,
and BERTs. Note that not all registers are cleared to 00h on a reset condition. The register space must be
reinitialized to appropriate values after a hardware or software reset has occurred. This includes writing
reserved locations to 00h.

The DS26514 has several features included to reduce power consumption. The individual LIU transmitters can be
powered down by setting the TPDE bit in the LIU Maintenance Control Register (LMCR). Note that powering down
the transmit LIU results in a high-impedance state for the corresponding TTIPn and TRINGn pins and reduced
operating current. The RPDE in the LMCR register can be used to power down the LIU receiver.
The TE (transmit enable) bit in the LMCR register can be used to disable the TTIPn and TRINGn outputs and place
them in a high-impedance mode, while keeping the LIU in an active state (powered up). This is useful for
equipment protection-switching applications.

9.4       Initialization and Configuration
9.4.1     Example Device Initialization and Sequence
STEP 1: Reset the device by pulling the RESETB pin low, applying power to the device, or by using the software
reset bits outlined in Section 9.3. Clear all reset bits. Allow time for the reset recovery.
STEP 2: Check the Device ID in the IDR register.
STEP 3: Write the GTCCR1 register to correctly configure the system clocks. If supplying a 1.544MHz MCLK
follows this write with at least a 300ns delay in order to allow the clock system to properly adjust.
STEP 4: Write the entire remainder of the register space for each port with 00h, including reserved register
locations.
STEP 5: Write value 71h to address 1307h. This increases the frequency of the internally generated clock that is
supplied to the framers.
STEP 6: Choose T1/J1 or E1 operation for the framers by configuring the T1/E1 bit in the TMMR and RMMR
registers for each framer. Set the FRM_EN bit to 1 in the TMMR and RMMR registers. If using software transmit
signaling in E1 mode, program the E1TAF and E1TNAF registers as required. Configure the framer Transmit
Control Registers (TCR1–TCR4). Configure the framer Receive Control Registers (RCR1–RCR3). Configure other
framer features as appropriate.
STEP 7: Choose T1/J1 or E1 operation for the LIUs by configuring the T1J1E1S bit in the LTRCR register.
Configure the line build-out for each LIU. Configure other LIU features as appropriate. Set the TE (transmit enable)
bit to turn on the TTIPn and TRINGn outputs.
STEP 8: Configure the elastic stores, HDLC controller, and BERT as needed.
STEP 9: Set the INIT_DONE bit in the TMMR and RMMR registers for each framer.
9.5       Global Resources
All four framers share a common microprocessor port and a common MCLK. There is a common software
configurable BPCLK1 output. A set of global registers includes global resets, global interrupt status, interrupt
masking, clock configuration, and the device ID register. See the global register bit map in Table 10-7. A common
JTAG controller is used for all ports.
9.6       Per-Port Resources
Each port has an associated framer, LIU, BERT, jitter attenuator, and transmit/receive HDLC controller. Each of the
per-port functions has its own register space.
9.7       Device Interrupts
Figure 9-10 diagrams the flow of interrupt conditions from their source status bits through the multiple levels of
information registers and mask bits to the interrupt pin. When an interrupt occurs, the host can read the global
interrupt information registers GFISR1, GLISR1, and GBISR1 to quickly identify which of the four transceivers is
(are) causing the interrupt(s). The host can then read the specific transceiver’s interrupt information registers (TIIR,
RIIR) and the latched status registers (LLSR, BSR)to further identify the source of the interrupt(s). If TIIR or RIIR is
the source, the host reads the transmit latched status or the receive latched status registers for the source of the
interrupt. All interrupt information register bits are real-time bits that clear once the appropriate interrupt has been
serviced and cleared, as long as no additional, unmasked interrupt condition is present in the associated status
register. All latched status bits must be cleared by the host writing a “1” to the bit location of the interrupt condition
that has been serviced. Latched status bits that have been masked via the interrupt mask registers are masked
from the interrupt information registers. The interrupt mask register bits prevent individual latched status conditions
from generating an interrupt, but they do not prevent the latched status bits from being set. Therefore, when
servicing interrupts, the user should XOR the latched status with the associated interrupt mask in order to exclude
bits for which the user wished to prevent interrupt service. This architecture allows the application host to
periodically poll the latched status bits for noninterrupt conditions, while using only one set of registers.

9.8      System Backplane Interface
The DS26514 provides a versatile backplane interface that can be configured to:
     • Transmit and receive two-frame elastic stores
     • Mapping of T1 channels into a 2.048MHz backplane
     • IBO mode for multiple framers to share the backplane signals
     • Transmit and receive channel blocking capability
     • Fractional T1/E1/J1 support
     • Hardware-based (through the backplane interface) or processor-based signaling
     • Flexible backplane clock providing frequencies of 2.048MHz, 4.096MHz, 8.192MHz, 16.384MHz
     • Backplane clock and frame pulse (TSSYNCIOn) generator
9.8.1    Elastic Stores
The DS26514 contains dual, two-frame elastic stores for each framer: one for the receive direction and one for the
transmit direction. Both elastic stores are fully independent. The transmit- and receive-side elastic stores can be
enabled/disabled independently of each other. Also, the transmit or receive elastic store can interface to either a
1.544MHz or 2.048/4.096/8.192/16.384MHz backplane without regard to the backplane rate for the other elastic
store. All four channels have their own TSYSCLKn/RSYSCLKn pins, allowing a unique backplane system clock for
each channel. This allows for maximum flexibility in the design of the backplane clock structure.
The elastic stores have two main purposes. First, they can be used for rate conversion. When the DS26514 is in
the T1 mode, the elastic stores can rate convert the T1 data stream to a 2.048MHz backplane. In E1 mode the
elastic store can rate convert the E1 data stream to a 1.544MHz backplane. Second, they can be used to absorb
the differences in phase and frequency between the T1 or E1 clock and an asynchronous (i.e., not locked)
backplane clock, which can be 1.544MHz or 2.048MHz. If the two clocks are not frequency locked, the elastic
stores manage the rate difference and perform controlled slips, deleting or repeating frames of data in order to
manage the difference between the network and the backplane.
If the elastic store is enabled while in E1 mode, then either CAS or CRC4 multiframe boundaries are indicated via
the RMSYNCn output as controlled by the RSMS2 control bit (RIOCR.1). If the user selects to apply a 1.544MHz
clock to the RSYSCLKn pin, the Receive Blank Channel Select Registers (RBCS1–4) determine which channels of
the received E1 data stream will be deleted. In this mode an F-bit location is inserted into the RSERn data and set
to one. Also, in 1.544MHz applications, the RCHBLKn output will not be active in channels 25 to 32 (or in other
words, RCBR4 is not active). If the two-frame elastic buffer either fills or empties, a controlled slip will occur. If the
buffer empties, then a full frame of data will be repeated at RSERn and the RLS4.5 and RLS4.6 bits will be set to a
one. If the buffer fills, then a full frame of data will be deleted and the RLS4.5 and RLS4.7 bits will be set to a one.
The elastic stores can also be used to multiplex T1 or E1 data streams into higher backplane rates. This is the
Interleave Bus Option (IBO), which is discussed in Section 9.8.2. Table 9-3 shows the registers related to the
elastic stores.

9.8.1.1 Elastic Stores Initialization
There are two elastic store initializations that may be used to improve performance in certain applications: elastic
store reset and elastic store align. Both of these involve the manipulation of the elastic store’s read and write
pointers and are useful primarily in synchronous applications (RSYSCLKn/TSYSCLKn are locked to
RCLKn/TCLKn, respectively). The elastic store reset is used to minimize the delay through the elastic store. The
elastic store align bit is used to center the read/write pointers to the extent possible.

9.8.1.2 Minimum Delay Mode
Elastic store minimum delay mode may be used when the elastic store’s system clock is locked to its network clock
(i.e., RCLKn locked to RSYSCLKn for the receive side and TCLKn locked to TSYSCLKn for the transmit side).
RESCR.1 enables the receive elastic store minimum delay mode. When enabled, the elastic stores will be forced to
a maximum depth of 32 bits instead of the normal two-frame depth. This feature is useful primarily in applications
that interface to a 2.048MHz bus. Certain restrictions apply when minimum delay mode is used. In addition to the
restriction mentioned above, RSYNCn must be configured as an output when the receive elastic store is in
minimum delay mode, and TSYNCn must be configured as an output when transmit minimum delay mode is
enabled. In this mode, the SYNC outputs are always in frame mode (multiframe outputs are not allowed). In a
typical application RSYSCLKn and TSYSCLKn are locked to RCLKn, and RSYNCn (frame output mode) is
connected to TSSYNCIOn (frame input mode). The slip zone select bit (RSZS at RESCR.4) must be set to 1. All
the slip contention logic in the framer is disabled (since slips cannot occur). On power-up after the RSYSCLKn and
TSYSCLKn signals have locked to their respective network clock signals, the elastic store reset bit (RESCR.2)
should be toggled from a zero to a one to ensure proper operation.
9.8.1.3 Additional Receive Elastic Store Information
If the receive-side elastic store is enabled, then the user must provide either a 1.544MHz or 2.048MHz clock at the
RSYSCLKn pin. See Section 9.8.2 for higher rate system clock applications. The user has the option of either
providing a frame/multiframe sync at the RSYNCn pin or having the RSYNCn pin provide a pulse on
frame/multiframe boundaries. If signaling reinsertion is enabled, the robbed-bit signaling data is realigned to the
multiframe sync input on RSYNCn. Otherwise, a multiframe sync input on RSYNCn is treated as a simple frame
boundary by the elastic store. The framer will always indicate frame boundaries on the network side of the elastic
store via the RFSYNCn output whether the elastic store is enabled or not. Multiframe boundaries will always be
indicated via the RMSYNCn output. If the elastic store is enabled, then RMSYNCn will output the multiframe
boundary on the backplane side of the elastic store. When the device is receiving T1 and the backplane is enabled
for 2.048MHz operation, the RMSYNCn signal will output the T1 multiframe boundaries as delayed through the
elastic store. When the device is receiving E1 and the backplane is enabled for 1.544MHz operation, the
RMSYNCn signal will output the E1 multiframe boundaries as delayed through the elastic store.
If the user selects to apply a 2.048MHz clock to the RSYSCLKn pin, the user can use the backplane blank channel
select registers (RBCS1–4) to determine which channels will have the data output at RSERn forced to all ones.

9.8.1.4 Receiving Mapped T1 Channels from a 2.048MHz Backplane
Setting the TSCLKM bit in TIOCR.4 enables the transmit elastic store to operate with a 2.048MHz backplane (32
time slots / frame). In this mode the user can choose which of the backplane channels on TSERn will be mapped
into the T1 data stream by programming the Transmit Blank Channel Select registers (TBCS1–4). A logic 1 in the
associated bit location forces the transmit elastic store to ignore backplane data for that channel. Typically the user
will want to program eight channels to be ignored. The default (power-up) configuration will ignore channels 25–32,
so that the first 24 backplane channels are mapped into the T1 transmit data stream.
For example, if the user desired to transmit data from the 2.048MHz backplane channels 2–16 and 18–26, the
TBCS registers should be programmed as follows:
          TBCS1 = 01h :: ignore backplane channel 1 ::
          TBCS2 = 00h
          TBCS3 = 01h :: ignore backplane channel 17 ::
          TBCS4= FCh :: ignore backplane channels 27–32 ::
9.8.1.5 Mapping T1 Channels onto a 2.048MHz Backplane
Setting the RSCLKM bit in RIOCR.4 will enable the receive elastic store to operate with a 2.048MHz backplane (32
time slots/frame). In this mode the user can choose which of the backplane channels on RSERn receive the T1
data by programming the Receive Blank Channel Select registers (RBCS1–4). A logic 1 in the associated bit
location will force RSERn high for that backplane channel. Typically the user will want to program eight channels to
be blanked. The default (power-up) configuration will blank channels 25 to 32, so that the 24 T1 channels are
mapped into the first 24 channels of the 2.048MHz backplane. If the user chooses to blank channel 1 (TS0) by
setting RBCS1.0 = 1, then the F-bit will be passed into the MSB of TS0 on RSERn.
For example, if:
RBCS1 = 01h
RBCS2 = 00h
RBCS3 = 01h
RBCS4 = FCh
Then on RSERn:
          Channel 1 (MSB) = F-bit
          Channel 1 (bits 1-7) = all ones
          Channels 2-16 = T1 channels 1-15
          Channel 17 = all ones
          Channels 18-26 = T1 channels 16-24
          Channels 27-32 = all ones
Note that when two or more sequential channels are chosen to be blanked, the receive slip zone select bit should
be set to zero. If the blank channels are distributed (such as 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29), the RSZS bit can be set to
one, which can provide a lower occurrence of slips in certain applications.
If the two-frame elastic buffer either fills or empties, a controlled slip will occur. If the buffer empties, then a full
frame of data will be repeated at RSERn and the RLS4.5 and RLS4.6 bits will be set to a one. If the buffer fills, then
a full frame of data will be deleted and the RLS4.5 and RLS4.7 bits will be set to a one.
9.8.1.6 Receiving Mapped E1 Transmit Channels from a 1.544MHz Backplane
The user can use the TSCLKM bit in TIOCR.4 to enable the transmit elastic store to operate with a 1.544MHz
backplane (24 channels / frame + F-bit). In this mode the user can choose which of the E1 time slots will have all-
ones data inserted by programming the Transmit Blank Channel Select registers (TBCS1–4). A logic 1 in the
associated bit location will cause the elastic store to force all ones at the outgoing E1 data for that channel.
Typically the user will want to program eight channels to be blanked. The default (power-up) configuration will blank
channels 25 to 32, so that the first 24 E1 channels are mapped from the 24 channels of the 1.544MHz backplane.

9.8.1.7 Mapping E1 Channels onto a 1.544MHz Backplane
The user can use the RSCLKM bit in RIOCR.4 to enable the receive elastic store to operate with a 1.544MHz
backplane (24 channels / frame + F-bit). In this mode the user can choose which of the E1 time slots will be
ignored (not transmitted onto RSERn) by programming the Receive Blank Channel Select registers (RBCS1–4). A
logic 1 in the associated bit location will cause the elastic store to ignore the incoming E1 data for that channel.
Typically, the user will want to program eight channels to be ignored. The default (power-up) configuration will
ignore channels 25 to 32, so that the first 24 E1 channels are mapped into the 24 channels of the 1.544MHz
backplane. In this mode the F-bit location at RSERn is always set to 1.
For example, if the user wants to ignore E1 time slots 0 (channel 1) and TS 16 (channel 17), the RBCS registers
would be programmed as follows:
RBCS1 = 01h
RBCS2 = 00h
RBCS3 = 01h
RBCS4 = FCh
9.8.2    IBO Multiplexing
The DS26514 offers two methods of multiplexing data streams onto a high-speed backplane bus.
The default method multiplexes the data streams internally and then outputs them on one pin, e.g., RSER1. For
example, if the user wants to multiplex RSER[4:1] together to make a 8 MHz high-speed bus, the data stream will
be output on RSER1 only. The traditional method, external multiplexing of IBO operation, that allows the user to
gang signals together on the PCB is supported. RSERn and RSIGn will three-state at the appropriate times to allow
the ganging of these signals together. In a 16 MHz IBO bus, 8 channels are multiplexed. In this mode, the
DS26514 is assigned to channels 1-4 of the 8-channel bus. The DS26514 cannot assign its four datastreams to
other channels of the bus, e.g. channels 5-8 cannot be accessed or assigned. This applies to the internal
multiplexing and well as external multiplexing methods.
The selection between external ganging and internal multiplexing is made via GTCR1.GIBO.
Note that in IBO mode, the channel block signals TCHBLKn and RCHBLKn are referenced to as TSYSCLKn and
RSYSCLKn.
Figure 9-11, Figure 9-12, and Figure 9-13 show the equivalent internal circuit for each IBO mode. These figures
only show channels 1-4. Table 9-5 describes the pin function changes for each mode of the IBO multiplexer.

9.8.3    H.100 (CT Bus) Compatibility
The H.100 (or CT bus) is a synchronous, bit-serial, TDM transport bus operating at 8.192MHz. The H.100 standard
also allows compatibility modes to operate at 2.048MHz, 4.096MHz, or 8.192MHz. The control bit H100EN
(RIOCR.5), when combined with RSYNCINV and TSSYNCINV, allows the DS26514 to accept a CT-bus-
compatible frame-sync signal (CT_FRAME) at the RSYNCn and TSSYNCIOn (input mode) inputs. See Figure 9-14
and Figure 9-15.
The following rules apply to the H100EN control bit:
         1) The H100EN bit controls the sampling point for the RSYNCn (input mode) and TSSYNCIOn (input
            mode) only. The RSYNCn output and other sync signals are not affected.
         2) The H100EN bit would always be used in conjunction with the receive and transmit elastic store
            buffers.
         3) The H100EN bit would typically be used with 8.192MHz IBO mode, but could also be used with
            4.096MHz IBO mode or 2.048MHz backplane operation.
         4) The H100EN bit in RIOCR controls both RSYNCn and TSSYNCIOn (i.e., there is no separate control
            bit for the TSSYNCIOn).
         5) The H100EN bit does not invert the expected signal; RSYNCINV (RIOCR) and TSSYNCINV (TIOCR)
            must be set high to invert the inbound sync signals.

9.8.4    Transmit and Receive Channel Blocking Registers
The Receive Channel Blocking Registers (RCBR1/RCBR2/RCBR3/RCBR4) and the Transmit Channel Blocking
Registers (TCBR1/TCBR2/TCBR3/TCBR4) control the RCHBLKn and TCHBLKn pins, respectively. The RCHBLKn
and TCHBLKn pins are user-programmable outputs that can be forced either high or low during individual
channels. These outputs can be used to block clocks to a USART or LAPD controller in ISDN-PRI applications.
When the appropriate bits are set to a one, the RCHBLKn and TCHBLKn pins will be held high during the entire
corresponding channel time. When used with a T1 (1.544MHz) backplane, only TCBR1 to TCBR3 will be used.
TCBR4 is included to support an E1 (2.048MHz) backplane when the elastic store is configured for T1-to-E1 rate
conversion (See Section 9.8.1).
9.8.5    Transmit Fractional Support (Gapped Clock Mode)
The DS26514 can be programmed to output gapped clocks for selected channels in the receive and transmit paths
to simplify connections into a USART or LAPD controller in Fractional T1/E1 or ISDN-PRI applications. When the
gapped clock feature is enabled, a gated clock is output on the TCHCLK signal. The channel selection is controlled
via the Transmit Gapped Clock Channel Select Registers (TGCCS1–4). The transmit path is enabled for gapped
clock mode with the TGCLKEN bit (TESCR.6). Both 56kbps and 64kbps channel formats are supported as
determined by TESCR.7. When 56kbps mode is selected, the clock corresponding to the data/control bit in the
channel is omitted (only the seven most significant bits of the channel have clocks).
9.8.6    Receive Fractional Support (Gapped Clock Mode)
The DS26514 can be programmed to output gapped clocks for selected channels in the receive and transmit paths
to simplify connections into a USART or LAPD controller in Fractional T1/E1 or ISDN-PRI applications. When the
gapped clock feature is enabled, a gated clock is output on the RCHCLKn signal. The channel selection is
controlled via the Receive Gapped Clock Channel Select Registers (RGCCS1–4). The receive path is enabled for
gapped clock mode with the RGCLKEN bit (RESCR.6). Both 56kbps and 64kbps channel formats are supported as
determined by RESCR.7. When 56kbps mode is selected, the clock corresponding to the data/control bit in the
channel is omitted (only the seven most significant bits of the channel have clocks).

                                                                              DS26514 4-Port T1/E1/J1 Transceiver
9.9      Framers
The DS26514 framer cores are software selectable for T1, J1, or E1. The receive framer locates the frame and
multiframe boundaries and monitors the data stream for alarms. It is also used for extracting and inserting signaling
data, T1 FDL data, and E1 Si- and Sa-bit information. The receive-side framer decodes AMI, B8ZS line coding,
synchronizes to the data stream, reports alarm information, counts framing/coding and CRC errors, and provides
clock/data and frame-sync signals to the backplane interface section. Diagnostic capabilities include loopbacks,
and 16-bit loop-up and loop-down code detection. The device contains a set of internal registers for host access
and control of the device.
On the transmit side, clock, data, and frame-sync signals are provided to the framer by the backplane interface
section. The framer inserts the appropriate synchronization framing patterns, alarm information, calculates and
inserts the CRC codes, and provides the B8ZS (zero code suppression) and AMI line coding.
Both the transmit and receive path have an HDLC controller. The HDLC controller transmits and receives data via
the framer block. The HDLC controller may be assigned to any time slot, portion of a time slot, or to FDL (T1). The
HDLC controller has separate 64-byte Tx and Rx FIFO to reduce the amount of processor overhead required to
manage the flow of data.
The backplane interface provides a versatile method of sending and receiving data from the host system. Elastic
stores provide a method for interfacing to asynchronous systems, converting from a T1/E1 network to a 2.048MHz,
4.096MHz, 8.192MHz or N x 64kHz system backplane. The elastic stores also manage slip conditions
(asynchronous interface). An IBO (Interleave Bus Option) is provided to allow multiple framers in the DS26514 to
share a high-speed backplane.
9.9.1    T1 Framing
DS1 trunks contain 24 bytes of serial voice/data channels bundled with an overhead bit, the F-bit. The F-bit
contains a fixed pattern for the receiver to delineate the frame boundaries. The F-bit is inserted once per frame at
the beginning of the transmit frame boundary. The frames are further grouped into bundles of frames 12 for D4 and
24 for ESF.
The D4 and ESF framing modes are outlined in Table 9-11 and Table 9-12. In the D4 mode, framing bit for frame
12 is ignored if Japanese Yellow is selected. Table 9-13 shows SLC-96 framing.

9.9.3    T1 Transmit Synchronizer
The DS26514 transmitter can identify the D4 or ESF frame boundary, as well as the CRC multiframe boundaries
within the incoming NRZ data stream at TSERn. The TFM (TCR3.2) control bit determines whether the transmit
synchronizer searches for the D4 or ESF multiframe. Additional control signals for the transmit synchronizer are
located in the TSYNCC register. The latched status bit TLS3.0 (LOFD) is provided to indicate that a loss of frame
synchronization has occurred, and a real-time bit (LOF) which is set high when the synchronizer is searching for
frame/multiframe alignment. The LOFD bit can be enabled to cause an interrupt condition on INTB.
Note that when the transmit synchronizer is used, the TSYNCn signal should be set as an output (TSIO = 1) and
the recovered frame-sync pulse will be output on this signal. The recovered CRC-4 multi-frame sync pulse will be
output if enabled with TIOCR.0 (TSM = 1).
Other key points concerning the E1 transmit synchronizer:
     1) The Tx synchronizer is not operational when the transmit elastic store is enabled, including IBO modes.
     2) The Tx synchronizer does not perform CRC-6 alignment verification (ESF mode) and does not verify
         CRC-4 codewords.
The Tx synchronizer cannot search for the CAS multiframe. Table 9-16 shows the registers related to the transmit
synchronizer.

9.9.4.1 Transmit-Signaling Operation
There are two methods to provide transmit-signaling data. These are processor based (i.e., software based) or
hardware based. Processor-based refers to access through the transmit signaling registers, TS1–TS16, while
hardware based refers to using the TSIGn pins. Both methods can be used simultaneously.
9.9.4.1.1 Processor-Based Transmit Signaling
In processor-based mode, signaling data is loaded into the transmit-signaling registers (TS1–TS16) via the host
interface. On multiframe boundaries, the contents of these registers are loaded into a shift register for placement in
the appropriate bit position in the outgoing data stream. The user can utilize the transmit multiframe interrupt in the
Transmit Latched Status Register 1 (TLS1.2) to know when to update the signaling bits. The user need not update
any transmit signaling register for which there is no change of state for that register.
Each transmit-signaling register contains the robbed-bit signaling (TCR1.4 in T1 mode) or TS16 CAS signaling
(TCR1.6 in E1 mode) for one time slot that will be inserted into the outgoing stream. Signaling data can be sourced
from the TS registers on a per-channel basis by using the Software Signaling Insertion Enable Registers, SSIE1–4.
In T1 ESF framing mode, there are four signaling bits per channel (A, B, C, and D). TS1–TS12 contain a full
multiframe of signaling data. In T1 D4 framing mode, there are only two signaling bits per channel (A and B). In T1
D4 framing mode, the framer uses A and B bit positions for the next multiframe. The C and D bit positions become
‘don’t care’ in D4 mode.
In E1 mode, TS16 carries the signaling information. This information can be in either CCS (Common Channel
Signaling) or CAS (Channel Associated Signaling) format. The 32 time slots are referenced by two different
channel number schemes in E1. In “channel” numbering, TS0–TS31 are labeled channels 1 through 32. In “Phone
Channel” numbering TS1–TS15 are labeled channel 1 to channel 15 and TS17–TS31 are labeled channel 15 to
channel 30.

9.9.4.1.3 Hardware-Based Transmit Signaling
In hardware-based mode, signaling data is input via the TSIGn pin. This signaling PCM stream is buffered and
inserted to the data stream being input at the TSERn pin.
Signaling data may be input via the Transmit Hardware-Signaling Channel Select Register (THSCS1) function. The
framer can be set up to take the signaling data presented at the TSIGn pin and insert the signaling data into the
PCM data stream that is being input at the TSERn pin. The user can control which channels are to have signaling
data from the TSIGn pin inserted into them on a per-channel basis. The signaling insertion capabilities of the
framer are available whether the transmit-side elastic store is enabled or disabled. If the elastic store is enabled,
the backplane clock (TSYSCLKn) can be either 1.544MHz or 2.048MHz.

9.9.4.2 Receive-Signaling Operation
There are two methods to access receive-signaling data and provide transmit-signaling data: processor based (i.e.,
software based) or hardware based. Processor-based refers to access through the transmit- and receive-signaling
registers, RS1–RS16. Hardware based refers to the RSIGn pin. Both methods can be used simultaneously.
9.9.4.2.1 Processor-Based Receive Signaling
Signaling information is sampled from the receive data stream and copied into the Receive-Signaling Registers,
RS1–RS16. The signaling information in these registers is always updated on multiframe boundaries. This function
is always enabled.
9.9.4.2.2 Change of State
To avoid constant monitoring of the receive-signaling registers, the DS26514 can be programmed to alert the host
when any specific channel or channels undergo a change of their signaling state. RSCSE1–4 are used to select
which channels can cause a change of state indication. The change of state is indicated in Receive Latched Status
Register 4 (RLS4.3). If signaling integration is enabled, the new signaling state must be constant for three
multiframes before a change of state indication is indicated. The user can enable the INTB pin to toggle low upon
detection of a change in signaling by setting the interrupt mask bit RIM4.3. The signaling integration mode is global
and cannot be enabled on a channel-by-channel basis.
The user can identity which channels have undergone a signaling change of state by reading the Receive-
Signaling Status Registers (RSS1–4) . The information from these registers will tell the user which RSx register to
read for the new signaling data. All changes are indicated in the RSS1–4 registers regardless of the RSCSE1–4
registers.
9.9.4.2.3 Hardware-Based Receive Signaling
In hardware-based signaling the signaling data is can be obtained from the RSERn pin or the RSIGn pin. RSIGn is
a signaling PCM stream output on a channel by channel basis from the signaling buffer. The T1 robbed bit or E1
TS16 signaling data is still present in the original data stream at RSERn. The signaling buffer provides signaling
data to the RSIGn pin and also allows signaling data to be reinserted into the original data stream in a different
alignment that is determined by a multiframe signal from the RSYNCn pin. In this mode, the receive elastic store
may be enabled or disabled. If the receive elastic store is enabled, then the backplane clock (RSYSCLKn) can be
either 1.544MHz or 2.048MHz. In the ESF framing mode, the ABCD signaling bits are output on RSIGn in the lower
nibble of each channel. The RSIGn data is updated once a multiframe (3ms for T1 ESF, 1.5ms for T1 D4, 2ms for
E1 CAS) unless a signaling freeze is in effect. In the D4 framing mode, the AB signaling bits are output twice on
RSIGn in the lower nibble of each channel. Hence, bits 5 and 6 contain the same data as bits 7 and 8, respectively,
in each channel.
9.9.4.2.4 Receive-Signaling Reinsertion at RSERn
In this mode, the user will provide a multiframe sync at the RSYNCn pin and the signaling data will be reinserted
based on this alignment. In T1 mode, this results in two copies of the signaling data in the RSERn data stream. The
original signaling data based on the Fs/ESF frame positions and the realigned data based on the user supplied
multiframe sync applied at RSYNCn. In voice channels this extra copy of signaling data is of little consequence.
Reinsertion can be avoided in data channels since this feature is activated on a per-channel basis. For reinsertion,
the elastic store must be enabled and for T1, the backplane clock can be either 1.544MHz or 2.048MHz. E1
signaling information cannot be reinserted into a 1.544MHz backplane.
Signaling reinsertion mode is enabled, on a per-channel basis by setting the receive-signaling reinsertion channel
select bit high in the RSI1–4 register. The channels that are to have signaling reinserted are selected by writing to
the RSI1–4 registers. In E1 mode, the user will generally select all channels or none for reinsertion.
9.9.4.2.5 Force Receive-Signaling All Ones
In T1 mode, the user can on a per-channel basis force the robbed-bit signaling bit positions to a one. This is done
by using the Receive-Signaling All-Ones Insertion Registers (T1RSAOI1–3). The user sets the channel select bit in
the T1RSAOI1–3 registers to select the channels that are to have the signaling forced to one.

9.9.4.2.6 Receive-Signaling Freeze
The signaling data in the four multiframe signaling buffers will be frozen in a known good state upon either a loss of
synchronization (OOF event), carrier loss, or change of frame alignment. In T1 mode, this action meets the
requirements of BellCore TR-TSY-000170 for signaling freezing. To allow this freeze action to occur, the RSFE
control bit (RSIGC.1) should be set high. The user can force a freeze by setting the RSFF control bit (RSIGC.2)
high. The RSIGF output pin provides a hardware indication that a freeze is in effect. The four multiframe buffer
provides a three multiframe delay in the signaling bits provided at the RSIGn pin (and at the RSERn pin if receive-
signaling reinsertion is enabled). When freezing is enabled (RSFE = 1), the signaling data will be held in the last
known good state until the corrupting error condition subsides. When the error condition subsides, the signaling
data will be held in the old state for at least an additional 9ms (4.5ms in D4 framing mode, 6ms for E1 mode) before

The receive-signaling registers are frozen and not updated during a loss of sync condition. They will contain the
most recent signaling information before the LOF occurred.
9.9.4.3 Transmit SLC-96 Operation (T1 Mode Only)
In an SLC-96-based transmission scheme, the standard Fs-bit pattern is robbed to make room for a set of
message fields. The SLC-96 multiframe is made up of six D4 superframes, hence it is 72 frames long. In the 72-
frame SLC-96 multiframe, 36 of the framing bits are the normal Ft pattern and the other 36 bits are divided into
alarm, maintenance, spoiler, and concentrator bits as well as 12-bits of the normal Fs pattern. Additional SLC-96
information can be found in BellCore document TR-TSY-000008. Registers related to the transmit FDL are shown
in Table 9-18.

The T1TFDL register is used to insert the SLC-96 message fields. To insert the SLC-96 message using the
T1TFDL register, the user should configure the DS26514 as shown below:
         • T1.TCR2.6 (TSLC96) = 1 Enable Transmit SLC-96.
         • T1.TCR2.7 (TFDLS) = 0                    Source FS bits via TFDL or SLC-96 formatter.
         • TCR3.2 (TFM) = 1                         D4 framing mode.
         • TCR1.6 (TFPT) = 0                        Do not “pass through” TSERn F-bits.
The DS26514 will automatically insert the 12-bit alignment pattern in the Fs bits for the SLC-96 data link frame.
Data from the T1TSLC1–3 will be inserted into the remaining Fs-bit locations of the SLC-96 multiframe. The status
bit TSLC96 located at TLS1.4 will set to indicate that the SLC-96 data link buffer has been transmitted and that the
user should write new message data into T1TSLC1–3. The host will have 9ms after the assertion of TLS1.4 to write
the registers T1TSLC1–3. If no new data is provided in these registers, the previous values will be retransmitted.

9.9.4.4 Receive SLC-96 Operation (T1 Mode Only)
In an SLC-96-based transmission scheme, the standard Fs-bit pattern is robbed to make room for a set of
message fields. The SLC-96 multiframe is made up of six D4 superframes, hence it is 72 frames long. In the 72-
frame SLC-96 multiframe, 36 of the framing bits are the normal Ft pattern and the other 36-bits are divided into
alarm, maintenance, spoiler, and concentrator bits as well as 12-bits of the normal Fs pattern. Additional SLC-96
information can be found in BellCore document TR-TSY-000008.
To enable the DS26514 to synchronize onto a SLC-96 pattern, the following configuration should be used:
          • RCR1.5 (RFM) = 1                Set to D4 framing mode.
          • RCR1.3 (SYNCC) = 1              Set to cross-couple Ft and Fs bits.
          • T1RCR2.4 (RSLC96) = 1 Enable SLC-96 synchronizer.
          • RCR1.7 (SYNCT) = 0              Set to minimum sync time.
The SLC-96 message bits can be extracted via the T1RSLC1–3 registers. The status bit RSLC96 located at
RLS7.3 is useful for retrieving SLC-96 message data. The RSLC96 bit will indicate when the framer has updated
the data link registers T1RSLC1–3 with the latest message data from the incoming data stream. Once the RSLC96
bit is set, the user will have 9ms (or until the next RSLC96 interrupt) to retrieve the most recent message data from
the T1RSLC1–3 registers. Note that RSLC96 will not set if the DS26514 is unable to detect the 12-bit SLC-96
alignment pattern.

Bits 0 to 5 in the T1TBOC register contain the BOC message to be transmitted. Setting SBOC = 1 (THC2.6)
causes the transmit BOC controller to immediately begin inserting the BOC sequence into the FDL bit position. The
transmit BOC controller automatically provides the abort sequence. BOC messages will be transmitted as long as
SBOC is set. Note that the TFPT (TCR1.6) control bit must be set to zero for the BOC message to overwrite F-bit
information being sampled on TSERn.

In ESF mode, the DS26514 continuously monitors the receive message bits for a valid BOC message. The BOC
detect (BD) status bit at RLS7.0 will be set once a valid message has been detected for time determined by the
receive BOC filter bits RBF0 and RBF1 in the T1RBOCC register. The 6-bit BOC message will be available in the
RBOC register. Once the user has cleared the BD bit, it will remain clear until a new BOC is detected (or the same
BOC is detected following a BOC clear event). The BOC clear (BC) bit at RLS7.1 is set when a valid BOC is no
longer being detected for a time determined by the receive BOC disintegration bits RBD0 and RBD1 in the
T1RBOCC register.
The BD and BC status bits can create a hardware interrupt on the INTB signal as enabled by the associated
interrupt mask bits in the RIM7 register.

address + (n - 1) x 200hex), where n = 2 to 4 for Framers 2 to 4.
When enabled with T1.TCR2.7, the transmit section will shift out into the T1 data stream, either the FDL (in the
ESF framing mode) or the Fs bits (in the D4 framing mode) contained in the Transmit FDL Register (T1TFDL).
When a new value is written to the T1TFDL, it will be multiplexed serially (LSB first) into the proper position in the
outgoing T1 data stream. After the full eight bits has been shifted out, the framer will signal the host controller that
the buffer is empty and that more data is needed by setting the TLS2.4 bit to a one. INTB will also toggle low if
enabled via TIM2.4. The user has 2ms to update the T1TFDL with a new value. If the T1TFDL is not updated, the
old value in the T1TFDL register will be transmitted once again. Note that in this mode, no zero stuffing will be
applied to the FDL data. It is strongly suggested that the HDLC controller be used for FDL messaging applications.
In the D4 framing mode, the framer uses the T1TFDL register to insert the Fs framing pattern. To accomplish this
the T1TFDL register must be programmed to 1Ch and T1.TCR2.7 should be set to 0 (source Fs data from the
T1TFDL register).
The T1TFDL register contains the Facility Data Link (FDL) information that is to be inserted on a byte basis into the
outgoing T1 data stream. The LSB is transmitted first. In D4 mode, only the lower six bits are used.

In the receive section, the recovered FDL bits or Fs bits are shifted bit-by-bit into the Receive FDL Register
(T1RFDL). Since the T1RFDL is 8 bits in length, it will fill up every 2ms (8 times 250µs). The framer will signal an
external controller that the buffer has filled via the RLS7.2 bit. If enabled via RIM7.2, the INTB pin will toggle low
indicating that the buffer has filled and needs to be read. The user has 2ms to read this data before it is lost. Note
that no zero destuffing is applied to the for the data provided through the T1RFDL register. The T1RFDL register
reports the incoming Facility Data Link (FDL) or the incoming Fs bits. The LSB is received first. In D4 framing
mode, T1RFDL updates on multiframe boundaries and reports only the Fs bits.

9.9.6.1 Additional E1 Receive Sa- and Si-Bit Receive Operation (E1 Mode)
The DS26514, when operated in the E1 mode, provides for access to both the Sa and the Si bits via two methods.
The first involves using the internal E1RAF/E1RNAF and E1TAF/E1TNAF registers. The second method involves
an expanded version of the first method.
9.9.6.1.1 Internal Register Scheme Based on Double-Frame (Method 1)
On the receive side, the E1RAF and E1RNAF registers will always report the data as it received in the Sa and Si bit
locations. The E1RAFand E1RNAF registers are updated on align frame boundaries. The setting of the Receive
Align Frame bit in Receive Latched Status Register 2 (RLS2.0) will indicate that the contents of the RAF and RNAF
have been updated. The host can use the RLS2.0 bit to know when to read the E1RAF and E1RNAF registers. The
host has 250µs to retrieve the data before it is lost.
9.9.6.1.2 Internal Register Scheme Based on CRC-4 Multiframe (Receive)
On the receive side, there is a set of eight registers (E1RsiAF, E1RSiNAF, E1RRA, E1RSa4 to E1RSa8) that report
the Si and Sa bits as they are received. These registers are updated with the setting of the receive CRC-4
multiframe bit in Receive Latched Status Register 2 (RLS2.1). The host can use the RLS2.1 bit to know when to
read these registers. The user has 2ms to retrieve the data before it is lost. See the register descriptions for
additional information.
9.9.6.1.3 Internal Register Scheme Based on CRC-4 Multiframe (Transmit)
On the transmit side there is a set of eight registers (E1TSiAF, E1TSiNAF, E1TRA, E1TSa4 to E1TSa8) that, via
the E1 Transmit Sa-Bit Control Register (E1TSACR), can be programmed to insert both Si and Sa data. Data is
sampled from these registers with the setting of the transmit multiframe bit in Transmit Latched Status Register 1
(TLS1.3). The host can use the TLS1.3 bit to know when to update these registers. It has 2ms to update the data or
else the old data will be retransmitted. See the register descriptions in Section 10 for more information.
9.9.6.2 Sa-Bit Monitoring and Reporting
In addition to the registers outlined above, the DS26514 provides status and interrupt capability in order to detect
changes in the state of selected Sa bits. The E1RSAIMR register can be used to select which Sa bits are
monitored for a change of state. When a change of state is detected in one of the enabled Sa bit positions, a status
bit is set in the RLS7 register via the SaXCD bit (bit 0). This status bit can in turn be used to generate an interrupt
by unmasking RIM7.0 (SaXCD). If multiple Sa bits have been enabled, the user can read the SaBITS register at
address 06Eh to determine the current value of each Sa bit.
For the Sa6 bits, additional support is available to detect specific codewords per ETS 300 233. The Sa6CODE
register will report the received Sa6 codeword. The codeword must be stable for a period of three submultiframes
and be different from the previous stored value in order to be updated in this register. See the Sa6CODE register
description for further details on the operation of this register and the values reported in it. An additional status bit is
provided in RLS7.1 (Sa6CD) to indicate if the received Sa6 codeword has changed. A mask bit is provided for this
status bit in RIM7 to allow for interrupt generation when enabled.
9.9.7     Maintenance and Alarms
The DS26514 provides extensive functions for alarm detection and generation. It also provides diagnostic functions
for monitoring of performance and sending of diagnostic information:
     • Real-time and latched status bits, interrupts and interrupt mask for transmitter and receiver
     • LOS detection
     • RIA detection and generation
     • Error counters
     • DS0 monitoring
     • Milliwatt generation and detection
     • Slip buffer status for transmit and receive

9.9.7.1 Status and Information Bit Operation
When a particular event has occurred (or is occurring), the appropriate bit in one of these registers will be set to a
one. Status bits may operate in either a latched or real-time fashion. Some latched bits may be enabled to generate
a hardware interrupt via the INTB signal.
9.9.7.1.1 Real-Time Bits
Some status bits operate in a real-time fashion. These bits are read-only and indicate the present state of an alarm
or a condition. Real-time bits will remain stable, and valid during the host read operation. The current value of the
internal status signals can be read at any time from the real-time status registers without changing any the latched
status register bits.
9.9.7.1.2 Latched Bits
When an event or an alarm occurs and a latched bit is set to a one, it will remain set until cleared by the user.
These bits typically respond on a change-of-state for an alarm, condition, or event; and operate in a read-then-write
fashion. The user should read the value of the desired status bit, and then write a 1 to that particular bit location in
order to clear the latched value (write a 0 to locations not to be cleared). Once the bit is cleared, it will not be set
again until the event has occurred again.
9.9.7.1.3 Mask Bits
Some of the alarms and events can be either masked or unmasked from the interrupt pin via the Receive Interrupt
Mask Registers (RIM1, RIM3, RIM4, RIM5, RIM7). When unmasked, the INTB signal will be forced low when the
enabled event or condition occurs. The INTB pin will be allowed to return high (if no other unmasked interrupts are
present) when the user reads then clears (with a write) the alarm bit that caused the interrupt to occur. Note that
the latched status bit and the INTB pin will clear even if the alarm is still present.
Note that some conditions may have multiple status indications. For example, receive loss of frame (RLOF)
provides the following indications:
                                      Real-time indication that the receiver is not synchronized
                       RRTS1.0
                                      with incoming data stream. Read-only bit that remains high
                        (RLOF)
                                      as long as the condition is present.
                                      Latched indication that the receiver has loss
                        RLS1.0        synchronization since the bit was last cleared. Bit will clear
                       (RLOFD)        when written by the user, even if the condition is still
                                      present (rising edge detect of RRTS1.0).
                                      Latched indication that the receiver has reacquired
                        RLS1.4        synchronization since the bit was last cleared. Bit will clear
                       (RLOFC)        when written by the user, even if the condition is still
                                      present (falling edge detect of RRTS1.0).

Note 1:    The definition of the Alarm Indication Signal (Blue Alarm) is an unframed all-ones signal. AIS detectors should be able to operate
           properly in the presence of a 10E-3 error rate and they should not falsely trigger on a framed all-ones signal. The AIS alarm criteria
           in the DS26514 has been set to achieve this performance. It is recommended that the RAIS bit be qualified with the RLOF bit.

9.9.8.3 E1 Automatic Alarm Generation
The device can be programmed to automatically transmit AIS or remote alarm. When automatic AIS generation is
enabled (E1.TCR2.AAIS = 1), the device monitors the receive-side framer to determine if any of the following
conditions are present/loss of receive frame synchronization, AIS alarm (all ones) reception, or loss of receive
carrier (or signal). If any one (or more) of the above conditions is present, then the framer will either force an AIS.
When automatic RAI generation is enabled (E1.TCR2.ARA = 1), the framer monitors the receive side to determine
if any of the following conditions are present/ loss of receive frame synchronization, AIS alarm (all ones) reception,
or loss of receive carrier (or signal) or if CRC-4 multiframe synchronization cannot be found within 128ms of FAS
synchronization (if CRC-4 is enabled). If any one (or more) of the above conditions is present, then the framer will
transmit a RAI alarm. RAI generation conforms to ETS 300 011 and ITU-T G.706 specifications.
Note: It is an illegal state to have both automatic AIS generation and automatic remote alarm generation enabled
at the same time.
9.9.8.4 Receive AIS-CI and RAI-CI Detection
AIS-CI is a repetitive pattern of 1.26 seconds. It consists of 1.11 seconds of an unframed all-ones pattern and 0.15
seconds of all ones modified by the AIS-CI signature. The AIS-CI signature is a repetitive pattern 6176 bits in
length in which, if the first bit is numbered bit 0, bits 3088, 3474 and 5790 are logical zeros and all other bits in the
pattern are logical ones (T1.403). AIS-CI is an unframed pattern, so it is defined for all T1 framing formats. The
RAIS-CI bit is set when the AIS-CI pattern has been detected and RAIS (RRTS1.2) is set. RAIS-CI is a latched bit
that should be cleared by the host when read. RAIS-CI will continue to set approximately every 1.2 seconds that
the condition is present. The host will need to ‘poll’ the bit, in conjunction with the normal AIS indicators to
determine when the condition has cleared.
RAI-CI is a repetitive pattern within the ESF data link with a period of 1.08 seconds. It consists of sequentially
interleaving 0.99 seconds of “00000000 11111111” (right-to-left ) with 90 ms of “00111110 11111111”. The RRAI-
CI bit is set when a bit oriented code of “00111110 11111111” is detected while RRAI (RRTS1.3) is set. The RRAI-
CI detector uses the receive BOC filter bits (RBF0 and RBF1) located in RBOCC to determine the integration time
for RAI-CI detection. Like RAIS-CI, the RRAI-CI bit is latched and should be cleared by the host when read. RRAI-
CI will continue to set approximately every 1.1 seconds that the condition is present. The host will need to “poll” the
bit, in conjunction with the normal RAI indicators to determine when the condition has cleared. It may be useful to
enable the 200ms ESF RAI integration time with the RAIIE control bit (T1RCR2.1) in networks that utilize RAI-CI.
9.9.8.5 T1 Receive-Side Digital Milliwatt Code Generation
Receive-side digital milliwatt code generation involves using the T1 Receive Digital Milliwatt Registers
(T1RDMWE1–3) to determine which of the 24 T1 channels of the T1 line going to the backplane should be
overwritten with a digital milliwatt pattern. The digital milliwatt code is an 8-byte repeating pattern that represents a
1kHz sine wave (1E/0B/0B/1E/9E/8B/8B/9E). Each bit in the T1RDMWEx registers represents a particular channel.
If a bit is set to a one, then the receive data in that channel will be replaced with the digital milliwatt code. If a bit is
set to zero, no replacement occurs.

                                                                               DS26514 4-Port T1/E1/J1 Transceiver
9.9.9    Error Count Registers
The DS26514 contains four counters that are used to accumulate line coding errors, path errors, and
synchronization errors. Counter update options include one second boundaries, 42ms (T1 mode only), 62.5ms (E1
mode only) or manually. See the Error Counter Configuration Register (ERCNT). When updated automatically, the
user can use the interrupt from the timer to determine when to read these registers. All four counters will saturate at
their respective maximum counts and they will not roll over. (Note: Only the Line Code Violation Count Register
has the potential to overflow but the bit error would have to exceed 10E-2 before this would occur.)
The DS26514 can share the one-second timer from Port 1 across all ports. All DS26514 error/performance
counters can be configured to update on the shared one-second source or a separate manual update signal input.
See the ERCNT register for more information. By allowing multiple framer cores to synchronously latch their
counters, the host software can be streamlined to read and process performance information from multiple spans in
a more controlled manner.
9.9.9.1 Line Code Violation Count Register (LCVCR)
Either bipolar violations or code violations can be counted. Bipolar violations are defined as consecutive marks of
the same polarity. In T1 mode, if the B8ZS mode is set for the receive side, then B8ZS codewords are not counted
as BPVs. In E1 mode, if the HDB3 mode is set for the receive side, then HDB3 codewords are not counted as
BPVs. If ERCNT.0 is set, then the LVC counts code violations as defined in ITU-T O.161. Code violations are
defined as consecutive bipolar violations of the same polarity. In most applications, the framer should be
programmed to count BPVs when receiving AMI code and to count CVs when receiving B8ZS or HDB3 code. This
counter increments at all times and is not disabled by loss of sync conditions. The counter saturates at 65,535 and
will not rollover. The bit error rate on an E1 line would have to be greater than 10E-2 before the VCR would
saturate. See Table 9-28 and Table 9-29 for details of exactly what the LCVCRs count.

9.9.9.2 Path Code Violation Count Register (PCVCR)
In T1 operation, the Path Code Violation Count Register records either Ft, Fs, or CRC-6 errors. When the receive
side of a framer is set to operate in the T1 ESF framing mode, PCVCR will record errors in the CRC-6 codewords.
When set to operate in the T1 D4 framing mode, PCVCR will count errors in the Ft framing bit position. Via the
ERCNT.2 bit, a framer can be programmed to also report errors in the Fs framing bit position. The PCVCR will be
disabled during receive loss of synchronization (RLOF = 1) conditions. See Table 9-30 for a detailed description of
exactly what errors the PCVCR counts in T1 operation.
In E1 operation, the Path Code Violation Count Register records CRC-4 errors. Since the maximum CRC-4 count
in a one second period is 1000, this counter cannot saturate. The counter is disabled during loss of sync at either
the FAS or CRC-4 level; it will continue to count if loss of multiframe sync occurs at the CAS level.
The Path Code Violation Count Register 1 (PCVCR1) is the most significant word and the Path Code Violation
Count Register 2 (PCVCR2) is the least significant word of a 16-bit counter that records path violations (PVs).

9.9.9.3 Frames Out of Sync Count Register (FOSCR)
The FOSCR is used to count the number of multiframes that the receive synchronizer is out of sync. This number is
useful in ESF applications needing to measure the parameters loss of frame count (LOFC) and ESF error events
as described in AT&T publication TR54016. When the FOSCR is operated in this mode, it is not disabled during
receive loss of synchronization (RLOF = 1) conditions. The FOSCR has alternate operating mode whereby it will
count either errors in the Ft framing pattern (in the D4 mode) or errors in the FPS framing pattern (in the ESF
mode). When the FOSCR is operated in this mode, it is disabled during receive loss of synchronization (RLOF = 1)
conditions. See Table 9-31 for a detailed description of what the FOSCR is capable of counting.
In E1 mode, the FOSCR counts word errors in the frame alignment signal in time slot 0. This counter is disabled
when RLOF is high. FAS errors will not be counted when the framer is searching for FAS alignment and/or
synchronization at either the CAS or CRC-4 multiframe level. Since the maximum FAS word error count in a one-
second period is 4000, this counter cannot saturate.
The Frames Out of Sync Count Register 1 (FOSCR1) is the most significant word and the Frames Out of Sync
Count Register 2 FOSCR2 is the least significant word of a 16-bit counter that records frames out of sync.

9.9.9.4 E-Bit Counter (EBCR)
This counter is only available in E1 mode. The E-Bit Count Register 1 (E1EBCR1) is the most significant word and
the E-Bit Count Register 2 (E1EBCR2) is the least significant word of a 16-bit counter that records far-end block
errors (FEBE) as reported in the first bit of frames 13 and 15 on E1 lines running with CRC-4 multiframe. These
count registers will increment once each time the received E-bit is set to zero. Since the maximum E-bit count in a
one-second period is 1000, this counter cannot saturate. The counter is disabled during loss of sync at either the
FAS or CRC-4 level; it will continue to count if loss of multiframe sync occurs at the CAS level.

Note: The addresses shown above are for Framer 1. Addresses for Framers 2 to 4 can be calculated using the following: Framer n = (Framer 1
address + (n - 1) x 200hex), where n = 2 to 4 for Framers 2 to 4.
In the transmit direction the user will determine which channel is to be monitored by properly setting the TCM[4:0]
bits in the TDS0SEL register. In the receive direction, the RCM[4:0] bits in the RDS0SEL register need to be
properly set. The DS0 channel pointed to by the TCM[4:0] bits will appear in the Transmit DS0 Monitor Register
(TDS0M) and the DS0 channel pointed to by the RCM[4:0] bits will appear in the Receive DS0 Monitor Register
(RDS0M). The TCM[4:0] and RCM[4:0] bits should be programmed with the decimal decode of the appropriate
T1or E1 channel. T1 channels 1 to 24 map to register values 0 to 23. E1 channels 1 to 32 map to register values 0
to 31. For example, if DS0 channel 6 in the transmit direction and DS0 channel 15 in the receive direction needed
to be monitored, then the following values would be programmed into TDS0SEL and RDS0SEL:
                                                       TCM4 = 0          RCM4 = 0

9.9.11 Transmit Per-Channel Idle Code Generation
Channel data can be replaced by an idle code on a per-channel basis in the transmit and receive directions.
The Transmit Idle Code Definition Registers (TIDR1–32) are provided to set the 8-bit idle code for each channel.
The Transmit Channel Idle Code Enable registers (TCICE1–4) are used to enable idle code replacement on a per-
channel basis.
9.9.12 Receive Per-Channel Idle Code Insertion
Channel data can be replaced by an idle code on a per-channel basis in the transmit and receive directions. The
Receive Idle Code Definition Registers (RIDR1–32) are provided to set the 8-bit idle code for each channel. The
Receive Channel Idle Code Enable Registers (RCICE1–4) are used to enable idle code replacement on a per-
channel basis.
9.9.13 Per-Channel Loopback
The Per-Channel Loopback Enable Registers (PCL1–4) determine which channels (if any) from the backplane
should be replaced with the data from the receive side or in other words, off of the T1 or E1 line. If this loopback is
enabled, then transmit and receive clocks and frame syncs must be synchronized. One method to accomplish this
would be to tie RCLKn to TCLKn and RFSYNCn to TSYNCn. There are no restrictions on which channels can be
looped back or on how many channels can be looped back.
Each of the bit positions in PCL1–4) represents a DS0 channel in the outgoing frame. When these bits are set to a
one, data from the corresponding receive channel will replace the data on TSERn for that channel.
9.9.14 E1 G.706 Intermediate CRC-4 Updating (E1 Mode Only)
The DS26514 can implement the G.706 CRC-4 recalculation at intermediate path points. When this mode is
enabled, the data stream presented at TSERn will already have the FAS/NFAS, CRC multiframe alignment word,
and CRC-4 checksum in time slot 0. The user can modify the Sa-bit positions and this change in data content will
be used to modify the CRC-4 checksum. This modification, however, will not corrupt any error information the
original CRC-4 checksum may contain. In this mode of operation, TSYNCn must be configured to multiframe mode.
The data at TSERn must be aligned to the TSYNCn signal. If TSYNCn is an input then the user must assert
TSYNCn aligned at the beginning of the multiframe relative to TSERn. If TSYNCn is an output, the user must
multiframe align the data presented to TSERn. This mode is enabled with the TCR3.0 control bit (CRC4R). Note
that the E1 transmitter must already be enabled for CRC insertion with the TCR1.0 control bit (TCRC4). See Figure
9-16.

address + (n - 1) x 200hex), where n = 2 to 4 for Framers 2 to 4.
To transmit a pattern, the user will load the pattern to be sent into the Transmit Code Definition Registers (T1TCD1
and T1TCD2) and select the proper length of the pattern by setting the TC0 and TC1 bits in Transmit Control
Register 4 (TCR4). When generating a 1-, 2-, 4-, 8-, or 16-bit pattern both T1TCD1 and T1TCD2 must be filled with
the proper code. Generation of a 3-, 5-, 6-, and 7-bit pattern only requires T1TCD1 to be filled. Once this is
accomplished, the pattern will be transmitted as long as the TLOOP control bit (TCR3.0) is enabled. Normally
(unless the transmit formatter is programmed to not insert the F-bit position) the framer will overwrite the repeating
pattern once every 193 bits to allow the F-bit position to be sent.
As an example, to transmit the standard “loop-up” code for Channel Service Units (CSUs), which is a repeating
pattern of ...10000100001..., set TCD1 = 80h, TC0 = 0, TC1 = 0, and TCR3.0 = 1.

address + (n - 1) x 200hex), where n = 2 to 4 for Framers 2 to 4.
The framer has three programmable pattern detectors. Typically, two of the detectors are used for “loop-up” and
“loop-down” code detection. The user will program the codes to be detected in the Receive Up Code Definition
Registers 1 and 2 (T1RUPCD1 and T1RUPCD2) and the Receive Down Code Definition Registers 1 and 2
(T1RDNCD1 and T1RDNCD2) registers and the length of each pattern will be selected via the T1RIBCC register.
There is a third detector (spare) and it is defined and controlled via the T1RSCD1/T1RSCD2 and T1RSCC
registers. When detecting a 16-bit pattern both receive code definition registers are used together to form a 16-bit
register. For 8-bit patterns, both receive code definition registers will be filled with the same value. Detection of a
1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-bit pattern only requires the first receive code definition register to be filled. The framer
will detect repeating pattern codes in both framed and unframed circumstances with bit error rates as high as
10E–2. The detectors can handle both F-bit inserted and F-bit overwrite patterns. Writing the least significant byte
of receive code definition register resets the integration period for that detector. The code detector has a nominal
integration period of 48ms. Hence, after about 48ms of receiving a valid code, the proper status bit (LUP, LDN, and
LSP) will be set to a one. Note that real-time status bits, as well as latched set and clear bits are available for LUP,
LDN and LSP (RRTS3 and RLS3). Normally codes are sent for a period of 5 seconds. It is recommend that the
software poll the framer every 50ms to 100ms until 5 seconds has elapsed to ensure that the code is continuously
present.

9.10     HDLC Controllers
There are two HDLC Controllers available for each port of the DS26514. HDLC-64 is the default HDLC controller,
which is software compatible to the entire TEX series of SCTs. The HDLC-256 controller is available on the
DS26514 beginning with die revision B1. (Note: Older DS26514 die revisions do not have this feature so check

9.10.1 HDLC-64 Controller
This device has an enhanced HDLC controller that can be mapped into a single time slot, or Sa4 to Sa8 bits (E1
Mode) or the FDL (T1 Mode). This HDLC controller has a 64-byte FIFO buffer in both the transmit and receive
paths. The user can select any specific bits within the time slot(s) to assign to the HDLC-64 controller, as well as
specific Sa bits (E1 Mode)
The HDLC-64 controller performs all the necessary overhead for generating and receiving Performance Report
Messages (PRM) as described in ANSI T1.403 and the messages as described in AT&T TR54016. The HDLC
controller automatically generates and detects flags, generates and checks the CRC check sum, generates and
detects abort sequences, stuffs and de-stuffs zeros, and byte aligns to the data stream. The 64-byte buffers in the
HDLC-64 controller are large enough to allow a full PRM to be received or transmitted without host intervention.
The registers related to the HDLC are displayed in the following table.
Table 9-37 shows the registers related to the HDLC.

address + (n - 1) x 200hex); where n = 2 to 4 for Framers 2 to 4.
9.10.1.1             HDLC-64 FIFO Control
Control of the transmit and receive FIFOs is accomplished via the Receive HDLC-64 FIFO Control (RHFC) and
Transmit HDLC-64 FIFO Control (THFC) registers. The FIFO Control registers set the watermarks for the FIFO.
When the receive FIFO fills above the high watermark, the RHWM bit (RRTS5.1) will be set. RHWM and TLWM
are real-time bits and will remain set as long as the FIFO’s write pointer is above the watermark. When the transmit
FIFO empties below the low watermark, the TLWM bit in the TRTS2 register will be set. TLWM is a real-time bit
and will remain set as long as the transmit FIFO’s write pointer is below the watermark. If enabled, this condition
can also cause an interrupt via the INTB pin.
If the receive HDLC FIFO does overrun, the current packet being processed is dropped and the receive FIFO will
be emptied . The packet status bits in RRTS5 and RLS5.5 (ROVR) indicate an overrun.
9.10.1.2             Receive Packet Bytes Available
The lower 7 bits of the Receive HDLC Packet Bytes Available Register (RHPBA) indicates the number of bytes (0
to 64) that can be read from the receive FIFO. The value indicated by this register informs the host as to how many
bytes can be read from the receive FIFO without going past the end of a message. This value will refer to one of
four possibilities, the first part of a packet, the continuation of a packet, the last part of a packet, or a complete
packet. After reading the number of bytes indicated by this register the host then checks the HDLC status registers
for detailed message status.
If the value in the RHPBA register refers to the beginning portion of a message or continuation of a message, then
the MSB of the RHPBA register will return a value of 1. This indicates that the host can safely read the number of
bytes returned by the lower 7 bits of the RHPBA register, but there is no need to check the information register
since the packet has not yet terminated (successfully or otherwise).
9.10.1.3             HDLC-64 Status and Information
RRTS5, RLS5, and TLS2 provide status information for the HDLC controller. When a particular event has occurred
(or is occurring), the appropriate bit in one of these registers will be set to a one. Some of the bits in these registers
are latched and some are real-time bits that are not latched. This section contains register descriptions that list
which bits are latched and which are real-time. With the latched bits, when an event occurs and a bit is set to a
one, it will remain set until the user reads and clears that bit. The bit will be cleared when a 1 is written to the bit
and it will not be set again until the event has occurred again. The real-time bits report the current instantaneous
conditions that are occurring and the history of these bits is not latched.
Like the other latched status registers, the user will follow a read of the status bit with a write. The byte written to
the register will inform the device which of the latched bits the user wishes to clear (the real-time bits are not
affected by writing to the status register). The user will write a byte to one of these registers, with a one in the bit
positions he or she wishes to clear and a zero in the bit positions he or she does not wish to clear.
The HDLC status registers RLS5 and TLS2 have the ability to initiate a hardware interrupt via the INTB output
signal. Each of the events in this register can be either masked or unmasked from the interrupt pin via the HDLC
interrupt mask registers RIM5 and TIM2. Interrupts will force the INTB signal low when the event occurs. The INTB
pin will be allowed to return high (if no other interrupts are present) when the user reads the event bit that caused
the interrupt to occur.

9.10.1.4         Receive HDLC-64 Example
The HDLC status registers in the DS26514 allow for flexible software interface to meet the user’s preferences.
When receiving HDLC messages, the host can choose to be interrupt driven, to poll to desired status registers, or a
combination of polling and interrupt processes can be used. An example routine for using the DS26514 HDLC
receiver is given in Figure 9-17.

9.10.2.1         FIFO Information
The Transmit HDLC FIFO Buffer Available Register (TFBA) indicates the number of bytes that can be written into
the transmit FIFO. The count from this register informs the host as to how many bytes can be written into the
transmit FIFO without overflowing the buffer. This is a real-time register. The count shall remain valid and stable
during the read cycle.

9.10.3 HDLC-256 Controller
This device has an enhanced HDLC controller that can be mapped into up to 32 time slots, or Sa4 to Sa8 bits (E1
Mode) or the FDL (T1 Mode). This HDLC controller has a 256-byte FIFO buffer in both the transmit and receive
paths. The user can select any specific bits within the time slot(s) to assign to the HDLC-256 controller, as well as
specific Sa bits (E1 Mode)

The HDLC-256 controller performs all the necessary overhead for generating and receiving Performance Report
Messages (PRM) as described in ANSI T1.403 and the messages as described in AT&T TR54016. The HDLC
controller automatically generates and detects flags, generates and checks the CRC check sum, generates and
detects abort sequences, stuffs and de-stuffs zeros, and byte aligns to the data stream. The 256-byte buffers in the
HDLC-256 controller are large enough to allow a full PRM to be received or transmitted without host intervention.
They are also large enough to store an entire frame’s worth of data before requiring host intervention. The

9.10.3.1          HDLC-256 FIFO Control
Control of the transmit and receive FIFOs is accomplished via the Receive HDLC-256 Control Register 2
(RH256CR2) and Transmit HDLC-256 Control Register 2 (TH256CR2). The FIFO Control registers set the
watermarks for the FIFO.
When the receive FIFO fills above the data available level, the RHDA bit (RH256SR.0) will be set. RHDA and
THDA are real-time bits and will remain set as long as the FIFO’s write pointer is above the data available level.
When the transmit FIFO empties below the data storage available level , the THDA bit in the TH256SR1 register
will be set. THDA is a real-time bit and will remain set as long as the transmit FIFO’s write pointer is below the level
setting. If enabled, this condition can also cause an interrupt via the INTB pin.
If a packet start is received while the receive FIFO is full, the data is discarded and a FIFO overflow condition is
declared (RH256SRL.7). If any other packet data is received while full, the current packet being transferred is
marked with an abort indication, and a FIFO overflow condition is declared. Once a FIFO overflow condition is
declared, the Receive FIFO will discard incoming data until a packet start is received while the Receive FIFO has

sixteen or more bytes available for storage. If the Receive FIFO is read while the FIFO is empty, the read is
ignored, and an invalid data indication given.
The Transmit FIFO accepts data from the host until full. If the Transmit FIFO is written to while the FIFO is full, the
write is ignored, and a FIFO overflow condition is declared. If the Transmit HDLC Controller attempts to read the
Transmit FIFO while it is empty, a FIFO underflow condition is declared.
The transmit FIFO fill level is available real-time in the Transmit HDLC-256 Status Register 2 (TH256SR2),
indicating the number of bytes that can be written into the transmit FIFO.
9.10.3.2         HDLC-256 Status And Information
RH256SRL, RH256SR, TH256SR1, TH256SR2, and TH256SRL provide status information for the HDLC
controller. When a particular event has occurred (or is occurring), the appropriate bit in one of these registers will
be set to a one. Some of the bits in these registers are latched and some are real-time bits that are not latched.
This section contains register descriptions that list which bits are latched and which are real-time. With the latched
bits, when an event occurs and a bit is set to a one, it will remain set until the user reads and clears that bit. The bit
will be cleared when a ‘1’ is written to the bit and it will not be set again until the event has occurred again. The
real-time bits report the current instantaneous conditions that are occurring and the history of these bits is not
latched.
Like the other latched status registers, the user will follow a read of the status bit with a write. The byte written to
the register will inform the device which of the latched bits the user wishes to clear (the real-time bits are not
affected by writing to the status register). The user will write a byte to one of these registers, with a one in the bit
positions he or she wishes to clear and a zero in the bit positions he or she does not wish to clear.
The HDLC status registers RH256SRL and TH256SRL have the ability to initiate a hardware interrupt via the INTB
output signal. Each of the events in this register can be either masked or unmasked from the interrupt pin via the
HDLC Interrupt Enable Registers TH256SRIE and RH256SRIE . Interrupts will force the INTB signal low when the
event occurs. The INTB pin will be allowed to return high (if no other interrupts are present) when the user reads
the event bit that caused the interrupt to occur.
9.10.3.3         Receive HDLC-256 Example
The HDLC status registers in the DS26514 allow for flexible software interface to meet the user’s preferences.
When receiving HDLC messages, the host can chose to be interrupt driven, or to poll to desired status registers, or
a combination of polling and interrupt processes may be used. An example routine for using the DS26514 HDLC
receiver is given in the following figure.

9.12      Line Interface Units (LIUs)
The DS26514 has four identical LIU transmit and receive front-ends for each of the four framers. Each LIU contains
three sections: the transmitter, which waveshapes and drives the network line; the receiver, which handles clock
and data recovery; and the jitter attenuator. The DS26514 LIUs can switch between T1 or E1 networks without
changing any external components on either the transmit or receive side. Figure 9-21 shows a recommended
circuit for software selected termination with protection. In this configuration the device can connect to 100Ω T1
twisted pair, 110Ω J1 twisted pair, 75Ω or 120Ω E1 twisted pair without additional component changes. The signals
between the framer and LIU are not accessible by the user, thus the framer and LIU cannot be separated. The
transmitters have fast high-impedance capability and can be individually powered down.
The DS26514’s transmit waveforms meet the corresponding G.703 and T1.102 specifications. Internal software-
selectable transmit termination is provided for 100Ω T1 twisted pair, 110Ω J1 twisted pair, 120Ω E1 twisted pair
and 75Ω E1 coaxial applications. The receiver can connect to 100Ω T1 twisted pair, 110Ω J1 twisted pair, 120Ω E1
twisted pair, and 75Ω E1 coaxial. The receive LIU can function with a receive signal attenuation of up to 36dB for
T1 mode and 43dB for E1 mode. The receiver sensitivity is programmable from 12dB to 43dB of cable loss. Also a

9.12.1 LIU Operation
The analog AMI/HDB3 waveforms off of the E1 lines or the AMI/B8ZS waveform off of the T1 lines are transformer
coupled into the RTIPn and RRINGn pins of the DS26514. The user has the option to use internal termination,
software selectable for 75Ω/100Ω/110Ω/120Ω applications, or external termination. The LIU recovers clock and
data from the analog signal and passes it through the jitter attenuation mux. The DS26514 contains an active filter
that reconstructs the analog received signal for the nonlinear losses that occur in transmission. The receive
circuitry also is configurable for various monitor applications. The device has a usable receive sensitivity of 0dB to
-43dB for E1 and 0dB to -36dB for T1, which allows the device to operate on 0.63mm (22AWG) cables up to 2.5km
(E1) and 6k feet (T1) in length. Data input to the transmit side of the LIU is sent via the jitter attenuation mux to the
wave shaping circuitry and line driver. The DS26514 will drive the E1 or T1 line from the TTIPn and TRINGn pins
via a coupling transformer. The line driver can handle both CEPT 30/ISDN-PRI lines for E1 and long-haul (CSU) or
short-haul (DSX-1) lines for T1. The registers that control the LIU operation are shown in Table 9-39.

9.12.2 Transmitter
NRZ data arrives from the framer transmitter; the data is encoded with HDB3 or B8ZS or AMI. The encoded data
passes through a jitter attenuator if it is enabled for the transmit path. A digital sequencer and DAC are used to
generate transmit waveforms compliant with T1.102 and G.703 pulse templates.
A line driver is used to drive an internal matched impedance circuit for provision of 75Ω, 100Ω, 110Ω, and 120Ω
terminations. A 560pF capacitor should be placed between TTIPn and TRINGn for each transmitter for proper
operation, as noted in Figure 9-21. The transmitter couples to the E1 or T1 transmit twisted pair (or coaxial cable in
some E1 applications) via a 1:2 step-up transformer. In order for the device to create the proper waveforms, the
transformer used must meet the specifications listed in Table 9-41. The transmitter requires a transmit clock of
2.048MHz for E1 or 1.544MHz for T1/J1 operation.
The DS26514 drivers have a short-circuit and open-circuit detection driver-fail monitor. The TXENABLE pin can
high impedance the transmitter outputs for protection switching. The individual transmitters can also be placed in
high impedance through register settings. The DS26514 also has functionality for powering down the transmitters
individually. The relevant telecommunications specification compliance is shown in Table 9-40.

The DS26514 transmitters can be selected individually to meet the pulse templates for E1 and T1/J1 modes. The
T1/J1 pulse template is shown in Figure 9-22. The E1 pulse template is shown in Figure 9-23. The transmit pulse
shape can be configured for each LIU on an individual basis. The LIU transmit impedance selection registers can
be used to select an internal transmit terminating impedance of 100Ω for T1, 110Ω for J1 mode, 75Ω or 120Ω for
E1 mode or no internal termination for E1 or T1 mode. The transmit pulse shape and terminating impedance is
selected by LTIPSR registers. The pulse shapes will be compliant to T1.102 and G.703. Pulse shapes are
measured for compliance at the appropriate network interface (NI). For T1 long haul and E1, the pulse shape is
measured at the far end. For T1 short haul, the pulse shape is measured at the near end.

9.12.2.2          Transmit G.703 Section 10 Synchronization Signal
The DS26514 can transmit a 2.048MHz square-wave synchronization clock as specified in Section 10 of ITU-T
G.703. To use this mode, set the transmit G.703 synchronization clock bit (TG703) found in the LIU Transmit
Impedance and Pulse Shape Selection Register (LTIPSR). This mode also requires a 1µF blocking capacitor
between TTIPn and the transformer. Additionally, the following registers should set to center the pulse to meet the
pulse template:
                          If configuring for E1 75Ω mode, set register address 0x1229 = 0xF8.
             If configuring for E1 120Ω mode, set register addresses 0x1229 = 0xF8 and 0x122D = 0x09.
9.12.2.3          Transmit Power-Down
The individual transmitters can be powered down by setting the TPDE bit in the LIU Maintenance Control Register
(LMCR). Note that powering down the transmit LIU results in a high-impedance state for the corresponding TTIPn
and TRINGn pins.
When transmit all ones (AIS) is invoked, continuous ones are transmitted using MCLK as the timing reference.
Data input from the framer is ignored. AIS can be sent by setting a bit in the LMCR register. Transmit all ones will
also be sent if the corresponding receiver goes into LOS state and the ATAIS bit is set in the LMCRl register.
9.12.2.4          Transmit Short-Circuit Detector/Limiter
Each transmitter has an automatic short-circuit current limiter that activates when the load resistance is
approximately 25Ω or less. TSCS (LRSR.2) provides a real-time indication of when the current limiter is activated.
The LIU Latched Status Register (LLSR) provides latched versions of the information, which can be used to
activate an interrupt when enable via the LSIMR register.
9.12.2.5          Transmit Open-Circuit Detector
The DS26514 can also detect when the TTIPn or TRINGn outputs are open circuited. OCS (LRSR.1) will provide a
real-time indication of when an open circuit is detected. Register LLSR provides latched versions of the information,
which can be used to activate an interrupt when enabled via the LSIMR register. The open-circuit-detect feature is
not available in T1 CSU operating modes (LBO 5, LBO 6, and LBO 7).
9.12.3 Receiver
9.12.3.1          Receive Internal Termination
The DS26514 contains four receivers. The termination circuit provides an analog switch that powers up in the open
setting, providing high impedance to the receive line side. This is useful for redundancy applications and hot
swapability.
Three termination methods are available:
     •   Partially internal impedance match with 120Ω external resistor.
     •   Fully internal impedance match, no external resistor.
     •   External resistor termination, internal termination disabled.
See the LRISMR register for more details. Internal impedance match is configurable to 75Ω, 100Ω, 110Ω, or 120Ω
termination by setting the appropriate RIMPM[1:0] bits. These bits must be configured to match line impedance
even if internal termination is disabled.
Figure 9-24 shows a diagram of the switch control of termination. If internal impedance match is disabled, the
external resistor, RT, must match the line impedance.

The device couples to the receive E1 or T1 twisted pair (or coaxial cable in 75Ω E1 applications) via a 1:1 or 2:1
transformer. See Table 9-41 for transformer details.
Receive sensitivity is configurable by setting the appropriate RSMS[1:0] bits (LRCR).
The DS26514 uses a digital clock recovery system. The resultant E1, T1 or J1 clock derived from MCLK is
multiplied by 16 via an internal PLL and fed to the clock recovery system. The clock recovery system uses the
clock from the PLL circuit to form a 16 times oversampler, which is used to recover the clock and data. This
oversampling technique offers outstanding performance to meet jitter tolerance specifications shown in
Figure 9-27.
Normally, the clock that is output at the RCLKn pin is the recovered clock from the E1 AMI/HDB3 or T1 AMI/B8ZS
waveform presented at the RTIPn and RRINGn inputs. If the jitter attenuator (LTRCR) is placed in the receive path
(as is the case in most applications), the jitter attenuator restores the RCLKn to an approximate 50% duty cycle. If
the jitter attenuator is either placed in the transmit path or is disabled, the RCLKn output can exhibit slightly shorter
high cycles of the clock. This is due to the highly over-sampled digital clock recovery circuitry. See Table 13-3 for
more details. When no signal is present at RTIPn and RRINGn, a receive carrier loss (RCL) condition will occur
and the RCLKn will be derived from the MCLKT1 or MCLKE1 source (depending on the configuration).
9.12.3.2          Receive Level Indicator
The DS26514 will report the signal strength at RTIPn and RRINGn in approximately 2.5dB increments via RSL[3:0]
located in the LIU Receive Signal Level Register (LRSL). This feature is helpful when trouble shooting line
performance problems.
9.12.3.3          Receive G.703 Section 10 Synchronization Signal
The DS26514 can receive a 2.048MHz square-wave synchronization clock as specified in Section 10 of ITU-T
G.703. To use this mode, set the receive G.703 clock bit (RG703) found in the LIU Receive Control Register
(LRCR.7).
9.12.3.4          Receiver Monitor Mode
The receive equalizer is equipped with a monitor mode function that is used to overcome the signal attenuation
caused by the resistive bridge used in monitoring applications. This function allows for a resistive gain of up to
32dB along with cable attenuation of 12dB to 30dB as shown in the LIU Receive Control Register (LRCR).

9.12.3.5         Loss of Signal
The DS26514 uses both the digital and analog loss-detection method in compliance with the latest T1.231 for
T1/J1 and ITU-T G.775 or ETS 300 233 for E1 mode of operation.
LOS is detected if the receiver level falls bellow a threshold analog voltage for certain duration. Alternatively, this
can be termed as having received “zeros” for a certain duration. The signal level and timing duration are defined in
accordance with the T1.231 or G.775 or ETS 300 233 specifications.
For short-haul mode, the loss-detection thresholds are based on cable loss of 12dB to 18dB for both T1/J1 and E1
modes. The loss thresholds are selectable based on Table 10-23. For long-haul mode, the LOS-detection threshold
is based on cable loss of 30dB to 38dB for T1/J1 and 30dB to 45dB for E1 mode. Note there is no explicit bit called
short-haul mode selection. Loss declaration level is set at 3dB lower than the maximum sensitivity setting
programmed in Table 10-23.
The loss state is exited when the receiver detects a certain ones density at the maximum sensitivity level or higher,
which is 3dB higher than the loss-detection level. The loss-detection signal level and loss-reset signal level are
defined with hysteresis to prevent the receiver from bouncing between “LOS” and “no LOS” states. Table 9-42
outlines the specifications governing the loss function.

9.12.3.6           ANSI T1.231 for T1 and J1 Modes
For short-haul mode, loss is declared if the received signal level is 3dB lower from the programmed value (based
on Table 10-23) for a duration of 192-bit periods. Hence, if the sensitivity is programmed to be 12dB, loss is
declared at 15dB.
LOS is reset if all the following crieria are met:
    1) 24 or more ones are detected in a 192-bit period with a programmed sensitivity level measured at RTIPn
         and RRINGn.
    2) During the 192 bits, fewer than 100 consecutive zeros are detected.
For long-haul mode, loss is detected if the received signal level is 3dB lower from the programmed value (based on
Table 10-23) for a duration of 192-bit periods. Hence, if the sensitivity is programmed to be 30dB, the loss
declaration level is 33dB.
LOS is reset if all the following crieria are met:

9.12.3.7           ITU-T G.775 for E1 Modes
For short-haul mode, loss is declared if the received signal level is 3dB lower from the programmed value (based
on Table 10-23) for a duration of 192-bit periods. Hence, if the sensitivity is programmed to be 12dB, loss is
declared at 15dB. LOS is reset if the receive signal level is greater than or equal to the programmed sensitivity
level for a duration of 192-bit periods.
For long-haul mode, loss is detected if the received signal level is 3dB lower from the programmed value (based on

9.12.4 Hitless Protection Switching (HPS)
Many current redundancy protection implementations use mechanical relays to switch between primary and
backup boards. The switching time in relays is typically in the milliseconds, making T1/E1 HPS impossible. The
switching event will likely cause frame-synchronization loss in any equipment downstream, affecting the quality of
service. The same is also true for tri-stating mechanisms that use software or inactive clocks for the triggering of
HPS.
The DS26514 LIUs feature fast tristatable outputs for TTIPn and TRINGn and fast disabling of internal impedance
matching for RTIPn and RRINGn within one-bit period. The TXENABLE pin is used for hitless protection circuits in
combination with the LTRCR.RHPM bit. When low, the TXENABLE pin three-states all four transmitters, providing
a high-impedance state on TTIPn and TRINGn. If the RHPM bit is set, the TXENABLE pin, when low, will also
disable the internal termination on RTIPn and RRINGn on a per-port basis, providing a high impedance to the
receive line.
This is a very useful function in that control can be done through a hardware pin, allowing a quick switch to the
backup system for both the receiver and the transmitter. Figure 9-26 shows a typical HPS application.

9.12.5 Jitter Attenuator
Each LIU contains a jitter attenuator that can be set to a depth of 32 or 128 bits via the JADS bits in LIU Transmit
and Receive Control Register (LTRCR).
The 128-bit mode is used in applications where large excursions of wander are expected. The 32-bit mode is used
in delay sensitive applications. The characteristics of the attenuation are shown in Figure 9-27. The jitter attenuator
can be placed in either the receive path or the transmit path, or be disabled by appropriately setting the JAPS1 and
JAPS0 bits in the LIU Transmit and Receive Control Register (LTRCR).
For the jitter attenuator to operate properly, a 2.048MHz, 1.544MHz, or a multiple of up to 8x clock must be applied
at MCLK. See the Global Transceiver Clock Control Register 1 (GTCCR1) for MCLK options. ITU-T specification
G.703 requires an accuracy of ±50ppm for both T1/J1 and E1 applications. TR62411 and ANSI specs require an
accuracy of ±32ppm for T1/J1 interfaces. Circuitry adjusts either the recovered clock from the clock/data recovery
block or the clock applied at the TCLKn pin to create a smooth jitter-free clock, which is used to clock data out of
the jitter attenuator FIFO. It is acceptable to provide a gapped/bursty clock at the TCLKn pin if the jitter attenuator is
placed in the transmit side. If the incoming jitter exceeds either 120UIP-P (buffer depth is 128-bits) or 28UIP-P (buffer
depth is 32 bits), then the DS26514 will set the jitter attenuator limit trip (JALTS) bit in the LIU Latched Status
Register (LLSR.3). In T1/J1 mode, the jitter attenuator corner frequency is 3.75Hz, and in E1 mode it is 0.6Hz.
The DS26514 jitter attenuator is compliant with the following specifications shown in Table 9-43.

9.12.6 LIU Loopbacks
The DS26514 provides four LIU loopbacks for diagnostic purposes: Analog Loopback, Local Loopback, Remote
Loopback 1, and Remote Loopback 2. Dual Loopback is a combination of Local Loopback and Remote Loopback
1. In the loopback diagrams that follow, TSERn, TCLKn, RSERn, and RCLKn are inputs/outputs from the framer.

9.12.6.5          Dual Loopback
The inputs decoded from the receive LIU are looped back to the transmit LIU. The inputs from the transmit framer
are looped back to the receiver with the optional jitter attenuator. Dual Loopback is a combination of Local
Loopback and Remote Loopback 1. This loopback is invoked by setting the correct bits in the LIU Maintenance
Control Register (LMCR). This loopback is conceptually shown in Figure 9-32.

Note: The addresses shown above are for Framer 1.
The BERT block can generate and detect the following patterns:
     • The pseudorandom patterns 2E7-1, 2E9-1, 2E11-1, 2E15-1, and QRSS.
     • A repetitive pattern from 1 to 32 bits in length.
     • Alternating (16-bit) words that flip every 1 to 256 words.
     • Daly pattern (Modified 55 Octet pattern), 55 Octet pattern
The BERT function must be enabled and configured in the TXPC and RXPC registers for each port. The BERT can
then be assigned on a per-channel basis for both the transmitter and receiver, using the special per-channel
function in the TBPCS1-4 and RBCS1-4 registers. Individual bit positions within the channels can be suppressed
with the TBPBS and RBPBS registers. Using combinations of these functions, the BERT pattern can be transmitted
and/or received in single or across multiple DS0s, contiguous or broken. Transmit and receive bandwidth
assignments are independent of each other.
The BERT receiver has a 32-bit bit counter and a 24-bit error counter. The BERT receiver can generate interrupts
on: a change in receive-synchronizer status, receive all zeros, receive all ones, error counter overflow, bit counter
overflow, and bit error detection. Interrupts from each of these events can be masked within the BERT function via
the BERT Status Interrupt Mask Register (BSIM). If the software detects that the BERT has reported an event, then
the software must read the BERT Latched Status Register (BSR) to determine which event(s) has occurred.
Beginning with die revision B1, the DS26514 has a new set of BERT registers to complement the original registers.
These are located at 1400 hex. Additional features were added to support the 55 Octet Pattern and the ability to
byte-align to the DS0 timeslot. In addition, a new set of status registers was added that is intended to replace the
original status registers. The user now has the option to use either set of status registers, but it is recommended
that he/she use the new ones as they are more complete and easier to use. A BERT real-time status register
(BRSR) was added to provide better visibility of the status of the BERT.
9.13.1 BERT Repetitive Pattern Set
These registers must be properly loaded for the BERT to generate and synchronize to a repetitive pattern, a
pseudorandom pattern, alternating word pattern, or a Daly pattern. For a repetitive pattern that is fewer than 32
bits, the pattern should be repeated so that all 32 bits are used to describe the pattern. For example, if the pattern
was the repeating 5-bit pattern …01101… (where the rightmost bit is the one sent first and received first), then
BRP1 should be loaded with ADh, BRP2 with B5h, BRP3 with D6h, and BRP4 should be loaded with 5Ah. For a
pseudo-random pattern, all four registers should be loaded with all ones (i.e., FFh). For an alternating word pattern,
one word should be placed into BRP1 and BRP2 and the other word should be placed into BRP3 and BRP4. For
example, if the DDS stress pattern “7E” is to be described, the user would place 00h in BRP1, 00h in BRP2, 7Eh in
BRP3, and 7Eh in BRP4, and the alternating word counter would be set to 50 (decimal) to allow 100 bytes of 00h
followed by 100 bytes of 7Eh to be sent and received.
9.13.2 BERT Error Counter
Once BERT has achieved synchronization, this 24-bit counter will increment for each data bit received in error.
Toggling the LC control bit in BC1 can clear this counter. This counter saturates when full and will set the BECO
status bit in the BSR register.

10.     DEVICE REGISTERS
Thirteen address bits are used to control the settings of the registers. The registers control functions of the framers,
LIUs, and BERTs within the DS26514. The map is divided into four framers, followed by four LIUs and four BERTs.
Global registers (applicable to all four transceivers and BERTs) are located within the address space of Framer 1.
The register details are provided in the following tables. The framer registers bits are provided for Framer 1 and
address bits A[12:8] determine the framer addressed.
10.1    Register Listings
The framer registers have an offset of 200 hex, the LIU registers have an offset of 20 hex, and the BERT registers
have an offset of 10 hex for each transceiver.

10.2.2 Framer Register Bit Map
Table 10-8 contains the framer registers of the DS26514. Some registers have dual functionality based on the
selection of T1/J1 or E1 operating mode in the RMMR and TMMR registers. These dual-function registers are
shown below using two lines of text. The first line of text is the bit functionality for T1/J1 mode. The second line is
the bit functionality in E1 mode, in italics. Bits that are not used for an operating mode are denoted with a single
dash “—“. When there is only one set of bit definitions listed for a register, the bit functionality does not change with
respect to the selection of T1/J1 or E1 mode. All registers not listed are reserved and should be initialized with a
value of 00h for proper operation. The addresses shown are for Framer 1. Addresses for Framers 2 to 4 can be
calculated using the following formula: Address for Framer n = (Framer 1 address + (n - 1) x 200hex).

Bit 3: DS26524 Mode (524MD)
         0 = Normal operation.
         1 = Pin definitions switch to DS26524 pins to obtain pin compatibility with the DS26524.

Bit 2: Ganged IBO Enable (GIBO). This bit is used to select either the internal mux for IBO operation or an
external “wire-OR” operation. Normally this bit should be set = 0 and the internal mux used.
         0 = Use internal IBO mux.
         1 = Externally “wire-OR” TSERn and RSERn for IBO operation.
Note: Setting GIBO disables the internal IBO mux. GFCR1 must be set to inform the framers of the IBO
configuration.
Bit 1: Global Counter Latch Enable (GCLE). A low-to-high transition on this bit will, when enabled, latch the
framer performance monitor counters. Each framer can be independently enabled to accept this input. This bit must
be cleared and set again to perform another counter latch.
Bit 0: Global Interrupt Pin Inhibit (GIPI)
         0 = Normal Operation. Interrupt pin (INTB) will toggle low on an unmasked interrupt condition.
         1 = Interrupt Inhibit. Interrupt pin (INTB) is forced high (inactive) when this bit is set.

Bits 7 to 4: Backplane Clock Reference Selects (BPREFSEL[3:0]). These bits select which reference clock
source will be used for BPCLK1 generation. The BPCLK1 can be generated from LIU’s 1 to 4 recovered clocks, an
external reference, or derivatives of MCLK input. This is shown in Table 10-16. See Figure 9-9 for additional
information.
Bit 3: Backplane Frequency Select (BFREQSEL). In conjunction with BPRFSEL[3:0], this bit identifies the
reference clock frequency used by the DS26514 backplane clock generation circuit. Note that the setting of this bit
should match the T1E1 selection for the LIU whose recovered clock is being used to generate the backplane clock.
See Figure 9-9 for additional information.

Bits 2 to 0: Silicon Revision Bits (ID[2:0]). The lower three bits of the IDR are used to display a sequential
number denoting the die revision of the chip. The initial silicon revision = “000” and is incremented with each silicon
revision. This value is not the same as the two-character device revision on the top brand of the device. This is due
to the fact that portions of the device assembly other than the silicon may change, causing the device revision

Bit 7: Receive BOC Reset (RBR). The host should set this bit to force a reset of the BOC circuitry. Note that this is
an acknowledged reset—that is, the host needs only to set the bit and the DS26514 will clear it once the reset
operation is complete (less than 250µs). Modifications to the RBF[1:0] and RBD[1:0] bits will not be applied to the
BOC controller until a BOC reset has been completed.
Bits 5 and 4: Receive BOC Disintegration Bits (RBD[1:0]). The BOC disintegration filter sets the number of
message bits that must be received without a valid BOC to set the BC bit indicating that a valid BOC is no longer
being received.

In the ESF framing mode, there can be up to four signaling bits per channel (A, B, C, and D). In the D4 framing
mode, there are only two signaling bits per channel (A and B). In the D4 framing mode, the framer will repeat the A
and B signaling data in the C and D bit locations. Therefore, when the framer is operated in D4 framing mode, the
user will need to retrieve the signaling bits every 1.5ms as opposed to 3ms for ESF mode. The receive-signaling
registers are frozen and not updated during a loss of sync condition. They will contain the most recent signaling
information before the “OOF” occurred.

Note: This register has an alternate definition for T1 mode. See T1RFDL. All bits in this register are real-time (not latched).
Bits 7 to 3: CRC-4 Sync Counter Bits (CSC[5:2] and CSC0). The CRC-4 sync counter increments each time the
8ms CRC-4 multiframe search times out. The counter is cleared when the framer has successfully obtained
synchronization at the CRC-4 level. The counter can also be cleared by disabling the CRC-4 mode (RCR1.3 = 0).
This counter is useful for determining the amount of time the framer has been searching for synchronization at the
CRC-4 level. ITU-T G.706 suggests that if synchronization at the CRC-4 level cannot be obtained within 400 ms,
then the search should be abandoned and proper action taken. The CRC-4 sync counter will saturate (not rollover).
CSC0 is the LSB of the 6–bit counter. (Note: CSC1 is omitted to allow resolution to > 400ms using 5 bits.)
Bit 2: CRC-4 MF Sync Active (CRC4SA). Set while the synchronizer is searching for the CRC-4 MF alignment
word.
Bit 1: CAS MF Sync Active (CASSA). Set while the synchronizer is searching for the CAS MF alignment word.
Bit 0: FAS Sync Active (FASSA). Set while the synchronizer is searching for alignment at the FAS level.

The T1RBOC register always contains the last valid BOC received. The Receive FDL Register (T1RFDL) reports
the incoming Facility Data Link (FDL) or the incoming Fs bits. The LSB is received first. In D4 framing mode, RFDL
updates on multiframe boundaries and reports the six Fs bits in RFDL[5:0].

This register indicates the last received SaX bit. This can be used in conjunction with the RLS7 register to
determine which SaX bits have changed. The user can program which Sa bit positions should be monitored via the
E1RSAIMR register, and when a change is detected through an interrupt in RLS7.0, the user can determine which
bit has changed by reading this register and comparing it with previous known values.

This register will report the received Sa6 codeword per ETS 300 233. The bits are monitored on a submultiframe
asynchronous basis, so the pattern reported could be one of multiple patterns that would represent a valid
codeword. The table below indicates which patterns reported in this register correspond to a given valid Sa6
codeword.

Bit 7: Framer Enable (FRM_EN). This bit must be set to the desired state before writing INIT_DONE.
         0 = Framer disabled—held in low-power state.
         1 = Framer enabled—all features active.
Bit 6: Initialization Done (INIT_DONE). The user must set this bit once he has written the configuration registers.
The host is required to write or clear all device registers prior to setting this bit. Once INIT_DONE is set, the
DS26514 will check the FRM_EN bit and, if enabled, will begin operation based on the initial configuration.
Bit 5: Disable Receive-Side Synchronizer (DRSS). This bit must be set to the desired state before writing
INIT_DONE.
         0 = Synchronizer enabled.
         1 = Synchronizer disabled.
Bit 1: Soft Reset (SFTRST). Level sensitive “soft” reset. Should be taken high, then low to reset the receiver.
         0 = Normal operation.
         1 = Reset the receiver.
Note: This reset does not clear the registers.
Bit 0: Receiver T1/E1 Mode Select (T1/E1). Sets operating mode for receiver only! This bit must be set to the
desired state before writing INIT_DONE.
         0 = T1 operation.
         1 = E1 operation.

Bit 6: u-Law or A-Law Digital Milliwatt Code Select (uALAW)
         0 = u-law code is inserted based on T1RDMWE1–3 or E1RDMWE1–4 registers.
         1 = A-law code is inserted based on T1RDMWE1–3 or E1RDMWE1–4 registers.
Bit 5: RSERn Control (RSERC)
         0 = Allow RSERn to output data as received under all conditions (normal operation).
         1 = Force RSERn to one under loss of frame alignment conditions.
Bits 4 and 3: Receive Bit Inversion (BINV[1:0])
         00 = No inversion.
         01 = Invert framing.
         10 = Invert signaling.
         11 = Invert payload.
Bit 1: Payload Loopback (PLB)
         0 = Loopback disabled.
         1 = Loopback enabled.
When PLB is enabled, the following will occur:
     1)  Data will be transmitted on TTIPn and TRINGn synchronous with RCLKn instead of TCLKn.
     2)  All of the receive-side signals will continue to operate normally.
     3)  The TCHCLKn and TCHBLKn signals are forced low.
     4)  Data at the TSERn, TDATAn, and TSIGn pins is ignored.
In a PLB situation, the DS26514 will loop the 192 bits (248 for E1) of payload data (with BPVs corrected) from the
receive section back to the transmit section. The transmitter will follow the frame alignment provided by the
receiver. The receive frame boundary is automatically fed into the transmit section, such that the transmit frame
position is locked to the receiver (i.e., TSYNCn is sourced from RSYNCn). The FPS framing pattern, CRC-6
calculation, and the FDL bits (FAS word, Si, Sa, E bits, and CRC-4 for E1) are not looped back, they are reinserted
by the DS26514 (i.e., the transmit section will modify the payload as if it was input at TSERn).
Bit 0: Framer Loopback (FLB)
         0 = loopback disabled
         1 = loopback enabled
This loopback is useful in testing and debugging applications. In FLB, the DS26514 will loop data from the transmit
side back to the receive side. When FLB is enabled, the following will occur:
         1) (T1 mode) an unframed all-ones code will be transmitted at TTIPn and TRINGn.
            (E1 mode) normal data will be transmitted at TTIPn and TRINGn.
         2) Data at RTIPn and RRINGn will be ignored.
         3) All receive-side signals will take on timing synchronous with TCLKn instead of RCLKn.
         Note that it is not acceptable to have RCLKn tied to TCLKn during this loopback because this will cause an
         unstable condition.

Bit 7: RCLKn Invert (RCLKINV)
         0 = No inversion.
         1 = Invert RCLKn.
Bit 6: RSYNCn Invert (RSYNCINV)
         0 = No inversion.
         1 = Invert RSYNCn as either input or output.
Bit 5: H.100 Sync Mode (H100EN). See Section 0 for more information.
         0 = Normal operation.
         1 = RSYNCn and TSSYNCIOn signals are shifted.
Bit 4: RSYSCLKn Mode Select (RSCLKM)
         0 = If RSYSCLKn is 1.544MHz.
         1 = If RSYSCLKn is 2.048MHz or IBO enabled.
Bit 3: RSYNCn Multiframe Skip Control (RSMS) (T1 Mode Only). Useful in framing format conversions from D4
to ESF. This function is not available when the receive-side elastic store is enabled. RSYNCn must be set to output
multiframe pulses.
         0 = RSYNCn will output a pulse at every multiframe.
         1 = RSYNCn will output a pulse at every other multiframe.
Bit 2: RSYNCn I/O Select (RSIO). (Note: This bit must be set to zero when elastic store is disabled.) The default
value for this bit is a logic 1 so that the default state of RSYNCn is as an input.
         0 = RSYNCn is an output.
         1 = RSYNCn is an input (only valid if elastic store enabled).
Bit 1: RSYNCn Mode Select 2 (RSMS2)
         T1: RSYNCn pin must be programmed in the output frame mode.
         0 = do not pulse double wide in signaling frames.
         1 = do pulse double wide in signaling frames.
         E1: RSYNCn pin must be programmed in the output multiframe mode.
         0 = RSYNCn outputs CAS multiframe boundaries.
         1 = RSYNCn outputs CRC-4 multiframe boundaries.
In E1 mode, RSMS2 also selects which multiframe signal is available at the RMSYNCn pin, regardless of the
configuration for RSYNCn. When RSMS2 = 0, RMSYNCn outputs CAS multiframe boundaries; when RSMS2 = 1,
RMSYNCn outputs CRC-4 multiframe boundaries.
Bit 0: RSYNC Mode Select 1 (RSMS1). Selects frame or multiframe pulse when RSYNCn pin is in output mode. In
input mode (elastic store must be enabled) multiframe mode is only useful when receive signaling reinsertion is
enabled.
         0 = Frame mode.
         1 = Multiframe mode.

Bit 7: Receive Channel Data Format (RDATFMT)
         0 = 64kbps (data contained in all 8 bits).
         1 = 56kbps (data contained in 7 out of the 8 bits).
Bit 6: Receive Gapped Clock Enable (RGCLKEN)
         0 = RCHCLKn functions normally.
1 = Enable gapped bit clock output on RCHCLKn.
Note: RGPCKEN and RDATFMT are not associated with the elastic store and will be explained in the fractional
support section.
Bit 4: Receive Slip Zone Select (RSZS). This bit determines the minimum distance allowed between the elastic
store read and write pointers before forcing a controlled slip. This bit is only applies during T1 to E1 or E1 to T1
conversion applications.
         0 = Force a slip at 9 bytes or less of separation (used for clustered blank channels).
         1 = Force a slip at 2 bytes or less of separation (used for distributed blank channels and minimum delay
         mode).
Bit 3: Receive Elastic Store Align (RESALGN). Setting this bit from a zero to a one will force the receive elastic
store’s write/read pointers to a minimum separation of half a frame. No action will be taken if the pointer separation
is already greater or equal to half a frame. If pointer separation is less than half a frame, the command will be
executed and the data will be disrupted. Should be toggled after RSYSCLKn has been applied and is stable. Must
be cleared and set again for a subsequent align.
Bit 2: Receive Elastic Store Reset (RESR). Setting this bit from a zero to a one will force the read pointer into the
same frame that the write pointer is exiting, minimizing the delay through the elastic store. If this command should
place the pointers within the slip zone (see bit 4), then an immediate slip will occur and the pointers will move back
to opposite frames. Should be toggled after RSYSCLKn has been applied and is stable. Do not leave this bit set
HIGH.
Bit 1: Receive Elastic Store Minimum Delay Mode (RESMDM)
         0 = Elastic stores operate at full two-frame depth.
         1 = Elastic stores operate at 32-bit depth.
Bit 0: Receive Elastic Store Enable (RESE)
         0 = Elastic store is bypassed.

Bit 7: One-Second Select (1SECS). This bit allows for synchronization of the error counter updates between
multiple ports. When ERCNT.3 = 0, setting this bit (on a specific framer) will update the framer’s error counters on
the transition of the one-second timer from framer 1. Note that this bit should always be clear for framer 1.
         0 = Use the one-second timer that is internal to the framer.
         1 = Use the one-second timer from framer 1 to latch updates.
Bit 6 : Manual Counter Update Select (MCUS). When manual update mode is enabled with EAMS, this bit can be
used to allow the incoming LATCH_CNT signal to latch all counters. Useful for synchronously latching counters of
multiple DS26514 cores located on the same die.
         0 = MECU is used to manually latch counters.
         1 = Counters are latched on the rising edge of the LATCH_CNT signal.
Bit 5: Manual Error Counter Update (MECU). When enabled by ERCNT.3, the changing of this bit from a 0 to a 1
allows the next clock cycle to load the error counter registers with the latest counts and reset the counters. The
user must wait a minimum of 250µs before reading the error count registers to allow for proper update.
Bit 4: Error Counter Update Select (ECUS)
T1 mode:
         0 = Update error counters once a second.
         1 = Update error counters every 42ms (333 frames).
E1 mode:
         0 = Update error counters once a second.
         1 = Update error counters every 62.5ms (500 frames).
Bit 3: Error Accumulation Mode Select (EAMS)
         0 = Automatic updating of error counters enabled. The state of ERCNT.4 determines accumulation time
         (timed update).
         1 = User toggling of ERCNT.5 determines accumulation time (manual update).
Bit 2: PCVCR Fs-Bit Error Report Enable (FSBE) (T1 Mode Only)
         0 = Do not report bit errors in Fs-bit position; only Ft-bit position.
         1 = Report bit errors in Fs-bit position as well as Ft-bit position.
Bit 1: Multiframe Out of Sync Count Register Function Select (MOSCRF) (T1 Mode Only)
         0 = Count errors in the framing bit position.
         1 = Count the number of multiframes out of sync.
Bit 0: T1 Line Code Violation Count Register Function Select (LCVCRF)
         0 = Do not count excessive zeros.
         1 = Count excessive zeros.

Note: Status bits in this register are latched.
When a channel’s signaling data changes state, the respective bit in registers RSS1–4 will be set and latched. The
RSCOS bit (RLS4.3) will be set if the channel was also enabled by setting the appropriate bit in RSCSE1–4. The
INTB signal will go low if enabled by the interrupt mask bit RIM4.3. The bit will remain set until read.
*Note that in E1 CAS mode, the LSB of RSS1 would typically represent the CAS alignment bits, and the LSB of RSS3
represents reserved bits and the distant multiframe alarm.

The Receive Interrupt Information Register indicates which of the DS26514 status registers are generating an
interrupt. When an interrupt occurs, the host can read RIIR to quickly identify which of the receive status registers
is (are) causing the interrupt(s). The Receive Interrupt Information Register bits will clear once the appropriate
interrupt has been serviced and cleared, as long as no additional, unmasked interrupt condition is present in the
associated status register. Status bits that have been masked via the Receive Interrupt Mask (RIMx) registers will
also be masked from the RIIR register.

Bits 7 to 0: Receive Blank Channel Select for Channels 1 to 32 (CH[1:32])
         0 = Do not blank this channel (channel data is available on RSERn).
         1 = Data on RSERn is forced to all ones for this channel.
Note that when two or more sequential channels are chosen to be blanked, the receive-slip zone select bit should
be set to zero. If the blank channels are distributed (such as 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29), then the RSZS bit can be
set to one, which may provide a lower occurrence of slips in certain applications.

Bit 7 : Number Of Flags Select (NOFS).
         0 = send one flag between consecutive messages
         1 = send two flags between consecutive messages
Bit 6 : Transmit End of Message and Loop (TEOML). To loop on a message, should be set to a one just before
the last data byte of an HDLC packet is written into the transmit FIFO. The message will repeat until the user clears
this bit or a new message is written to the transmit FIFO. If the host clears the bit, the looping message will
complete then flags will be transmitted until new message is written to the FIFO. If the host terminates the loop by
writing a new message to the FIFO the loop will terminate, one or two flags will be transmitted and the new
message will start. If not disabled via TCRCD, the transmitter will automatically append a two-byte CRC code to the
end of all messages.
Bit 5 : Transmit HDLC-64 Reset (THR). Will reset the transmit HDLC-64 controller and flush the transmit FIFO. An
abort followed by 7Eh or FFh flags/idle will be transmitted until a new packet is initiated by writing new data into the
FIFO. This is an acknowledged reset, that is, the host need only to set the bit and the DS26514 will clear it once
the reset operation is complete. Total time for the reset is less than 250µs.
         0 = Normal operation
         1 = Reset transmit HDLC-64 controller and flush the transmit FIFO
Bit 4 : Transmit HDLC-64 Mapping Select (THMS).
         0 = Transmit HDLC-64 assigned to channels
         1 = Transmit HDLC-64 assigned to FDL(T1 mode), Sa Bits(E1 mode). This mode must be enabled with
         TCR2.7.
Bit 3 : Transmit Flag/Idle Select (TFS). This bit selects the inter-message fill character after the closing and
before the opening flags (7Eh).
         0 = 7Eh
         1 = FFh
Bit 2 : Transmit End of Message (TEOM). Should be set to a one just before the last data byte of an HDLC
packet is written into the transmit FIFO at THF. If not disabled via TCRCD, the transmitter will automatically append
a two byte CRC code to the end of the message.
Bit 1 : Transmit Zero Stuffer Defeat (TZSD). The Zero Stuffer function automatically inserts a zero in the
message field (between the flags) after 5 consecutive ones to prevent the emulation of a flag or abort sequence by
the data pattern. The receiver automatically removes (de-stuffs) any zero after 5 ones in the message field.
         0 = enable the zero stuffer (normal operation)
         1 = disable the zero stuffer
Bit 0 : Transmit CRC Defeat (TCRCD). A two-byte CRC code is automatically appended to the outbound
message. This bit can be used to disable the CRC function.
         0 = enable CRC generation (normal operation)
         1 = disable CRC generation

    0          1
                      1 channel time.
    1          0      Reserved.
    1          1      Use the signal present at RCLKn as the transmit clock. The TCLKn pin is ignored (loop time).
Bit 3: Multiframe Reference Select (MFRS). This bit selects the source for the transmit formatter multiframe
boundary.

         TSYNCn when TSYNCn is an input. Free-running when TSYNCn is an output.
         1 = Pass-Forward Operation. Tx multiframe boundary determined by 'system-side' counters referenced to
         TSSYNCIOn (input mode3), which is then passed forward to the line side clock domain. This mode can
         only be used when the transmit elastic store is enabled with a synchronous backplane (i.e., no frame slips
         allowed). This mode must be used to allow Tx hardware signaling insertion while the Tx elastic store is
         enabled.

into the transmit data stream. Once this bit has been toggled from a 0 to a 1, the device waits for the next
occurrence of three consecutive ones to insert the BPV. This bit must be cleared and set again for a subsequent
error to be inserted.
Bit 0 (T1 Mode): Transmit Loop Code Enable (TLOOP). See Section 9.9.15 for details.
         0 = Transmit data normally.
         1 = Replace normal transmitted data with repeating code as defined in registers T1TCD1 and T1TCD2.
Bit 0 (E1 Mode): CRC-4 Recalculate (CRC4R)
         0 = Transmit CRC-4 generation and insertion operates in normal mode.
         1 = Transmit CRC-4 generation operates according to G.706 Intermediate Path Recalculation method.

Bit 4: Transmit Slip Zone Select (TSZS). This bit determines the minimum distance allowed between the elastic
store read and write pointers before forcing a controlled slip. This bit is only applies during T1 to E1 or E1 to T1
conversion applications.
          0 = Force a slip at 9 bytes or less of separation (used for clustered blank channels).
          1 = Force a slip at 2 bytes or less of separation (used for distributed blank channels).
Bit 3: Transmit Elastic Store Align (TESALGN). Setting this bit from a zero to a one will force the transmit elastic
store’s write/read pointers to a minimum separation of half a frame. No action will be taken if the pointer separation
is already greater or equal to half a frame. If pointer separation is less than half a frame, the command will be
executed and the data will be disrupted. Should be toggled after TSYSCLKn has been applied and is stable. Must
be cleared and set again for a subsequent align.
Bit 2: Transmit Elastic Store Reset (TESR). Setting this bit from a zero to a one will force the read pointer into
the same frame that the write pointer is exiting, minimizing the delay through the elastic store. If this command
should place the pointers within the slip zone (see bit 4), then an immediate slip will occur and the pointers will
move back to opposite frames. Should be toggled after TSYSCLKn has been applied and is stable. Do not leave
this bit set high.
Bit 1: Transmit Elastic Store Minimum Delay Mode (TESMDM)
          0 = Elastic stores operate at full two-frame depth.
          1 = Elastic stores operate at 32-bit depth.

Bit 7: Transmit Elastic Store Full Event (TESF). Set when the transmit elastic store buffer fills and a frame is
deleted.
Bit 6: Transmit Elastic Store Empty Event (TESEM). Set when the transmit elastic store buffer empties and a
frame is repeated.
Bit 5: Transmit Elastic Store Slip Occurrence Event (TSLIP). Set when the transmit elastic store has either
repeated or deleted a frame.
Bit 4: Transmit SLC-96 Multiframe Event (TSLC96) (T1 Mode Only). When enabled by T1.TCR2.6, this bit will
set once per SLC-96 multiframe (72 frames) to alert the host that new data may be written to the T1TSLC1–3
registers. See Section 9.9.4.3 for more information.
Bit 3: Transmit Align Frame Event (TAF) (E1 Mode Only). Set every 250µs to alert the host that the E1TAF and
E1TNAF registers need to be updated.
Bit 2: Transmit Multiframe Event (TMF). In T1 mode, this bit is set every 1.5ms on D4 MF boundaries or every
3ms on ESF MF boundaries. In E1 operation, this but is set every 2ms (regardless if CRC-4 is enabled) on transmit
multiframe boundaries. Used to alert the host that signaling data needs to be updated.
Bit 1: Loss of Transmit Clock Condition Clear (LOTCC). Set when the LOTC condition has cleared (a clock has
been sensed at the TCLKn pin).
Bit 0: Loss of Transmit Clock Condition (LOTC). Set when the TCLKn pin has not transitioned for approximately
3 clock periods. Will force the LOTC pin high if enabled. This bit can be cleared by the host even if the condition is
still present. The LOTC pin will remain high while the condition exists, even if the host has cleared the status bit. If
enabled by TIM1.0, the INTB pin will transition low when this bit is set, and transition high when this bit is cleared (if
no other unmasked interrupt conditions exist).

The interrupt information register provides an indication of which status registers are generating an interrupt. When
an interrupt occurs, the host can read TIIR to quickly identify which of the transmit status registers are causing the
interrupt(s). These are real-time registers in that the bits will clear once the appropriate interrupt has been serviced
and cleared.

Note that when two or more sequential channels are chosen to be ignored, the receive slip zone select bit should
be set to zero. If the ignore channels are distributed (such as 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29) then the RSZS bit can be
set to one, which may provide a lower occurrence of slips in certain applications.

Bits 7 to 0: Transmit Channels 1 to 32 Channel Blocking Control Bits (CH[1:32]).
         0 = Force the TCHBLKn pin to remain low during this channel time.
         1 = Force the TCHBLKn pin high during this channel time.
* Note that TCBR4 has two functions:
         When 2.048MHz backplane mode is selected, this register allows the user to enable the channel blocking
         signal for any of the 32 possible backplane channels.
         When 1.544MHz backplane mode is selected, the LSB of this register determines whether or not the
         TCHBLKn signal will pulse high during the F-bit time:
                   TCBR4.0 = 0, do not pulse TCHBLKn during the F-bit.
                   TCBR4.0 = 1, pulse TCHBLKn during the F-bit.
         In this mode TCBR4.1 to TCBR4.7 should be set to 0.

Bits 5 and 4: Transmit Load Impedance 1 and 0 (TIMPL[1:0]). These bits are used to select the transmit load
impedance. These must be set to match the cable impedance. Even if the Internal load impedance is turned off (via
TIMPTOFF); the external cable impedance has to be specified for optimum operation. For J1 applications, use
110Ω. See Table 10-19.
Bits 2 to 0: Line Build-Out Select 2 to 0 (L[2:0]). Used to select the transmit waveshape. The waveshape has a
voltage level and load impedance associated with it once the T1/J1 or E1 selection is made by settings in the
LTRCR register. See Table 10-20.

Bit 6: Receive Internal Impedance Match On (RIMPON)
         0 = Receive internal impedance termination is disabled (high impedance).
         1 = Receive internal impedance termination is enabled.
Bits 2 to 0: Receive Impedance Selection (RIMPM[2:0]). These bits are used to select the receive impedance
termination. They must be set according to the cable impedance even if internal termination resistance is disabled
(RIMPON = 0). See Table 10-22.

Bit 7: Receive G.703 Clock (RG703). If this bit is set, the receiver expects a 2.048MHz or 1.544MHz clock from
the RTIPn/RRINGn, based on the selection of T1 (1.544) or E1 (2.048) mode in the LTRCR register.
Bit 3: Receiver Turns Ratio (RTR)
         0 = Receive transformer turns ratio is 1:1.
         1 = Receive transformer turns ratio is 2:1. This option should only be used in short-haul applications.
         Note: Internal impedance match is not available for this mode.
Bit 2: Receiver Monitor Mode Enable (RMONEN)
         0 = Disable receive monitor mode.
         1 = Enable receive monitor mode. Resistive gain is added with the maximum sensitivity. The receiver
         sensitivity is determined by RSMS1 and RSMS0.
Bits 1 and 0: Receiver Sensitivity/Monitor Gain Select (RSMS[1:0]). These bits are used to select the receiver
sensitivity level and additional gain in monitoring applications. The monitor mode (RMONEN) adds resistive gain to
compensate for the signal loss caused by the isolation resistors. See Table 10-23 and Table 10-24.

Bit 7: Transmit Pattern Load (TC). A low-to-high transition loads the pattern generator with the pattern that is to
be generated. This bit should be toggled from low to high whenever the host wishes to load a new pattern. Must be
cleared and set again for a subsequent loads.
Bit 6:Transmit Invert Data Enable (TINV)
          0 = Do not invert the outgoing data stream.
          1 = Invert the outgoing data stream.
Bit 5:Receive Invert Data Enable (RINV).
          0 = Do not invert the incoming data stream.
          1 = Invert the incoming data stream.
Bits 4 to 2: Pattern Select Bits 2 to 0 (PS[2:0]). These bits select data pattern used by the transmit and receive

Bit 1: Load Bit and Error Counters (LC). A low-to-high transition latches the current bit and error counts into the
registers BBC1, BBC2, BBC3, BBC4 and BEC1, BEC2, BEC3 and clears the internal count. This bit should be
toggled from low to high whenever the host wishes to begin a new acquisition period. Must be cleared and set
again for a subsequent loads.
Bit 0: Force Resynchronization (RESYNC). A low-to-high transition will force the receive BERT synchronizer to
resynchronize to the incoming data stream. This bit should be toggled from low to high whenever the host wishes
to acquire synchronization on a new pattern. Must be cleared and set again for a subsequent resynchronization.

Bit 4: Single Bit Error Insert (SBE). A low-to-high transition will create a single bit error. Must be cleared and set
again for a subsequent bit error to be inserted.
Bits 3 to 0: Repetitive Pattern Length Select 3 to 0 (RPL[3:0]). RPL0 is the LSB and RPL3 is the MSB of a
nibble that describes the how long the repetitive pattern is. The valid range is 17 (0000) to 32 (1111). These bits
are ignored if the receive BERT is programmed for a pseudorandom pattern. To create repetitive patterns fewer
than 17 bits in length, the user must set the length to an integer number of the desired length that is less than or
equal to 32. For example, to create a 6-bit pattern, the user can set the length to 18 (0001) or to 24 (0111) or to 30
(1101). See Table 10-28.

FCS error. This bit is ignored if transmit FCS processing is disabled (TFPD = 1).
Bit 4: Transmit Inter-frame Fill Value (TIFV) – When 0, inter-frame fill is done with the flag sequence (7Eh).
When 1, inter-frame fill is done with all ‘1’s.
Bit 3: Transmit Bit Reordering Enable (TBRE) – When 0, bit reordering is disabled (The first bit transmitted is the
LSB of the Transmit FIFO Data byte TFD[0]). When 1, bit reordering is enabled (The first bit transmitted is the MSB
of the Transmit FIFO Data byte TFD[7]).
Bit 2: Transmit Data Inversion Enable (TDIE) – When 0, the outgoing data is directly output from packet
processing. When 1, the outgoing data is inverted before being output from packet processing.
Bit 1: Transmit FCS Processing Disable (TFPD) – This bit controls whether or not a FCS is calculated and
appended to the end of each packet. When 0, the calculated FCS bytes are appended to the end of the packet.
When 1, the packet is transmitted without a FCS.
Bit 0: Transmit FIFO Reset (TFRST) – When 0, the Transmit FIFO will resume normal operations, however, data
is discarded until a start of packet is received after RAM power-up is completed. When 1, the Transmit FIFO is

Bits 4 to 0: Transmit HDLC Data Storage Available Level (TDAL[4:0]) – These five bits indicate the minimum
number of bytes ([TDAL*8]+1) that must be available for storage (do not contain data) in the Transmit FIFO for
HDLC data storage to be available. For example, a value of 21 (15h) results in HDLC data storage being available
(THDA = 1) when the Transmit FIFO has 169 (A9h) bytes or more available for storage, and HDLC data storage
not being available (THDA = 0) when the Transmit FIFO has 168 (A8h) bytes or less available for storage. Default
value (after reset) is 128 bytes minimum available.

packet data.
         000 = packet middle
         001 = packet start.
         010 = reserved
         011 = reserved
         100 = packet end: good packet
         101 = packet end: FCS errored packet.
         110 = packet end: invalid packet (a non-integer number of bytes).
         111 = packet end: aborted packet.
Bit 0: Receive FIFO Data Valid (RFDV) – When 0, the Receive FIFO data (RFD[7:0]) is invalid (the Receive FIFO
is empty). When 1, the Receive FIFO data (RFD[7:0]) is valid.

Note: Reading this register when RH256FDR1.RFDV=0 may result in a loss of data.
Bits 7 to 0: Receive FIFO Data (RFD[7:0]) – These eight bits are the packet data stored in the Receive FIFO.
RFD[7] is the MSB, and RFD[0] is the LSB. If bit reordering is disabled, RFD[0] is the first bit received, and RFD[7]
is the last bit received. If bit reordering is enabled, RFD[7] is the first bit received, and RFD[0] is the last bit
received.

14.1      TAP Controller State Machine
The TAP controller is a finite state machine that responds to the logic level at JTMS on the rising edge of JTCLK.
See Figure 14-2.
14.1.1        Test-Logic-Reset
Upon power-up, the TAP Controller will be in the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction register will contain the
IDCODE instruction. All system logic of the device will operate normally.
14.1.2        Run-Test-Idle
The Run-Test-Idle is used between scan operations or during specific tests. The Instruction Register and test
registers will remain idle.
14.1.3        Select-DR-Scan
All test registers retain their previous state. With JTMS LOW, a rising edge of JTCLK moves the controller into the
Capture-DR state and will initiate a scan sequence. JTMS HIGH during a rising edge on JTCLK moves the
controller to the Select-IR-Scan state.
14.1.4        Capture-DR
Data may be parallel-loaded into the test data registers selected by the current instruction. If the instruction does
not call for a parallel load or the selected register does not allow parallel loads, the Test Register remains at its
current value. On the rising edge of JTCLK, the controller goes to the Shift-DR state if JTMS is LOW or it goes to
the Exit1-DR state if JTMS is HIGH.
14.1.5        Shift-DR
The test data register selected by the current instruction is connected between JTDI and JTDO and will shift data
one stage towards its serial output on each rising edge of JTCLK. If a test register selected by the current
instruction is not placed in the serial path, it maintains its previous state.
14.1.6        Exit1-DR
While in this state, a rising edge on JTCLK puts the controller in the Update-DR state, which terminates the
scanning process if JTMS is HIGH. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW puts the controller in the Pause-DR
state.
14.1.7        Pause-DR
Shifting of the test registers is halted while in this state. All test registers selected by the current instruction retain
their previous state. The controller remains in this state while JTMS is LOW. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS
HIGH puts the controller in the Exit2-DR state.
14.1.8        Exit2-DR
A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS HIGH while in this state puts the controller in the Update-DR state and
terminates the scanning process. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW enters the Shift-DR state.
14.1.9        Update-DR
A falling edge on JTCLK while in the Update-DR state latches the data from the shift register path of the test
registers into the data output latches. This prevents changes at the parallel output due to changes in the shift
register.
14.1.10       Select-IR-Scan
All test registers retain their previous state. The instruction register remains unchanged during this state. With
JTMS LOW, a rising edge on JTCLK moves the controller into the Capture-IR state and initiates a scan sequence

for the instruction register. JTMS HIGH during a rising edge on JTCLK puts the controller back into the Test-Logic-
Reset state.
14.1.11       Capture-IR
The Capture-IR state is used to load the shift register in the instruction register with a fixed value. This value is
loaded on the rising edge of JTCLK. If JTMS is HIGH on the rising edge of JTCLK, the controller enters the Exit1-
IR state. If JTMS is LOW on the rising edge of JTCLK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state.
14.1.12       Shift-IR
In this state, the shift register in the instruction register is connected between JTDI and JTDO and shifts data one
stage for every rising edge of JTCLK towards the serial output. The parallel register, as well as all test registers,
remains at their previous states. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS HIGH moves the controller to the Exit1-IR
state. A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW keeps the controller in the Shift-IR state while moving data one
stage through the instruction shift register.
14.1.13       Exit1-IR
A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW puts the controller in the Pause-IR state. If JTMS is HIGH on the rising
edge of JTCLK, the controller enters the Update-IR state and terminates the scanning process.
14.1.14       Pause-IR
Shifting of the instruction shift register is halted temporarily. With JTMS HIGH, a rising edge on JTCLK puts the
controller in the Exit2-IR state. The controller remains in the Pause-IR state if JTMS is LOW during a rising edge on
JTCLK.
14.1.15       Exit2-IR
A rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW puts the controller in the Update-IR state. The controller loops back to
Shift-IR if JTMS is HIGH during a rising edge of JTCLK in this state.
14.1.16       Update-IR
The instruction code shifted into the instruction shift register is latched into the parallel output on the falling edge of
JTCLK as the controller enters this state. Once latched, this instruction becomes the current instruction. A rising
edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW puts the controller in the Run-Test-Idle state. With JTMS HIGH, the controller
enters the Select-DR-Scan state.

14.2      Instruction Register
The instruction register contains a shift register as well as a latched parallel output and is 3 bits in length. When the
TAP controller enters the Shift-IR state, the instruction shift register is connected between JTDI and JTDO. While in
the Shift-IR state, a rising edge on JTCLK with JTMS LOW shifts the data one stage towards the serial output at
JTDO. A rising edge on JTCLK in the Exit1-IR state or the Exit2-IR state with JTMS HIGH moves the controller to
the Update-IR state. The falling edge of that same JTCLK will latch the data in the instruction shift register to the
instruction parallel output. Instructions supported by the DS26514 and its respective operational binary codes are
shown in Table 14-1.

14.2.1 SAMPLE:PRELOAD
This is a mandatory instruction for the IEEE 1149.1 specification. This instruction supports two functions. The
digital I/Os of the device can be sampled at the Boundary Scan Register without interfering with the normal
operation of the device by using the Capture-DR state. SAMPLE:PRELOAD also allows the device to shift data into
the boundary scan register via JTDI using the Shift-DR state.
14.2.2 BYPASS
When the BYPASS instruction is latched into the parallel instruction register, JTDI connects to JTDO through the
one-bit Bypass Test Register. This allows data to pass from JTDI to JTDO without affecting the device’s normal
operation.
14.2.3 EXTEST
This allows testing of all interconnections to the device. When the EXTEST instruction is latched in the instruction
register, the following actions occur. Once enabled via the Update-IR state, the parallel outputs of all digital output
pins will be driven. The Boundary Scan Register will be connected between JTDI and JTDO. The Capture-DR will
sample all digital inputs into the Boundary Scan Register.
14.2.4 CLAMP
All digital outputs of the device will output data from the boundary scan parallel output while connecting the Bypass
Register between JTDI and JTDO. The outputs will not change during the CLAMP instruction.
14.2.5 HIGHZ
All digital outputs of the device will be placed in a high-impedance state. The Bypass Register will be connected
between JTDI and JTDO.
14.2.6 IDCODE
When the IDCODE instruction is latched into the parallel instruction register, the identification test register is
selected. The device identification code will be loaded into the identification register on the rising edge of JTCLK
following entry into the Capture-DR state. Shift-DR can be used to shift the identification code out serially via
JTDO. During Test-Logic-Reset, the identification code is forced into the instruction register’s parallel output. The
ID code will always have a “1” in the LSB position. The next 11 bits identify the manufacturer’s JEDEC number and
number of continuation bytes followed by 16 bits for the device and 4 bits for the version.

14.4     Test Registers
IEEE 1149.1 requires a minimum of two test registers: the Bypass Register and the Boundary Scan Register. An
optional test register, the Identification Register, has been included with the DS26514 design. The Identification
Register is used in conjunction with the IDCODE instruction and the Test-Logic-Reset state of the TAP controller.
14.4.1 Boundary Scan Register
This register contains both a shift register path and a latched parallel output for all control cells and digital I/O cells,
and is n bits in length.
14.4.2 Bypass Register
This register is a single one-bit shift register used in conjunction with the BYPASS, CLAMP, and HIGHZ
instructions, providing a short path between JTDI and JTDO.
14.4.3 Identification Register
The Identification Register contains a 32-bit shift register and a 32-bit latched parallel output. This register is
selected during the IDCODE instruction and when the TAP controller is in the Test-Logic-Reset state.

         0                   022007              New Product Release.
                                                 Updated data sheet to reflect new features with B1 die revision:
                                                 HDLC-256 Controller – introduced in Section 9.10 and described in Section
         1                   041307              9.10.3
                                                 Extended BERT Registers – introduced in Section 9.13 and defined in Section
                                                 10.6.1
         2                   103007              Added more content to TCLKn pin description in Section 8.1.
                                                 Finalized the specifications in this document and removed “preliminary”
                                                 designation.
                                                 Removed commercial temperature range product option from Ordering
                                                 Information table (page 1) and Operating Parameters (Section 12).
                                                 In the Absolute Maximum Ratings portion of Section 12, added Note 1 stating
                                                 that specifications to -40°C are guaranteed by design (GBD) and not production
                                                 tested.
                                                 Reduced the maximum supply current for the 1.8v supply from 70mA to 60mA.
         3                   101608              Increased the typical supply currents for the 3.3v and 1.8v supplies to 215mA
                                                 and 45mA, respectively.
                                                 Added definition for Receive Master Mode Register bit 5 (RMMR.5) which, when
                                                 set, disables the receive-side synchronizer in the framer. This feature is new with
                                                 revision B1.
                                                 Added instruction in Step 5 of the Example Device Initialization and Sequence
                                                 (Section 9.4.1) to increase the frequency of the internally generated clock which
                                                 is supplied to the framers.
                                                 Replaced package drawing with link to package drawing (Section 16).
                                                 Correct TTIP and TRING pin identification in Figure 15.1 FROM: TTIP3 pins J3,
                                                 K3, TRING3 pins J1, J2 TO: TTIP3 pins J1, J2, TRING3 pins J3, K3. Removed
                                                 reference to TSYSCLK8 at C14. Changed table format to improve readability.
                                                 Section 12 Operating Parameters added lead and lead-free reflow temperatures.

                                                 Table 8-1 Pin Function Descriptions the following note was added to pin names
                                                 RDB/DSB and WRB/RWB: Note: If SPI mode is selected by the SPI_SEL pin, this
                                                 pin must be connected through a 10K ohm resistor to the I/O Supply.
