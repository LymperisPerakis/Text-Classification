                               Setting this input pin "High" turns on the Transmitter.
                               NOTES:
                                     1.   Even when the XRT75VL00D is configured in HOST mode, this pin still
                                          controls the TTIP and TRING outputs
                                     2.   When the Transmitter is turned off either in Host or Hardware mode,the
                                          TTIP and TRING outputs are Tri-stated.
                                     3.   This pin is internally pulled down
  46           TxClk     I     Transmit Clock Input for TPData and TNData
                               The frequency accuracy of this input clock must be of nominal bit rate ± 20 ppm.
                               The duty cycle can be 30%-70%.
                               The XRT75VL00D samples the TPData and TNData pins on the falling or rising
                               edge of TxClk signal based on the status of TxClkINV pin (in Hardware mode)
                               or the status of the bit in the Channel Register (in HOST mode).
  26        TxClkINV/    I     Transmit Clock Invert or Serial Clock Input:
               SClk            Function of this depends on whether the XRT75VL00D is configured to operate
                               in Hardware mode or Host mode.
                               In Hardware mode, setting this input pin “High” configures the Transmitter to
                               sample the TPData and TNData data on the rising edge of the TxClk.
                               NOTE: If the XRT75VL00D is configured in HOST mode, this pin functions as
                                         SClk input pin (please refer to the pin description for Microprocessor
                                         interface).
  48          TNData     I     Transmit Negative Data Input
                               If the XRT75VL00D is configured in Dual-rail mode, this pin is sampled on the
                               falling or rising edge of TxClk based on the status of the TClkINV pin (in Hard-
                               ware mode) or the status of the control bit in the Channel Register (in HOST
                               mode).
                               NOTES:
                                     1.   This input pin is ignored and should be tied to GND if the Transmitter
                                          Section is configured to accept Single-Rail data from the Terminal
                                          Equipment.
  47          TPData     I     Transmit Positive Data Input
                               The XRT75VL00D samples this pin on the falling or rising edge of TxClk based
                               on the status of the TClkINV pin (in Hardware mode) or the status of the control
                               bit in the Channel Register (in HOST mode).
  50           TTIP     O      Transmit TTIP Output
                               The XRT75VL00D uses this pin along with TRING to transmit a bipolar signal to
                               the line using a 1:1 transformer.

                               The XRT75VL00D uses this pin along with TTIP to transmit a bipolar signal to
                               the line using a 1:1 transformer.
    1        TxLEV         I   Transmit Line Build-Out Enable/Disable Select
                               This input pin is used to enable or disable the Transmit Line Build-Out circuit.
                               Setting this pin to "High" disables the Line Build-Out circuit. In this mode, par-
                               tially-shaped pulses are output onto the line via the TTIP and TRING output
                               pins.
                               Setting this pin to "Low" enables the Line Build-Out circuit. In this mode, shaped
                               pulses are output onto the line via the TTIPand TRING output pins.
                               To comply with the Isolated DSX-3/STSX-1 Pulse Template Requirements per
                               Bellcore GR-499-CORE or Bellcore GR-253-CORE:

                               The Recovered Clock signal from the incoming line signal is output through this
                               pin.By default, the Receiver Section outputs data via RPOS and RNEG pins on
                               the rising edge of this clock signal.
                               Configure the Receiver Section to update data on the RPOS and RNEG pins on
                               the falling edge of RxClk by doing the following:
                               a) Operating in Hardware mode, pull the RxClkINV pin to “High”.
                               b) Operating in Host mode, write a “1” to RxClkINV bit field within the Receive

                              Function of these pins depends on whether the XRT75VL00D is config-
                              ured in Single Rail or Dual Rail mode.
                              If the XRT75VL00D is configured in Dual Rail mode, a negative pulse is output
                              through RNEG.
                              In Hardware mode: Tie the pin SR/DR (pin 22) “High” to configure the
                              XRT75VL00D in Single Rail mode and tie “Low” to configure in Dual Rail mode.
                              In HOST mode: XRT75VL00D can be configured in Single Rail or Dual Rail by
                              setting or clearing the bit in the block control register.
                              Line Code Violation Indicator
                              If the XRT75VL00D is configured in Single Rail mode then:
                              Whenever the Receiver Section detects a Line Code violation, it pulses this
                              output pin “High”. This output pin remains “Low” at all other times.          It is
                              advisable to sample this output pin using the RxClk output signal.

                              monitoring channel. In the monitoring mode, the Receiver is capable of monitor-
                              ing the signals with 20 dB flat loss plus 6 dB cable attenuation. This allows to
                              monitor very weak signal before declaring LOS.
                              In HOST Mode, XRT75VL00D can be configured to be a monitoring channel by
                              setting the bits in the receive control register.
                              NOTE: If the XRT75VL00D is configured in HOST mode, this pin functions as

 4.0 THE TRANSMITTER SECTION:
The Transmitter Section accepts TTL/CMOS level signals from the Terminal Equipment in the selectable data
formats.
• In Single-Rail or un-encoded Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) input data via TPData pin while the TNData pin
   must be grounded. The NRZ or Single-Rail mode is selected when the SR/DR input pin is “High” (in
   Hardware Mode) or bit 0 of the control register is “1” (in Host Mode). Figure 12 illustrates the Single-Rail or
   NRZ format.

• In Dual-Rail mode, data is input via TPData and TNData pins. TPData contains positive data and TNData
   contains negative data. The SR/DR input pin = “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or bit 0 of the control register = “0”
   (in Host Mode) enables the Dual-Rail mode. Figure 13 illustrates the Dual-Rail data format.

• Convert the CMOS level B3ZS or HDB3 encoded data into pulses with shapes that are compliant with the
   various industry standard pulse template requirements. Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the pulse
   template requirements.
• Encode the un-encoded NRZ data into either B3ZS format (for DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3) and
   convert to pulses with shapes and width that are compliant with industry standard pulse template
   requirements. Figure 7,Figure 8 and Figure 9 illustrate the pulse template requirements.
 4.1      TRANSMIT CLOCK:
The Transmit Clock applied via TxClk pin, for the selected data rate (for E3 = 34.368 MHz, DS3 = 44.736 MHz
or STS-1 = 51.84 MHz), is duty cycle corrected by the internal PLL circuit to provide a 50% duty cycle clock to
the pulse shaping circuit. This allows a 30% to 70% duty cycle Transmit Clock be supplied and thus eliminates
the need to use an expensive oscillator.
 4.2      B3ZS/HDB3 ENCODER:
When the Single-Rail (NRZ) data format is selected, the Encoder Block encodes the data into either B3ZS
format (for either DS3 or STS-1) or HDB3 format (for E3).
  4.2.1      B3ZS Encoding:
                                                        24

An example of B3ZS encoding is shown in Figure 14. If the encoder detects an occurrence of three
consecutive zeros in the data stream, it is replaced with either B0V or 00V, where ‘B’ refers to Bipolar pulse that
is compliant with the Alternating polarity requirement of the AMI (Alternate Mark Inversion) line code and ‘V’
refers to a Bipolar Violation (e.g., a bipolar pulse that violates the AMI line code). The substitution of B0V or
00V is made so that an odd number of bipolar pulses exist between any two consecutive violation (V) pulses.
This avoids the introduction of DC component into the line signal.

  4.2.2     HDB3 Encoding:
An example of the HDB3 encoding is shown in Figure 15.If the HDB3 encoder detects an occurrence of four
consecutive zeros in the data stream, then the four zeros are substituted with either 000V or B00V pattern. The
substitution code is made in such a way that an odd number of bipolar (B) pulses exist between any
consecutive V pulses. This avoids the introduction of DC component into the analog signal.

NOTES:
     1.  When Dual-Rail data format is selected, the B3ZS/HDB3 Encoder is automatically disabled.
     2.  In Dual-Rail format, the Bipolar Violations in the incoming data stream is converted to valid data pulses.
     3.  Encoder and Decoder is enabled only in Single-Rail mode.
 4.3     TRANSMIT PULSE SHAPER:
The Transmit Pulse Shaper converts the B3ZS encoded digital pulses into a single analog Alternate Mark
Inversion (AMI) pulse that meet the industry standard mask template requirements for STS-1 and DS3. See
Figure 8 and Figure 9.
                                                               25

REV. 1.0.4                                       E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH SONET DESYNCHRONIZER
For E3 mode, the pulse shaper converts the HDB3 encoded pulses into a single full amplitude square shaped
pulse with very little slope. This is illustrated in Figure 7.
The Pulse Shaper Block also consists of a Transmit Build Out Circuit, which can either be disabled or enabled
by setting the TxLEV input pin “High” or “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the TxLEV bit to “1” or “0” in the
control register (in Host Mode).
For DS3/STS-1 rates, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is used to shape the transmit waveform that ensures that
transmit pulse template requirements are met at the Cross-Connect system. The distance between the
transmitter output and the Cross-Connect system can be between 0 to 450 feet.
For E3 rate, since the output pulse template is measured at the secondary of the transformer and since there is
no Cross-Connect system pulse template requirements, the Transmit Build Out Circuit is always disabled.
 4.3.1       Guidelines for using Transmit Build Out Circuit:
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1, Cross-Connect system, is less than 225 feet,
enable the Transmit Build Out Circuit by setting the TxLEV input pin “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the
TxLEV control bit to “0” (in Host Mode).
If the distance between the transmitter and the DSX3 or STSX-1 is greater than 225 feet, disable the Transmit
Build Out Circuit.
 4.3.2       Interfacing to the line:
The differential line driver increases the transmit waveform to appropriate level and drives into the 75Ω load as
shown in Figure 6.
4.4      Transmit Drive Monitor:
This feature is used for monitoring the transmit line for occurrence of fault conditions such as short circuit on
the line or defective line driver.The device can also be configured for internal tranmit driver monitoring.
To monitor the transmitter output of another chip, connect MTIP pin to the TTIP line via a 270 Ω resistor and
MRing pins to TRing line via 270 Ω resistor as shown in Figure 16
In order to configure the device for internal transmit driver monitoring, set the TxMON bit to “1” in the transmit
control register.

XRT75VL00D
 E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH SONET DESYNCHRONIZER                                                          REV. 1.0.4
When the MTIP and MRing are connected to the TTIP and TRing lines, the drive monitor circuit monitors the
line for transitions. The DMO (Drive Monitor Output) will be asserted “Low” as long as the transitions on the line
are detected via MTIP and MRing.
If no transitions on the line are detected for 128 ± 32 TxClk periods, the DMO output toggles “High” and when
the transitions are detected again, DMO toggles “Low”.
NOTE: The Drive Monitor Circuit is only for diagnostic purposes and does not have to be used to operate the transmitter.
  4.5     Transmitter Section On/Off:
The transmitter section can be turned on or off. To turn on the transmitter in the Hardware mode, pull TxON pin
“High”. In the Host mode, write a “1” to the TxON control bit AND pull the TxON pin “High” to turn on the
transmitter.
When the transmitter is turned off, the TTIP and TRing are tri-stated.
NOTES:
      1.   This feature provides support for Redundancy.
      2.   If the XRT75VL00D is configured in Host mode, to permit a system designed for redundancy to quickly shut-off
          the defective line card and turn on the back-up line card, writing a “1” to the TxON control bit transfers the control
          to TxON pin.
  5.0 THE RECEIVER SECTION:
This section describes the detailed operation of the various blocks in the receiver. The receiver recovers the
TTL/CMOS level data from the incoming bipolar B3ZS or HDB3 encoded input pulses.
  5.1     AGC/Equalizer:
The Adaptive Gain Control circuit amplifies the incoming analog signal and compensates for the various flat
losses and also for the loss at one-half symbol rate. The AGC has a dynamic range of 30 dB.
The Equalizer restores the integrity of the signal and compensates for the frequency dependent attenuation of
up to 900 feet of coaxial cable (1300 feet for E3). The Equalizer also boosts the high frequency content of the
signal to reduce the Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) so that, the slicer slices the signal at 50% of peak voltage to
generate Positive and Negative data.
The Equalizer can either be “IN” or “OUT” by setting the REQEN pin “High” or “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or
setting the REQEN control bit to “1” or “0” (in Host Mode).
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EQUALIZER SETTINGS:
The Equalizer has two gain settings to provide optimum equalization. In the case of normally shaped DS3/
STS-1 pulses (pulses that meet the template requirements) that has been driven through 0 to 900 feet of cable,
the Equalizer can be left “IN” by setting the REQEN pin to “High” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the REQEN
control bit to “1” (in Host Mode).
However, for square-shaped pulses such as E3 or for DS3/STS-1 high pulses (that does not meet the pulse
template requirements), it is recommended that the Equalizer be left “OUT” for cable length less than 300 feet
by setting the REQEN pin “Low” (in Hardware Mode) or by setting the REQEN control bit to “0” (in Host
Mode).This would help to prevent over-equalization of the signal and thus optimize the performance in terms of
better jitter transfer characteristics.
NOTE: The results of extensive testing indicates that even when the Equalizer was left “IN” (REQEN = “HIGH”), regardless
         of the cable length, the integrity of the E3 signal was restored properly over 0 to 12 dB cable loss at Industrial
         Temperature.
The Equalizer also contain an additional 20 dB gain stage to provide the line monitoring capability of the
resistively attenuated signals which may have 20dB flat loss. This capability can be turned on by writing a “1” to
the RxMON bits in the control register or by setting the RxMON pin (pin 27) “High”.
  5.1.1       Interference Tolerance:
For E3 mode, ITU-T G.703 Recommendation specifies that the receiver be able to recover error-free clock and
data in the presence of a sinusoidal interfering tone signal. For DS3 and STS-1 modes, the same
                                                              27

STS1. Figure 18 shows the set up for E3.

 5.2      Clock and Data Recovery:
The Clock and Data Recovery Circuit extracts the embedded clock, from the sliced digital data stream and
provides the retimed data to the B3ZS (HDB3) decoder.
The Clock Recovery PLL can be in one of the following two modes:
TRAINING MODE:
In the absence of input signals at RTIP and RRing pins, or when the frequency difference between the
recovered line clock signal and the reference clock applied on the ExClk input pin exceed 0.5%, the clock
recovery unit enters into Training Mode and a Loss of Lock condition is declared by toggling RLOL output pin
“High” (in Hardware Mode) or setting the RLOL bit to “1” in the control registers (in Host Mode). Also, the clock
output on the RxClk pin is the same as the reference clock applied on ExClk pin.
DATA/CLOCK RECOVERY MODE:
In the presence of input line signals on the RTIP and RRing input pins and when the frequency difference
between the recovered clock signal and the reference clock signal is less than 0.5%, the clock that is output on
the RxClk out pin is the Recovered Clock signal.
 5.3      B3ZS/HDB3 Decoder:
The decoder block takes the output from clock and data recovery block and decodes the B3ZS (for DS3 or
STS-1) or HDB3 (for E3) encoded line signal and detects any coding errors or excessive zeros in the data
stream.
Whenever the input signal violates the B3ZS or HDB3 coding sequence for bipolar violation or contains three
(for B3ZS) or four (for HDB3) or more consecutive zeros, an active “High” pulse is generated on the RLCV
output pins to indicate line code violation.
NOTE: In Single- Rail (NRZ) mode, the decoder is bypassed.
 5.4      LOS (Loss of Signal) Detector:
  5.4.1     DS3/STS-1 LOS Condition:
A Digital Loss of Signal (DLOS) condition occurs when a string of 175 ± 75 consecutive zeros occur on the line.
When the DLOS condition occurs, the DLOS bit is set to “1” in the status control register. DLOS condition is
cleared when the detected average pulse density is greater than 33% for 175 ± 75 pulses.
Analog Loss of Signal (ALOS) condition occurs when the amplitude of the incoming line signal is below the
threshold as shown in the Table 10.The status of the ALOS condition is reflected in the ALOS status control
register.
RLOS is the logical OR of the DLOS and ALOS states. When the RLOS condition occurs the RLOS output pin

DISABLING ALOS/DLOS DETECTOR:
For debugging purposes it is useful to disable the ALOS/DLOS detector. Writing a “1” to the ALOS and DLOS
bits disables the LOS detector on a per channel basis.
  5.4.2      E3 LOS Condition:
If the level of incoming line signal drops below the threshold as described in the ITU-T G.775 standard, the
LOS condition is detected. Loss of signal level is defined to be between 15 and 35 dB below the normal level. If
the signal drops below 35 dB for 175 ± 75 consecutive pulse periods, LOS condition is declared. This is
illustrated in Figure 19.

As defined in ITU-T G.775, an LOS condition is also declared between 10 and 255 UI (or E3 bit periods) after
the actual time the LOS condition has occurred. The LOS condition is cleared within 10 to 255 UI after
restoration of the incoming line signal. Figure 20 shows the LOS declaration and clearance conditions.

 5.4.3     Muting the Recovered Data with LOS condition:
When the LOS condition is declared, the clock recovery circuit locks into the reference clock applied to the
ExClk pin and output this clock on the RxClk output. The data on the RPOS and RNEG pins can be forced to
zero by pulling the LOSMUT pin “High” (in Hardware Mode) or by setting the LOSMUT bits in the individual
channel control register to “1” (in Host Mode).
NOTE: When the LOS condition is cleared, the recovered data is output on RPOS and RNEG pins.

  6.0 JITTER:
There are three fundamental parameters that describe circuit performance relative to jitter:
• Jitter Tolerance (Receiver)
• Jitter Transfer (Receiver/Transmitter)
• Jitter Generation
  6.1     JITTER TOLERANCE - RECEIVER:
Jitter tolerance is a measure of how well a Clock and Data Recovery unit can successfully recover data in the
presence of various forms of jitter. It is characterized by the amount of jitter required to produce a specified bit
error rate. The tolerance depends on the frequency content of the jitter. Jitter Tolerance is measured as the
jitter amplitude over a jitter spectrum for which the clock and data recovery unit achieves a specified bit error
rate (BER). To measure the jitter tolerance as shown in Figure 21, jitter is introduced by the sinusoidal
modulation of the serial data bit sequence.

Input jitter tolerance requirements are specified in terms of compliance with jitter mask which is represented as
a combination of points.Each point corresponds to a minimum amplitude of sinusoidal jitter at a given jitter
frequency.
  6.1.1      DS3/STS-1 Jitter Tolerance Requirements:
Bellcore GR-499 CORE, Issue 1, December 1995 specifies the minimum requirement of jitter tolerance for
Category I and Category II. The jitter tolerance requirement for Category II is the most stringent. Figure 22
shows the jitter tolerance curve as per GR-499 specification along with the measured performance for the
device.

 6.2      JITTER TRANSFER - RECEIVER/TRANSMITTER:
Jitter Transfer function is defined as the ratio of jitter on the output relative to the jitter applied on the input
versus frequency.
There are two distinct characteristics in jitter transfer: jitter gain (jitter peaking) defined as the highest ratio
above 0 dB; and jitter transfer bandwidth.The overall jitter transfer bandwidth is controller by a low bandwidth
loop,which is part of the XRT75VL00D.
The jitter transfer function is a ratio between the jitter output and jitter input for a component, or system often
expressed in dB. A negative dB jitter transfer indicates the element removed jitter. A positive dB jitter transfer
indicates the element added jitter.A zero dB jitter transfer indicates the element had no effect on jitter.
Table 12 shows the jitter transfer characteristics and/or jitter attenuation specifications for various data rates:

                                               Category I and Category II
The XRT75VL00D meets the above Jitter Specifications.
 6.3      JITTER GENERATION:
Jitter Generation is defined as the process whereby jitter appears at the output port of the digital equipment in
the absence of applied input jitter. Jitter Generation is measured by sending jitter free data to the clock and
data recovery circuit and measuring the amount of jitter on the output clock or the re-timed data. Since this is
essentially a noise measurement, it requires a definition of bandwidth to be meaningful. The bandwidth is set
according to the data rate. In general, the jitter is measured over a band of frequencies.
 6.4      Jitter Attenuator:
An advanced crystal-less jitter attenuator is included in the XRT75VL00D. The jitter attenuator uses the internal
reference clock.
In Host mode, by clearing or setting the JATx/Rx bit in the control register selects the jitter attenuator either in
the Receive or Transmit path. In Hardware mode, JATx/Rx pin selects the jitter attenuator in Receive or
Transmit path.
The FIFO is either a 16-bit, 32-bit or 128-bit register. In Host mode, the bits JA0 and JA1can be set to
appropriate combination to select the different FIFO sizes or to disable the jitter attenuator. In Hardware mode,
appropriate setting of the pins JA0 and JA1 selects the different FIFO sizes or disable the jitter attenuator. Data
is clocked into the FIFO with the associated clock signal (TxClk or RxClk) and clocked out of the FIFO with the
                                                           34

dejittered clock. When the FIFO is within two bits of overflowing or underflowing, the FIFO limit status bit, FL is
set to “1” in the Alarm status register. Reading this bit clears the FIFO and resets the bit into default state.
NOTE: It is recommended to select the 16-bit FIFO for delay-sensitive applications as well as for removing smaller amounts
       of jitter.

7.0 SERIAL HOST INTERFACE:
 A flexible serial microprocessor interface is incorporated in the XRT75VL00D. The interface is generic and is
designed to support the common microprocessors/microcontrollers. The XRT75VL00D operates in Host mode
when the HOST/HW pin is tied “High”. The serial interface includes a serial clock (SClk), serial data input
(SDI), serial data output (SDO), chip select (CS) and interrupt output (INT). The serial interface timing is shown
in Figure 11.
The active low interrupt output signal (INT pin) indicates alarm conditions like LOS, DMO and FL to the
processor.

When the XRT75VL00D is configured in Host mode, the following input pins,TxLEV, TAOS, RLB, LLB, E3,
STS-1/DS3, REQEN, JATx/Rx, JA0 and JA1 are disabled and must be connected to ground.
Table 14 below illustrates the functions of the shared pins in either Host mode or in Hardware mode.

NOTE: While configured in Host mode, the TxON input pin will be active if the TxON bit in the control register is set to “1”,
        and can be used to turn on and off the transmit output drivers. This permits a system designed for redundancy to
        quickly switch out a defective line card and switch-in the backup line card.

XRT75VL00D
 E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH SONET DESYNCHRONIZER                                             REV. 1.0.4
  8.0 DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES:
  8.1      PRBS Generator and Detector:
The XRT75VL00D contains an on-chip Pseudo Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) generator and detector for
diagnostic purpose. This feature is only available in Host mode. With the PRBSEN bit = “1”, the transmitter will
send out PRBS of 223-1 in E3 rate or 215-1 in STS-1/DS3 rate. At the same time, the receiver PRBS detector is
also enabled. When the correct PRBS pattern is detected by the receiver, the RNEG/LCV pin will go “Low” to
indicate PRBS synchronization has been achieved. When the PRBS detector is not in sync the PRBSLS bit will
be set to “1” and RNEG/LCV pin will go “High”.
With the PRBS mode enabled, the user can also insert a single bit error by toggling “INSPRBS” bit. This is
done by writing a “1” to INSPRBS bit. The receiver at RNEG/LCV pin will pulse “High” for half RxClk cycle for
every bit error detected. Any subsequent single bit error insertion must be done by first writing a “0” to
INSPRBS bit and followed by a “1”.
When PRBS mode is enabled, the PRBS counter starts counting each single bit error. The PRBS counter is 16
bits wide. The current value in the counter can be read via two readback operations of the Serial I/O registers.
1) Either the Least Significant Byte (LSB, address 0x30) or the Most Significant Byte (MSB, address 0x31) can
be read first. The value of the un-read register will be copied into the Holding register (address 0x38) and both
the LSB and MSB registers will be reset to zero.
2) Read the Holding register and concatenate the result with the value from the first read operation to get the
full 16 bit counter value.
When the PRBS mode is first enabled, errors will be counted while the receiver logic is synchronizing to the
PRBS pattern. When RNEG/LCV goes “Low” indicating PRBS synchronization, reset the counter by reading
either the LSB or the MSB register.
Figure 25 shows the status of RNEG/LCV pin when the XRT75VL00D is configured in PRBS mode.

  8.2      LOOPBACKS:
The XRT75VL00D offers three loopback modes for diagnostic purposes. In Hardware mode, the loopback
modes are selected via the RLB and LLB pins. In Host mode, the RLB and LLB bits in the control registers
select the loopback modes.
  8.2.1      ANALOG LOOPBACK:
In this mode, the transmitter outputs (TTIP and TRING) are connected internally to the receiver inputs (RTIP
and RRING) as shown in Figure 26. Data and clock are output at RCLK, RPOS and RNEG pins for the
corresponding transceiver. Analog loopback exercises most of the functional blocks of the device including the
jitter attenuator which can be selected in either the transmit or receive path.

XRT75VL00D can be configured in Analog Loopback either in Hardware mode via the LLB and RLB pins or in
Host mode via LLB and RLB bits in the channel control registers.
NOTES:
    1.   In the Analog loopback mode, data is also output via TTIP and TRING pins.
    2.   Signals on the RTIP and RRING pins are ignored during analog loopback.

 8.2.2       DIGITAL LOOPBACK:
The Digital Loopback function is available either in Hardware mode or Host mode. When the Digital Loopback
is selected, the transmit clock (TxClk) and transmit data inputs (TPDATA & TNDATA) are looped back and
output onto the RxClk, RPOS and RNEG pins as shown in Figure 27. The data presented on TxClk, TPDATA
and TNDATA are not output on the TTIP and TRING pins.This provides the capability to configure the
protection card (in redundancy applications) in Digital Loopback mode without affecting the traffic on the
primary card.
NOTE: Signals on the RTIP and RRING pins are ignored during digital loopback.

With Remote loopback activated as shown in Figure 28,the receive data on RTIP and RRING is looped back
after the jitter attenuator (if selected in receive or transmit path) to the transmit path using RxClk as transmit
timing. The receive data is also output via the RPOS and RNEG pins.
During the remote loopback mode, if the jitter attenuator is selected in the transmit path, the receive data after
the Clock and Data Recovery Block is looped back to the transmit path and pass through the jitter attenuator
using RxClk as the transmit timing.
NOTE: Input signals on TxClk, TPDATA and TNDATA are ignored during Remote loopback.

Transmit All Ones (TAOS) can be set either in Hardware mode by pulling the TAOS pins “High” or in Host mode
by setting the TAOS control bits to “1” in the Channel control registers. When the TAOS is set, the Transmit
Section generates and transmits a continuous AMI all “1’s” pattern on TTIP and TRING pins. The frequency of
this “1’s” pattern is determined by TClk.TAOS data path is shown in Figure 29.

The LIU with D-SYNC is very similar to the non D-SYNC LIU in that they both contain Jitter Attenuator blocks
within each channel. They are also pin to pin compatible with each other. However, the Jitter Attenuators
within the D-SYNC have some enhancements over and above those within the non D-SYNC device. The Jitter
Attenuator blocks will support all of the modes and features that exist in the non D-SYNC device and in addition
they also support a SONET/SDH De-Sync Mode.
NOTE: The "D" suffix within the part number stands for "De-Sync".
The SONET/SDH De-Sync feature of the Jitter Attenuator blocks permits the user to design a SONET/SDH
PTE (Path Terminating Equipment) that will comply with all of the following Intrinsic Jitter and Wander
requirements.
• For SONET Applications
       ■ Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements per Telcordia GR-253-CORE (for DS3 Applications)
       ■ ANSI T1.105.03b-1997 - SONET Jitter at Network Interfaces - DS3 Wander Supplement
• For SDH Applications
       ■ Jitter and Wander Generation Requirements per ITU-T G.783 (for DS3 and E3 Applications)
Specifically, if the user designs in the LIU along with a SONET/SDH Mapper IC (which can be realized as either
a standard product or as a custom logic solution, in an ASIC or FPGA), then the following can be
accomplished.
• The Mapper can receive an STS-N or an STM-M signal (which is carrying asynchronously-mapped DS3 and/
   or E3 signals) and byte de-interleave this data into N STS-1 or 3*M VC-3 signals
• The Mapper will then terminate these STS-1 or VC-3 signals and will de-map out this DS3 or E3 data from
   the incoming STS-1 SPEs or VC-3s, and output this DS3 or E3 to the DS3/E3 Facility-side towards the LIU
• This DS3 or E3 signal (as it is output from these Mapper devices) will contain a large amount of intrinsic jitter
   and wander due to (1) the process of asynchronously mapping a DS3 or E3 signal into a SONET or SDH
   signal, (2) the occurrence of Pointer Adjustments within the SONET or SDH signal (transporting these DS3
   or E3 signals) as it traverses the SONET/SDH network, and (3) clock gapping.
• When the LIU has been configured to operate in the "SONET/SDH De-Sync" Mode, then it will (1) accept this
   jittery DS3 or E3 clock and data signal from the Mapper device (via the Transmit System-side interface) and
   (2) through the Jitter Attenuator, the LIU will reduce the Jitter and Wander amplitude within these DS3 or E3
   signals such that they (when output onto the line) will comply with the above-mentioned intrinsic jitter and
   wander specifications.
 9.1       BACKGROUND AND DETAILED INFORMATION - SONET DE-SYNC APPLICATIONS
This section provides an in-depth discussion on the mechanisms that will cause Jitter and Wander within a
DS3 or E3 signal that is being transported across a SONET or SDH Network. A lot of this material is
introductory, and can be skipped by the engineer that is already experienced in SONET/SDH designs.
In the wide-area network (WAN) in North America it is often necessary to transport a DS3 signal over a long
distance (perhaps over a thousand miles) in order to support a particular service. Now rather than realizing
this transport of DS3 data, by using over a thousand miles of coaxial cable (interspaced by a large number of
DS3 repeaters) a common thing to do is to route this DS3 signal to a piece of equipment (such as a Terminal
MUX, which in the "SONET Community" is known as a PTE or Path Terminating Equipment). This Terminal
MUX will asynchronously map the DS3 signal into a SONET signal. At this point, the SONET network will now
transport this asynchronously mapped DS3 signal from one PTE to another PTE (which is located at the other
end of the SONET network). Once this SONET signal arrives at the remote PTE, this DS3 signal will then be
extracted from the SONET signal, and will be output to some other DS3 Terminal Equipment for further
processing.
Similar things are done outside of North America. In this case, this DS3 or E3 signal is routed to a PTE, where
it is asynchronously mapped into an SDH signal. This asynchronously mapped DS3 or E3 signal is then
transported across the SDH network (from one PTE to the PTE at the other end of the SDH network). Once

this SDH signal arrives at the remote PTE, this DS3 or E3 signal will then be extracted from the SDH signal,
and will be output to some other DS3/E3 Terminal Equipment for further processing.
Figure 30 presents an illustration of this approach to transporting DS3 data over a SONET Network

As mentioned above a DS3 or E3 signal will be asynchronously mapped into a SONET or SDH signal and then
transported over the SONET or SDH network. At the remote PTE this DS3 or E3 signal will be extracted (or
de-mapped) from this SONET or SDH signal, where it will then be routed to DS3 or E3 terminal equipment for
further processing.
In order to insure that this "de-mapped" DS3 or E3 signal can be routed to any industry-standard DS3 or E3
terminal equipment, without any complications or adverse effect on the network, the Telcordia and ITU-T
standard committees have specified some limits on both the Intrinsic Jitter and Wander that may exist within
these DS3 or E3 signals as they are de-mapped from SONET/SDH. As a consequence, all PTEs that maps
and de-mapped DS3/E3 signals into/from SONET/SDH must be designed such that the DS3 or E3 data that is
de-mapped from SONET/SDH by these PTEs must meet these Intrinsic Jitter and Wander requirements.
As mentioned above, the LIU can assist the System Designer (of SONET/SDH PTE) by ensuring that their
design will meet these Intrinsic Jitter and Wander requirements.
This section of the data sheet will present the following information to the user.
• Some background information on Mapping DS3/E3 signals into SONET/SDH and de-mapping DS3/E3
   signals from SONET/SDH.
• A brief discussion on the causes of jitter and wander within a DS3 or E3 signal that mapped into a SONET/
   SDH signal, and is transported across the SONET/SDH Network.
• A brief review of these Intrinsic Jitter and Wander requirements in both SONET and SDH applications.
• A brief review on the Intrinsic Jitter and Wander measurement results (of a de-mapped DS3 or E3 signal)
   whenever the LIU device is used in a system design.
• A detailed discussion on how to design with and configure the LIU device such that the end-system will meet
   these Intrinsic Jitter and Wander requirements.

In a SONET system, the relevant specification requirements for Intrinsic Jitter and Wander (within a DS3 signal
that is mapped into and then de-mapped from SONET) are listed below.
• Telcordia GR-253-CORE Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements for DS3 Applications (Section 5.6), and
• ANSI T1.105.03b-1997 - SONET Jitter at Network Interfaces - DS3 Wander Supplement
In general, there are three (3) sources of Jitter and Wander within an asynchronously-mapped DS3 signal that
the system designer must be aware of. These sources are listed below.
• Mapping/De-Mapping Jitter
• Pointer Adjustments
• Clock Gapping
Each of these sources of jitter/wander will be defined and discussed in considerable detail within this Section.
In order to accomplish all of this, this particular section will discuss all of the following topics in details.
• How DS3 data is mapped into SONET, and how this mapping operation contributes to Jitter and Wander
  within this "eventually de-mapped" DS3 signal.
• How this asynchronously-mapped DS3 data is transported throughout the SONET Network, and how
  occurrences on the SONET network (such as pointer adjustments) will further contributes to Jitter and
  Wander within the "eventually de-mapped" DS3 signal.
• A review of the Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements (per Telcordia GR-253-CORE) for DS3 applications
• A review of the DS3 Wander requirements per ANSI T1.105.03b-1997
• A review of the Intrinsic Jitter and Wander Capabilities of the LIU in a typical system application
• An in-depth discussion on how to design with and configure the LIU to permit the system to the meet the
  above-mentioned Intrinsic Jitter and Wander requirements
NOTE: An in-depth discussion on SDH De-Sync Applications will be presented in the next revision of this data sheet.
 9.2      MAPPING/DE-MAPPING JITTER/WANDER
Mapping/De-Mapping Jitter (or Wander) is defined as that intrinsic jitter (or wander) that is induced into a DS3
signal by the "Asynchronous Mapping" process. This section will discuss all of the following aspects of
Mapping/De-Mapping Jitter.
• How DS3 data is mapped into an STS-1 SPE
• How frequency offsets within either the DS3 signal (being mapped into SONET) or within the STS-1 signal
  itself contributes to intrinsic jitter/wander within the DS3 signal (being transported via the SONET network).
 9.2.1      HOW DS3 DATA IS MAPPED INTO SONET
Whenever a DS3 signal is asynchronously mapped into SONET, this mapping is typically accomplished by a
PTE accepting DS3 data (from some remote terminal) and then loading this data into certain bit-fields within a
given STS-1 SPE (or Synchronous Payload Envelope). At this point, this DS3 signal has now been
asynchronously mapped into an STS-1 signal. In most applications, the SONET Network will then take this
particular STS-1 signal and will map it into "higher-speed" SONET signals (e.g., STS-3, STS-12, STS-48, etc.)
and will then transport this asynchronously mapped DS3 signal across the SONET network, in this manner. As
this "asynchronously-mapped" DS3 signal approaches its "destination" PTE, this STS-1 signal will eventually
be de-mapped from this STS-N signal. Finally, once this STS-1 signal reaches the "destination" PTE, then this
asynchronously-mapped DS3 signal will be extracted from this STS-1 signal.
 9.2.1.1        A Brief Description of an STS-1 Frame
In order to be able to describe how a DS3 signal is asynchronously mapped into an STS-1 SPE, it is important
to define and understand all of the following.
• The STS-1 frame structure
• The STS-1 SPE (Synchronous Payload Envelope)

• Telcordia GR-253-CORE's recommendation on mapping DS3 data into an STS-1 SPE
An STS-1 frame is a data-structure that consists of 810 bytes (or 6480 bits). A given STS-1 frame can be
viewed as being a 9 row by 90 byte column array (making up the 810 bytes). The frame-repetition rate (for an
STS-1 frame) is 8000 frames/second. Therefore, the bit-rate for an STS-1 signal is (6480 bits/frame * 8000
frames/sec =) 51.84Mbps.
A simple illustration of this SONET STS-1 frame is presented below in Figure 31.
FIGURE 31. A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION OF THE SONET STS-1 FRAME
                                                                   90 Bytes
                       9 Rows
                                                           STS-1 Frame (810 Bytes)
                                                                 Last Byte of the STS-1 Frame
                                 First Byte of the STS-1 Frame
Figure 31 indicates that the very first byte of a given STS-1 frame (to be transmitted or received) is located in
the extreme upper left hand corner of the 90 column by 9 row array, and that the very last byte of a given STS-
1 frame is located in the extreme lower right-hand corner of the frame structure. Whenever a Network Element
transmits a SONET STS-1 frame, it starts by transmitting all of the data, residing within the top row of the STS-
1 frame structure (beginning with the left-most byte, and then transmitting the very next byte, to the right). After
the Network Equipment has completed its transmission of the top or first row, it will then proceed to transmit the
second row of data (again starting with the left-most byte, first). Once the Network Equipment has transmitted
the last byte of a given STS-1 frame, it will proceed to start transmitting the very next STS-1 frame.
The illustration of the STS-1 frame (in Figure 31) is very simplistic, for multiple reasons. One major reason is
that the STS-1 frame consists of numerous types of bytes. For the sake of discussion within this data sheet,
the STS-1 frame will be described as consisting of the following types (or groups) of bytes.
• The Transport Overheads (or TOH) Bytes
• The Envelope Capacity Bytes
  9.2.1.1.1       The Transport Overhead (TOH) Bytes
The Transport Overhead or TOH bytes occupy the very first three (3) byte columns within each STS-1 frame.
Figure 32 presents another simple illustration of an STS-1 frame structure. However, in this case, both the
TOH and the Envelope Capacity bytes are designated in this Figure.
                                                                  50

Since the TOH bytes occupy the first three byte columns of each STS-1 frame, and since each STS-1 frame
consists of nine (9) rows, then we can state that the TOH (within each STS-1 frame) consists of 3 byte columns
x 9 rows = 27 bytes. The byte format of the TOH is presented below in Figure 33.

In general, the role/purpose of the TOH bytes is to fulfill the following functions.
• To support STS-1 Frame Synchronization
• To support Error Detection within the STS-1 frame
• To support the transmission of various alarm conditions such as RDI-L (Line - Remote Defect Indicator) and
  REI-L (Line - Remote Error Indicator)
• To support the Transmission and Reception of "Section Trace" Messages
• To support the Transmission and Reception of OAM&P Messages via the DCC Bytes (Data Communication
  Channel bytes - D1 through D12 byte)
The roles of most of the TOH bytes is beyond the scope of this Data Sheet and will not be discussed any
further. However, there are a three TOH bytes that are important from the stand-point of this data sheet, and
will discussed in considerable detail throughout this document. These are the H1 and H2 (e.g., the SPE
Pointer) bytes and the H3 (e.g., the Pointer Action) byte.
Figure 34 presents an illustration of the Byte-Format of the TOH within an STS-1 Frame, with the H1, H2 and
H3 bytes highlighted.

                                                      The TOH Bytes
Although the role of the H1, H2 and H3 bytes will be discussed in much greater detail in “Section 9.3, Jitter/
Wander due to Pointer Adjustments” on page 60. For now, we will simply state that the role of these bytes is
two-fold.
• To permit a given PTE (Path Terminating Equipment) that is receiving an STS-1 data to be able to locate the
  STS-1 SPE (Synchronous Payload Envelope) within the Envelope Capacity of this incoming STS-1 data
  stream and,
• To inform a given PTE whenever Pointer Adjustment and NDF (New Data Flag) events occur within the
  incoming STS-1 data-stream.
 9.2.1.1.2       The Envelope Capacity Bytes within an STS-1 Frame
In general, the Envelope Capacity Bytes are any bytes (within an STS-1 frame) that exist outside of the TOH
bytes. In short, the Envelope Capacity contains the STS-1 SPE (Synchronous Payload Envelope). In fact,
every single byte that exists within the Envelope Capacity also exists within the STS-1 SPE. The only
difference that exists between the "Envelope Capacity" as defined in Figure 33 and Figure 34 above and the
STS-1 SPE is that the Envelope Capacity is aligned with the STS-1 framing boundaries and the TOH bytes;
whereas the STS-1 SPE is NOT aligned with the STS-1 framing boundaries, nor the TOH bytes.
The STS-1 SPE is an "87 byte column x 9 row" data-structure (which is the exact same size as is the Envelope
Capacity) that is permitted to "float" within the "Envelope Capacity". As a consequence, the STS-1 SPE (within
an STS-1 data-stream) will typically straddle across an STS-1 frame boundary.
 9.2.1.1.3       The Byte Structure of the STS-1 SPE
As mentioned above, the STS-1 SPE is an 87 byte column x 9 row structure. The very first column within the
STS-1 SPE consists of some overhead bytes which are known as the "Path Overhead" (or POH) bytes. The
remaining portions of the STS-1 SPE is available for "user" data. The Byte Structure of the STS-1 SPE is
presented below in Figure 35.

                                 Z5
In general, the role/purpose of the POH bytes is to fulfill the following functions.
• To support error detection within the STS-1 SPE
• To support the transmission of various alarm conditions such as RDI-P (Path - Remote Defect Indicator) and
   REI-P (Path - Remote Error Indicator)
• To support the transmission and reception of "Path Trace" Messages
The role of the POH bytes is beyond the scope of this data sheet and will not be discussed any further.
  9.2.1.2      Mapping DS3 data into an STS-1 SPE
Now that we have defined the STS-1 SPE, we can now describe how a DS3 signal is mapped into an STS-1
SPE. As mentioned above, the STS-1 SPE is basically an 87 byte column x 9 row structure of data. The very
first byte column (e.g., in all 9 bytes) consists of the POH (Path Overhead) bytes. All of the remaining bytes
within the STS-1 SPE is simply referred to as "user" or "payload" data because this is the portion of the STS-1
signal that is used to transport "user data" from one end of the SONET network to the other. Telcordia GR-
253-CORE specifies the approach that one must use to asynchronously map DS3 data into an STS-1 SPE. In
short, this approach is presented below in Figure 36.

 REV. 1.0.4                         E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH SONET DESYNCHRONIZER
Figure 37 presents an alternative illustration of Telcordia GR-253-CORE's recommendation on how to
asynchronously map DS3 data into an STS-1 SPE. In this case, the STS-1 SPE bit-format is expressed purely
in the form of "bit-types" and "numbers of bits within each of these types of bits". If one studies this figure
closely he/she will notice that this is the same "87 byte column x 9 row" structure that we have been talking
about when defining the STS-1 SPE. However, in this figure, the "user-data" field is now defined and is said to
consist of five (5) different types of bits. Each of these bit-types play a role when asynchronously mapping a
DS3 signal into an STS-1 SPE. Each of these types of bits are listed and described below.
Fixed Stuff Bits
Fixed Stuff bits are simply "space-filler" bits that simply occupy space within the STS-1 SPE. These bit-fields
have no functional role other than "space occupation". Telcordia GR-253-CORE does not define any particular
value that these bits should be set to. Each of the 9 rows, within the STS-1 SPE will contain 59 of these "fixed
stuff" bits.
DS3 Data Bits
The DS3 Data-Bits are (as its name implies) used to transport the DS3 data-bits within the STS-1 SPE. If the
STS-1 SPE is transporting a framed DS3 data-stream, then these DS3 Data bits will carry both the "DS3
payload data" and the "DS3 overhead bits". Each of the 9 rows, within the STS-1 SPE will contain 621 of these
"DS3 Data bits". This means that each STS-1 SPE contains 5,589 of these DS3 Data bit-fields.
Stuff Opportunity Bits
The "Stuff" Opportunity bits will function as either a "stuff" (or junk) bit, or it will carry a DS3 data-bit. The
decision as to whether to have a "Stuff Opportunity" bit transport a "DS3 data-bit" or a "stuff" bit depends upon
the "timing differences" between the DS3 data that is being mapped into the STS-1 SPE and the timing source
that is driving the STS-1 circuitry within the PTE.
As will be described later on, these "Stuff Opportunity" Bits play a very important role in "frequency-justifying"
the DS3 data that is being mapped into the STS-1 SPE. These "Stuff Opportunity" bits also play a critical role
in inducing Intrinsic Jitter and Wander within the DS3 signal (as it is de-mapped by the remote PTE).
Each of the 9 rows, within the STS-1 SPE consists of one (1) Stuff Opportunity bit. Hence, there are a total of
nine "Stuff Opportunity" bits within each STS-1 SPE.
Stuff Control/Indicator Bits
Each of the nine (9) rows within the STS-1 SPE contains five (5) Stuff Control/Indicator bits. The purpose of
these "Stuff Control/Indicator" bits is to indicate (to the de-mapping PTE) whether the "Stuff Opportunity" bits
(that resides in the same row) is a "Stuff" bit or is carrying a DS3 data bit.
If all five of these "Stuff Control/Indicator" bits, within a given row are set to "0", then this means that the
corresponding "Stuff Opportunity" bit (e.g., the "Stuff Opportunity" bit within the same row) is carrying a DS3
data bit.
Conversely, if all five of these "Stuff Control/Indicator" bits, within a given row are set to "1" then this means that
the corresponding "Stuff Opportunity" bit is carrying a "stuff" bit.
Overhead Communication Bits
Telcordia GR-253-CORE permits the user to use these two bits (for each row) as some sort of
"Communications" bit. Some Mapper devices, such as the XRT94L43 12-Channel DS3/E3/STS-1 to STS-12/
STM-1 Mapper and the XRT94L33 3-Channel DS3/E3/STS-1 to STS-3/STM-1 Mapper IC (both from Exar
Corporation) do permit the user to have access to these bit-fields.
However, in general, these particular bits can also be thought of as "Fixed Stuff" bits, that mostly have a "space
occupation" function.
  9.2.2      DS3 Frequency Offsets and the Use of the "Stuff Opportunity" Bits
In order to fully convey the role that the "stuff-opportunity" bits play, when mapping DS3 data into SONET, we
will present a detailed discussion of each of the following "Mapping DS3 into STS-1" scenarios.
• The Ideal Case (e.g., with no frequency offsets)
• The 44.736Mbps + 1 ppm Case

• The 44.736MHz - 1ppm Case
Throughout each of these cases, we will discuss how the resulting "bit-stuffing" (that was done when mapping
the DS3 signal into SONET) affects the amount of intrinsic jitter and wander that will be present in the DS3
signal, once it is ultimately de-mapped from SONET.
  9.2.2.1       The Ideal Case for Mapping DS3 data into an STS-1 Signal (e.g., with no Frequency
                Offsets)
Let us assume that we are mapping a DS3 signal, which has a bit rate of exactly 44.736Mbps (with no
frequency offset) into SONET. Further, let us assume that the SONET circuitry within the PTE is clocked at
exactly 51.84MHz (also with no frequency offset), as depicted below.

                                                        PTE
                     44.736MHz + 0ppm                                        51.84MHz + 0ppm
Given the above-mentioned assumptions, we can state the following.
• The DS3 data-stream has a bit-rate of exactly 44.736Mbps
• The PTE will create 8000 STS-1 SPE's per second
• In order to properly map a DS3 data-stream into an STS-1 data-stream, then each STS-1 SPE must carry
   (44.736Mbps/8000 =) 5592 DS3 data bits.
Is there a Problem?
According to Figure 37, each STS-1 SPE only contains 5589 bits that are specifically designated for "DS3 data
bits". In this case, each STS-1 SPE appears to be three bits "short".
No there is a Simple Solution
 No, earlier we mentioned that each STS-1 SPE consists of nine (9) "Stuff Opportunity" bits. Therefore, these
three additional bits (for DS3 data) are obtained by using three of these "Stuff Opportunity" bits. As a
consequence, three (3) of these nine (9) "Stuff Opportunity" bits, within each STS-1 SPE, will carry DS3 data-
bits. The remaining six (6) "Stuff Opportunity" bits will typically function as "stuff" bits.
In summary, for the "Ideal Case"; where there is no frequency offset between the DS3 and the STS-1 bit-rates,
once this DS3 data-stream has been mapped into the STS-1 data-stream, then each and every STS-1 SPE will
have the following "Stuff Opportunity" bit utilization.
3 "Stuff Opportunity" bits will carry DS3 data bits.
6 "Stuff Opportunity" bits will function as "stuff" bits
In this case, this DS3 signal (which has now been mapped into STS-1) will be transported across the SONET
network. As this STS-1 signal arrives at the "Destination PTE", this PTE will extract (or de-map) this DS3 data-
stream from each incoming STS-1 SPE. Now since each and every STS-1 SPE contains exactly 5592 DS3
data bits; then the bit rate of this DS3 signal will be exactly 44.736Mbps (such as it was when it was mapped
into SONET, at the "Source" PTE).

As a consequence, no "Mapping/De-Mapping" Jitter or Wander is induced in the "Ideal Case".
  9.2.2.2       The 44.736Mbps + 1ppm Case
The "above example" was a very ideal case. In reality, there are going to be frequency offsets in both the DS3
and STS-1 signals. For instance Bellcore GR-499-CORE mandates that a DS3 signal have a bit rate of
44.736Mbps ± 20ppm. Hence, the bit-rate of a "Bellcore" compliant DS3 signal can vary from the exact correct
frequency for DS3 by as much of 20ppm in either direction. Similarly, many SONET applications mandate that
SONET equipment use at least a "Stratum 3" level clock as its timing source. This requirement mandates that
an STS-1 signal must have a bit rate that is in the range of 51.84 ± 4.6ppm. To make matters worse, there are
also provisions for SONET equipment to use (what is referred to as) a "SONET Minimum Clock" (SMC) as its
timing source. In this case, an STS-1 signal can have a bit-rate in the range of 51.84Mbps ± 20ppm.
In order to convey the impact that frequency offsets (in either the DS3 or STS-1 signal) will impose on the bit-
stuffing behavior, and the resulting bit-rate, intrinsic jitter and wander within the DS3 signal that is being
transported across the SONET network; let us assume that a DS3 signal, with a bit-rate of 44.736Mbps +
1ppm is being mapped into an STS-1 signal with a bit-rate of 51.84Mbps + 0ppm. In this case, the following
things will occur.
• In general, most of the STS-1 SPE's will each transport 5592 DS3 data bits.
• However, within a "one-second" period, a DS3 signal that has a bit-rate of 44.736Mbps + 1 ppm will deliver
   approximately 44.7 additional bits (over and above that of a DS3 signal with a bit-rate of 44.736Mbps + 0
   ppm). This means that this particular signal will need to "negative-stuff" or map in an additional DS3 data bit
   every (1/44.736 =) 22.35ms. In other words, this additional DS3 data bit will need to be mapped into about
   one in every (22.35ms · 8000 =) 178.8 STS-1 SPEs in order to avoid dropping any DS3 data-bits.
What does this mean at the "Source" PTE?
All of this means that as the "Source" PTE maps this DS3 signal, with a data rate of 44.736Mbps + 1ppm into
an STS-1 signal, most of the resulting "outbound" STS-1 SPEs will transport 5592 DS3 data bits (e.g., 3 Stuff
Opportunity bits will be carrying DS3 data bits, the remaining 6 Stuff Opportunity bits are "stuff" bits, as in the
"Ideal" case). However, in approximately one out of 178.8 "outbound" STS-1 SPEs, there will be a need to
insert an additional DS3 data bit within this STS-1 SPE. Whenever this occurs, then (for these particular STS-
1 SPEs) the SPE will be carrying 5593 DS3 data bits (e.g., 4 Stuff Opportunity bits will be carrying DS3 data
bits, the remaining 5 Stuff Opportunity bits are "stuff" bits).
Figure 39 presents an illustration of the STS-1 SPE traffic that will be generated by the "Source" PTE, during
this condition.

What does this mean at the "Destination" PTE?
In this case, this DS3 signal (which has now been mapped into an STS-1 data-stream) will be transported
across the SONET network. As this STS-1 signal arrives at the "Destination" PTE, this PTE will extract (or de-
map) this DS3 data from each incoming STS-1 SPE. Now, in this case most (e.g., 177/178.8) of the incoming
STS-1 SPEs will contain 5592 DS3 data-bits. Therefore, the nominal data rate of the DS3 signal being de-
mapped from SONET will be 44.736Mbps. However, in approximately 1 out of every 178 incoming STS-1
SPEs, the SPE will carry 5593 DS3 data-bits. This means that (during these times) the data rate of the de-
mapped DS3 signal will have an instantaneous frequency that is greater than 44.736Mbps. These "excursion"
of the de-mapped DS3 data-rate, from the nominal DS3 frequency can be viewed as occurrences of "mapping/
de-mapping" jitter. Since each of these "bit-stuffing" events involve the insertion of one DS3 data bit, we can
say that the amplitude of this "mapping/de-mapping" jitter is approximately 1UI-pp. From this point on, we will
be referring to this type of jitter (e.g., that which is induced by the mapping and de-mapping process) as "de-
mapping" jitter.
Since this occurrence of "de-mapping" jitter is periodic and occurs once every 22.35ms, we can state that this
jitter has a frequency of 44.7Hz.
  9.2.2.3        The 44.736Mbps - 1ppm Case
In this case, let us assume that a DS3 signal, with a bit-rate of 44.736Mbps - 1ppm is being mapped into an
STS-1 signal with a bit-rate of 51.84Mbps + 0ppm. In this case, the following this will occur.
• In general, most of the STS-1 SPEs will each transport 5592 DS3 data bits.
• However, within a "one-second" period a DS3 signal that has a bit-rate of 44.736Mbps - 1ppm will deliver
    approximately 45 too few bits below that of a DS3 signal with a bit-rate of 44.736Mbps + 0ppm. This means
    that this particular signal will need to "positive-stuff" or exclude a DS3 data bit from mapping every (1/44.736)
    = 22.35ms. In other words, we will need to avoid mapping this DS3 data-bit about one in every
    (22.35ms*8000) = 178.8 STS-1 SPEs.
What does this mean at the "Source" PTE?
All of this means that as the "Source" PTE maps this DS3 signal, with a data rate of 44.736Mbps - 1ppm into
an STS-1 signal, most of the resulting "outbound" STS-1 SPEs will transport 5592 DS3 data bits (e.g., 3 Stuff
Opportunity bits will be carrying DS3 data bits, the remaining 6 Stuff Opportunity bits are "stuff" bits). However,
in approximately one out of 178.8 "outbound" STS-1 SPEs, there will be a need for a "positive-stuffing" event.
Whenever these "positive-stuffing" events occur then (for these particular STS-1 SPEs) the SPE will carry only
5591 DS3 data bits (e.g., in this case, only 2 Stuff Opportunity bits will be carrying DS3 data-bits, and the
remaining 7 Stuff Opportunity bits are "stuff" bits).
Figure 40 presents an illustration of the STS-1 SPE traffic that will be generated by the "Source" PTE, during
this condition.

What does this mean at the Destination PTE?
In this case, this DS3 signal (which has now been mapped into an STS-1 data-stream) will be transported
across the SONET network. As this STS-1 signal arrives at the "Destination" PTE, this PTE will extract (or de-
map) this DS3 data from each incoming STS-1 SPE. Now, in this case, most (e.g., 177/178.8) of the incoming
STS-1 SPEs will contain 5592 DS3 data-bits. Therefore, the nominal data rate of the DS3 signal being de-
mapped from SONET will be 44.736Mbps. However, in approximately 1 out of every 178 incoming STS-1
SPEs, the SPE will carry only 5591 DS3 data bits. This means that (during these times) the data rate of the de-
mapped DS3 signal will have an instantaneous frequency that is less than 44.736Mbps. These "excursions" of
the de-mapped DS3 data-rate, from the nominal DS3 frequency can be viewed as occurrences of mapping/de-
mapping jitter with an amplitude of approximately 1UI-pp.
Since this occurrence of "de-mapping" jitter is periodic and occurs once every 22.35ms, we can state that this
jitter has a frequency of 44.7Hz.
We talked about De-Mapping Jitter, What about De-Mapping Wander?
The Telcordia and Bellcore specifications define "Wander" as "Jitter with a frequency of less than 10Hz".
Based upon this definition, the DS3 signal (that is being transported by SONET) will cease to contain jitter and
will now contain "Wander", whenever the frequency offset of the DS3 signal being mapped into SONET is less
than 0.2ppm.
  9.3      Jitter/Wander due to Pointer Adjustments
In the previous section, we described how a DS3 signal is asynchronously-mapped into SONET, and we also
defined "Mapping/De-mapping" jitter. In this section, we will describe how occurrences within the SONET
network will induce jitter/wander within the DS3 signal that is being transported across the SONET network.
In order to accomplish this, we will discuss the following topics in detail.
• The concept of an STS-1 SPE pointer
• The concept of Pointer Adjustments
• The causes of Pointer Adjustments
• How Pointer Adjustments induce jitter/wander within a DS3 signal being transported by that SONET network.
  9.3.1      The Concept of an STS-1 SPE Pointer
As mentioned earlier, the STS-1 SPE is not aligned to the STS-1 frame boundaries and is permitted to "float"
within the Envelope Capacity. As a consequence, the STS-1 SPE will often times "straddle" across two

A PTE that is receiving and terminating an STS-1 data-stream will perform the following tasks.
• It will acquire and maintain STS-1 frame synchronization with the incoming STS-1 data-stream.
• Once the PTE has acquired STS-1 frame synchronization, then it will locate the J1 byte (e.g., the very byte
  within the very next STS-1 SPE) within the Envelope Capacity by reading out the contents of the H1 and H2
  bytes.
The H1 and H2 bytes are referred to (in the SONET standards) as the SPE Pointer Bytes. When these two
bytes are concatenated together in order to form a 16-bit word (with the H1 byte functioning as the "Most
Significant Byte") then the contents of the "lower" 10 bit-fields (within this 16-bit word) reflects the location of
the J1 byte within the Envelope Capacity of the incoming STS-1 data-stream. Figure 42 presents an illustration
of the bit format of the H1 and H2 bytes, and indicates which bit-fields are used to reflect the location of the J1
byte.

 9.3.2       Pointer Adjustments within the SONET Network
The word SONET stands for "Synchronous Optical NETwork. This name implies that the entire SONET
network is synchronized to a single clock source. However, because the SONET (and SDH) Networks can
                                                              62

span thousands of miles, traverse many different pieces of equipments, and even cross International
boundaries; in practice, the SONET/SDH network is NOT synchronized to a single clock source.
In practice, the SONET/SDH network can be thought of as being divided into numerous "Synchronization
Islands". Each of these "Synchronization Islands" will consist of numerous pieces of SONET Terminal
Equipment. Each of these pieces of SONET Terminal Equipment will all be synchronized to a single Stratum-1
clock source which is the most accurate clock source within the Synchronization Island. Typically a
"Synchronization Island" will consist of a single "Timing Master" equipment along with multiple "Timing Slave"
pieces of equipment. This "Timing Master" equipment will be directly connected to the Stratum-1 clock source
and will have the responsibility of distributing a very accurate clock signal (that has been derived from the
Stratum 1 clock source) to each of the "Timing Slave" pieces of equipment within the "Synchronization Island".
The purpose of this is to permit each of the "Timing Slave" pieces of equipment to be "synchronized" with the
"Timing Master" equipment, as well as the Stratum 1 Clock source. Typically this "clock distribution" is
performed in the form of a BITS (Building Integrated Timing Supply) clock, in which a very precise clock signal
is provided to the other pieces of equipment via a T1 or E1 line signal.
Many of these "Synchronization Islands" will use a Stratum-1" clock source that is derived from GPS pulses
that are received from Satellites that operate at Geo-synchronous orbit. Other "Synchronization Islands" will
use a Stratum-1" clock source that is derived from a very precise local atomic clock. As a consequence,
different "Synchronization Islands" will use different Stratum 1 clock sources. The up-shot of having these
"Synchronization Islands" that use different "Stratum-1 clock" sources, is that the Stratum 1 Clock frequencies,
between these "Synchronization Islands" are likely to be slightly different from each other. These "frequency-
differences" within Stratum 1 clock sources will result in "clock-domain changes" as a SONET signal (that is
traversing the SONET network) passes from one "Synchronization Island" to another.
The following section will describe how these "frequency differences" will cause a phenomenon called "pointer
adjustments" to occur in the SONET Network.
  9.3.3      Causes of Pointer Adjustments
The best way to discuss how pointer adjustment events occur is to consider an STS-1 signal, which is driven by
a timing reference of frequency f1; and that this STS-1 signal is being routed to a network equipment (that
resides within a different "Synchronization Island") and processes STS-1 data at a frequency of f2.
NOTE: Clearly, both frequencies f1 and f2 are at the STS-1 rate (e.g., 51.84MHz). However, these two frequencies are
        likely to be slightly different from each other.
Now, since the STS-1 signal (which is of frequency f1) is being routed to the network element (which is
operating at frequency f2), the typical design approach for handling "clock-domain" differences is to route this
STS-1 signal through a "Slip Buffer" as illustrated below.

                                                                 Clock Domain operating
                                                                 At Frequency f2.
In the "Slip Buffer, the "input" STS-1 data (labeled "STS-1 Data_IN") is latched into the FIFO, upon a given
edge of the corresponding "STS-1 Clock_f1" input clock signal. The STS-1 Data (labeled "STS-1 Data_OUT")
is clocked out of the Slip Buffer upon a given edge of the "STS-1 Clock_f2" input clock signal.
The behavior of the data, passing through the "Slip Buffer" is now described for each possible relationship
between frequencies f1 and f2.
If f1 = f2
If both frequencies, f1 and f2 are exactly equal, then the STS-1 data will be "clocked" into the "Slip Buffer" at
exactly the same rate that it is "clocked out". In this case, the "Slip Buffer" will neither fill-up nor become
depleted. As a consequence, no pointer-adjustments will occur in this STS-1 data stream. In other words, the
STS-1 SPE will remain at a constant location (or offset) within each STS-1 envelope capacity for the duration
that this STS-1 signal is supporting this particular service.
If f1 < f2
If frequency f1 is less than f2, then this means that the STS-1 data is being "clocked out" of the "Slip Buffer" at
a faster rate than it is being clocked in. In this case, the "Slip Buffer" will eventually become depleted.
Whenever this occurs, a typical strategy is to "stuff" (or insert) a "dummy byte" into the data stream. The
purpose of stuffing this "dummy byte" is to compensate for the frequency differences between f1 and f2, and
attempt to keep the "Slip Buffer, at a somewhat constant fill level.
NOTE: This "dummy byte" does not carry any valuable information (not for the user, nor for the system).
Since this "dummy byte" carries no useful information, it is important that the "Receiving PTE" be notified
anytime this "dummy byte" stuffing occurs. This way, the Receiving Terminal can "know" not to treat this
"dummy byte" as user data.
Byte-Stuffing and Pointer Incrementing in a SONET Network
Whenever this "byte-stuffing" occurs then the following other things occur within the STS-1 data stream.
During the STS-1 frame that contains the "Byte-Stuffing" event
 a. The "stuff-byte" will be inserted into the byte position immediately after the H3 byte. This insertion of the
      "dummy byte" immediately after the H3 byte position will cause the J1 byte (and in-turn, the rest of the
      SPE) to be "byte-shifted" away from the H3 byte. As a consequence, the offset between the H3 byte posi-
      tion and the STS-1 SPE will now have been increased by 1 byte.
 b. The "Transmitting" Network Equipment will notify the remote terminal of this byte-stuffing event, by invert-
      ing certain bits within the "pointer word" (within the H1 and H2 bytes) that are referred to as "I" bits.

NOTE: At this time the "I" bits are inverted in order to denote that an "incrementing" pointer adjustment event is currently
         occurring.
During the STS-1 frame that follows the "Byte-Stuffing" event
The "I" bits (within the "pointer-word") will be set back to their normal value; and the contents of the H1 and H2
bytes will be incremented by "1".
If f1 > f2
If frequency f1 is greater than f2, then this means that the STS-1 data is being clocked into the "Slip Buffer" at
a faster rate than is being clocked out. In this case, the "Slip Buffer" will start to fill up. Whenever this occurs, a
typical strategy is to delete (e.g., negative-stuff) a byte from the Slip Buffer. The purpose of this "negative-
stuffing" is to compensate for the frequency differences between f1 and f2; and to attempt to keep the "Slip
Buffer" at a somewhat constant fill-level.
NOTE: This byte, which is being "un-stuffed" does carry valuable information for the user (e.g., this byte is typically a
         payload byte). Therefore, whenever this negative stuffing occurs, two things must happen.
    a. The "negative-stuffed" byte must not be simply discarded. In other words, it must somehow also be
       transmitted to the remote PTE with the remainder of the SPE data.
    b. The remote PTE must be notified of the occurrence of these "negative-stuffing" events. Further, the
       remote PTE must know where to obtain this "negative-stuffed" byte.
Negative-Stuffing and Pointer-Decrementing in a SONET Network
Whenever this "byte negative-stuffing" occurs then the following other things occur within the STS-1 data-
stream.
During the STS-1 frame that contains the "Negative Byte-Stuffing" Event
    a. The "Negative-Stuffed" byte will be inserted into the H3 byte position. Whenever an SPE data byte is
       inserted into the H3 byte position (which is ordinarily an unused byte), the number of bytes that will exist
       between the H3 byte and the J1 byte within the very next SPE will be reduced by 1 byte. As a
       consequence, in this case, the J1 byte (and in-turn, the rest of the SPE) will now be "byte-shifted"
       towards the H3 byte position.
    b. The "Transmitting" Network Element will notify the remote terminal of this "negative-stuff" event by
       inverting certain bits within the "pointer word" (within the H1 and H2 bytes) that are referred to as "D"
       bits.

  9.3.4      Why are we talking about Pointer Adjustments?
The overall SONET network consists of numerous "Synchronization Islands". As a consequence, whenever a
SONET signal is being transmitted from one "Synchronization Island" to another; that SONET signal will
undergo a "clock domain" change as it traverses the network. This clock domain change will result in periodic
pointer-adjustments occurring within this SONET signal. Depending upon the direction of this "clock-domain"
shift that the SONET signal experiences, there will either be periodic "incrementing" pointer-adjustment events
or periodic "decrementing" pointer-adjustment events within this SONET signal.
Regardless of whether a given SONET signal is experiencing incrementing or decrementing pointer
adjustment events, each pointer adjustment event will result in an abrupt 8-bit shift in the position of the SPE
within the STS-1 data-stream. If this STS-1 signal is transporting an "asynchronously-mapped" DS3 signal;
then this 8-bit shift in the location of the SPE (within the STS-1 signal) will result in approximately 8UIpp of jitter
within the asynchronously-mapped DS3 signal, as it is de-mapped from SONET. In “Section 9.5, A Review of
the Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements (per Telcordia GR-253-CORE) for DS3 applications” on page 68 we
will discuss the "Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements (for DS3 Applications) per Telcordia GR-253-CORE.
However, for now we will simply state that this 8UIpp of intrinsic jitter far exceeds these "intrinsic jitter"
requirements.
In summary, pointer-adjustments events are a "fact of life" within the SONET/SDH network. Further, pointer-
adjustment events, within a SONET signal that is transporting an asynchronously-mapped DS3 signal, will
impose a significant impact on the Intrinsic Jitter and Wander within that DS3 signal as it is de-mapped from
SONET.

interface the LIU to a Mapper Device in the manner as presented below in Figure 47.

In this application, the Mapper IC will have the responsibility of receiving an STS-N signal (from the SONET
Network) and performing all of the following operations on this STS-N signal.
• Byte-de-interleaving this incoming STS-N signal into N STS-1 signals
• Terminating each of these STS-1 signals
• Extracting (or de-mapping) the DS3 signal(s) from the SPEs within each of these terminated STS-1 signals.
In this application, these Mapper devices can be thought of as multi-channel devices. For example, an STS-3
Mapper can be viewed as a 3-Channel DS3/STS-1 to STS-3 Mapper IC. Similarly, an STS-12 Mapper can be

viewed as a 12-Channel DS3/STS-1 to STS-12 Mapper IC. Continuing on with this line of thought, if a Mapper
IC is configured to receive an STS-N signal, and (from this STS-N signal) de-map and output N DS3 signals
(towards the DS3 facility), then it will typically do so in the following manner.
• In many cases, the Mapper IC will output this DS3 signal, using both a "Data-Signal" and a "Clock-Signal". In
   many cases, the Mapper IC will output the contents of an entire STS-1 data-stream via the Data-Signal.
• However, as the Mapper IC output this STS-1 data-stream, it will typically supply clock pulses (via the Clock-
   Signal output) coincident to whenever a DS3 bit is being output via the Data-Signal. In this case, the Mapper
   IC will NOT supply a clock pulse coincident to when a TOH, POH, or any "non-DS3 data-bit" is being output
   via the "Data-Signal".
Now, since the Mapper IC will output the entire STS-1 data stream (via the Data-Signal), the output Clock-
Signal will be of the form such that it has a period of 19.3ns (e.g., a 51.84MHz clock signal). However, the
Mapper IC will still generate approximately 44,736,000 clock pulses during any given one second period.
Hence, the clock signal that is output from the Mapper IC will be a horribly gapped 44.736MHz clock signal.
One can view such a clock signal as being a very-jittery 44.736MHz clock signal. This jitter that exists within
the "Clock-Signal" is referred to as "Clock-Gapping" Jitter. A more detailed discussion on how the user must
handle this type of jitter is presented in “Section 9.8.2, Recommendations on Pre-Processing the Gapped
Clocks (from the Mapper/ASIC Device) prior to routing this DS3 Clock and Data-Signals to the Transmit Inputs
of the LIU” on page 79.
 9.5      A Review of the Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements (per Telcordia GR-253-CORE) for DS3
          applications
The "Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements" per Telcordia GR-253-CORE (for DS3 applications) mandates
that the user perform a large series of tests against certain specified "Scenarios". These "Scenarios" and their
corresponding requirements is summarized in Table 18, below.

NOTE: All of these intrinsic jitter measurements are to be performed using a band-pass filter of 10Hz to 400kHz.
Each of the scenarios presented in Table 18, are briefly described below.
  9.5.1     DS3 De-Mapping Jitter
DS3 De-Mapping Jitter is the amount of Intrinsic Jitter that will be measured within the "Line" or "Facility-side"
DS3 signal, (after it has been de-mapped from a SONET signal) without the occurrence of "Pointer
Adjustments" within the SONET signal.
Telcordia GR-253-CORE requires that the "DS3 De-Mapping" Jitter be less than 0.4UI-pp, when measured
over all possible combinations of DS3 and STS-1 frequency offsets.
  9.5.2     Single Pointer Adjustment
Telcordia GR-253-CORE states that if each pointer adjustment (within a continuous stream of pointer
adjustments) is separated from each other by a period of 30 seconds, or more; then they are sufficiently
isolated to be considered "Single-Pointer Adjustments".
Figure 48 presents an illustration of the "Single Pointer Adjustment" Scenario.

                         Initialization         Cool Down            Measurement Period
Telcordia GR-253-CORE states that the Intrinsic Jitter that is measured (within the DS3 signal) that is
ultimately de-mapped from a SONET signal that is experiencing "Single-Pointer Adjustment" events, must NOT
exceed the value 0.3UI-pp + Ao.
NOTES:
     1.   Ao is the amount of Intrinsic Jitter that was measured during the "De-Mapping" Jitter portion of this test.
     2.   Testing must be performed for both Incrementing and Decrementing Pointer Adjustments.

Telcordia GR-253-CORE mandates that the Intrinsic Jitter, within the DS3 signal that is de-mapped from a
SONET signal, which is experiencing the "Burst of Pointer Adjustment" scenario, must NOT exceed 1.3UI-pp.

Telcordia GR-253-CORE defines an "87-3 Continuous" Pointer Adjustment pattern, as a repeating sequence of
90 pointer adjustment events. Within this 90 pointer adjustment event, 87 pointer adjustments are actually
executed. The remaining 3 pointer adjustments are never executed. The spacing between individual pointer
adjustment events (within this scenario) can range from 7.5ms to 10seconds.
Telcordia GR-253-CORE mandates that the Intrinsic Jitter, within the DS3 signal that is de-mapped from a
SONET signal, which is experiencing the "87-3 Continuous" pattern of Pointer Adjustments, must not exceed
1.0UI-pp.

  9.7.2     Wander Measurement Test Results
Wander Measurement test results will be provided in the next revision of the LIU Data Sheet.
 9.8      Designing with the LIU
In this section, we will discuss the following topics.
• How to design with and configure the LIU to permit a system to meet the above-mentioned Intrinsic Jitter and
   Wander requirements.
• How is the LIU able to meet the above-mentioned requirements?
• How does the LIU permits the user to comply with the SONET APS Recovery Time requirements of 50ms
   (per Telcordia GR-253-CORE)?
• How should one configure the LIU, if one needs to support "Daisy-Chain" Testing at the end Customer's site?
  9.8.1     How to design and configure the LIU to permit a system to meet the above-mentioned
            Intrinsic Jitter and Wander requirements
As mentioned earlier, in most application (in which the LIU will be used in a SONET De-Sync Application) the
user will typically interface the LIU to a Mapper device in the manner as presented below in Figure 57.
In this application, the Mapper has the responsibility of receiving a SONET STS-N/OC-N signal and extracting
as many as N DS3 signals from this signal. As a given channel within the Mapper IC extracts out a given DS3
signal (from SONET) it will typically be applying a Clock and Data signal to the "Transmit Input" of the LIU IC.
Figure 57 presents a simple illustration as to how one channel, within the LIU should be connected to the
Mapper IC.

As mentioned above, the Mapper IC will typically output a Clock and Data signal to the LIU. In many cases, the
Mapper IC will output the contents of an entire STS-1 data-stream via the Data Signal to the LIU. However, the
Mapper IC typically only supplies a clock pulse via the Clock Signal to the LIU coincident to whenever a DS3 bit
is being output via the Data Signal. In this case, the Mapper IC would not supply a clock edge coincident to
when a TOH, POH or any non-DS3 data-bit is being output via the Data-Signal.
Figure 57 indicates that the Data Signal from the Mapper device should be connected to the TPDATA_n input
pin of the LIU IC and that the Clock Signal from the Mapper device should be connected to the TCLK_n input
pin of the LIU IC.
In this application, the LIU has the following responsibilities.

• Using a particular clock edge within the "gapped" clock signal (from the Mapper IC) to sample and latch the
   value of each DS3 data-bit that is output from the Mapper IC.
• To (through the user of the Jitter Attenuator block) attenuate the jitter within this "DS3 data" and "clock signal"
   that is output from the Mapper IC.
• To convert this "smoothed" DS3 data and clock into industry-compliant DS3 pulses, and to output these
   pulses onto the line.
To configure the LIU to operate in the correct mode for this application, the user must execute the following
configuration steps.
 a. Configure the LIU to operate in the DS3 Mode
The user can configure a given channel (within the LIU) to operate in the DS3 Mode, by executing either of the
following steps.
• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Host Mode
The user can accomplish this by setting both Bits 2 (E3_n) and Bits 1 (STS-1/DS3*_n), within each of the
"Channel Control Registers" to "0" as depicted below.
CHANNEL CONTROL REGISTER - CHANNEL 0 ADDRESS LOCATION = 0X06
                                          CHANNEL 1 ADDRESS LOCATION = 0X0E
                                          CHANNEL 2 ADDRESS LOCATION = 0X16

• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Hardware Mode
The user can accomplish this by pulling all of the following input pins "Low".
Pin 76 - E3_0
Pin 94 - E3_1
Pin 85 - E3_2
Pin 72 - STS-1/DS3_0
Pin 98 - STS-1/DS3_1
Pin 81 - STS-1/DS3_2
b. Configure the LIU to operate in the Single-Rail Mode
Since the Mapper IC will typically output a single "Data Line" and a "Clock Line" for each DS3 signal that it
demaps from the incoming STS-N signal, it is imperative to configure each channel within the LIU to operate in
the Single Rail Mode.
The user can accomplish this by executing either of the following steps.
• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Host Mode
The user can accomplish this by setting Bit 0 (SR/DR*), within the each of the "Channel Control" Registers to 1,
as illustrated below.

• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Hardware Mode
Then the user should tie the (SR/DR*) pin to "High".
 c. Configure each of the channels within the LIU to operate in the SONET De-Sync Mode
The user can accomplish this by executing either of the following steps.
• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Host Mode.
Then the user should set Bit D2 (JA0) to "0" and Bit D0 (JA1) to "1", within the Jitter Attenuator Control
Register, as depicted below.

• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Hardware Mode
Then the user should tie pin 44 (JA0) to a logic "HIGH" and pin 42 (JA1) to a logic "LOW".
Once the user accomplishes either of these steps, then the Jitter Attenuator (within the LIU) will be configured
to operate with a very narrow bandwidth.
d. Configure the Jitter Attenuator (within each of the channels) to operate in the Transmit Direction.
The user can accomplish this by executing either the following steps.
• If the LIU has been configured to operate in the Host Mode.
Then the user should be Bit D1 (JATx/JARx*) to "1", within the Jitter Attenuator Control Register, as depicted
below.

           always be enabled.
      2.   The "SONET APS Recovery Time" mode will be discussed in greater detail in “Section 9.8.3, How does the LIU
           permit the user to comply with the SONET APS Recovery Time requirements of 50ms (per Telcordia GR-253-
           CORE)?” on page 83.
  9.8.2       Recommendations on Pre-Processing the Gapped Clocks (from the Mapper/ASIC Device)
              prior to routing this DS3 Clock and Data-Signals to the Transmit Inputs of the LIU
In order to minimize the effects of "Clock-Gapping" Jitter within the DS3 signal that is ultimately transmitted to
the DS3 Line (or facility), we recommend that some "pre-processing" of the "Data-Signals" and "Clock-Signals"
(which are output from the Mapper device) be implemented prior to routing these signals to the "Transmit
Inputs" of the LIU.
  9.8.2.1        SOME NOTES PRIOR TO STARTING THIS DISCUSSION:

 REV. 1.0.4                          E3/DS3/STS-1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT WITH SONET DESYNCHRONIZER
Our simulation results indicate that Jitter Attenuator PLL (within the LIU LIU IC) will have no problem handling
and processing the "Data-Signal" and "Clock-Signal" from a Mapper IC/ASIC if no pre-processing has been
performed on these signals. In order words, our simulation results indicate that the Jitter Attenuator PLL
(within the LIU IC) will have no problem handling the "worst-case" of 59 consecutive bits of no clock pulses in
the "Clock-Signal (due to the Mapper IC processing the TOH bytes, an Incrementing Pointer-Adjustment-
induced "stuffed-byte", the POH byte, and the two fixed-stuff bytes within the STS-1 SPE, etc), immediately
followed be processing clusters of DS3 data-bits (as shown in Figure 37) and still comply with the "Category I
Intrinsic Jitter Requirements per Telcordia GR-253-CORE for DS3 applications.
NOTE: If this sort of "pre-processing" is already supported by the Mapper device that you are using, then no further action
         is required by the user.
  9.8.2.2        OUR PRE-PROCESSING RECOMMENDATIONS
For the time-being, we recommend that the customer implement the "pre-processing" of the DS3 "Data-Signal"
and "Clock-Signal" as described below. Currently we are aware that some of the Mapper products on the
Market do implement this exact "pre-processing" algorithm. However, if the customer is implementing their
Mapper Design in an ASIC or FPGA solution, then we strongly recommend that the user implement the
necessary logic design to realize the following recommendations.
Some time ago, we spent some time, studying (and then later testing our solution with) the PM5342 OC-3 to
DS3 Mapper IC from PMC-Sierra. In particular, we wanted to understand the type of "DS3 Clock" and "Data"
signal that this DS3 to OC-3 Mapper IC outputs.
During this effort, we learned the following.
 1.    This "DS3 Clock" and "Data" signal, which is output from the Mapper IC consists of two major "repeating"
       patterns (which we will refer to as "MAJOR PATTERN A" and "MAJOR PATTERN B". The behavior of
       each of these patterns is presented below.
MAJOR PATTERN A
MAJOR PATTERN A consists of two "sub" or minor-patterns, (which we will refer to as "MINOR PATTERN P1
and P2).
MINOR PATTERN P1 consists of a string of seven (7) clock pulses, followed by a single gap (no clock pulse).
An illustration of MINOR PATTERN P1 is presented below in Figure 58.
FIGURE 58. ILLUSTRATION OF MINOR PATTERN P1
                                                                            Missing Clock Pulse

It should be noted that each of these clock pulses has a period of approximately 19.3ns (or has an
"instantaneously frequency of 51.84MHz).
MINOR Pattern P2 consists of string of five (5) clock pulses, which is also followed by a single gap (no clock
pulse). An illustration of Pattern P2 is presented below in Figure 59.

HOW MAJOR PATTERN A IS SYNTHESIZED
MAJOR PATTERN A is created (by the Mapper IC) by:
• Repeating MINOR PATTERN P1 (e.g., 7 clock pulses, followed by a gap) 63 times.
• Upon completion of the 63rd transmission of MINOR PATTERN P1, MINOR PATTERN P2 is transmitted
  repeatedly 36 times.
Figure 60 presents an illustration which depicts the procedure that is used to synthesize MAJOR PATTERN A
FIGURE 60. ILLUSTRATION OF PROCEDURE WHICH IS USED         TO SYNTHESIZE MAJOR PATTERN A
                                  Repeats 63 Times           Repeats 36 Times
                               MINOR PATTERN P1          MINOR PATTERN P2
Hence, MAJOR PATTERN A consists of "(63 x 7) + (36 x 5)" = 621 clock pulses. These 621 clock pulses were
delivered over a period of "(63 x 8) + (36 x 6)" = 720 STS-1 (or 51.84MHz) clock periods.
MAJOR PATTERN B
MAJOR PATTERN B consists of three sub or minor-patterns (which we will refer to as "MINOR PATTERNS P1,
P2 and P3).
MINOR PATTERN P1, which is used to partially synthesize MAJOR PATTERN B, is exactly the same "MINOR
PATTERN P1" as was presented above in Figure 30. Similarly, the MINOR PATTERN P2, which is also used
to partially synthesize MAJOR PATTERN B, is exactly the same "MINOR PATTERN P2" as was presented in
Figure 31.
MINOR PATTERN P3 (which has yet to be defined) consists of a string of six (6) clock pulses, which contains
no gaps. An illustration of MINOR PATTERN P3 is presented below in Figure 61.

HOW MAJOR PATTERN B IS SYNTHESIZED
MAJOR PATTERN B is created (by the Mapper IC) by:
• Repeating MINOR PATTERN P1 (e.g., 7 clock pulses, followed by a gap) 63 times.
• Upon completion of the 63rd transmission of MINOR PATTERN P1, MINOR PATTERN P2 is transmitted
  repeatedly 36 times.
• pon completion of the 35th transmission of MINOR PATTERN P2, MINOR PATTERN P3 is transmitted once.
Figure 62 presents an illustration which depicts the procedure that is used to synthesize MAJOR PATTERN B.
FIGURE 62. ILLUSTRATION OF PROCEDURE WHICH IS USED TO SYNTHESIZE PATTERN B
                                                                          Transmitted 1 Time
                          Repeats 63 Times           Repeats 35 Times
                            PATTERN P1                PATTERN P2            PATTERN P3
 Hence, MAJOR PATTERN B consists of "(63 x 7) + (35 x 5)" + 6 = 622 clock pulses.
These 622 clock pulses were delivered over a period of "(63 x 8) + (35 x 6) + 6 = 720 STS-1 (or 51.84MHz)
clock periods.
PUTTING THE PATTERNS TOGETHER
Finally, the DS3 to OC-N Mapper IC clock output is reproduced by doing the following.
• MAJOR PATTERN A is transmitted two times (repeatedly).
• After the second transmission of MAJOR PATTERN A, MAJOR PATTERN B is transmitted once.
• Then the whole process repeats.
Throughout the remainder of this document, we will refer to this particular pattern as the "SUPER PATTERN".
Figure 63 presents an illustration of this "SUPER PATTERN" which is output via the Mapper IC.

 CROSS-CHECKING OUR DATA
• Each SUPER PATTERN consists of (621 + 621 + 622) = 1864 clock pulses.
• The total amount of time, which is required for the "DS3 to OC-N Mapper" IC to transmit this SUPER
   PATTERN is (720 + 720 + 720) = 2160 "STS-1" clock periods.
• This amount to a period of (2160/51.84MHz) = 41,667ns.
• In a period of 41, 667ns, the LIU (when configured to operate in the DS3 Mode), will output a total (41,667ns
   x 44,736,000) = 1864 uniformly spaced DS3 clock pulses.
• Hence, the number of clock pulses match.
APPLYING THE SUPER PATTERN TO THE LIU
Whenever the LIU is configured to operate in a "SONET De-Sync" application, the device will accept a
continuous string of the above-defined SUPER PATTERN, via the TCLK input pin (along with the
corresponding data). The channel within the LIU (which will be configured to operate in the "DS3" Mode) will
output a DS3 line signal (to the DS3 facility) that complies with the "Category I Intrinsic Jitter Requirements -
per Telcordia GR-253-CORE (for DS3 applications). This scheme is illustrated below in Figure 64.

  9.8.3    How does the LIU permit the user to comply with the SONET APS Recovery Time
           requirements of 50ms (per Telcordia GR-253-CORE)?
Telcordia GR-253-CORE, Section 5.3.3.3 mandates that the "APS Completion" (or Recovery) time be 50ms or
less. Many of our customers interpret this particular requirement as follows.
"From the instant that an APS is initiated on a high-speed SONET signal, all lower-speed SONET traffic (which
is being transported via this "high-speed" SONET signal) must be fully restored within 50ms. Similarly, if the
"high-speed" SONET signal is transporting some PDH signals (such as DS1 or DS3, etc.), then those entities

data-streams that have been de-mapped from SONET) must have re-acquired DS1 or DS3 frame
synchronization within 50ms" after APS has been initiated."
The LIU was designed such that the DS3 signals that it receives from a SONET Mapper device and processes
will comply with the Category I Intrinsic Jitter requirements per Telcordia GR-253-CORE.
Reference 1 documents some APS Recovery Time testing, which was performed to verify that the Jitter
Attenuator blocks (within the LIU) device that permit it to comply with the Category I Intrinsic Jitter
Requirements (for DS3 Applications) per Telcordia GR-253-CORE, do not cause it to fail to comply with the
"APS Completion Time" requirements per Section 5.3.3.3 of Telcordia GR-253-CORE. However, Table 3
presents a summary of some APS Recovery Time requirements that were documented within this test report.

NOTE: The user can only disable the "SONET APS Recovery Time Mode" if the LIU is operating in the Host Mode. If the
         user is operating the LIU in the Hardware Mode, then the user will have NO ability to disable the "SONET APS
         Recovery Time Mode" feature.
  9.8.4     How should one configure the LIU, if one needs to support "Daisy-Chain" Testing at the end
            Customer's site?
Daisy-Chain testing is emerging as a new requirements that many of our customers are imposing on our
SONET Mapper and LIU products. Many System Designer/Manufacturers are finding out that whenever their
end-customers that are evaluating and testing out their systems (in order to determine if they wish to move
forward and start purchasing this equipment in volume) are routinely demanding that they be able to test out
these systems with a single piece of test equipment. This means that the end-customer would like to take a
single piece of DS3 or STS-1 test equipment and (with this test equipment) snake the DS3 or STS-1 traffic
(that this test equipment will generate) through many or (preferably all) channels within the system. For
example, we have had request from our customers that (on a system that supports OC-192) our silicon be able
to support this DS3 or STS-1 traffic snaking through the 192 DS3 or STS-1 ports within this system.
After extensive testing, we have determined that the best approach to complying with test "Daisy-Chain"
Testing requirements, is to configure the Jitter Attenuator blocks (within each of the Channels within the LIU)
into the "32-Bit" Mode. The user can configure the Jitter Attenuator block (within a given channel of the LIU) to
operate in this mode by settings in the table below.
