1.1      Brief Description
The CMX602B is a low power CMOS integrated circuit for the reception of the physical layer signals used
in BT's Calling Line Identification Service (CLIP), Bellcore's Calling Identity Delivery System (CID), the
Cable Communications Association's Caller Display Services (CDS), and similar evolving systems. It also
meets the requirements of emerging Caller Identity with Call Waiting services (CIDCW).
The device includes a 'zero-power' ring or line reversal detector, a dual-tone (2130Hz plus 2750Hz) Tone
Alert Signal and a 1200-baud FSK V23/Bell202 compatible asynchronous data demodulator with a data
retiming circuit which removes the need for a UART in the associated µController.
It is suitable for use in systems to BT specifications SIN227 and SIN242, Bellcore GR-30-CORE and
SR-TSV-002476, CCA TW/P&E/312, ETSI ETS 300 659 parts 1 and 2, ETS 300 778 parts 1 and 2 and
Mercury Communications MNR 19.

This amplifier is used to convert the balanced FSK and Tone Alert signals received over the telephone line
to an unbalanced signal of the correct amplitude for the FSK receiver and Tone Alert Detector circuits.

The design equations for this circuit are;
                     Differential voltage gain VAOP / V(b-a) = R8/R6
                     R6 = R7 = 470kΩ
                     R10 = 160kΩ
                     R9 = R8 x R10 / (R8 - R10)
The target differential voltage gain depends on the expected signal levels between the A and B wires and
the CMX602B's internal threshold levels, which are proportional to the supply voltage.

1.5.3      Bandpass Filter
Is used to attenuate out of band noise and interfering signals which might otherwise reach the FSK
Demodulator, Tone Alert Detector and Level Detector circuits. The characteristics of this filter differ in FSK
and Tone Alert modes. Most of the filtering is provided by Switched Capacitor stages clocked at 57.7kHz.
1.5.4      Level Detector
This block operates by measuring the level of the signal at the output of the Bandpass Filter, and
comparing it against a threshold which depends on whether FSK Receive or Tone Alert Detect mode has
been selected.
In Tone Alert Detect mode the output of the Level Detector block provides an input to the Tone Alert Signal
Detector.

In FSK Receive mode the CMX602B DET output will be set high when the level has exceeded the
threshold for sufficient time. Amplitude and time hysteresis are used to reduce chattering of the DET
output in marginal conditions.
Note that in FSK Receive mode this circuit may also respond to non-FSK signals such as speech.

1.5.5      FSK Demodulator
This block converts the 1200 baud FSK input signal to a logic level received data signal which is output via
the RXD pin as long as the Data Retiming function is not enabled (see section 1.5.6). This output does not
depend on the state of the FSK Level Detector output.
Note that in the absence of a valid FSK signal, the demodulator may falsely interpret speech or other
extraneous signals as data.
1.5.6      FSK Data Retiming
The Data Retiming block extracts the 8 data bits of each character from the received asynchronous data
stream, and presents them to the µC under the control of strobe pulses applied to the RXCK input. The
timing of these pulses is not critical and they may easily be generated by a simple software loop. This
facility removes the need for a UART in the µC without incurring an excessive software overhead.
The block operates on a character by character basis by first looking for the mark to space transition which
signals the beginning of the start bit, then, using this as a timing reference, sampling the output of the FSK
Demodulator in the middle of each of the following 8 received data bits, storing the results in an internal 8-
bit shift register.
When the eighth data bit has been clocked into the internal shift register, the CMX602B examines the
RXCK input. If this is low then the IRQN output will be pulled low and the first of the stored data bits put
onto the RXD output pin. On detecting that the IRQN output has gone low, the µC should pulse the RXCK
pin high 8 times. The high to low transition at the end of the first 7 of these pulses will be used by the
CMX602B to shift the next data bit from the shift register onto the RXD output. At the end of the eighth
pulse the FSK Demodulator output will be reconnected to the RXD output pin. The IRQN output will be
cleared the first time the RXCK input goes high.
Thus to use the Data Retiming function, the RXCK input should be kept low until the IRQN output goes
low; if the Data Retiming function is not required the RXCK input should be kept high.
The only restrictions on the timing of the RXCK waveform are those shown in Figure 5a and the need to
complete the transfer of all eight bits into the µC within 8.3ms (the time of a complete character at 1200
baud).

Note that, if enabled, the Data Retiming block will interpret the FSK Channel Seizure signal (a sequence of
alternating mark and space bits) as valid received characters, with values of 55 (hex). Similarly it may
interpret speech or other signals as random characters.
If the Data Retiming facility is not required, the RXCK input to the CMX602B should be kept high. The
asynchronous data from the FSK Demodulator will then be connected directly to the RXD output pin, and
the IRQN output will not be activated by the FSK signal. This case is illustrated in Figure 5b.

1.5.7      Tone Alert Detector
This block is enabled when the CMX602B is set to Tone Alert Detect mode. It will then monitor the
received signal for the presence of simultaneous 2130 and 2750Hz tones of sufficient level and duration.
Two digital bandpass filters, centred around 2130Hz and 2750Hz, are used within the block to give
additional rejection of interfering signals.
The CMX602B DET output will be set high while a Tone Alert signal is detected.
When the DET output goes low at the end of the Tone Alert signal, then if the DET output had been high
for a time within the CAS qualifying time TqCAS limits (see 1.7.1) , then the IRQN output will be pulled low
and will remain low until the CMX602B is switched out of Tone Alert Detect mode. Note that the TqCAS
timing has been optimised for the detection of 75 to 85ms Tone Alert (CAS) signals used in off-hook

When no signal is present on the telephone line, RD will be at VSS and RT pulled to VDD by R5 so the
output of the Schmitt trigger 'B' will be low.
The ring signal is usually applied at the subscriber's exchange as an ac voltage inserted in series with one
of the telephone wires and will pass through either C3 and R3 or C4 and R4 to appear at the top end of R1
(point X in Figure 7) in a rectified and attenuated form.
The signal at point X will be further attenuated by the potential divider formed by R1 and R2 before being
applied to the CMX602B input RD . If the amplitude of the signal appearing at RD is greater than the input
threshold (Vthi) of Schmitt trigger 'A' then the N transistor connected to RT will be turned on, pulling the
voltage at RT to VSS by discharging the external capacitor C5. The output of the Schmitt trigger 'B' will
then go high, activating the DET and/or IRQN outputs depending on the states of the MODE and ZP
inputs.
The minimum amplitude ringing signal that is certain to be detected is
                               ( 0.7 + Vthi x [R1 + R2 + R3] / R2 ) x 0.707 Vrms
where Vthi is the high-going threshold voltage of the Schmitt trigger A (see section 1.7).
With R1, R3 and R4 all 470kΩ as Figure 2, then setting R2 to 68kΩ will guarantee detection of ringing
signals of 40Vrms and above for VDD over the range 2.7 to 5.5V.
A line polarity reversal may be detected using the same circuit but there will be only one pulse at RD. The
BT specification SIN242 says that the circuit must detect a +15V to -15V reversal between the two lines
slewing in 30ms. For a linearly changing voltage at the input to C3 (or C4), then the voltage appearing at
the RD pin will be
                                        dV/dt x C3 x [ 1 - exp(-t/T) ] x R2
where T = C3 x (R1 + R2 + R3) and dV/dt is the input slew rate.
For dV/dt = 500V/sec (15V in 30ms), R1, R3 and R4 all 470kΩ and C3, C4 both 0.1µF as Figure 2, then
setting R2 to 390kΩ will guarantee detection at VDD = 5.5V.
If the time constant of R5 and C5 is large enough then the voltage on RT will remain below the threshold of
the 'B' Schmitt trigger keeping the DET and/or IRQN outputs active for the duration of a ring cycle
The time for the voltage on RT to charge from VSS towards VDD can be derived from the formula
                                       VRT = VDD x [1 - exp(-t/(R5 x C5)) ]
As the Schmitt trigger high-going input threshold voltage (Vthi) has a minimum value of 0.56 x VDD , then
the Schmitt trigger B output will remain high for a time of at least 0.821 x R5 x C5 following a pulse at RD.
Using the values given in Figure 2 (470kΩ and 0.33µF) gives a minimum time of 100 ms (independent of
VDD ), which is adequate for ring frequencies of 10Hz or above.
If necessary, the µC can distinguish between a ring and a reversal by timing the length of the IRQN or DET
output.

1.5.9      Xtal Osc and Clock Dividers
Frequency and timing accuracy of the CMX602B is determined by a 3.579545MHz clock present at the
XTAL pin. This may be generated by the on-chip oscillator inverter using the external components C1, C2
and X1 of Figure 2, or may be supplied from an external source to the XTAL input, in which case C1, C2
and X1 should not be fitted.
The oscillator is turned off in the 'Zero-Power' modes.
If the clock is provided by an external source which is not always running, then the ZP input must be set
high when the clock is not available. Failure to observe this rule may cause a significant rise in the supply
current drawn by CMX602B as well as generating undefined states of the RXD, DET and IRQN outputs.

1.6.1      'On-Hook' Operation
The systems described in this section operate when the telephone set is not in use (on-hook) to display
the number of a calling party before the call is answered.
British Telecom System
Figure 8a illustrates the line signalling and CMX602B I/O signals for the BT on-hook Calling Line ID
system as defined in BT specifications SIN227 and SIN242 part 1. A similar system is described in ETS
300 659-1 section 6.1.2c.
The Tone Alert signal consists of simultaneous 2130Hz and 2750Hz tones, the 'Chan Seize' signal is a
'1010..' FSK bit sequence. Not shown are the requirements for AC and DC loads, including a short initial
Current Wetting Pulse, to be applied to the line 20ms after the end of the Tone Alert signal and to be
maintained during reception of the FSK signal. Note that, for simplicity of presentation, the Data Retiming
function is not used in Figure 8a (RXCK is kept high).

as defined in Bellcore documents GR-30-CORE and SR-TSV-002476 and also in ETS 300 659-1 section
6.1.1.
As for the BT system, the 'Chan Seize' signal is a '1010..' FSK bit sequence. The Bellcore specifications
do not require AC or DC line terminations while the FSK data is being received, however ETS 300 659-1
allows for the possibility of an AC termination being applied. Note that, for simplicity of presentation, the
Data Retiming function is not used in Figure 8b (RXCK is kept high).

Other On-hook Systems
ETS 300 659-1 also allows for systems where the FSK transmission is preceded by a Dual Tone Alerting
signal similar to that used by BT but without a line reversal (section 6.1.2a) or by a Ringing Pulse Alerting
Signal (section 6.1.2b).
The U.K. CCA (Cable Communications Association) specification TW/P&E/312 precedes the FSK signals
by a 200 to 450ms ring burst. AC and DC line terminations during FSK reception are optional.
Mercury Communications Ltd. specification MNR 19 allows for either the BT system or that specified by
CCA.
As these are all slight variants on the BT and Bellcore systems, they can also be handled by the
CMX602B.

1.6.2      'Off-Hook' Operation
The CIDCW (Calling Identity on Call Waiting) system described in this section operates when the
telephone set is in use (off-hook) to display the number of a waiting caller without interrupting the current
call.
Bellcore documents GR-30-CORE and SR-TSV-002476, BT specifications SIN227 and SIN242 Part 2 and
ETS 300-659-2 all describe similar systems in which a successful CIDCW transaction consists of a
sequence of actions between the CPE (Customer Premises Equipment - e.g. a telephone) and the Central
Office as indicated in Figure 9a.
           A.         Normal conversation with both near and far end voice present.
           B.         Central Office mutes far end voice, sends CAS and becomes silent.
           C.         CPE recognises CIDCW initiation and mutes near end voice and keypad.
           D.         CPE sends dtmf ACK to Central Office to signal its readiness to receive FSK data.
           E.         Central Office recognises ACK and sends FSK Caller ID data to CPE.
           F.         CIDCW transaction is complete. CPE unmutes near end voice and the Central Office
                      unmutes far end voice, returning to normal conversation.
                        Figure 9a : CIDCW Transaction from Near End CPE Perspective
The CAS signal is transmitted by the Central Office to initiate a CIDCW transaction and consists of a 80ms
burst of simultaneous 2130Hz and 2750Hz tones.
CAS detection is very important because a “missed” signal causes Caller ID information to be lost and a
false signal detection produces a disruptive tone which is heard by the far end caller. Because the CAS
signals must be detected in the presence of conversations which both mask and masquerade as the tone
signals, this function is difficult to accomplish correctly.
Because the numbers of false responses (Talk-offs) and missed signals (Talk-downs) are related to the
speech levels at the CMX602B input, and because the level of near end speech from the local handset is
normally greater than that of far end speech coming from the Central Office, a further improvement in
overall performance can be obtained by taking the CMX602B’s audio input from the receive side of the
telephone set hybrid where this is possible.
The internal algorithms used by the CMX602B to drive the DET and IRQN outputs in Tone Alert Detect
mode have been optimised for the detection of off-hook CAS signals in the presence of speech when used
according to the following principles:
1.         If it is possible to mute the local speech from the microphone rapidly (within 0.5ms) without
           introducing noise (i.e. where the CIDCW equipment is built into the telephone set) then this should
           be done whenever the CMX602B is in Tone Detect mode and the DET output is high. Doing this
           will markedly reduce the number of false responses generated by local (near end) speech. Note
           that the DET output is not used for any other purpose in an off-hook application when the

2.         The IRQN output going low when in Tone Alert Detect mode indicates that a CAS has been
           detected. The local handset and keypad should then be muted as required by the Bellcore
           specification and the CMX602B switched to FSK Receive mode to be ready to receive the FSK
           data, doing this will also clear the IRQN output.
3.         The CMX602B’s DET output should be monitored for a period of 50ms after changing to FSK
           Receive mode, before sending the ACK signal, and the transaction abandoned if the DET output
           goes high during this time, which would be the case if a false CAS detect had been caused by far
           end speech.
