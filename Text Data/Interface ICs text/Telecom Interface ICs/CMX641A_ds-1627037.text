1.1      Brief Description
The CMX641A is a low power, system selectable Dual Subscriber Pulse Metering (SPM) Detector – two
detectors on a single chip – to indicate the presence on a telephone line of either 12kHz or 16kHz
telephone call charge frequencies. The detection sensitivity, frequency and bandwidth are independently
selectable for each channel, under µC control, as is the frequency of the security tone generator, which
may be ASK modulated by an external signal. The CMX641A is also backwards compatible with the
FX641 and MX641 dual SPM detectors, whilst offering a lower (3.0V) operating voltage and power.
The CMX641A has two modes of operation:
    (1) Fixed Bandwidth Operating state, in which the two channels are set to the same system
         frequency and sensitivity setting. Sensitivity and system frequency can be under either µC or
         external control. This state is fully pin and function compatible with the FX641 and MX641.
    (2) Enhanced Features Operating state, under µC control, in which each channel has independently
         controllable sensitivity, bandwidth and system frequency (12kHz or 16kHz). There is also a
         12kHz/16kHz transmission tone which can be keyed on and off directly by a dedicated logic pin.
This device is suitable for PBX/PABX line-card installations, payphone security applications and pair-gain
systems. It is available in 24-pin plastic DIL and SOIC packages and consumes ≈1.2mA at 3V.

      1             1                XTAL           I/P   The input of the on-chip oscillator for use with a
                                                          3.579545MHz Xtal in conjunction with the
                                                          XTALN output; circuit components are on-chip.
                                                          When using an Xtal input, the CLOCK OUT pin
                                                          should be connected directly to the CLOCK IN
                                                          pin. If an external clock input is employed at
                                                          the CLOCK IN pin, the XTAL pin must be
                                                          connected directly to VDD (see Figure 2). See

      3             3           CLOCK OUT          O/P    The buffered output of the on-chip oscillator
                                                          inverter. If a XTAL input is employed, this
                                                          output should be connected directly to the

Fixed Bandwidth Operating State, Fixed Sensitivity Mode
In this mode input amplifier components are chosen to set the required sensitivity of the CMX641A. (See
section 1.6.5).
Note that when calculating/selecting gain components, R3, R4, R7 and R8 should always be greater than
or equal to 100kΩ.
Particular attention should be paid to decoupling VDD and keeping the power, ground and signal lines free
from unnecessary noise.
Telephone systems may have unusually high dc and ac voltages present on the line, as either differential
or common mode signals. If the CMX641A is part of a host system which does not have its own input
protection, then protection diodes must be added to both signal inputs (+ and -) so that the voltage on any
pin is limited to within VSS – 0.3V and Vdd + 0.3V. The breakdown voltage of capacitors and the peak
inverse voltage of diodes must be sufficient to withstand the sum of the dc and peak-peak ac voltages
applied.

1.5      General Description
1.5.1 Description of Blocks
Crystal Oscillator and Clock Dividers
These circuits derive the internal logic clocks, decode frequencies and transmit frequencies by frequency
division of a reference frequency which may be generated by the on-chip crystal oscillator or applied from
an external source.
If the on-chip oscillator is used, a 3.579545MHz crystal should be connected across the XTAL and XTALN
pins and CLOCK IN pin should be connected to CLOCK OUT. All other oscillator components are on-
chip. If an external clock source is used then it should be applied to the CLOCK IN pin and the XTAL pin
connected to VDD.
Input Operational Amplifiers
The input signals are input to the CMX641A via these amplifiers. In Controlled Sensitivity mode of the
Fixed Bandwidth Operating state, or when in Enhanced Features Operating state, the external
components shown in Figure 2 should be used. When used in the Fixed Sensitivity mode of the Fixed
Bandwidth Operating state, external gain setting components should be calculated using Figure 6.
In Enhanced Features Operating state, with the channels set to 12kHz/16kHz detect, the channel 2
amplifier can optionally be isolated and may be used as an independent amplifier. In this case, both
channels are internally connected to amplifier 1. The amplifiers can be connected as differential mode or
single ended, depending upon the application (see Figure 3).
SPM Tone Bandpass Filter
These are tone bandpass/audio reject filters automatically centred on the system frequency (12kHz or
16kHz) being detected. When in Controlled Sensitivity mode of the Fixed Bandwidth Operating state or
when in Enhanced Features Operating state, the level sensitivity of the device is set by adjusting the
passband gain of these filters. When in Fixed Sensitivity mode of the Fixed Bandwidth Operating state,
their gain is constant so that the internal device sensitivity is also constant.
Level Detection and Pulse Generator Circuits
The outputs from the bandpass filters are input to these circuits which perform the signal level
discrimination function for the CMX641A. Signals which fulfil the system level requirements cause a
stream of digital pulses, one per 32 cycles of input signal, to be generated. These pulses are sent to the
period measurement circuitry.
Period Measurement Logic
This digital circuit block inputs the stream of pulses from the level detection circuits and measures their
repetition rate against a predetermined maximum and minimum. Because each pulse from the level
detect circuit occur once per 32 cycles of input signal, this has the effect of averaging the input signal
period over this number of cycles. A valid SPM tone is recognised when 3 successive correctly spaced
pulses are received. If the Tone Follower output format is selected, this causes a signal to appear
immediately at the relevant channel output signifying receipt of a valid SPM signal. Depending upon the
frequency, within the legal bandwidth, received, the CMX641A should respond within 10-15ms (see
section 1.7 and Figure 5).
Tone Length Logic
This digital circuit block is used when Packet output format is selected. Its output responds when 40ms
of valid tone is received within any 48ms window, signifying receipt of a valid packet of SPM tone (see
section 1.7). Once the CMX641A has responded, within any 48ms window, 40ms of no-tone, or of tone
outside the chosen bandwidth or below the level threshold will cause the output to derespond. (See
Figure 5).
Tx Tone Generator and Shaping Filter
These are active in Enhanced Features Operating state only. They generate a low distortion sinewave
for transmission by the CMX641A as an SPM security tone. The output at the TONE OP pin is

modulated on-off by the TONE ASK pin. A high (logic ‘1’) selects no tone and low (logic ‘0’) selects tone.
The transmission frequency is selected by the TX TONE SELECT pin. A high (logic ‘1’) selects 12kHz
and a low (logic ‘0’) selects 16kHz. (See Table 7).
Output Select Circuits
These drive the output logic pins ‘Channel 1 Output’ (CH1OP) and ‘Channel 2 Output’ (CH2OP). These
outputs can be made high impedance by setting the OP ENABLEN pin high. When enabled, the format
at these pins is either Tone Follower or Packet. (See Table 1). A high (logic ‘1’) indicates the tone is
absent, a low (logic ‘0’) indicates the tone is present.
1.5.2 Operating States
There are two operating states for the CMX641A: Fixed Bandwidth and Enhanced Features.
Fixed Bandwidth Operating State (ENHANCED FEATURES pin = logic ‘0’ or open circuit)
In this operating state, the CMX641A is function and pin compatible with the FX641 and MX641. It is a
dual-channel SPM detector with both detectors set to the same level sensitivity and system frequency
(12kHz or 16kHz) via a 6-bit serial data word from a host µController. Alternatively, for non µController
systems, the sensitivity and system frequency can be set via external components and logic inputs. In
this state, the decode bandwidth of both channels is internally fixed at ±1.5% of the nominal centre
frequency.
Enhanced Features Operating State (ENHANCED FEATURES pin = logic ‘1’)
In this state, the following features of the two SPM detector channels are independently controllable via a
16-bit serial data word from a host µController.
     (i)      The decode bandwidths, which can be set to ±1.5%, ±3%, ±5% and ±7.5% of the nominal
              tone frequency.
     (ii)     The level sensitivity.
     (iii)    The system frequencies, which have one of three possible settings: 12kHz & 12kHz, 16kHz &
              16kHz, or 12kHz for Channel 2 and 16kHz for Channel 1.
When the two channels are set to 12kHz/16kHz mode, there is an option to disconnect the channel 2
decode path from its own amplifier and have both channels connected to the channel 1 input. The
channel 2 amplifier is then independent and available for some other use, say gain setting or filtering,
within the host circuitry.
There is also a transmit tone, selectable to 12kHz or 16kHz, which is ASK modulated via a logic input pin.
Features Common to both Operating States
In both states, three output formats are available for the channel output pins. These output formats are
selectable via the logic input pins OP SELECT and OP ENABLEN. (See Table 1).
      (i)      In Tone Follower mode, the logic output has very short response and deresponse times so
               that it forms an ‘envelope’ of the input tone. Host systems will decide whether the received
               signal fulfils the system tone pulse length requirements.
      (ii)     In Packet mode, the channel output only responds after 40ms of received continuous tone.
               The CMX641A then ignores the erroneous 20ms on, 20ms off “ringing” pattern which occurs
               on some telephone lines.
      (iii)
               The deresponse time is also 40ms, so that the decode output pin forms a delayed envelope
               of the input tone and host systems can decide, as in the Tone Follower mode, whether the
               received tone duration fulfils local system requirements.

 Controlled Sensitivity Mode (PRESET LEVEL pin = logic ‘0’)
 This mode allows the sensitivity to be set from a µController via a 6-bit serial data input. This same
 serial input also sets operation (bit 0) for either 12kHz or 16kHz systems. Both channels are set
 identically.

    11100        These states should never be used. If sensitivities of this order are required, (e.g. the Swedish Rural
    11101        SPM specification, it is recommended that the Controlled sensitivity setting is set to 20dB (10100)
    11110        and external components selected to set the Input Amp gain to a higher figure.
    11111
       Table 2 Controlled Sensitivity Setting Information in Fixed Bandwidth Operating State
The figures in Table 2 assume:
     1. The recommended amplifier components (see figure 2) are employed.
     2. The applied VDD is 5.0V. 0dB(ref.) = 775Vrms.
     3. Signal sensitivity is proportional to VDD. However, the 16kHz settings marked * (11000 to 11011)
         are allowed for 5V operation only.
     4. Bandwidth setting 00 (±1.5%), 01 (±3/0%) or 10 (±5.0%) is selected. Add 0.5dB to upper figure if
         bandwidth setting 11 (±7.5%) is selected.
Table 2 shows the serial data input to produce the required sensitivity. Minimum, nominal and maximum
sensitivity figures are provided to make complete allowance for internal circuit offsets and component
tolerances. The gain of each bandpass filter, and hence the device sensitivity, is adjusted by the applied
serial bits D1 to D5. The system frequency is selected by bit D0 (‘1’ = 12kHz; ‘0’ = 16kHz). Data is loaded
bit 5 (D5) first (See Figure 7).

In controlled sensitivity mode, the ‘will detect’ bandwidth is internally set at ±1.5% i.e. in 12kHz mode, the
CMX641A will detect frequencies between 11.82kHz to 12.18kHz inclusive. In 16kHz mode, it will detect
frequencies between 15.76kHz to 16.24kHz inclusive. The ‘will not detect’ bandedges are ±4% so that, in
12kHz mode, the CMX641A will not respond to frequencies of 11.52kHz or lower or to 12.48kHz or
higher. In 16kHz, the equivalent frequencies are 15.36kHz and 16.64kHz.
Fixed Sensitivity Mode (PRESET LEVEL pin = logic ‘1’ or open circuit)
In this mode, the sensitivity of each channel is set by correct selection of external components around
each Channel input amplifier. See section 1.6.5 and Figure 6 for a method of selecting amplifier gain
and components to meet a particular sensitivity requirement.
 1.5.2.2 Enhanced Features Operating State (ENHANCED FEATURES pin = logic ‘1’)
 This state is selected by tying pin 23 to logic 1. It has individually programmable tone detect
 bandwidths, signal sensitivities and a 12kHz or 16kHz ASK keyed transmission tone. Control of the
 CMX641A in this state is via a 16-bit serial data word, as shown in Table 3. Data is loaded bit 15 (D15)
 first (See Figure 8).

Channel Level Sensitivities
These are independently programmable via bits D15-D11 for channel 2 and bits D8-D4 for channel 1.
The 5-bit coding and sensitivities are as given in Table 2 above for the Fixed Bandwidth Operating State.
For example, if D15-D11 = ‘01001’ and D8-D4 = ‘00101’, both in 12kHz mode, then channel 2 would have
a nominal sensitivity of –26.5dB(ref) and channel 1 would have a nominal sensitivity of –22.5dB(ref).
Will Detect and Will Not Detect Bandwidths
There are four individually programmable bandwidths per channel. The ‘will detect’ bandwidth can be
programmed to ±1.5%, ±3%, ±5% or ±7.5%. The corresponding ‘will not detect’ band edges are ±4%,
±5.5%, ±7.5% and ±10%. Bits D10 and D9 control channel 2 and bits D3 and D2 control channel 1.

 frequencies inclusive. It will not respond to frequencies at or below the Lower ‘Will Not Detect’ or at or
 above the Upper ‘Will Not Detect’. The response and deresponse times will depend upon the output
 format chosen, i.e. Tone Follower or Packet output.

              Table 6 Setting System Frequencies in Enhanced Features Operating State
 The operating frequencies can be set in four ways as shown in Table 6. In three of the four cases,
 Amplifier 1 is the input to channel 1 and Amplifier 2 is the input to channel 2. However, when bits
 D1-D0 = ‘10’, both channels take their input from Amplifier 1. This makes Amplifier 2 available for
 independent use, perhaps as a gain or filter block. However, it should be noted that each channel will
 detect its system frequency only in the absence of the other. The device is not designed to be immune to
 the presence of the other tone. Each channel will function correctly when either 12kHz or 16kHz, but not
 both, is present.
 ASK Tone Output
 This is output from the TONE OP pin under the control of the TONE ASK input and the TX TONE
 SELECT pins. The TONE ASK pin keys the transmit tone on-off. A logic high corresponds to no tone
 and logic low to tone. The output frequency is selected by the TX TONE SELECT pin. A logic high

Figure 3 shows how the input amplifiers can be connected as differential mode or common mode
amplifiers, according to the application.

1.6.2 Crystal/Clock Distribution
The CMX641A requires a 3.579545MHz crystal or an external clock pulse input. With the exception of
the crystal, all oscillator components are incorporated on chip. If a crystal is employed, the Clock Out pin
should be connected directly to the Clock In pin.
To reduce component and layout complexity the clock requirements of up to 3 additional CMX641A
microcircuits may be supplied from a crystal driven CMX641A acting as the master system clock. With
reference to Figure 4, the clock should be distributed as illustrated and the XTAL pins of the driven
devices should be connected directly to VDD.
Note that the maximum load on the master Clock Out pin should not be exceeded.

1.6.4 Setting Level Sensitivity via the Input Serial Data Word
The serial data word input is used to set the device sensitivity in the Controlled Sensitivity mode of the
Fixed Bandwidth Operating state and in the Enhanced Features Operating state.
In Controlled Sensitivity mode of the Fixed Bandwidth Operating state, the CMX641A operates identically
to the FX641 and MX641. The input word is 6 bits and Table 2 lists the device sensitivities vs input
codes.
In the Enhanced Features Operating State, channel 1’s sensitivity is controlled by applying the codes in
Table 2 to bits D15-D11. Channel 2’s sensitivity is controlled by applying these codes to bits D8-D4.
Example:      Suppose the CMX641A is required to work in a system in which 16kHz signals, at or above
–22dB(ref) must be detected and signals at or below –27dB(ref) must not be detected. Reference to
Table 2 shows that bandpass filter gain settings of 6dB or 7dB will meet this level specification.
Thus in Fixed Bandwidth Operating State and Controlled Sensitivity Mode:
Inputting D5-D0 = ’001100’ or ‘001110’ (See Table 2) will set both channels to meet this specification.
Selecting ‘001100’ makes both channels’ minimum ‘Will Detect’ level –22.9dB(ref) and its maximum ‘Will
Not Detect’ level –25.5dB(ref). This means that the detection threshold of any device will lie between
these two levels.
In Enhanced Features Operating State Channel 2:
Inputting D15-D11 = ‘00110’ or ‘00111’ (See Tables 2 & 3) and D1-D0 = ‘00’ (See Table 6) will
programme channel 2 to meet this level specification. Selecting ‘00111’ makes the channel 2 minimum
‘Will Detect’ level –23.9dB(ref) and its maximum ‘Will Not Detect’ level –26.5dB(ref). This means that
Channel 2’s detection threshold will lie between these two levels.
In Enhanced Features Operating State Channel 1:
Inputting D8-D4 = ‘00110’ or ‘00111’ (See Tables 2 & 3) and D1-D0 = ‘00’, ‘01’ or ‘10’ (See Table 6) will
programme channel 1 to meet this level specification. Selecting ‘00110’ makes the CMX641A minimum
‘Will Detect’ level –22.9dB(ref) and its maximum ‘Will Not Detect’ level –25.5dB(ref). This means that
channel 1’s detection threshold will lie between these two levels. The two channels may be set to
identical detection thresholds, if desired.

1.6.5 Setting Level Sensitivity via External Components
In Fixed Bandwidth Operating state, Fixed Sensitivity mode, the sensitivities of the two channels are set
by the correct selection of the components around the Channel Input Amplifiers.
Input Gain Calculation:            The input amplifiers, with their external circuitry, are available to set the
sensitivity of the CMX641A to conform to the user’s national level specification with regard to ‘Must’ and
‘Must-Not’ detect signal levels. With reference to the graph in Figure 6, the following steps will assist in
the determination of the required gain/attenuation.
Step 1
Draw two horizontal lines from the Y-axis {Signal Level dB(ref)}
The upper line will represent the required ‘Must’ decode level
The lower line will represent the required ‘Must-Not’ decode level.
Step 2
Mark the intersection of the upper horizontal line and the upper sloping line; drop a vertical line from this
point to the X-axis {Amplifier Gain (dB)}.
The point where the vertical line meets the X-axis will indicate the MINIMUM Input gain required for
reliable decoding of valid signals.
Step 3
Mark the intersection of the lower horizontal line and the lower sloping line; drop a vertical line from this
point to the X-axis.
The point where the vertical line meets the X-axis will indicate the MAXIMUM allowable Input amp gain.
Input signals at or below the ‘Must-Not’ decode level will not be detected as long as the amplifier gain is
no higher than this level.
Step 4
Refer to the gain components shown in Figure 2. The user should calculate and select external
components (R1/R3/C3, R2/R4/C4 and R5/R7/C5, R6/R8/C6) to provide amplifier gains within the limits
obtained in Steps 2 and 3.
Component tolerances should not move the gain figure outside these limits. Resistors R3, R4, R7 and
R8 should always be greater than or equal to 100kΩ. It is recommended that the designed gain is near
the centre of the calculated range.
Note that the device sensitivity is directly proportional to the applied power supply (VDD). The graph in
Figure 6 is for the calculation of input gain components for the CMX641A using a VDD of 5.0 (±0.1) volts.
Subtract 4.44dB from the amplifier gain for operation at 3.0V volts.
1.6.6 Aliasing
Due to the switched capacitor filters employed in the CMX641A, care should be taken to avoid any
aliasing effects by removing all frequencies above 579.390kHz (16kHz mode) or 434.543kHz (12kHz
mode). This can be achieved by adding bypass capacitors across R3, R4, R7 and R8, setting the –3dB
breakpoint of each resistor-capacitor combination such that there is sufficient attenuation at the alias
frequency and negligible effect at the desired SPM frequency.

1.7.1.3     Operating Characteristics (continued)
Notes:
        1.   At 5.0V. Not including any current drawn from the pins by external circuitry.
        2.   At 3.0V. Not including any current drawn from the pins by external circuitry.
        3.   Logic pins with no internal pullup or pulldown resistors; CHIP SELECTN, SERIAL DATA,
             SERIAL CLOCK, OP ENABLEN, OP SELECT and CLOCK IN pins.

        6.   Tristate selected.
        7.   Time taken to change between any two of the operational modes: Tone follower, Packet or
             Tristrate, and with a maximum capacitive load of 30pF on an output.
        8.   With adherence to Signal to Voice and Signal to Noise specifications.
        9.   12kHz system.
        10.  16kHz system
        11.  The time delay after a valid serial data load (or after device powerup, change of bandwidth
             setting or change in input signal conditions), before the condition of the outputs can be
             guaranteed correct.
        12.  With ‘Will Detect’ bandwidth set to ±1.5%, Fixed Bandwidth Operating State or Enhanced
             Features Operating State.
        13.  With ‘Will Detect’ bandwidth set to ±3.0%, Enhanced Features Operating State only.
        14.  With ‘Will Detect’ bandwidth set to ±5.0%, Enhanced Features Operating State only.
        15.  With ‘Will Detect’ bandwidth set to ±7.5%, Enhanced Features Operating State only.
        16.   With the input amplifier gain at 0dB and the Bandpass filter gain set to 0dB (Table 2);
              subtract 1dB from this specification for each single dB of Bandpass filter gain programmed.
              Alternatively, with the input components as recommended in Figure 2, the sensitivity is as
              defined in Table 2.
         17. In Fixed Bandwidth Operating State, Controlled Sensitivity mode; or in Enhanced Features
             Operating State.
         18. In Fixed Bandwidth Operating State, Preset Sensitivity mode.

             output.
         20. Signal sensitivity is proportional to VDD.
         21. For immunity to false responses and/or deresponses.
         22. Common mode SPM and balanced voice signal.
         23. With SPM and voice signal balanced; to avoid false deresponses due to saturation, the peak
             to peak voice + noise level at the output of the input amplifier should be no greater than the
             dynamic range of the device. For this reason, the signal to voice figure at the Amp output
             will vary with the sensitivity setting. The lowest signal to voice figure occurs at the highest
             sensitivity setting (Table 2, 27dB).
         24. Maximum voice frequencies = 3.4kHz.
         25. Output tone = 12kHz selected.
         26. Output tone = 16kHz selected.
         27. The time between a logic ‘1-0’ transition at TONE ASK input and the tone at TONE OP
             reaching 10% of its full value or between a ‘0-1’ transition at TONE ASK input and the tone
             falling to 90% of its full value.
         28. The time for the tone at TONE OP to rise from 10% to 90% or to fall from 90% to 10% of its
             full value.
         29. Tx circuit enabled in Enhanced Features Operating State.

                                         CML Product Data
In the process of creating a more global image, the three standard product semiconductor
companies of CML Microsystems Plc (Consumer Microcircuits Limited (UK), MX-COM, Inc
(USA) and CML Microcircuits (Singapore) Pte Ltd) have undergone name changes and, whilst
maintaining their separate new names (CML Microcircuits (UK) Ltd, CML Microcircuits (USA)
Inc and CML Microcircuits (Singapore) Pte Ltd), now operate under the single title CML Micro-
circuits.
These companies are all 100% owned operating companies of the CML Microsystems Plc
Group and these changes are purely changes of name and do not change any underlying legal
entities and hence will have no effect on any agreements or contacts currently in force.
CML Microcircuits Product Prefix Codes
Until the latter part of 1996, the differentiator between products manufactured and sold from
MXCOM, Inc. and Consumer Microcircuits Limited were denoted by the prefixes MX and FX
respectively. These products use the same silicon etc. and today still carry the same prefixes.
In the latter part of 1996, both companies adopted the common prefix: CMX.
