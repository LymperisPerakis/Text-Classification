miSLIC™ Series Solution Overview
The sixth-generation miSLIC line interface solution consists of a miSLIC device, VoicePath API-II (VP-API-II)
Software, and Profiles Data Structures. To support the miSLIC device, Microsemi offers comprehensive software
and hardware collateral packages, including 2-layer printed circuit board reference designs.
The VoicePath API-II (VP-API-II) software initializes the FXS port coefficient data containing application or country-
specific AC and DC parameters, ringing and other signaling characteristics, and configures the switching power
supply. VP-API-II resides on the customer’s VoIP processor or SoC and provides high-level control over the
telephony functions. VP-API-II offers a seamless migration between products utilizing its common software
architecture and interfaces with the Microsemi VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software.
A Microsoft® Windows® GUI (Graphical User Interface) application, VoicePath Profile Wizard (VP Profile Wizard),
allows the user to select the operating parameters of the FXS channels and to automatically generate the sets of
data structures, called Profiles, that are required by the VP-API-II for integration with the VoIP host software.
The Le9643/Le9653 miSLIC device implements a universal telephone line interface with pin-selectable PCM and
SPI or ZSI serial digital interfaces. All AC, DC, and signaling parameters are fully programmable via the PCM and
SPI or reduced pin-count ZSI interfaces.
The switching regulator controller generates the high voltage needed for efficiently powering and ringing analog
telephones. The Le9643 supports two switching regulator architectures, both are capable of ringing 85-VPK; a
Buck-Boost fixed tracking switching regulator architecture which uses a fixed voltage for ringing signals, or an
Inverting-Boost switcher circuit which tracks the ringing voltage during ringing. The Le9653 supports two switching
regulator architectures, both are capable of ringing 140-VPK; a High Voltage Flyback or a High Voltage Inverting-
Boost switcher circuit both of which track the ringing voltage during ringing. The battery tracks the DC feed with
both architectures. The switching regulators provide high efficiency in all operating states and corresponding low
power consumption.
The Le9643/Le9653 utilizes the VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software to resolve line circuit faults and to
provide line diagnostics. The integrated digital access to line information such as AC and DC line voltages and
Metallic or Longitudinal currents is crucial for remote applications where dedicated test hardware is not cost
effective.
Additionally, the VeriVoice Manufacturing Software (VVMT) package provides test functions intended to facilitate
factory testing, eliminating the need for expensive external test equipment.

VoicePath Application Programming Interface II (VP-API-II)
The Microsemi VoicePath Application Programming Interface II (VP-API-II) is a C source code module that provides
a standard software interface for controlling, testing, and passing digitized voice through a set of subscriber lines
using the Microsemi family of voice termination devices.

Customer Application
This block represents the user’s line management module that performs tasks such as initializing the system,
configuring lines, changing the line states in response to line events and other inputs, switching digitized voice
traffic, etc. Microsemi provides example implementations of this layer as part of the VoicePath SDK.
VoicePath API-II
The VoicePath API-II is the core component of the Microsemi VoicePath SDK. This software module runs on the
host microprocessor that controls one or more Microsemi voice telephony devices.
Hardware Abstraction Layer
The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) provides access to Microsemi voice telephony devices through the SPI or
multiplexed ZSI interface. The HAL software is platform-dependent and must be implemented by the VP-API-II
user. Microsemi provides example HAL source code with the VoicePath SDK.

VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software
VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software is an advanced test suite that provides the ability for the user to perform
the Telcordia GR-909-CORE / TIA-1063 diagnostic testing for testing the physical subscriber loop. Additionally the
VeriVoice Professional Test Suite Software provides for a series of inward looking tests so the operation of the FXS
circuit and switching regulator can be verified.
The VeriVoice Professional Test Suite features the following tests:
•    Line Voltage:                   Checks for hazardous and foreign AC and DC voltages.
•    Receiver Off-Hook:               Checks for longitudinal fault, off-hook resistive fault and receiver off-hook.
•    Regular REN:                     Tests the impedance of the line and returns a fail if the Ringer Equivalence Number
                                      (REN) is too low or high.
•    Electronic REN:                  Provides REN Tip to Ring, Tip to ground and Ring to ground based on capacitance
•    Resistive Fault:                 Measures three-element resistance.
•    GR-909-CORE / TIA-1063:          Performs all of the GR-909-CORE outward tests in the correct sequence.
•    Capacitance:                     Measures three element capacitance
•    Master Socket:                   Detects master socket terminations
•    Cross Connect:                   Detects cross connected FXS
•    Loop back:                       Enables receive-to-transmit signal loop-back using two different methods

                                      normal operation of the line circuit.
•    DC Feed Self-Test                Measures the voltage and current across a known internal test termination using the
                                     DC Profile that has been programmed.
•    Ringing Self-Test                Verifies ring signal generation, drive capability, and ring trip.

                                     and verifies that they are properly reported.
•    Draw and Break Dial Tone         Verifies the capability of the line circuit to detect off-hook and on-hook as well as the
                                     voice path to/from the host
•    Read Loop Conditions - Extended Reads the loop conditions of the current state of the line without disturbing the T/R feed
                                      conditions. Measures AC and DC voltages Tip and Ring, Tip to ground and Ring to
                                      ground. Measures VBAT to ground. Also measures metallic and longitudinal AC and
                                      DC line currents in supported States.
Manufacturing Testing
The Le9643 and Le9653 are supported by the VeriVoice Manufacturing Test Package (VVMT). The VeriVoice™
Manufacturing Test Package is a stand-alone, self contained test package intended to facilitate factory testing of
new products based on Microsemi miSLIC™ Series of Voice Solutions. The software is distributed as a portable,
platform-independent C source code module. The software is architected as a rapid set of tests which provide
thorough test cover and eliminates the need for expensive test equipment.
