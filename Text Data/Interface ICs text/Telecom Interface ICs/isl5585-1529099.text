   The 3.3V family of ringing subscriber line interface circuits     Features
   (SLIC) supports analog Plain Old Telephone Service
   (POTS) in short and medium loop length, wireless and              • 3.3V Operation
   wireline voice over broadband applications. Ideally suited for    • Onboard Ringing Generation
   customer premise equipment, this family of products offers
                                                                     • Low Standby Power Consumption (75V, 65mW)
   flexibility to designers with high ringing voltage and low
   power consumption system requirements.                            • Programmable Transient Current Limit
   The ISL5585 family is capable of operating with 100V ringing      • Improved Off Hook Software Interface
   battery supply, which translates directly to the amount of        • Integrated MTU DC Characteristics
   ringing voltage supplied to the subscriber. With the high
   operating voltage, subscriber loop lengths can be extended        • Low External Component Count
   to 500 (i.e., 5,000 feet) and beyond, allowing this family to    • Silent Polarity Reversal
   serve emerging Fiber In The Loop (FITL) markets.
                                                                     • Pulse Metering and On Hook Transmission
   Other key features across the product family include: 3.3V
                                                                     • Tip Open Ground Start Operation
   VCC operation, low power consumption, ringing using
   sinusoidal or trapezoidal waveforms, robust auto-detection        • Balanced and Unbalanced Ringing
   mechanisms for when subscribers go on or off hook, and            • Thermal Shutdown with Alarm Indicator
   minimal external discrete application components.
   Integrated test access features are also offered on selected      • 28 Lead Surface Mount Packaging
   products to support loopback testing as well as line              • QFN Package:
   measurement tests.                                                  - Compliant to JEDEC PUB95 MO-220

 PLCC  QFN   SYMBOL                                                        DESCRIPTION
  10     6      F0    Mode control input.
  11     7      E0    Detector Output Selection Input. This TTL input controls the multiplexing of the SHD (E0 = 1) and GKD (E0 = 0)
                      comparator outputs to the DET output based upon the state at the F2-F0 pins (see the Device Operating Modes table
                      shown on page 2).
  12     9     DET    Detector Output - This TTL output provides on-hook/off-hook status of the loop based upon the selected operating
                      mode. The detected output will either be switch hook, ground key or ring trip (see the Device Operating Modes table
                      shown on page 2). DET will be latched low following a ring trip. Unlatching the DET pin is accomplished by changing
                      logic state.
  13    10     ALM    Thermal Shutdown Alarm. This pin signals the internal die temperature has exceeded safe operating temperature
                      (approximately 175°C) and the device has been powered down automatically.
  14    11    AGND    Analog ground reference. This pin should be externally connected to BGND.
  15    12     BSEL   Selects between high and low battery, with a logic “1” selecting the high battery and logic “0” the low battery.
  16    13      TL    Programming pin for the transient current limit feature, set by an external resistor to ground.
  17    14     POL    External capacitor on this pin sets the polarity reversal time.
  18    15     VRS    Ringing Signal Input - Analog input for driving 2-wire interface while in Ring Mode.
  19    17     AUX    Auxiliary input - Float if not used.
  20    18     VTX    Transmit Output Voltage - Output of impedance matching amplifier, AC couples through a resistor to CODEC.
  21    19     VFB    Feedback voltage for impedance matching. This voltage is scaled to accomplish impedance matching. The CFB
                      capacitor connects between this pin and the -IN pin. The CFB cap needs to be non-polarized for proper device
                      operation in the Reverse Active mode. Ceramic surface mount capacitors (1206 body style) are available from
                      Panasonic with a 6.3V voltage rating. These can be used for CFB since it is internally limited to approximately ±3V.
  22    20      -IN   Analog Receive Voltage - 4-wire analog audio input voltage. connects to CODEC via receive gain setting resistor RIN
                      (see Figure 18). Resistor RIN needs to be as close to the -IN pin as possible to minimize parasitic capacitance.
  23    21     VCC    Positive voltage power supply,+3.3V
  24    22     CDC    DC Biasing Filter Capacitor - Connects between this pin and VCC.The CDC capacitor may be either polarized or non
                      polarized with a 6.3V voltage rating.
  25    23      RT    Ring trip filter network.
  26    24     ILIM   Loop Current Limit programming resistor.
  27    25      SH    Switch hook detection threshold programming resistor.
  ---   26     SCC    Substrate Common Connection - Connect this pin to VBH Supply. This pin is used to connect the substrate of the die
                      and the thermal heatsink plane of the QFN package.
  28     27    RING   RING power amplifier output.

NOTES:
  1. JA is measured with the component mounted on a low effective thermal conductivity test board in free air. See Tech Brief TB379 for details.
  2. JA is measured in free air with the component mounted on a high effective thermal conductivity test board with “direct attach” features. JC, the
     “case temp” is measured at the center of the exposed metal pad on the package underside. See Tech Brief TB379.

NOTES:
  3. These parameters are controlled via design or process parameters and are not directly tested. These parameters are characterized upon initial
     design release and upon design changes which would affect these characteristics.
  4. Differential Ringing Gain is measured with VRS = 0.795VRMS for -100V devices, VRS = 0.663 VRMS for -85V devices and VRS = 0.575VRMS
     for -75V devices.
  5. Longitudinal Balance is tested per IEEE455-1985, with 368 per Tip and Ring terminal.
  6. These parameters are tested 100% at room temperature. These parameters are guaranteed not tested across temperature via statistical
     characterization and design.
  7. The power dissipation is based on actual device measurements and will be less than worst case calculations based on data sheet supply current
     limits.
  8. Characterized with 2 x 10s, and 10 x 1000s first level lightning surge waveforms (GR-1089-CORE)
  9. For Unbalanced Ringing the Tip terminal is offset to 0V and the Ring terminal is centered at Vbh/2 + 0.5V.
