TXPERD                                              Encoder.
                                                    If a parity error is detected, the character in error is replaced with a C0.7 character to force
                                                    a corresponding bad-character detection at the remote end of the link. This replacement
                                                    takes place regardless of the encoded/non-encoded state of the interface.
                                                    When BIST is enabled for the specific transmit channel, BIST progress is presented on

                                                    HIGH), the associated TXPERx signal will pulse HIGH for one transmit-character clock
                                                    period (if RXCKSEL= MID) or seventeen transmit- character clock periods (if RXCKSEL =
                                                    LOW or HIGH and Encoder is enabled) to indicate a complete pass through the BIST
                                                    sequence. Therefore, in this case TXPERx signal will pulse HIGH for one
                                                    transmit-character clock period.
                                                    These outputs also provide indication of a transmit Phase-align Buffer underflow or
                                                    overflow. When the transmit Phase-align Buffers are enabled (TXCKSEL  LOW, or
                                                    TXCKSEL = LOW and TXRATE = HIGH), if an underflow or overflow condition is detected,
                                                    TXPERx for the channel in error is asserted and remains asserted until either an atomic
                                                    Word Sync Sequence is transmitted or TXRST is sampled LOW to re-center the transmit

TXCTD[1:0]     selected TXCLKx or                  bypassed, these inputs are interpreted as data bits of 10-bit input character. When the
               REFCLK [4]                          Encoder is enabled, these inputs determine if the TXDx[7:0] character is encoded as Data,

TXDC[7:0]      sampled by the                       When the Encoder is enabled (TXMODE[1:0]  LOW), TXDx[7:0] specify the specific data

TXOPA          LVTTL Input,                         Transmit Path Odd Parity. When parity checking is enabled (PARCTL  LOW), the parity
TXOPB          synchronous,                         captured at these inputs is XORed with the data on the associated TXDx bus (and
TXOPC          internal pull-up,                    sometimes TXCT[1:0]) to verify the integrity of the captured character. See Table 2 for

SCSEL          LVTTL Input,                         Special Character Select. Used in some transmit modes along with TXCTx[1:0] to

               internal pull-down,                  are configured for independent input clocks (TXCKSEL = MID), SCSEL is captured relative
               sampled by                           to TXCLKA.

TXRST               LVTTL Input,                         Transmit Clock Phase Reset. Active LOW. When sampled LOW, the transmit
                    asynchronous,                        Phase-align Buffers are allowed to adjust their data-transfer timing (relative to the selected
                    internal pull-up,                    input clock) to allow clean transfer of data from the Input Register to the Encoder or
                    sampled by                           Transmit Shifter. When TXRST is sampled HIGH, the internal phase relationship between
                    REFCLK [4]                          the associated TXCLKx and the internal character-rate clock is fixed and the device
                                                         operates normally.
                                                         When configured for half-rate REFCLK sampling of the transmit character stream
                                                         (TXCKSEL = LOW and TXRATE = HIGH), assertion of TXRST is only used to clear
                                                         Phase-align buffer faults caused by highly asymmetric REFCLK periods or REFCLKs with
                                                         excessive cycle-to-cycle jitter. During this alignment period, one or more characters may
                                                         be added to or lost from all the associated transmit paths as the transmit Phase-align
                                                         Buffers are adjusted. TXRST must be sampled LOW by a minimum of two consecutive
                                                         rising edges REFCLK to ensure the reset operation is initiated correctly on all channels.
                                                         This input is ignored when both TXCKSEL and TXRATE are LOW, since the phase align
                                                         buffer is bypassed. In all other configurations, TXRST should be asserted during device
                                                         initialization to ensure proper operation of the Phase-align buffer. TXRST should be
                                                         asserted after the presence of a valid TXCLKx and after allowing enough time for the
                                                         TXPLL to lock to the reference clock (as specified by parameter tTXLOCK).
Transmit Path Clock and Clock Control
TXCKSEL             Three-level Select [5],              Transmit Clock Select. Selects the clock source, used to write data into the transmit Input
                    static control input                 Register of the transmit channel(s). When LOW, REFCLK [4] is used as the Input Register
                                                         clock for TXDx[7:0] and TXCTx[1:0] of all channels. When MID, TXCLKx is used as the
                                                         Input Register clock for TXDx[7:0] and TXCTx[1:0]. When HIGH, TXCLKA is used as the
                                                         Input Register clock for TXDx[7:0] and TXCTx[1:0] of all channels.
TXCLKO             LVTTL Output                         Transmit Clock Output. This true and complement output clock is synthesized by the
                                                         transmit PLL and is synchronous to the internal transmit character clock. It has the same
                                                         frequency as REFCLK (when TXRATE = LOW), or twice the frequency of REFCLK (when
                                                         TXRATE = HIGH). This output clock has no direct phase relationship to REFCLK.
TXRATE              LVTTL Input,                         Transmit PLL Clock Rate Select. When TXRATE = HIGH, the Transmit PLL multiplies
                    static control input,                REFCLK by 20 to generate the serial bit-rate clock. When TXRATE = LOW, the transmit
                    internal pull-down                   PLL multiples REFCLK by 10 to generate the serial bit-rate clock. See Table 11 for a list
                                                         of operating serial rates.
                                                         When REFCLK is selected to clock the receive parallel interfaces (RXCKSEL = LOW), the
                                                         TXRATE input also determines if the clocks on the RXCLKA and RXCLKC outputs are
                                                         full or half-rate. When TXRATE = HIGH (REFCLK is half-rate), the RXCLKA± and
                                                         RXCLKC± output clocks are also half-rate clocks and follow the frequency and duty cycle
                                                         of the REFCLK input. When TXRATE = LOW (REFCLK is full-rate), the RXCLKA± and
                                                         RXCLKC± output clocks are full-rate clocks and follow the frequency and duty cycle of the
                                                         REFCLK input.
                                                         When TXCKSEL = MID or HIGH (TXCLKx or TXCLKA selected to clock input register),
                                                         configuring TXRATE = HIGH (Half-rate REFCLK) is an invalid mode of operation.
TXCLKA              LVTTL Clock Input,                   Transmit Path Input Clocks. These clocks must be frequency-coherent to TXCLKO, but
TXCLKB              internal                             may be offset in phase. The internal operating phase of each input clock (relative to
TXCLKC              pull-down                            REFLCK or TXCLKO) is adjusted when TXRST = LOW and locked when TXRST = HIGH.
TXCLKD
Note
 5. Three-level select inputs are used for static configuration. They are ternary (not binary) inputs that make use of non-standard logic levels of LOW, MID, and HIGH.
    The LOW level is usually implemented by direct connection to VSS (ground). The HIGH level is usually implemented by direct connection to VCC. When not connected
    or allowed to float, a Three-level select input will self-bias to the MID level.
Transmit Path Mode Control
TXMODE[1:0] Three-level Select [5]                       Transmit Operating Mode. These inputs are interpreted to select one of nine operating
                    static control inputs                modes of the transmit path. See Table 3 for a list of operating modes.

Receive Path Data Signals
RXDA[7:0]    LVTTL Output,               Parallel Data Output. These outputs change following the rising edge of the selected
RXDB[7:0]    synchronous to the          receive interface clock.
RXDC[7:0]    selected RXCLKx output     When the Decoder is enabled (DECMODE = HIGH or MID), these outputs represent either
RXDD[7:0]    (or REFCLKinput[4]        received data or special characters. The status of the received data is represented by the
             when RXCKSEL = LOW)         values of RXSTx[2:0].
                                         When the Decoder is bypassed (DECMODE = LOW), RXDx[7:0] become the higher order
                                         bits of the 10-bit received character. See Table 18 for details.
RXSTA[2:0]   LVTTL Output,               Parallel Status Output. These outputs change following the rising edge of the selected
RXSTB[2:0]   synchronous to the          receive interface clock.
RXSTC[2:0]   selected RXCLKx output     When the Decoder is bypassed (DECMODE = LOW), RXSTx[1:0] become the two
RXSTD[2:0]   (or REFCLKinput[4]        low-order bits of the 10-bit received character, while RXSTx[2] = HIGH indicates the
             when RXCKSEL = LOW)         presence of a Comma character in the Output Register. See Table 18 for details.
                                         When the Decoder is enabled (DECMODE = HIGH or MID), RXSTx[2:0] provide status of
                                         the received signal. See Table 20, 21 and 22 for a list of Receive Character status.
RXOPA        three-state, LVTTL          Receive Path Odd Parity. When parity generation is enabled (PARCTL  LOW), the parity
RXOPB        Output, synchronous to output at these pins is valid for the data on the associated RXDx bus bits. When parity
RXOPC        the selected                generation is disabled (PARCTL = LOW) these output drivers are disabled (High-Z).
RXOPD        RXCLKx output
             (or REFCLKinput[4]
             when RXCKSEL = LOW)
Receive Path Clock and Clock Control
RXRATE       LVTTL Input, static control Receive Clock Rate Select. When LOW, the RXCLKx recovered clock outputs are
             input, internal pull-down complementary clocks operating at the recovered character rate. Data for the associated
                                         receive channels should be latched on the rising edge of RXCLKx+ or falling edge of
                                         RXCLKx–.
                                         When HIGH, the RXCLKx± recovered clock outputs are complementary clocks operating
                                         at half the character rate. Data for the associated receive channels should be latched
                                         alternately on the rising edge of RXCLKx+ and RXCLKx–.
                                         When REFCLK± is selected to clock the output registers (RXCKSELx = LOW), RXRATEx
                                         is not interpreted. The RXCLKA± and RXCLKC± output clocks will follow the frequency
                                         and duty cycle of REFCLK±.
FRAMCHAR Three-level Select [5],         Framing Character Select. Used to select the character or portion of a character used
             static control input        for character framing of the received data streams. When MID, the Framer looks for both
                                         positive and negative disparity versions of the eight-bit Comma character. When HIGH,
                                         the Framer looks for both positive and negative disparity versions of the K28.5 character.
                                         Configuring FRAMCHAR to LOW is reserved for component test.
RFEN         LVTTL Input,                Reframe Enable for All Channels. Active HIGH. When HIGH, the framers in all four
             asynchronous,               channels are enabled to frame per the presently enabled framing mode as selected by
             internal pull-down          RFMODE and selected framing character as selected by FRAMCHAR.
RXMODE[1:0] Three-level Select [5],      Receive Operating Mode. These inputs are interpreted to select one of nine operating
             static control inputs       modes of the receive path. See Table 14 for details.

  Pin Name     I/O Characteristics                                       Signal Description
RXCLKA     Three-state, LVTTL      Receive Character Clock Output or Clock Select Input. When configured such that all
RXCLKB     Output clock or static  output data paths are clocked by the recovered clock (RXCKSEL = MID), these true and
RXCLKC     control input           complement clocks are the receive interface clocks which are used to control timing of
RXCLKD                             output data (RXDx[7:0], RXSTx[2:0] and RXOPx). These clocks are output continuously
                                    at either the dual-character rate (1/20th the serial bit-rate) or character rate (1/10th the
                                    serial bit-rate) of the data being received, as selected by RXRATE.
                                    When configured such that all output data paths are clocked by REFCLK instead of a
                                    recovered clock (RXCKSEL = LOW), the RXCLKA and RXCLKC output drivers present
                                    a buffered and delayed form of REFCLK. RXCLKA and RXCLKC are buffered forms of
                                    REFCLK that are slightly different in phase. This phase difference allows the user to select
                                    the optimal setup/hold timing for their specific interface.
                                    When RXCKSEL = LOW and quad channel bonding is enabled, RXCLKB+ and RXCLKD+
                                    are static control inputs used to select the master channel for bonding and status control.
                                    When RXCKSEL = HIGH and quad-channel bonding is enabled, one of the recovered
                                    clocks from channels A, B, C or D can be selected to clock the bonded output data. The
                                    selection of the recovered clock is made by RXCLKB+ and RXCLKD+ which act as static
                                    control inputs in this mode. Both RXCLKA and RXCLKCoutput buffered forms of the
                                    recovered clock selected from receive channel A, B, C, or D. See Table 15 for details.
                                    When RXCKSEL = HIGH and dual-channel bonding is enabled, one of the recovered
                                    clocks from channels A or B is selected to present bonded data from channels A and B,
                                    and one of the recovered clocks from channels C or D is selected to present bonded data
                                    from channels C and D. RXCLKA output the recovered clock from either receive channel
                                    A or receive channel B as selected by RXCLKB+ to clock the bonded output data from
                                    channels A and B, and RXCLKC output the recovered clock from either receive channel
                                    C or receive channel D as selected by RXCLKD+ to the clock the bonded output data from
                                    channels C and D. See Table 16 for details.
RXCKSEL     Three-level Select [5], Receive Clock Mode. Selects the receive clock source used to transfer data to the Output
            static control input    Registers.
                                    When LOW, all four Output Registers are clocked by REFCLK. RXCLKBand RXCLKD
                                    outputs are disabled (High-Z), and RXCLKAand RXCLKC present buffered and delayed
                                    forms of REFCLK. This clocking mode is required for channel bonding across multiple
                                    devices.
                                    When MID, each RXCLKxoutput follows the recovered clock for the respective channel,
                                    as selected by RXRATE. When the 10B/8B Decoder and Elasticity Buffer are bypassed
                                    (DECMODE = LOW), RXCKSEL must be MID.
                                    When HIGH and channel bonding is enabled in dual-channel mode (RX modes 3 and 5),
                                    RXCLKA outputs the recovered clock from either receive channel A or B as selected by
                                    RXCLKB+, and RXCLKC outputs the recovered clock from either receive channel C or
                                    D as selected by RXCLKD+. These output clocks may operate at the character-rate or half
                                    the character-rate as selected by RXRATE.
                                    When HIGH and channel bonding is enabled in quad channel mode (RX modes 6 and 8),
                                    or if the receive channels are operated in independent mode (RX modes 0 and 2),
                                    RXCLKA and RXCLKC output the recovered clock from receive channel A, B, C, or D,
                                    as selected by RXCLKB+ and RXCLKD+. This output clock may operate at the
                                    character-rate or half the character-rate as selected by RXRATE.

                                  [5]
DECMODE      Three-level Select       , Decoder Mode Select. This input selects the behavior of the Decoder block. When LOW,
             static control input       the Decoder is bypassed and raw 10-bit characters are passed to the Output Register.
                                        When the Decoder is bypassed, RXCKSEL must be MID.
                                        When MID, the Decoder is enabled and the Cypress decoder table for Special Code
                                        characters is used.
                                        When HIGH, the Decoder is enabled and the alternate decoder table for Special Code
                                        characters is used. See Table 27 for a list of the Special Codes supported in both encoded
                                        modes.
RFMODE       Three-level Select [5],    Reframe Mode Select. Used to select the type of character framing used to adjust the
             static control input       character boundaries (based on detection of one or more framing characters in the
                                        received serial bit stream). This signal operates in conjunction with the presently enabled
                                        channel bonding mode, and the type of framing character selected.
                                        When LOW, the Low-Latency Framer is selected. This will frame on each occurrence of
                                        the selected framing character(s) in the received data stream. This mode of framing
                                        stretches the recovered character-rate clock for one or multiple cycles to align that clock
                                        with the recovered data.
                                        When MID, the Cypress-mode Multi-Byte parallel Framer is selected. This requires a pair
                                        of the selected framing character(s), on identical 10-bit boundaries, within a span of 50
                                        bits, before the character boundaries are adjusted. The recovered character clock remains
                                        in the same phase regardless of character offset.
                                        When HIGH, the alternate mode Multi-Byte parallel Framer is selected. This requires
                                        detection of the selected framing character(s) of the allowed disparities in the received
                                        serial bit stream, on identical 10-bit boundaries, on four directly adjacent characters. The
                                        recovered character clock remains in the same phase regardless of character offset.
 Device Control Signals
PARCTL       Three-level Select [5],    Parity Check/Generate Control. Used to control the different parity check and generate
             static control input       functions. When LOW, parity checking is disabled, and the RXOPx outputs are all disabled
                                        (High-Z). When MID, and the 8B/10B Encoder and Decoder are enabled
                                        (TXMODE[1]  LOW, DECMODE  LOW), TXDx[7:0] inputs are checked (along with
                                        TXOPx) for valid ODD parity, and ODD parity is generated for the RXDx[7:0] outputs and
                                        presented on RXOPx. When the Encoder and Decoder are disabled (TXMODE[1] LOW,
                                        DECMODE  LOW), theTXDx[7:0] and TXCTx[1:0] inputs are checked (along with
                                        TXOPx) for valid ODD parity, and ODD parity is generated for the RXDx[7:0] and
                                        RXSTx[1:0] outputs and presented on RXOPx. When HIGH, parity checking and gener-
                                        ation are enabled. The TXDx[7:0] and TXCTx[1:0] inputs are checked (along with TXOPx)
                                        for valid ODD parity, and ODD parity is generated for the RXDx[7:0] and RXSTx[2:0]
                                        outputs and presented on RXOPx. See Table 2 and 19 for details.
SPDSEL       Three-level Select [5]     Serial Rate Select. This input specifies the operating bit-rate range of both transmit and
             static control input       receive PLLs. LOW = 195–400 MBaud, MID = 400–800 MBaud, HIGH = 800–1500 MBaud.
                                        When SPDSEL is LOW, setting TXRATE = HIGH (Half-rate Reference Clock) is invalid.
TRSTZ        LVTTL Input,               Device Reset. Active LOW. Initializes all state machines and counters in the device. When
             internal pull-up           sampled LOW by the rising edge of REFCLK, this input resets the internal state machines
                                        and sets the Elasticity Buffer pointers to a nominal offset. When the reset is removed
                                        (TRSTZ sampled HIGH by REFCLK), the status and data outputs will become determin-
                                        istic in less than 16 REFCLK cycles. The BISTLE, OELE, and RXLE latches are reset by
                                        TRSTZ. If the Elasticity Buffer or the Phase-align Buffer are used, TRSTZ should be

REFCLK       Differential LVPECL or     Reference Clock. This clock input is used as the timing reference for the transmit PLL. It
              single-ended               is also used as the centering frequency of the Range Controller block of the Receive CDR
              LVTTL Input Clock          PLLs.This input clock may also be selected to clock the transmit and receive parallel
                                         interfaces. When driven by a single-ended LVCMOS or LVTTL clock source, connect the
                                         clock source to either the true or complement REFCLK input, and leave the alternate
                                         REFCLK input open (floating). When driven by an LVPECL clock source, the clock must
                                         be a differential clock, using both inputs. When TXCKSEL = LOW, REFCLK is also used
                                         as the clock for the parallel transmit data (input) interface. When RXCKSEL = LOW, the
                                         Elasticity Buffer is enabled and REFCLK is used as the clock for the parallel receive data
                                         (output) interface.
                                         If the Elasticity Buffer is used, framing characters will be inserted or deleted to/from the
                                         data stream to compensate for frequency differences between the reference clock and
                                         recovered clock. When an addition happens, a K28.5 will be appended immediately after
                                         a framing is detected in the Elasticity Buffer. When deletion happens, a framing character
                                         will be removed from the data stream when detected in the Elasticity Buffer.

INSELB        asynchronous               receiver Clock and Data Recovery circuit. When HIGH, the INx1 input is selected. When
INSELC                                   LOW, the INx2 input is selected.
INSELD
SDASEL        Three-level Select [5]     Signal Detect Amplitude Level Select. Allows selection of one of three predefined
              static configuration input amplitude trip points for a valid signal indication, as listed in Table 12.
LPEN          LVTTL Input,               All-Port Loop-Back Enable. Active HIGH. When asserted (HIGH), the transmit serial data
              asynchronous,              from each channel is internally routed to the associated receiver Clock and Data Recovery
              internal pull-down         (CAR) circuit. All enabled serial drivers are forced to differential logic “1.” All serial data
                                         inputs are ignored.
OELE          LVTTL Input,               Serial Driver Output Enable Latch Enable. Active HIGH. When OELE = HIGH, the
              asynchronous,              signals on the BOE[7:0] inputs directly control the OUTxy differential drivers. When the
              internal pull-up           BOE[x] input is HIGH, the associated OUTxy differential driver is enabled. When the
                                         BOE[x] input is LOW, the associated OUTxy differential driver is powered down. The
                                         specific mapping of BOE[7:0] signals to transmit output enables is listed in Table 10. When
                                         OELE returns LOW, the last values present on BOE[7:0] are captured in the internal Output
                                         Enable Latch. If the device is reset (TRSTZ is sampled LOW), the latch is reset to disable

BISTLE      LVTTL Input,              Transmit and Receive BIST Latch Enable. Active HIGH. When BISTLE = HIGH, the
            asynchronous,             signals on the BOE[7:0] inputs directly control the transmit and receive BIST enables.
            internal pull-up          When the BOE[x] input is LOW, the associated transmit or receive channel is configured
                                      to generate or compare the BIST sequence respectively. When the BOE[x] input is HIGH,
                                      the associated transmit or receive channel is configured for normal data transmission or
                                      reception. The specific mapping of BOE[7:0] signals to transmit and receive BIST enables
                                      is listed in Table 10. When BISTLE returns LOW, the last values present on BOE[7:0] are
                                      captured in the internal BIST Enable Latch. When the latch is closed, if the device is reset
                                      (TRSTZ is sampled LOW), the latch is reset to disable BIST on all transmit and receive
                                      channels.
RXLE        LVTTL Input,              Receive Channel Power-control Latch Enable. Active HIGH. When RXLE = HIGH, the
            asynchronous,             signals on the BOE[7:0] inputs directly control the power enables for the receive PLLs and
            internal pull-up          analog circuitry. When the BOE[7:0] input is HIGH, the associated receive channel A
                                      through D PLL and analog circuitry are active. When the BOE[7:0] input is LOW, the
                                      associated receive channel A through D PLL and analog circuitry are powered down. The
                                      specific mapping of BOE[7:0] signals to the associated receive channel enables is listed
                                      in Table 10. When RXLE returns LOW, the last values present on BOE[7:0] are captured
                                      in the internal RX PLL Enable Latch. When the device is reset (TRSTZ = LOW), the latch
                                      is reset to disable all receive channels.
BOE[7:0]    LVTTL Input,              BIST, Serial Output, and Receive Channel Enables. These inputs are passed to and
            asynchronous,             through the Output Enable Latch when OELE is HIGH, and captured in this latch when
            internal pull-up          OELE returns LOW. These inputs are passed to and through the BIST Enable Latch when
                                      BISTLE is HIGH, and captured in this latch when BISTLE returns LOW. These inputs are
                                      passed to and through the Receive Channel Enable Latch when RXLE is HIGH, and
                                      captured in this latch when RXLE returns LOW.

                                      of the bonding domain to the slave devices of the same bonding domain. These outputs
                                      change at the same character rate as the receive output data buses, but are connected
                                      only to all the slave CYP(V)15G0401DXB devices. When MASTER = LOW, these are
                                      output signals and present the Elasticity Buffer status from the selected master receive
                                      channel of the device configured as the master. Receive master channel selection is
                                      performed using the RXCLKB+ and RXCLKD+ inputs. The BONDST[1:0] Outputs of the
                                      master device must be connected to BONDST[1:0] Inputs of all the slave devices in the
                                      bonding domain. These status outputs indicate one of four possible conditions, on a
                                      synchronous basis, to the slave devices. These conditions are:
                                      00—Reserved
                                      01—Add one K28.5 immediately following the next framing character received
                                      10—Delete next framing character received
                                      11—Normal data.
                                      These outputs are driven only when the device is configured as a master, all four channels
                                      are bonded together, and the receive parallel interface is clocked by REFCLK.

Notes
 12. REFCLK has no phase or frequency relationship with the recovered clock(s) and only acts as a centering reference to reduce clock synchronization time. REFCLK
     must be within ±1500 PPM (±0.15%) of the remote transmitter’s PLL reference (REFCLK) frequency. Although transmitting to a HOTLink II receiver necessitates the
     frequency difference between the transmitter and receiver reference clocks to be within ±1500-PPM, the stability of the crystal needs to be within the limits specified

     have a sign-wave appearance (highest transition density with repeating 0101...). Signal peak amplitudes levels within this environment type could increase the values
     in the table above by approximately 100 mV.

Notes
 15. The standard definition of a Comma contains only seven bits. However, since all valid Comma characters within the 8B/10B character set also have the eighth bit as
     an inversion of the seventh bit, the compare pattern is extended to a full eight bits to reduce the possibility of a framing error.
 16. When Receive BIST is enabled on a channel, the Low-Latency Framer must not be enabled. The BIST sequence contains an aliased K28.5 framing character, which
     would cause the Receiver to update its character boundaries incorrectly.

  22. This is the minimum difference in voltage between the true and complement inputs required to ensure detection of a logic-1 or logic-0. A logic-1 exists when the true
      (+) input is more positive than the complement () input. A logic-0 exists when the complement () input is more positive than true (+) input.
  23. The common mode range defines the allowable range of REFCLK+ and REFCLKwhen REFCLK+ = REFCLK. This marks the zero-crossing between the true and
      complement inputs as the signal switches between a logic-1 and a logic-0.

Notes
 24. The common mode range defines the allowable range of INPUT+ and INPUTwhen INPUT+ = INPUT. This marks the zero-crossing between the true and comple-
     ment inputs as the signal switches between a logic-1 and a logic-0.
 25. Not applicable for AC-coupled interfaces. For AC-coupled interfaces, VDIFFS requirement still needs to be satisfied.
 26. Maximum ICC is measured with VCC = MAX, RXCKSEL = LOW, with all TX and RX channels and Serial Line Drivers enabled, sending a continuous alternating 01
     pattern to the associated receive channel, and outputs unloaded.
 27. Typical ICC is measured under similar conditions except with VCC = 3.3 V, TA = 25°C, RXCKSEL = LOW, with all TX and RX channels enabled and one Serial Line
     Driver per transmit channel sending a continuous alternating 01 pattern to the associated receive channel. The redundant outputs on each channel are powered down
     and the parallel outputs are unloaded.
 28. Cypress uses constant current (ATE) load configurations and forcing functions. This figure is for reference only. 5-pF differential load reflects tester capacitance, and
     is recommended at low data rates only.
 29. The LVTTL switching threshold is 1.4 V. All timing references are made relative to the point where the signal edges crosses the threshold voltage.
 30. Tested initially and after any design or process changes that may affect these parameters, but not 100% tested.

Notes
  31. The ratio of rise time to falling time must not vary by greater than 2:1.
  32. For a given operating frequency, neither rise or fall specification can be greater than 20% of the clock-cycle period or the data sheet maximum time.
  33. Parallel data output specifications are only valid if all inputs or outputs are loaded with similar DC and AC loads.
  34. The duty cycle specification is a simultaneous condition with the tREFH and tREFL parameters. This means that at faster character rates the REFCLK duty cycle
      cannot be as large as 30% – 70%.
  35. Since this timing parameter is greater than the minimum time period of REFCLK it sets an upper limit to the frequency in which REFCLKx can be used to clock the
      receive data out of the output register. For predictable timing, users can use this parameter only if REFCLK period is greater than sum of tRREFDA and set-up time
      of the upstream device. When this condition is not true, RXCLKC± or RXCLKA± (a buffered or delayed version of REFCLK when RXCKSELx = LOW) could be used
      to clock the receive data out of the device.

Notes
  36. While sending continuous K28.5s, outputs loaded to a balanced 100 load, measured at the cross point of differential outputs, over the operating range.
  37. While sending continuous K28.7s, after 100,000 samples measured at the cross point of differential outputs, time referenced to REFCLK input, over the operating
      range.
  38. Total jitter is calculated at an assumed BER of 1E –12. Hence: total jitter (tJ) = (tRJ * 14) + tDJ.
  39. Also meets all Jitter Generation and Jitter Tolerance requirements as specified by SMPTE 259M, SMPTE 292M, CPRI, ESCON, FICON, Fibre Channel and DVB-ASI.
  40. Receiver UI (Unit Interval) is calculated as 1/(fREF * 20) (when RXRATE = HIGH) or 1/(fREF * 10) (when RXRATE = LOW) if no data is being received, or 1/(fREF *
      20) (when RXRATE = HIGH) or 1/(fREF * 10) (when RXRATE = LOW) of the remote transmitter if data is being received. In an operating link this is equivalent to tB.

        RXCLKC
Notes
 41. When REFCLK is configured for half-rate operation (TXRATE = HIGH) and data is captured using REFCLK instead of a TXCLKx clock (TXCKSEL = LOW), data is
     captured using both the rising and falling edges of REFCLK.
 42. The TXCLKO output is at twice the rate of REFCLK when TXRATE = HIGH and same rate as REFCLK when TXRATE = LOW. TXCLKO does not follow the duty
     cycle of REFCLK.
 43. The rising edge of TXCLKO output has no direct phase relationship to the REFCLK input.

 Notes
  44. RXCLKA and RXCLKC are delayed in phase from REFCLK, and are different in phase from each other.
  45. When operated with a half-rate REFCLK, the setup and hold specifications for data relative to RXCLKA and RXCLKC are relative to both rising and falling edges of
      the respective clock output.

Notes
 46. All codes not shown are reserved.
 47. Notation for Special Character Code Name is consistent with Fibre Channel and ESCON naming conventions. Special Character Code Name is intended to describe
     binary information present on I/O pins. Common usage for the name can either be in the form used for describing Data patterns (i.e., C0.0 through C31.7), or in hex
     notation (i.e., Cnn where nn = the specified value between 00 and FF).
 48. Both the Cypress and alternate encodings may be used for data transmission to generate specific Special Character Codes. The decoding process for received
     characters generates Cypress codes or Alternate codes as selected by the DECMODE configuration input.
 49. These characters are used for control of ESCON interfaces. They can be sent as embedded commands or other markers when not operating using ESCON protocols.
 50. The K28.5 character is used for framing operations by the receiver. It is also the pad or fill character transmitted to maintain the serial link when no user data is available.
 51. Care must be taken when using this Special Character code. When a K28.7(C7.0) or SVS(C0.7) is followed by a D11.x or D20.x, an alias K28.5 sync character is
     created. These sequences can cause erroneous framing and should be avoided while RFEN = HIGH.
 52. C2.1 = Transmit either K28.5+ or +K28.5 as determined by Current RD and modify the Transmission Character that follows, by setting its least significant bit to 1
     or 0. If Current RD at the start of the following character is plus (+) the LSB is set to 0, and if Current RD is minus () the LSB becomes 1. This modification allows
     construction of X3.230 “EOF” frame delimiters wherein the second data byte is determined by the Current RD.
     For example, to send “EOFdt” the controller could issue the sequence C2.1D21.4 D21.4D21.4, and the HOTLink IITransmitter will send either
     K28.5D21.4D21.4D21.4 or K28.5D21.5 D21.4D21.4 based on Current RD. Likewise to send “EOFdti” the controller could issue the sequence
     C2.1D10.4D21.4D21.4, and the HOTLink II Transmitter will send either K28.5D10.4D21.4 D21.4 or K28.5D10.5D21.4 D21.4 based on Current RD.
     The receiver will never output this Special Character, since K28.5 is decoded as C5.0, C1.7, or C2.7, and the subsequent bytes are decoded as data.
 53. C0.7 = Transmit a deliberate code rule violation. The code chosen for this function follows the normal Running Disparity rules. The receiver will only output this Special
     Character if the Transmission Character being decoded is not found in the tables.
 54. C1.7 = Transmit Negative K28.5 (K28.5+) disregarding Current RD. The receiver will only output this Special Character if K28.5 is received with the wrong running
     disparity. The receiver will output C1.7 if K28.5 is received with RD+, otherwise K28.5 is decoded as C5.0 or C2.7.
 55. C2.7 = Transmit Positive K28.5 (+K28.5) disregarding Current RD. The receiver will only output this Special Character if K28.5 is received with the wrong running
     disparity. The receiver will output C2.7 if +K28.5 is received with RD, otherwise K28.5 is decoded as C5.0 or C1.7.
 56. C4.7 = Transmit a deliberate code rule violation to indicate a Running Disparity violation. The receiver will only output this Special Character if the Transmission
     Character being decoded is found in the tables, but Running Disparity does not match. This might indicate that an error occurred in a prior byte.
 57. Supported only for data transmission. The receive status for these conditions will be reported by specific combinations of receive status bits.
