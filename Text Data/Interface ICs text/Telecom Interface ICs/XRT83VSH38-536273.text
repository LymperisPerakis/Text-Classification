                          This pin is used to enable the receivers for all channels. By default, the receivers
                          are turned ON in hardware mode. To turn the receivers OFF, pull this pin "Low".
                          NOTE: Internally pulled "High" with a 50k resistor.
    RLOS0      C3     O   Receive Loss of Signal
    RLOS1      H4         When a receive loss of signal occurs according to ITU-T G.775, the RLOS pin will go
    RLOS2     H15         "High" for a minimum of one RCLK cycle. RLOS will remain "High" until the loss of
    RLOS3     A16         signal condition clears. See the Receive Loss of Signal section of this datasheet for
                          more details.

    RCLK0      B3     O   Receive Clock Output
    RCLK1      H3         RCLK is the recovered clock from the incoming data stream. If the incoming signal
    RCLK2     H16         is absent or RTIP/RRING are in "High-Z", RCLK maintains its timing by using an
    RCLK3     A17         internal master clock as its reference. RPOS/RNEG data can be updated on either
                          edge of RCLK selected by RCLKE.

  RNEG/LCV2   H18         this pin is a Line Code Violation / Overflow indicator Indicator. If LCV is selected by
  RNEG/LCV3   B16         software and if a line code violation, a bi-polar violation, or excessive zeros occur,
                          the LCV_OF pin will pull "High" for a minimum of one RCLK cycle. LCV_OF will
  RNEG/LCV4    T4
                          remain "High" until there are no more violations. However, if OF (Overflow) is
  RNEG/LCV5    M4         selected, then the LCV_OF pin will pull "High" if the internal LCV counter is satu-
  RNEG/LCV6   M16         rated. The LCV_OF pin will remain "High" until the LCV counter is reset.

                         This pin is AND-ed with each of the RLOS functions on a per channel basis. There-
                         fore, if this pin is pulled "High" and a given channel experiences a loss of signal, then
                         the RPOS/RNEG output pins are automatically pulled "Low" to prevent data chatter-
                         ing. To disable this feature, the RxMUTE pin must be pulled "Low".
                         NOTE: This pin is internally pulled “High” with a 50k resistor
   RXRES1     R10     I  Receive External Resistor Control Pins
   RXRES0     V10        Hardware mode Only
                         These pins are used in the Receive Internal Impedance mode for unique applica-
                         tions where an accurate resistor can be used to achieve optimal return loss. When
                         RxRES[1:0] are used, the LIU automatically sets the internal impedance to match
                         the line build out. For example: if 240 is selected, the LIU chooses an internal
                         impedance such that the parallel combination equals the impedance chosen by
                         TERSEL[1:0].

                         NOTE: These pins are internally pulled “Low” with a 50k resistor. This feature is
                                    available in Host mode by programming the appropriate channel register.

                         the receiver on the RPOS/RNEG outputs. By default, data is updated on the risinge
                         edge. To udpdate data on the falling edge, this pin must be pulled "High".
                         Host Mode
                         PTS[2:1] pins are used to select the type of microprocessor to be used for Host

     TCLK0     B4     I  Transmit Clock Input
     TCLK1     A3        TCLK is the input facility clock used to sample the incoming TPOS/TNEG data. If
     TCLK2    A15        TCLK is absent, pulled "Low", or pulled "High", the transmitter outputs at TTIP/
     TCLK3    C14        TRING sends an all zero signal to the line. TPOS/TNEG data can be sampled on
                         either edge of TCLK selected by TCLKE.

                          This pin is used to match the frequency characteristics according to the gauge of
                          wire used in Telecom circuits. By default, the LIU is matched to 22 gauge or 24
                          gauge wire. To select 26 gauge, this pin must be pulled "High".

                          This pin is used to control the data format on the facility side of the LIU to interface to
                          a Framer or Mapper/ASIC device. By default, dual rail mode is selected which relies
                          upon the Framer to handle the encoding/decoding functions. To select single rail
                          mode, this pin must be pulled "High". If single rail mode is selected, the LIU can
                          encode/decode AMI or B8ZS/HDB3 data formats.

                          the receive path. By default, the receivers are configured for external impedance
                          mode, which is ideal for redundancy applications without relays. To select internal
                          impedance, this pin must be pulled "HIgh".
                          Host Mode
                          Internal/External impedance can be selected by programming the appropriate chan-
                          nel registers. However, to assist in redundancy applications, this pin can be used for
                          a hard switch if the RxTCNTL bit is set "High" in the appropriate global register. If
                          RxTCNTL is set "High", the individual RxTSEL register bits are ignored.

FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The XRT83VSH38 is a fully integrated 8-channel short-haul line interface unit (LIU) that operates from a 1.8V
and a 3.3V power supply. Using internal termination, the LIU provides one bill of materials to operate in T1, E1,
or J1 mode with minimum external components. The LIU features are programmed through a standard
microprocessor interface or controlled through Hardware mode. EXAR’s LIU has patented high impedance
circuits that allow the transmitter outputs and receiver inputs to be high impedance when experiencing a power
failure or when the LIU is powered off. Key design features within the LIU optimize 1:1 or 1+1 redundancy and
non-intrusive monitoring applications to ensure reliability without using relays. The on-chip clock synthesizer
generates T1/E1/J1 clock rates from a selectable external clock frequency and outputs a clock reference of the
line rate chosen. Additional features include RLOS, a 16-bit LCV counter for each channel, AIS, QRSS
generation/detection, Network Loop Code generation/detection, TAOS, DMO, and diagnostic loopback modes.
  1.0 HARDWARE MODE VS HOST MODE

 2.0 MASTER CLOCK GENERATOR
Using external clock sources, the on-chip frequency synthesizer generates the T1 (1.544MHz) or E1
(2.048MHz) master clocks necessary for the transmit pulse shaping and receive clock recovery circuit. There
are two master clock inputs MCLKE1 and MCLKT1. In systems where both T1 and E1 master clocks are
available these clocks can be connected to the respective pins. All channels of a given XRT83VSH38 must be
operated at the same clock rate, either T1, E1 or J1 modes. In systems that have only one master clock
source available (E1 or T1), that clock should be connected to both MCLKE1 and MCLKT1 inputs for proper
operation.

 3.0 RECEIVE PATH LINE INTERFACE
The receive path of the XRT83VSH38 LIU consists of 8 independent T1/E1/J1 receivers. The following section
describes the complete receive path from RTIP/RRING inputs to RCLK/RPOS/RNEG outputs. A simplified
block diagram of the receive path is shown in Figure 5.

 3.1     Line Termination (RTIP/RRING)
  3.1.1     CASE 1: Internal Termination
The input stage of the receive path accepts standard T1/E1/J1 twisted pair or E1 coaxial cable inputs through
RTIP and RRING. The physical interface is optimized by placing the terminating impedance inside the LIU.
This allows one bill of materials for all modes of operation reducing the number of external components
necessary in system design. The receive termination impedance is selected by programming TERSEL[1:0] to
match the line impedance. Selecting the internal impedance is shown in Table 3.

                                               1h (01)                                      110
                                               2h (10)                                        75

The XRT83VSH38 has the ability to switch the internal termination to "High" impedance by programming
RxTSEL in the appropriate channel register. For internal termination, set RxTSEL to "1". By default, RxTSEL
is set to "0" ("High" impedance). For redundancy applications, a dedicated hardware pin (RxTSEL) is also
available to control the receive termination for all channels simultaneously. This hardware pin takes priority
over the register setting if RxTCNTL is set to "1" in the appropriate global register. If RxTCNTL is set to "0", the
state of this pin is ignored. See Figure 6 for a typical connection diagram using the internal termination.

  3.1.2     CASE 2: Internal Termination With One External Fixed Resistor for All Modes
Along with the internal termination, a high precision external fixed resistor can be used to optimize the return
loss. This external resistor can be used for all modes of operation ensuring one bill of materials. There are
three resistor values that can be used by setting the RxRES[1:0] bits in the appropriate channel register.
Selecting the value for the external fixed resistor is shown in Table 4.

By default, RxRES[1:0] is set to "None" for no external fixed resistor. If an external fixed resistor is used, the
XRT83VSH38 uses the parallel combination of the external fixed resistor and the internal termination as the
input impedance. See Figure 7 for a typical connection diagram using the external fixed resistor.
NOTE: Without the external resistor, the XRT83VSH38 meets all return loss specifications. This mode was created to add
        flexibility for optimizing return loss by using a high precision external resistor.

 3.2      Clock and Data Recovery
The receive clock (RCLK) is recovered by the clock and data recovery circuitry. An internal PLL locks on the
incoming data stream and outputs a clock that’s in phase with the incoming signal. This allows for multi-
channel T1/E1/J1 signals to arrive from different timing sources and remain independent. In the absence of an
incoming signal, RCLK maintains its timing by using the internal master clock as its reference. The recovered
data can be updated on either edge of RCLK. By default, data is updated on the rising edge of RCLK. To
update data on the falling edge of RCLK, set RCLKE to "1" in the appropriate global register. Figure 8 is a
timing diagram of the receive data updated on the rising edge of RCLK. Figure 9 is a timing diagram of the
receive data updated on the falling edge of RCLK. The timing specifications are shown in Table 5.

To meet short haul requirements, the XRT83VSH38 can accept T1/E1/J1 signals that have been attenuated by
12dB of flat loss in E1 mode or by 655 feet of cable loss along with 6dB of flat loss in T1 mode. However, the
XRT83VSH38 can tolerate cable loss and flat loss beyond the industry specifications. The receive sensitivity
in the short haul mode is approximately 4,000 feet without experiencing bit errors, LOF, pattern
synchronization, etc. Although data integrity is maintained, the RLOS function (if enabled) will report an RLOS
condition according to the receiver loss of signal section in this datasheet. The test configuration for
measuring the receive sensitivity is shown in Figure 10.

  3.2.3        General Alarm Detection and Interrupt Generation
The receive path detects RLOS, AIS, QRPD and FLS. These alarms can be individually masked to prevent the
alarm from triggering an interrupt. To enable interrupt generation, the Global Interrupt Enable (GIE) bit must be
set "High" in the appropriate global register. Any time a change in status occurs (it the alarms are enabled), the
interrupt pin will pull "Low" to indicate an alarm has occurred. Once the status registers have been read, the
INT pin will return "High". The status registers are Reset Upon Read (RUR). The interrupts are categorized in
a hierarchical process block. Figure 12 is a simplified block diagram of the interrupt generation process.

REV. 1.2.0                                         8-CHANNEL T1/E1/J1 SHORT-HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT
  3.2.3.1       RLOS (Receiver Loss of Signal)
The XRT83VSH38 supports both G.775 or ETSI-300-233 RLOS detection scheme.
In G.775 mode, RLOS is declared when the received signal is less than 375mV for 32 consecutive pulse
periods (typical). The device clears RLOS when the receive signal achieves 12.5% ones density with no more
than 15 consecutive zeros in a 32 bit sliding window and the signal level exceeds 425mV (typical).
In ETSI-300-233 mode the device declares RLOS when the input level drops below 375mV (typical) for more
than 2048 pulse periods (1msec).
The device exits RLOS when the input signal exceeds 425mV (typical) and has transitions for more than 32
pulse periods with 12.5% ones density with no more than 15 consecutive zero’s in a 32 bit sliding window.
ETSI-300-233 RLOS detection method is only available in Host mode.
In T1 mode RLOS is declared when the received signal is less than 320mV for 175 consecutive pulse period
(typical). The device clears RLOS when the receive signal achieves 12.5% ones density with no more than 100
consecutive zeros in a 128 bit sliding window and the signal level exceeds 425mV (typical).
  3.2.3.2       EXLOS (Extended Loss of Signal)
By enabling the extended loss of signal by programming the appropriate channel register, the digital RLOS is
extended to count 4,096 consecutive zeros before declaring RLOS in T1 and E1 mode. By default, EXLOS is
disabled and RLOS operates in normal mode.
  3.2.3.3       AIS (Alarm Indication Signal)
The XRT83VSH38 adheres to the ITU-T G.775 specification for an all ones pattern. The alarm indication
signal is set to "1" if an all ones pattern (at least 99.9% ones density) is present for T, where T is 3ms to 75ms
in T1 mode. AIS will clear when the ones density is not met within the same time period T. In E1 mode, the
AIS is set to "1" if the incoming signal has 2 or less zeros in a 512-bit window. AIS will clear when the incoming
signal has 3 or more zeros in the 512-bit window.
  3.2.3.4       FLSD (FIFO Limit Status Detection)
The purpose of the FIFO limit status is to indicate when the Read and Write FIFO pointers are within a pre-
determined range (over-flow or under-flow indication). The FLSD is set to "1" if the FIFO Read and Write
Pointers are within ±3-Bits.
  3.2.3.5       LCV (Line Code Violation)
The LIU contains 8 independent, 16-bit LCV counters. When the counters reach full-scale, they remain
saturated at FFFFh until they are reset globally or on a per channel basis. For performance monitoring, the
counters can be updated globally or on a per channel basis to place the contents of the counters into holding
registers. The LIU uses an indirect address bus to access a counter for a given channel. Once the contents of
the counters have been placed in holding registers, they can be individually read out 8-bits at a time according
to the BYTEsel bit in the appropriate global register. By default, the LSB is placed in the holding register until
the BYTEsel is pulled "High" where upon the MSB will be placed in the holding register for read back. Once
both bytes have been read, the next channel may be selected for read back.
By default, the LCV_OFD will be set to a "1" if the receiver is currently detecting line code violations or
excessive zeros for HDB3 (E1 mode) or B8ZS (T1 mode). In AMI mode, the LCV_OFD will be set to a "1" if the
receiver is currently detecting bipolar violations or excessive zeros. However, if the LIU is configured to
monitor the 16-bit LCV counter through software, the LCV_OFD will be set to a "1" if the counter saturates.
 3.3      Receive Jitter Attenuator
The receive path has a dedicated jitter attenuator that reduces phase and frequency jitter in the recovered
clock. The jitter attenuator uses a data FIFO (First In First Out) with a programmable depth of 32-bit or 64-bit.
If the LIU is used for line synchronization (loop timing systems), the JA should be enabled. When the Read
and Write pointers of the FIFO are within 2-Bits of over-flowing or under-flowing, the bandwidth of the jitter
attenuator is widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. When this condition
occurs, the jitter attenuator will not attenuate input jitter until the Read/Write pointer’s position is outside the 2-
                                                            24

Bit window. In T1 mode, the bandwidth of the JA is always set to 3Hz. In E1 mode, the bandwidth is
programmable to either 10Hz or 1.5Hz (1.5Hz automatically selects the 64-Bit FIFO depth). The JA has a
clock delay equal to ½ of the FIFO bit depth.
NOTE: If the LIU is used in a multiplexer/mapper application where stuffing bits are typically removed, the transmit path has
        a dedicated jitter attenuator to smooth out the gapped clock. See the Transmit Section of this datasheet.
 3.4     HDB3/B8ZS Decoder
In single rail mode, RPOS can decode AMI or HDB3/B8ZS signals. For E1 mode, HDB3 is defined as any
block of 4 successive zeros replaced with 000V or B00V, so that two successive V pulses are of opposite
polarity to prevent a DC component. In T1 mode, 8 successive zeros are replaced with OOOVBOVB. If the
HDB3/B8ZS decoder is selected, the receive path removes the V and B pulses so that the original data is
output to RPOS.
 3.5     RPOS/RNEG/RCLK
The digital output data can be programmed to either single rail or dual rail formats. Figure 13 is a timing
diagram of a repeating "0011" pattern in single-rail mode. Figure 14 is a timing diagram of the same fixed
pattern in dual rail mode.

 3.6     RxMUTE (Receiver LOS with Data Muting)
The receive muting function can be selected by setting RxMUTE to "1" in the appropriate global register. If
selected, any channel that experiences an RLOS condition will automatically pull RPOS and RNEG "Low" to
prevent data chattering. If RLOS does not occur, the RxMUTE will remain inactive until an RLOS on a given
channel occurs. The default setting for RxMUTE is "0" which is disabled. A simplified block diagram of the
RxMUTE function is shown in Figure 15.

 4.0 TRANSMIT PATH LINE INTERFACE

 4.1     TCLK/TPOS/TNEG Digital Inputs
In dual rail mode, TPOS and TNEG are the digital inputs for the transmit path. In single rail mode, TNEG has
no function and can be left unconnected. The XRT83VSH38 can be programmed to sample the inputs on
either edge of TCLK. By default, data is sampled on the falling edge of TCLK. To sample data on the rising
edge of TCLK, set TCLKE to "1" in the appropriate global register. Figure 17 is a timing diagram of the
transmit input data sampled on the falling edge of TCLK. Figure 18 is a timing diagram of the transmit input
data sampled on the rising edge of TCLK. The timing specifications are shown in Table 6.

 4.2     HDB3/B8ZS Encoder
In single rail mode, the LIU can encode the TPOS input signal to AMI or HDB3/B8ZS data. In E1 mode and
HDB3 encoding selected, any sequence with four or more consecutive zeros in the input will be replaced with
000V or B00V, where "B" indicates a pulse conforming to the bipolar rule and "V" representing a pulse violating
the rule. An example of HDB3 encoding is shown in Table 7. In T1 mode and B8ZS encoding selected, an

XRT83VSH38
8-CHANNEL T1/E1/J1 SHORT-HAUL LINE INTERFACE UNIT                                                           REV. 1.2.0
 4.3     Transmit Jitter Attenuator
The XRT83VSH38 LIU is ideal for multiplexer or mapper applications where the network data crosses multiple
timing domains. As the higher data rates are de-multiplexed down to T1 or E1 data, stuffing bits are typically
removed which can leave gaps in the incoming data stream. The transmit path has a dedicated jitter
attenuator with a 32-Bit or 64-Bit FIFO that is used to smooth the gapped clock into a steady T1 or E1 output.
The maximum gap width of the 8-channel LIU is shown in Table 9.
                      TABLE 9: MAXIMUM GAP WIDTH FOR MULTIPLEXER/MAPPER APPLICATIONS
                                   FIFO DEPTH                     MAXIMUM GAP WIDTH
                                      32-Bit                             9 UI
                                      64-Bit                             9 UI
NOTE: If the LIU is used in a loop timing system, the receive path has a dedicated jitter attenuator. See the Receive
        Section of this datasheet.
 4.4     TAOS (Transmit All Ones)
The XRT83VSH38 has the ability to transmit all ones on a per channel basis by programming the appropriate
channel register. This function takes priority over the digital data present on the TPOS/TNEG inputs. For
example: If a fixed "0011" pattern is present on TPOS in single rail mode and TAOS is enabled, the transmitter
will output all ones. In addition, if digital or dual loopback is selected, the data on the RPOS output will be
equal to the data on the TPOS input. Figure 19 is a diagram showing the all ones signal at TTIP and TRING.

 4.5     Transmit Diagnostic Features
In addition to TAOS, the XRT83VSH38 offers diagnostic features for analyzing network integrity such as
ATAOS and QRSS on a per channel basis by programming the appropriate registers. These diagnostic
features take priority over the digital data present on TPOS/TNEG inputs. The transmitters will send the
diagnostic code to the line and will be maintained in the digital loopback if selected. When the LIU is
responsible for sending diagnostic patterns, the LIU is automatically placed in the single rail mode.
  4.5.1    ATAOS (Automatic Transmit All Ones)
If ATAOS is selected by programming the appropriate global register, an AMI all ones signal will be transmitted
for each channel that experiences an RLOS condition. If RLOS does not occur, the ATAOS will remain inactive
until an RLOS on a given channel occurs. A simplified block diagram of the ATAOS function is shown in
Figure 20.

  4.5.2     QRSS/PRBS Generation
The XRT83VSH38 can transmit a QRSS/PRBS random sequence to a remote location from TTIP/TRING. The
polynomial is shown in Table 10.

  4.5.3     T1 Short Haul Line Build Out (LBO)
The short haul transmitter output pulses are generated using a 7-Bit internal DAC (6-Bit plus the MSB sign bit).
The line build out can be set to interface to five different ranges of cable attenuation by programming the
appropriate channel register. The pulse shape is divided into eight discrete time segments which are set to
fixed values to comply with the pulse template. To program the eight segments individually to optimize a
special line build out, see the arbitrary pulse section of this datasheet. The short haul LBO settings are shown
in Table 11.

  4.5.4     Arbitrary Pulse Generator For T1 and E1
The arbitrary pulse generator divides the pulse into eight individual segments. Each segment is set by a 7-Bit
binary word by programming the appropriate channel register. This allows the system designer to set the
overshoot, amplitude, and undershoot for a unique line build out. The MSB (bit 7) is a sign-bit. If the sign-bit is
set to "0", the segment will move in a positive direction relative to a flat line (zero) condition. If this sign-bit is
set to "1", the segment will move in a negative direction relative to a flat line condition. The resolution of the
DAC is typically 45mV per LSB. Thus, writing 7-bit = 1111111 will clamp the output at either voltage rail
corresponding to a maximum amplitude. A pulse with numbered segments is shown in Figure 21.

NOTE: By default, the arbitrary segments are programmed to 0x00h. The transmitter outputs will result in an all zero
         pattern to the line interface.
 4.6      DMO (Digital Monitor Output)
The driver monitor circuit is used to detect transmit driver failures by monitoring the activities at TTIP/TRING
outputs. Driver failure may be caused by a short circuit in the primary transformer or system problems at the
transmit inputs. If the transmitter of a channel has no output for more than 128 clock cycles, DMO goes "High"
until a valid transmit pulse is detected. If the DMO interrupt is enabled, the change in status of DMO will cause
the interrupt pin to go "Low". Once the status register is read, the interrupt pin will return "High" and the status
register will be reset (RUR).
 4.7      Line Termination (TTIP/TRING)
The output stage of the transmit path generates standard return-to-zero (RZ) signals to the line interface for T1/
E1/J1 twisted pair or E1 coaxial cable. The physical interface is optimized by placing the terminating
impedance inside the LIU. This allows one bill of materials for all modes of operation reducing the number of
external components necessary in system design. The transmitter outputs only require one DC blocking
capacitor of 0.68F. For redundancy applications (or simply to tri-state the transmitters), set TxTSEL to a "1" in
the appropriate channel register. A typical transmit interface is shown in Figure 22.

 5.0 T1/E1 APPLICATIONS
This applications section describes common T1/E1 system considerations along with references to application
notes available for reference where applicable.
 5.1     Loopback Diagnostics
The XRT83VSH38 supports several loopback modes for diagnostic testing. The following section describes
the local analog loopback, remote loopback, digital loopback, and dual loopback modes.
 5.1.1     Local Analog Loopback
With local analog loopback activated, the transmit output data at TTIP/TRING is internally looped back to the
analog inputs at RTIP/RRING. External inputs at RTIP/RRING are ignored while valid transmit output data
continues to be sent to the line. A simplified block diagram of local analog loopback is shown in Figure 23.

NOTE: The transmit diagnostic features such as TAOS and QRSS take priority over the transmit input data at TCLK/TPOS/
        TNEG.
 5.1.2     Remote Loopback
With remote loopback activated, the receive input data at RTIP/RRING is internally looped back to the transmit
output data at TTIP/TRING. The remote loopback includes the Receive JA (if enabled). The transmit input
data at TCLK/TPOS/TNEG are ignored while valid receive output data continues to be sent to the system. A
simplified block diagram of remote loopback is shown in Figure 24.

With digital loopback activated, the transmit input data at TCLK/TPOS/TNEG is looped back to the receive
output data at RCLK/RPOS/RNEG. The digital loopback mode includes the Transmit JA (if enabled). The
receive input data at RTIP/RRING is ignored while valid transmit output data continues to be sent to the line. A
simplified block diagram of digital loopback is shown in Figure 25.

 5.2     Line Card Redundancy
Telecommunication system design requires signal integrity and reliability. When a T1/E1 primary line card has
a failure, it must be swapped with a backup line card while maintaining connectivity to a backplane without
losing data. System designers can achieve this by implementing common redundancy schemes with the
XRT83VSH38 LIU. EXAR offers features that are tailored to redundancy applications while reducing the
number of components and providing system designers with solid reference designs.
RLOS and DMO
If an RLOS or DMO condition occurs, the XRT83VSH38 reports the alarm to the individual status registers on a
per channel basis. However, for redundancy applications, an RLOS or DMO alarm can be used to initiate an
automatic switch to the back up card. For this application, two global pins RLOS and DMO are used to indicate
that one of the 8-channels has an RLOS or DMO condition.
Typical Redundancy Schemes
 1:1 One backup card for every primary card (Facility Protection)
 1+1 One backup card for every primary card (Line Protection)
 ·N+1 One backup card for N primary cards
  5.2.1     1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy Without Relays
The 1:1 facility protection and 1+1 line protection have one backup card for every primary card. When using
1:1 or 1+1 redundancy, the backup card has its transmitters tri-stated and its receivers in high impedance. This
eliminates the need for external relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
For 1+1 line protection, the receiver inputs on the backup card have the ability to monitor the line for bit errors
while in high impedance. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
  5.2.2      Transmit Interface with 1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy
The transmitters on the backup card should be tri-stated. Select the appropriate impedance for the desired
mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for blocking DC bias. See
Figure 27. for a simplified block diagram of the transmit section for a 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy.

 5.2.3      Receive Interface with 1:1 and 1+1 Redundancy
The receivers on the backup card should be programmed for "High" impedance. Since there is no external
resistor in the circuit, the receivers on the backup card will not load down the line interface. This key design
feature eliminates the need for relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation.
Select the impedance for the desired mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. To swap the primary card, set the backup
card to internal impedance, then the primary card to "High" impedance. See Figure 28. for a simplified block
diagram of the receive section for a 1:1 redundancy scheme.

  5.2.4    N+1 Redundancy Using External Relays
N+1 redundancy has one backup card for N primary cards. Due to impedance mismatch and signal
contention, external relays are necessary when using this redundancy scheme. The relays create complete
isolation between the primary cards and the backup card. This allows all transmitters and receivers on the
primary cards to be configured in internal impedance, providing one bill of materials for all interface modes of
operation. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
  5.2.5    Transmit Interface with N+1 Redundancy
For N+1 redundancy, the transmitters on all cards should be programmed for internal impedance. The
transmitters on the backup card do not have to be tri-stated. To swap the primary card, close the desired
relays, and tri-state the transmitters on the failed primary card. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP
for blocking DC bias. See Figure 29 for a simplified block diagram of the transmit section for an N+1
redundancy scheme.

 5.3     Power Failure Protection
For 1:1 or 1+1 line card redundancy in T1/E1 applications, power failure could cause a line card to change the
characteristics of the line impedance, causing a degradation in system performance. The XRT83VSH38 was
designed to ensure reliability during power failures. The LIU has patented high impedance circuits that allow
the receiver inputs and the transmitter outputs to be in "High" impedance when the LIU experiences a power
failure or when the LIU is powered off.
NOTE: For power failure protection, a transformer must be used to couple to the line interface. See the TAN-56 application
        note for more details.
 5.4     Overvoltage and Overcurrent Protection
Physical layer devices such as LIUs that interface to telecommunications lines are exposed to overvoltage
transients posed by environmental threats. An Overvoltage transient is a pulse of energy concentrated over a
small period of time, usually under a few milliseconds. These pulses are random and exceed the operating
conditions of CMOS transceiver ICs. Electronic equipment connecting to data lines are susceptible to many
forms of overvoltage transients such as lightning, AC power faults and electrostatic discharge (ESD). There
are three important standards when designing a telecommunications system to withstand overvoltage
transients.
 UL1950 and FCC Part 68
 Telcordia (Bellcore) GR-1089
 ITU-T K.20, K.21 and K.41
 5.5     Non-Intrusive Monitoring
In non-intrusive monitoring applications, the transmitters are shut off by setting TxON "Low". The receivers
must be actively receiving data without interfering with the line impedance. The XRT83VSH38’s internal
termination ensures that the line termination meets T1/E1 specifications for 75 100 or 120 while
monitoring the data stream. System integrity is maintained by placing the non-intrusive receiver in "High"
impedance, equivalent to that of a 1+1 redundancy application. A simplified block diagram of non-intrusive
monitoring is shown in Figure 31.

 6.0 MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE
The microprocessor interface can be accessed through a standard serial interface (BGA Package Only) or a
standard parallel microprocessor interface. The SER_PAR pin is used to select between the two. By default,
the chip is configured in the Parallel Microprocessor interace. For Serial communication, this pin must be
pulled “High”.
 6.1      Serial Microprocessor Interface Block (BGA Package Only)
The serial microprocessor uses a standard 3-pin serial port with CS, SCLK, and SDI for programming the LIU.
Optional pins such as SDO, INT, and RESET allow the ability to read back contents of the registers, monitor
the LIU via an interrupt pin, and reset the LIU to its default configuration by pulling reset "Low" for more than
10S. A simplified block diagram of the Serial Microprocessor is shown in Figure 32.

 6.1.1       Serial Timing Information
The serial port requires 24 bits of data applied to the SDI (Serial Data Input) pin. The Serial Microprocessor
samples SDI on the rising edge of SCLK (Serial Clock Input). The data is not latched into the device until all 24
bits of serial data have been sampled. A timing diagram of the Serial Microprocessor is shown in Figure 33.

  6.1.2    24-Bit Serial Data Input Descritption
The serial data input is sampled on the rising edge of SCLK. In readback mode, the serial data output is
updated on the falling edge of SCLK. The serial data must be applied to the LIU LSB first. The 24 bits of serial
data are described below.
  6.1.3    ADDR[7:0] (SCLK1 - SCLK8)
The first 8 SCLK cycles are used to provide the address to which a Read or Write operation will occur.
ADDR[0] (LSB) must be sent to the LIU first followed by ADDR[1] and so forth until all 8 address bits have been
sampled by SCLK.
  6.1.4    R/W (SCLK9)
The next serial bit applied to the LIU informs the microprocessor that a Read or Write operation is desired. If
the R/W bit is set to “0”, the microprocessor is configured for a Write operation. If the R/W bit is set to “1”, the
microprocessor is configured for a Read operation.
  6.1.5    Dummy Bits (SCLK10 - SCLK16)
The next 7 SCLK cycles are used as dummy bits. Seven bits were chosen so that the serial interface can
easily be divided into three 8-bit words to be compliant with standard serial interface devices. The state of
these bits are ignored and can hold either “0” or “1” during both Read and Write operations.
  6.1.6    DATA[7:0] (SCLK17 - SCLK24)
The next 8 SCLK cycles are used to provide the data to be written into the internal register chosen by the
address bits. DATA[0] (LSB) must be sent to the LIU first followed by DATA[1] and so forth until all 8 data bits
have been sampled by SCLK. Once 24 SCLK cycles have been completed, the LIU holds the data until CS is
pulled “High” whereby, the serial microprocessor latches the data into the selected internal register.
  6.1.7    8-Bit Serial Data Output Description
The serial data output is updated on the falling edge of SCLK17 - SCLK24 if R/W is set to “1”. DATA[0] (LSB)
is provided on SCLK17 to the SDO pin first followed by DATA[1] and so forth until all 8 data bits have been
updated. The SDO pin allows the user to read the contents stored in individual registers by providing the
desired address on the SDI pin during the Read cycle.

 6.2     Parallel Microprocessor Interface Block
The Parallel Microprocessor Interface section supports communication between the local microprocessor (µP)
and the LIU. The XRT83VSH38 supports an Intel asynchronous interface and Motorola 68K asynchronous
interface. The microprocessor interface is selected by the state of the µPTS[2:1] input pins. Selecting the
microprocessor interface is shown in Table 13.

The XRT83VSH38 uses multipurpose pins to configure the device appropriately. The local µP configures the
LIU by writing data into specific addressable, on-chip Read/Write registers. The microprocessor interface
provides the signals which are required for a general purpose microprocessor to read or write data into these
registers. The microprocessor interface also supports polled and interrupt driven environments. A simplified
block diagram of the microprocessor is shown in Figure 35.

 6.3      The Microprocessor Interface Block Signals
The LIU may be configured into different operating modes and have its performance monitored by software
through a standard microprocessor using data, address and control signals. These interface signals are
described below in Table 14, Table 15, and Table 16. The microprocessor interface can be configured to
operate in Intel mode or Motorola mode. When the microprocessor interface is operating in Intel mode, some
of the control signals function in a manner required by the Intel 80xx family of microprocessors. Likewise, when
the microprocessor interface is operating in Motorola mode, then these control signals function in a manner as
required by the Motorola microprocessors. (For using a Motorola 68K asynchronous processor, see
Figure 37 and Table 18) Table 14 lists and describes those microprocessor interface signals whose role is
constant across the two modes. Table 15 describes the role of some of these signals when the microprocessor
interface is operating in the Intel mode. Likewise, Table 16 describes the role of these signals when the
microprocessor interface is operating in the Motorola Power PC mode.

 6.4      Intel Mode Programmed I/O Access (Asynchronous)
If the LIU is interfaced to an Intel type µP, then it should be configured to operate in the Intel mode. Intel type
Read and Write operations are described below.
Intel Mode Read Cycle
Whenever an Intel-type µP wishes to read the contents of a register, it should do the following.
 1. Place the address of the target register on the address bus input pins ADDR[7:0].
 2. While the µP is placing this address value on the address bus, the address decoding circuitry should
     assert the CS pin of the LIU, by toggling it "Low". This action enables further communication between the
     µP and the LIU microprocessor interface block.
 3. Toggle the ALE input pin "High". This step enables the address bus input drivers, within the microproces-
     sor interface block of the LIU.
 4. The µP should then toggle the ALE pin "Low". This step causes the LIU to latch the contents of the address
     bus into its internal circuitry. At this point, the address of the register has now been selected.
 5. Next, the µP should indicate that this current bus cycle is a Read operation by toggling the RD input pin
     "Low". This action also enables the bi-directional data bus output drivers of the LIU.
 6. After the µP toggles the Read signal "Low", the LIU will toggle the RDY output pin "Low". The LIU does this
     in order to inform the µP that the data is available to be read by the µP, and that it is ready for the next com-
     mand.
 7. After the µP detects the RDY signal and has read the data, it can terminate the Read Cycle by toggling the
     RD input pin "High".
NOTE: ALE can be tied “High” if this signal is not available.
The Intel Mode Write Cycle
Whenever an Intel type µP wishes to write a byte or word of data into a register within the LIU, it should do the
following.
 1. Place the address of the target register on the address bus input pins ADDR[7:0].
 2. While the µP is placing this address value on the address bus, the address decoding circuitry should
     assert the CS pin of the LIU, by toggling it "Low". This action enables further communication between the
     µP and the LIU microprocessor interface block.
 3. Toggle the ALE input pin "High". This step enables the address bus input drivers, within the microproces-
     sor interface block of the LIU.
 4. The µP should then toggle the ALE pin "Low". This step causes the LIU to latch the contents of the address
     bus into its internal circuitry. At this point, the address of the register has now been selected.
 5. The µP should then place the byte or word that it intends to write into the target register, on the bi-direc-
     tional data bus DATA[7:0].
 6. Next, the µP should indicate that this current bus cycle is a Write operation by toggling the WR input pin
     "Low". This action also enables the bi-directional data bus input drivers of the LIU.
 7. After the µP toggles the Write signal "Low", the LIU will toggle the RDY output pin "Low". The LIU does this
     in order to inform the µP that the data has been written into the internal register location, and that it is ready
     for the next command.
NOTE: ALE can be tied “High” if this signal is not available.
The Intel Read and Write timing diagram is shown in Figure 36. The timing specifications are shown in
Table 17.

CLOCK SELECT REGISTER
The input clock source is used to generate all the necessary clock references internally to the LIU. The
microprocessor timing is derived from a PLL output which is chosen by programming the Clock Select Bits and
the Master Clock Rate in register 0x81h. Therefore, if the clock selection bits or the MCLRATE bit are being
programmed, the frequency of the PLL output will be adjusted accordingly. During this adjustment, it is
important to "Not" write to any other bit location within the same register while selecting the input/output clock
frequency. For best results, register 0x81h can be broken down into two sub-registers with the MSB being bits
D[7:3] and the LSB being bits D[2:0] as shown in Figure 38. Note: Bit D[7] is a reserved bit.

Programming Examples:
Example 1: Changing bits D[7:3]
If bits D[7:3] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 2: Changing bits D[2:0]
If bits D[2:0] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 3: Changing bits within the MSB and LSB
In this scenario, one must initiate TWO write operations such that the MSB and LSB do not change within ONE
write cycle. It is recommended that the MSB and LSB be treated as two independent sub-registers. One can
either change the clock selection (MSB) and then change bits D[2:0] (LSB) on the SECOND write, or vice-
versa. No order or sequence is necessary.

                             MCLKRATE = “0”, and the T1/J1 clock when MCLKRATE =

                             declared to 4096 bits. Writing a “0” reverts to the normal mode
                             (175+75 bits for T1 and 32 bits for E1).
