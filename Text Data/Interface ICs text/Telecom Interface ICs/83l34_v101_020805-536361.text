     CS           72          Setting this pin to the logic "HIGH" level configures the Transmit Section (of

                              Setting this pin to the logic "LOW" level, configures the Transmit Section (of
                              the corresponding channel) to transmit normal traffic via the outbound DS1/E1

                                   This pin permits the user to configure the XRT83L34 device to operate in
                                   either the HOST or the Hardware Mode. If the user configures the XRT83L34
                                   device to operate in the HOST Mode, then the Microprocessor Interface
                                   block will become active and virtually all configuration settings (within the
                                   XRT83L34 device) will be achieved by writing values into the on-chip regis-
                                   ters (via the Microprocessor Interface). If the user configures the XRT83L34
                                   device to operate in the Hardware Mode, then the Microprocessor Interface
                                   block will be disabled, and all configuration settings (within the XRT83L34
                                   device) will be achieved by setting various input pins to logic HIGH or LOW
                                   settings.
                                   LOGIC LOW - Configures the XRT83L34 device to operate in the HOST
                                   Mode.

                                   The exact function of this input pin depends upon whether the XRT83L34
                                   device has been configured to operate in the HOST or the Hardware Mode,
                                   as described below.
                                   HOST Mode Operation - Write Strobe/Read-Write Operation Identifier:
                                   Assuming that the XRT83L34 device has been configured to operate in the
                                   Host Mode, then the exact function of the this input pin depends upon which
                                   mode the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in, as
                                   described below.
                                   Intel-Asynchronous Mode - WR* - Write Strobe Input pin:
                                   If the Microprocessor Interface is configured to operate in the Intel-Asynchro-
                                   nous Mode, then this input pin functions as the WR* (Active-Low WRITE
                                   Strobe) input signal from the Microprocessor. Once this active-low signal is
                                   asserted, then the input buffers (associated with the Bi-Direction Data bus
                                   pins, D[7:0]) will be enabled. The Microprocessor Interface will latch the con-
                                   tents on the Bi-Directional Data Bus (into the "target" register or address
                                   location, within the XRT83L34) upon the rising edge of this input pin.

                                   Mode, then this pin is functionally equivalent to the R/W* input pin. In the
                                   Motorola-Asynchronous Mode, a READ operation occurs if this pin is held at
                                   a logic "1", coincident to a falling edge of the RD/DS* (Data Strobe) input pin.
                                   Similarly, a WRITE operation occurs if this input is at a logic "0", coincident to
                                   a falling edge of the RD/DS* (Data Strobe) input pin.

                                   During each READ or WRITE operation, the user is expected to drive this

                               cycle of 40% to 60% can be provided at this pin.
                               In systems that have only one master clock source available (E1 or T1), that
                               clock should be connected to both MCLKE1 and MCLKT1 inputs for proper
                               operation.
                               NOTES:
                                    1.   All channels of the XRT83L34 must be operated at the same clock
                                         rate, either T1, E1 or J1.

   CLKSEL1         38          CLKSEL[2:0] are input signals to a programmable frequency synthesizer that
   CLKSEL2         39          can be used to generate a master clock from an accurate external clock
                               source according to the following table.
                               The MCLKRATE control signal is generated from the state of EQC[4:0]
                               inputs. See Table 4 for description of Transmit Equalizer Control bits.
                               Host Mode: The state of these pins are ignored and the master frequency
                               PLL is controlled by the corresponding interface bits. See register address

QUAD T1/E1/J1 LH/SH TRANSCEIVER WITH CLOCK RECOVERY AND JITTER ATTENUATOR REV. 1.0.1
FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The XRT83L34 is a fully integrated four-channel long-haul and short-haul transceiver intended for T1, J1 or E1
systems. Simplified block diagrams of the device are shown in Figure 1, Host mode and Figure 2, Hardware
mode. The XRT83L34 can receive signals that have been attenuated from 0 to 36dB at 772kHz (0 to 6000 feet
cable loss) for T1 and from 0 to 43dB at 1024kHz for E1 systems.
In T1 applications, the XRT83L34 can generate five transmit pulse shapes to meet the short-haul Digital Cross-
connect (DSX-1) template requirement as well as four CSU Line Build-Out (LBO) filters of 0dB, -7.5dB, -15dB
and -22.5dB as required by FCC rules. It also provides programmable transmit output pulse generators for
each channel that can be used for output pulse shaping allowing performance improvement over a wide variety
of conditions. The operation and configuration of the XRT83L34 can be controlled through a parallel
microprocessor Host interface or, by Hardware control.
MASTER CLOCK GENERATOR
Using a variety of external clock sources, the on-chip frequency synthesizer generates the T1 (1.544MHz) or
E1 (2.048MHz) master clocks necessary for the transmit pulse shaping and receive clock recovery circuit.
There are two master clock inputs MCLKE1 and MCLKT1. In systems where both T1 and E1 master clocks are
available these clocks can be connected to the respective pins. All channels of a given XRT83L34 must be
operated at the same clock rate, either T1, E1 or J1 modes.
In systems that have only one master clock source available (E1 or T1), that clock should be connected to both
MCLKE1 and MCLKT1 inputs for proper operation. T1 or E1 master clocks can be generated from 8kHz,
16kHz, 56kHz, 64kHz, 128kHz and 256kHz external clocks under the control of CLKSEL[2:0] inputs according
to Table 1.
NOTE: EQC[4:0] determine the T1/E1 operating mode. See Table 5 for details.

In Host mode the programming is achieved through the corresponding interface control bits, the state of the
CLKSEL[2:0] control bits and the state of the MCLKRATE interface control bit.
RECEIVER
RECEIVER INPUT
At the receiver input, a cable attenuated AMI signal can be coupled to the receiver through a capacitor or a 1:1
transformer. The input signal is first applied to a selective equalizer for signal conditioning. The maximum
equalizer gain is up to 36dB for T1 and 43dB for E1 modes. The equalized signal is subsequently applied to a
peak detector which in turn controls the equalizer settings and the data slicer. The slicer threshold for both E1
and T1 is typically set at 50% of the peak amplitude at the equalizer output. After the slicers, the digital
representation of the AMI signals are applied to the clock and data recovery circuit. The recovered data
subsequently goes through the jitter attenuator and decoder (if selected) for HDB3 or B8ZS decoding before
being applied to the RPOS_n/RDATA_n and RNEG_n/LCV_n pins. Clock recovery is accomplished by a digital
phase-locked loop (DPLL) which does not require any external components and can tolerate high levels of
input jitter that meets or exceeds the ITU-G.823 and TR-TSY000499 standards.
In Hardware mode only, all receive channels are turned on upon power-up and are always on. In Host mode,
each receiver channel can be individually turned on or off with the respective channel RXON_n bit. See
“Microprocessor Register #0, Bit Description” on page 63.

RECEIVE MONITOR MODE
In applications where Monitor mode is desired, the equalizer can be configured in a gain mode which handles
input signals attenuated resistively up to 29dB, along with 0 to 6dB cable attenuation for both T1 and E1
applications, refer to Table 5 for details. This feature is available in both Hardware and Host modes.
RECEIVER LOSS OF SIGNAL (RLOS)
For compatibility with ITU G.775 requirements, the RLOS monitoring function is implemented using both
analog and digital detection schemes. If the analog RLOS condition occurs, a digital detector is activated to
count for 32 consecutive zeros in E1 (4096 bits in Extended Los mode, EXLOS = “1”) or 175 consecutive zeros
in T1 before RLOS is asserted. RLOS is cleared when the input signal rises +3dB (built in hysteresis) above
the point at which it was declared and meets 12.5% ones density of 4 ones in a 32 bit window, with no more
than 16 consecutive zeros for E1. In T1 mode, RLOS is cleared when the input signal rises +3dB (built in
hysteresis) above the point at which it was declared and contains 16 ones in a 128 bit window with no more
than 100 consecutive zeros in the data stream. When loss of signal occurs, RLOS register indication and
register status will change. If the RLOS register enable is set high (enabled), the alarm will trigger an interrupt
causing the interrupt pin (INT) to go low. Once the alarm status register has been read, it will automatically
reset upon read (RUR), and the INT pin will return high.
Analog RLOS
Setting the Receiver Inputs to -15dB T1/E1 Short Haul Mode
By setting the receiver inputs to -15dB T1/E1 short haul mode, the equalizer will detect the incoming amplitude
and make adjustments by adding gain up to a maximum of +15dB normalizing the T1/E1 input signal.
NOTE: This is the only setting that refers to cable loss (frequency), not flat loss (resistive).
Once the T1/E1 input signal has been normalized to 0dB by adding the maximum gain (+15dB), the receiver
will declare RLOS if the signal is attenuated by an additional -9dB. The total cable loss at RLOS declaration is
typically -24dB (-15dB + -9dB). A 3dB hysteresis was designed so that transients will not trigger the RLOS to
clear. Therefore, the RLOS will typically clear at a total cable attenuation of -21dB. See Figure 6 for a simplified
diagram.

The Decoder function is available in both Hardware and Host modes on a per channel basis by controlling the
TNEG_n/CODES_n pin or the CODES_n interface bit. The decoder function is only active in single-rail Mode.
When selected, receive data in this mode will be decoded according to HDB3 rules for E1 and B8ZS for T1
systems. Bipolar violations that do not conform to the coding scheme will be reported as Line Code Violation at
the RNEG_n/LCV_n pin of each channel. The length of the LCV pulse is one RCLK cycle for each code
violation. In E1mode only, an excessive number of zeros in the receive data stream is also reported as an error
at the same output pin. If AMI decoding is selected in single rail mode, every bipolar violation in the receive
data stream will be reported as an error at the RNEG_n/LCV_n pin.
RECOVERED CLOCK (RCLK) SAMPLING EDGE
This feature is available in both Hardware and Host modes on a global basis. In Host mode, the sampling
edge of RCLK output can be changed through the interface control bit RCLKE. If a “1” is written in the RCLKE
interface bit, receive data output at RPOS_n/RDATA_n and RNEG_n/LCV_n are updated on the falling edge of
RCLK for all eight channels. Writing a “0” to the RCLKE register, updates the receive data on the rising edge of
RCLK. In Hardware mode the same feature is available under the control of the RCLKE pin.

REV. 1.0.1 QUAD T1/E1/J1 LH/SH TRANSCEIVER WITH CLOCK RECOVERY AND JITTER ATTENUATOR
To reduce phase and frequency jitter in the recovered clock, the jitter attenuator can be placed in the receive
signal path. The jitter attenuator uses a data FIFO (First In First Out) with a programmable depth that can vary
between 2x32 and 2x64. The jitter attenuator can also be placed in the transmit signal path or disabled
altogether depending upon system requirements. The jitter attenuator, other than using the master clock as
reference, requires no external components. With the jitter attenuator selected, the typical throughput delay
from input to output is 16 bits for 32 bit FIFO size or 32 bits for 64 bit FIFO size. When the read and write
pointers of the FIFO in the jitter attenuator are within two bits of over-flowing or under-flowing, the bandwidth of
the jitter attenuator is widened to track the short term input jitter, thereby avoiding data corruption. When this
situation occurs, the jitter attenuator will not attenuate input jitter until the read/write pointer's position is outside
the two bits window. Under normal condition, the jitter transfer characteristic meets the narrow bandwidth
requirement as specified in ITU- G.736, ITU- I.431 and AT&T Pub 62411 standards.
In T1 mode the Jitter Attenuator Bandwidth is always set to 3Hz. In E1 mode, the bandwidth can be reduced
through the JABW control signal. When JABW is set “High” the bandwidth of the jitter attenuator is reduced
from 10Hz to 1.5Hz. Under this condition the FIFO length is automatically set to 64 bits and the 32 bits FIFO
length will not be available in this mode. Jitter attenuator controls are available on a per channel basis in the
Host mode and on a global basis in the Hardware mode.
GAPPED CLOCK (JA MUST BE ENABLED IN THE TRANSMIT PATH)
The XRT83L34 LIU is ideal for multiplexer or mapper applications where the network data crosses multiple
timing domains. As the higher data rates are de-multiplexed down to T1 or E1 data, stuffing bits are removed
which can leave gaps in the incoming data stream. If the jitter attenuator is enabled in the transmit path, the 32-
Bit or 64-Bit FIFO is used to smooth the gapped clock into a steady T1 or E1 output. The maximum gap width
of the 8-Channel LIU is shown in Table 2.

ARBITRARY PULSE GENERATOR FOR T1 AND E1
The arbitrary pulse generator divides the pulse into eight individual segments. Each segment is set by a 7-Bit
binary word by programming the appropriate channel register. This allows the system designer to set the
overshoot, amplitude, and undershoot for a unique line build out. The MSB (bit 7) is a sign-bit. If the sign-bit is
set to “1”, the segment will move in a positive direction relative to a flat line (zero) condition. If this sign-bit is set
to “0”, the segment will move in a negative direction relative to a flat line condition. A pulse with numbered
segments is shown in Figure 11.

TRANSMITTER
DIGITAL DATA FORMAT
Both the transmitter and receiver can be configured to operate in dual or single-rail data formats. This feature is
available under both Hardware and Host control modes, on a global basis. The dual or single-rail data format
is determined by the state of the SR/DR pin in Hardware mode or SR/DR interface bit in the Host mode. In
single-rail mode, transmit clock and NRZ data are applied to TCLK_n and TPOS_n/TDATA_n pins respectively.
In single-rail and Hardware mode the TNEG_n/CODES_n input can be used as the CODES function. With
TNEG_n/CODES_n tied “Low”, HDB3 or B8ZS encoding and decoding are enabled for E1 and T1 modes
respectively. With TNEG_n/CODES_n tied “High”, the AMI coding scheme is selected. In both dual or single-
rail modes of operations, the transmitter converts digital input data to a bipolar format before being transmitted
to the line.
TRANSMIT CLOCK (TCLK) SAMPLING EDGE
Serial transmit data at TPOS_n/TDATA_n and TNEG_n/CODES_n are clocked into the XRT83L34 under the
synchronization of TCLK_n. With a “0” written to the TCLKE interface bit, or by pulling the TCLKE pin “Low”,
input data is sampled on the falling edge of TCLK_n. The sampling edge is inverted with a “1” written to TCLKE
interface bit, or by connecting the TCLKE pin “High”.

TRANSMIT HDB3/B8ZS ENCODER
The Encoder function is available in both Hardware and Host modes on a per channel basis by controlling the
TNEG_n/CODES_n pin or CODES interface bit. The encoder is only available in single-rail mode. In E1 mode
and with HDB3 encoding selected, any sequence with four or more consecutive zeros in the input serial data
from TPOS_n/TDATA_n, will be removed and replaced with 000V or B00V, where “B” indicates a pulse
conforming with the bipolar rule and “V” representing a pulse violating the rule. An example of HDB3 Encoding
is shown in Table 3. In a T1 system, an input data sequence with eight or more consecutive zeros will be
removed and replaced using the B8ZS encoding rule. An example of Bipolar with 8 Zero Substitution (B8ZS)
encoding scheme is shown in Table 4. Writing a “1” into the CODES_n interface bit or connecting the TNEG_n/
CODES_n pin to a “High” level selects the AMI coding for both E1 or T1 systems.

The driver monitor circuit is used to detect transmit driver failure by monitoring the activities at TTIP and TRING
outputs. Driver failure may be caused by a short circuit in the primary transformer or system problems at the
transmit input. If the transmitter of a channel has no output for more than 128 clock cycles, the corresponding
DMO pin goes “High” and remains “High” until a valid transmit pulse is detected. In Host mode, the failure of
the transmit channel is reported in the corresponding interface bit. If the DMOIE bit is also enabled, any
transition on the DMO interface bit will generate an interrupt. The driver failure monitor is supported in both
Hardware and Host modes on a per channel basis.
TRANSMIT PULSE SHAPER & LINE BUILD OUT (LBO) CIRCUIT
The transmit pulse shaper circuit uses the high speed clock from the Master timing generator to control the
shape and width of the transmitted pulse. The internal high-speed timing generator eliminates the need for a
tightly controlled transmit clock (TCLK) duty cycle. With the jitter attenuator not in the transmit path, the
transmit output will generate no more than 0.025Unit Interval (UI) peak-to-peak jitter. In Hardware mode, the
state of the A[4:0]/EQC[4:0] pins determine the transmit pulse shape for all eight channels. In Host mode
transmit pulse shape can be controlled on a per channel basis using the interface bits EQC[4:0]. The chip
supports five fixed transmit pulse settings for T1 Short-haul applications plus a fully programmable waveform
generator for arbitrary transmit output pulse shapes. Transmit Line Build-Outs for T1 long-haul application are
supported from 0dB to -22.5dB in three 7.5dB steps. The choice of the transmit pulse shape and LBO under
the control of the interface bits are summarized in Table 5. For CSU LBO transmit pulse design information,
refer to ANSI T1.403-1993 Network-to-Customer Installation specification, Annex-E.
NOTE: EQC[4:0] determine the T1/E1 operating mode of the XRT83L34. When EQC4 = “1” and EQC3 = “1”, the XRT83L34
         is in the E1 mode, otherwise it is in the T1/J1 mode.

TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE TERMINATIONS
The XRT83L34 is a versatile LIU that can be programmed to use one Bill of Materials (BOM) for worldwide
applications for T1, J1 and E1. For specific applications the internal terminations can be disabled to allow the
use of existing components and/or designs.
RECEIVER (CHANNELS 0 - 3)
INTERNAL RECEIVE TERMINATION MODE
In Hardware mode, RXTSEL (Pin 83) can be tied “High” to select internal termination mode for all receive
channels or tied “Low” to select external termination mode. Individual channel control can only be done in Host
mode. By default the XRT83L34 is set for external termination mode at power up or at Hardware reset.

If the internal termination mode (RXTSEL = “1”) is selected, the effective impedance for E1, T1 or J1 can be
achieved either with an internal resistor or a combination of internal and external resistors as shown in Table 7.
NOTE: In Hardware mode, pins RXRES[1:0] control all channels.

In Hardware mode, TXTSEL (Pin 84) can be tied “High” to select internal termination mode for all transmit
channels or tied “Low” for external termination. Individual channel control can be done only in Host mode. In
Host mode, bit 6 in the appropriate register for a given channel is set “High” to select the internal termination
mode for that specific transmit channel, see Table 21, “Microprocessor Register #1, Bit Description,” on
page 64.

By default the XRT83L34 is set for external termination mode at power up or at Hardware reset.
When external transmit termination mode is selected, the internal termination circuitry is disabled. The value of
the external resistors is chosen for a specific application according to the turns ratio selected by TRATIO (Pin
127) in Hardware mode or bit 0 in the appropriate register for a specific channel in Host mode, see Table 10
and Table 23, “Microprocessor Register #3, Bit Description,” on page 68. Figure 14 is a simplified block
diagram for T1 (100Ω) in the external termination mode. Figure 15 is a simplified block diagram for E1 (75Ω) in
the external termination mode.

REDUNDANCY APPLICATIONS
Telecommunication system design requires signal integrity and reliability. When a T1/E1 primary line card has
a failure, it must be swapped with a backup line card while maintaining connectivity to a backplane without
losing data. System designers can achieve this by implementing common redundancy schemes with the
XRT83L34 Line Interface Unit (LIU). The XRT83L34 offers features that are tailored to redundancy applications
while reducing the number of components and providing system designers with solid reference designs. These
features allow system designers to implement redundancy applications that ensure reliability. The Internal
Impedance mode eliminates the need for external relays when using the 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy schemes.

PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS
In many applications switching the control of the transmitter outputs and the receiver line impedance to
hardware control will provide faster transmitter ON/OFF switching.
In Host Mode, there are two bits in register 130 (82H) that control the transmitter outputs and the Rx line
impedance select, TXONCNTL (Bit 7) and TERCNTL (Bit 6).
Setting bit-7 (TXONCNTL) to a “1” transfers the control of the Transmit On/Off function to the TXON_n
Hardware control pins. (Pins 90 through 93 and pins 169 through 172).
Setting bit-6 (TERCNTL) to a “1” transfers the control of the Rx line impedance select (RXTSEL) to the
RXTSEL Hardware control pin (pin 83).
Either mode works well with redundancy applications. The user can determine which mode has the fastest
switching time for a unique application.
TYPICAL REDUNDANCY SCHEMES

    n  ·1+1 One backup card for every primary card (Line Protection)
    n  ·N+1One backup card for N primary cards
1:1 REDUNDANCY
A 1:1 facility protection redundancy scheme has one backup card for every primary card. When using 1:1
redundancy, the backup card has its transmitters tri-stated and its receivers in high impedance. This eliminates
the need for external relays and provides one bill of materials for all interface modes of operation. The transmit
and receive sections of the LIU device are described separately.
1+1 REDUNDANCY
A 1+1 line protection redundancy scheme has one backup card for every primary card, and the receivers on
the backup card are monitoring the receiver inputs. Therefore, the receivers on both cards need to be active.
The transmit outputs require no external resistors. The transmit and receive sections of the LIU device are
described separately.
TRANSMIT 1:1 & 1+1 REDUNDANCY
For 1:1 and 1+1 redundancy, the transmitters on the primary and backup card should be programmed for
Internal Impedance mode. The transmitters on the backup card should be tri-stated. Select the appropriate
impedance for the desired mode of operation, T1/E1/J1. A 0.68uF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for
blocking DC bias. See Figure 16 for a simplified block diagram of the transmit section for 1:1 and 1+1
redundancy scheme.
NOTE: For simplification, the over voltage protection circuitry was omitted.

RECEIVE 1:1 & 1+1 REDUNDANCY

no external resistor in the circuit, the receivers on the backup card will be high impedance. This key design

QUAD T1/E1/J1 LH/SH TRANSCEIVER WITH CLOCK RECOVERY AND JITTER ATTENUATOR REV. 1.0.1
N+1 redundancy has one backup card for N primary cards. Due to impedance mismatch and signal contention,
external relays are necessary when using this redundancy scheme. The advantage of relays is that they create
complete isolation between the primary cards and the backup card. This allows all transmitters and receivers
on the primary cards to be configured in internal impedance mode, providing one bill of materials for all
interface modes of operation. The transmit and receive sections of the XRT83L34 are described separately.
TRANSMIT
For N+1 redundancy, the transmitters on all cards should be programmed for internal impedance mode
providing one bill of materials for T1/E1/J1. The transmitters on the backup card do not have to be tri-stated. To
swap the primary card, close the desired relays, and tri-state the transmitters on the failed primary card. A
0.68µF capacitor is used in series with TTIP for blocking DC bias. See Figure 18 for a simplified block diagram
of the transmit section for an N+1 redundancy scheme.
NOTE: For simplification, the over voltage protection circuitry was omitted.

PATTERN TRANSMIT AND DETECT FUNCTION
Several test and diagnostic patterns can be generated and detected by the chip. In Hardware mode each
channel can be independently programmed to transmit an All Ones pattern by applying a “High” level to the
corresponding TAOS_n pin. In Host mode, the three interface bits TXTEST[2:0] control the pattern generation
and detection independently for each channel according to Table 12.

TRANSMIT ALL ONES (TAOS)
This feature is available in both Hardware and Host modes. With the TAOS_n pin connected to a “High” level
or when interface bits TXTEST2=“1”, TXTEST1=“0” and TXTEST0=“1” the transmitter ignores input from
TPOS_n/TDATA_n and TNEG_n/CODES_n pins and sends a continuous AMI encoded all “Ones” signal to the
line, using TCLK_n clock as the reference. In addition, when the Hardware pin and interface bit ATAOS is
activated, the chip will automatically transmit the All “Ones” data from any channel that detects an RLOS
condition. This feature is not available on a per channel basis. TCLK_n must NOT be tied “Low”.
NETWORK LOOP CODE DETECTION AND TRANSMISSION
This feature is available in Host mode only. When the interface bits TXTEST2=”1”, TXTEST1=”1” and
TXTEST0=”0” the chip is enabled to transmit the “00001” Network Loop-Up Code from the selected channel
requesting a Loop-Back condition from the remote terminal. Simultaneously setting the interface bits
NLCDE1=”0” and NLCDE0=”1” enables the Network Loop-Up code detection in the receiver. If the “00001”
Network Loop-Up code is detected in the receive data for longer than 5 seconds, the NLCD bit in the interface
register is set indicating that the remote terminal has activated remote Loop-Back and the chip is receiving its
own transmitted data. When the interface bits TXTEST2=”1”, TXTEST1=”1” and TXTEST0=”1” the chip is
enabled to transmit the Network Loop-Down Code (TLDC) “001” from the selected channel requesting the
remote terminal the removal of the Loop-Back condition.
In the Host mode each channel is capable of monitoring the contents of the receive data for the presence of
Loop-Up or Loop-Down code from the remote terminal. In the Host mode the two interface bits NLCDE[1:0]
control the Loop-Code detection independently for each channel according to Table 13.

Setting the interface bits to NLCDE1=”0” and NLCDE0=”1” activates the detection of the Loop-Up code in the
receive data. If the “00001” Network Loop-Up code is detected in the receive data for longer than 5 seconds,
the NLCD interface bit is set to “1” and stays in this state for as long as the receiver continues to receive the
Network Loop-Up Code. In this mode if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, the chip will initiate an interrupt on every

transition of NLCD. The host has the option to ignore the request from the remote terminal, or to respond to the
request and manually activate Remote Loop-Back. The host can subsequently activate the detection of the
Loop-Down Code by setting NLCDE1=”1” and NLCDE0=”0”. In this case, receiving the “001” Loop-Down Code
for longer than 5 seconds will set the NLCD bit to “1” and if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, the chip will initiate
an interrupt on every transition of NLCD. The host can respond to the request from the remote terminal and
remove Loop-Back condition. In the manual Network Loop-Up (NLCDE1=”0” and NLCDE0=”1”) and Loop-
Down (NLCDE1=”1” and NLCDE0=”0”) Code detection modes, the NLCD interface bit will be set to “1” upon
receiving the corresponding code in excess of 5 seconds in the receive data. The chip will initiate an interrupt
any time the status of the NLCD bit changes and the Network Loop-code interrupt is enabled.
In the Host mode, setting the interface bits NLCDE1=”1” and NLCDE0=”1” enables the automatic Loop-Code
detection and Remote Loop-Back activation mode if, TXTEST[2:0] is NOT equal to “110”. As this mode is
initiated, the state of the NLCD interface bit is reset to “0” and the chip is programmed to monitor the receive
input data for the Loop-Up Code. If the “00001” Network Loop-Up Code is detected in the receive data for
longer than 5 seconds in addition to the NLCD bit in the interface register being set, Remote Loop-Back is
automatically activated. The chip stays in remote Loop-Back even if it stops receiving the “00001” pattern. After
the chip detects the Loop-Up code, sets the NLCD bit and enters Remote Loop-Back, it automatically starts
monitoring the receive data for the Loop-Down code. In this mode however, the NLCD bit stays set even if the
receiver stops receiving the Loop-Up code, which is an indication to the host that the Remote Loop-Back is still
in effect. Remote Loop-Back is removed if the chip detects the “001” Loop-Down code for longer than 5
seconds. Detecting the “001” code also results in resetting the NLCD interface bit and initiating an interrupt.
The Remote Loop-Back can also be removed by taking the chip out of the Automatic detection mode by
programming it to operate in a different state. The chip will not respond to remote Loop-Back request if Local
Analog Loop-Back is activated locally. When programmed in Automatic detection mode the NLCD interface bit
stays “High” for the whole time the Remote Loop-Back is activated and initiates an interrupt any time the status
of the NLCD bit changes provided the Network Loop-code interrupt is enabled.
TRANSMIT AND DETECT QUASI-RANDOM SIGNAL SOURCE (TDQRSS)
Each channel of XRT83L34 includes a QRSS pattern generation and detection block for diagnostic purposes
that can be activated only in the Host mode by setting the interface bits TXTEST2=”1”, TXTEST1=”0” and
TXTEST0=”0”. For T1 systems, the QRSS pattern is a 220-1pseudo-random bit sequence (PRBS) with no
more than 14 consecutive zeros. For E1 systems, the QRSS pattern is 215 -1 PRBS with an inverted output.
With QRSS and Analog Local Loop-Back enabled simultaneously, and by monitoring the status of the QRPD
interface bit, all main functional blocks within the transceiver can be verified.
When the receiver achieves QRSS synchronization with fewer than 4 errors in a 128 bits window, QRPD
changes from “Low” to “High”. After pattern synchronization, any bit error will cause QRPD to go “Low” for one
clock cycle. If the QRPDIE bit is enabled, any transition on the QRPD bit will generate an interrupt.
With TDQRSS activated, a bit error can be inserted in the transmitted QRSS pattern by transitioning the
INSBER interface bit from “0” to “1”. Bipolar violation can also be inserted either in the QRSS pattern, or input
data when operating in the single-rail mode by transitioning the INSBPV interface bit from “0” to “1”. The state
of INSBER and INSBPV bits are sampled on the rising edge of the TCLK_n. To insure the insertion of the bit
error or bipolar violation, a “0” should be written in these bit locations before writing a “1”.

THE MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE
XRT83L34 is equipped with a microprocessor interface for easy device configuration. The parallel port of the
XRT83L34 is compatible with both the Intel-Asynchronous and the Motorola-Asynchronous address and data
buses. The XRT83L34 has an 7-bit address A[6:0] input and 8-bit bi-directional data bus D[7:0].
THE PINS OF THE MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE
Table 16 presents a list and a brief description of each of the pins that make up the Microprocessor Interface block, within
the XRT83L34 device.

       D[7:0]      Bi-Directional Data Bus pins:
                   These pins are used to drive and receive data over the bi-directional data bus, whenever the Micro-
                   processor performs READ or WRITE operations with the Microprocessor Interface of the XRT83L34
                   device.
       A[6:0]      Address Bus Input pins:
                   These input pins permit the Microprocessor to identify on-chip registers (within the XRT83L34 device)
                   whenever it performs READ and WRITE operations with the XRT83L34 device.

                       TABLE 16: MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE SIGNAL DESCRIPTION
   ALE_AS      Address Latch Enable/Address Strobe Input:
               The exact function of this input pin depends upon which mode the Microprocessor Interface has been
               configured to operate in, as described below.
               Intel-Asynchronous Mode - Address Latch Enable - ALE:
               If the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in the Intel-Asynchronous Mode, then
               this active-high input pin is used to latch the data (residing on the Address Bus, A[6:0] into the Micro-
               processor Interface circuitry of the XRT83L34 device and to indicate the start of a READ or WRITE
               cycle.
               Pulling this input pin "high" enables the input bus drivers for the Address Bus input pins. The contents
               of the Address Bus will be latched into the Microprocessor Interface circuitry, upon the falling edge of
               this input signal.
               Motorola-Asynchronous Mode - Address Strobe - AS*:
               If the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in the Motorola-Asynchronous Mode,
               then pulling this input pin "LOW enables the "input" bus drivers for the Address Bus Input pins.
               During each READ or WRITE operation, the user is expected to drive this input pin "LOW" after (or
               around the time that) he/she has places the address (of the "target" register) onto the Address Bus
               pins (A[6:0]). The user is then expected to hold this input pin "LOW" for the remainder of the READ or
               WRITE cycle.
               NOTE: It is permissible to tie the ALE_AS* and CS* input pins together.. Read and Write operations
                        will be performed properly if ALE_AS is driven "LOW" coincident to whenever CS* is also
                        driven "LOW".
     CS        Chip Select Input:
               The user must assert this active-low signal in order to select the Microprocessor Interface for READ
               and WRITE operations between the Microprocessor and the XRT83L34 on-chip registers.
   RD_DS       Read Strobe/Data Strobe Input Pin:
               The exact function of this input pin depends upon which mode the Microprocessor Interface has been
               configured to operate in, as described below.
               Intel-Asynchronous Mode - READ Strobe Input - RD*:
               If the Microprocessor Interface is operating in the Intel-Asynchronous Mode, then this input pin will
               function as the RD* (Active-Low READ Strobe) input signal from the Microprocessor. Once this
               active-low signal is asserted, then the XRT83L34 device will place the contents of the addressed reg-
               ister on the Microprocessor Interface Bi-Directional Data Bus (D[7:0]). When this signal is negated,
               then the Data Bus will be tri-stated.
               Motorola-Asynchronous Mode - Data Strobe Input - DS*:
               If the Microprocessor Interface is operating in the Motorola-Asynchronous Mode, then this input pin
               will function as the DS* (Data Strobe) input signal.

     WR_R/W      Write Strobe/Read-Write Operation Identifier:
                 The exact function of this input pin depends upon which mode the Microprocessor Interface has been
                 configured to operate in, as described below.
                 Intel-Asynchronous Mode - Write Strobe Input - WR*:
                 If the Microprocessor Interface is configured to operate in the Intel-Asynchronous Mode, then this
                 input pin functions as the WR* (Active-Low, Write Strobe) input signal form the Microprocessor. Once
                 this active-low signal is asserted then the input buffers (associated with the Bi-Directional Data Bus
                 pins, D[7:0]) will be enabled. The Microprocessor Interface will latch the contents of the Bi-Directional
                 Data Bus (into the "target" register or address location, within the XRT83L34 device) upon the rising
                 edge of this input pin.
                 Motorola-Asynchronous Mode - Read/Write Operation Identification Input - R/W*
                 If the Microprocessor Interface is operating in the "Motorola-Asynchronous" Mode, then this pin is
                 functionally equivalent to the "R/W*" input pin. In the Motorola-Asynchoronous Mode, a READ opera-
                 tion occurs if this pin is held at a logic "1", coincident to a falling edge of the RD/DS* (Data Strobe)
                 input pin. Similarly, a WRITE operation occurs if this pin is at a logic "0", coincident to a falling edge of
                 the RD/DS* (Data Strobe) input pin.
  RDY_DTACK      Ready or DTACK (Data Transfer Acknowledge) Output pin:
                 The exact function of this output pin depends upon which mode the Microprocessor Interface has
                 been configured to operate in, as described below.
                 Intel-Asynchronous Mode - READY Output - RDY*:
                 If the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in the Intel-Asynchronous Mode, then
                 this output pin will function as the "Active-low" READY Output:
                 During a READ or WRITE cycle, the Microprocessor Interface block will toggle this output pin to the
                 logic low level, ONLY when it (the Microprocessor Interface) is ready to complete or terminate the cur-
                 rent READ or WRITE cycle.
                 If (during a READ or WRITE cycle) the Microprocessor Interface block is holding this output pin at a
                 logic "HIGH" level, then the Microprocessor is expected to extend this READ or WRITE cycle, until it
                 detects this output pin being toggled to the logic "LOW" level.
                 Motorola-Asynchronous Mode - Data Transfer Acknowledge Output - DTACK*:
                 If the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in the Motorola-Asynchronous Mode,
                 then this output pin will function as the "active-low" DTACK output.
                 During a READ or WRITE cycle, the Microprocessor Interface will toggle this output pin to the logic
                 "LOW" level, ONLY when it (the Microprocessor Interface) is ready to complete or terminate the cur-
                 rent READ or WRITE cycle. Once the Microprocessor has determined that this input pin has toggled
                 to the logic "low" level, then it is now safe for it to move on and execute the next READ or WRITE
                 cycle.
                 If (during a READ or WRITE cycle) the Microprocessor Interface block is holding this output pin at a
                 logic "HIGH" level, then the Microprocessor is expected to extend this READ or WRITE cycle, until it
                 detects this output pin being toggled to the logic "LOW" level.
         INT     Interrupt Output:
                 This active-low output signal will be asserted (pulled to a logic "LOW" level) whenever the XRT83L34
                 device is requesting interrupt service from the Microprocessor. The activation of this pin can be
                 blocked by setting the GIE bit to “0” in the Command Control register.

                If the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in

CONFIGURING THE MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE TO OPERATE IN THE INTEL-ASYNCHRONOUS
MODE
The user can configure the Microprocessor Interface to operate in the Intel-Asynchronous Mode by tying the
UPTS1 (Pin 106) to GND.
Finally, if the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in the Intel-Asynchronous Mode, then it
will perform READ and WRITE operations as described below.
THE INTEL-ASYNCHRONOUS READ CYCLE
If the Microprocessor Interface (of the XRT83L34 device) has been configured to operate in the Intel-
Asynchronous Mode, then the Microprocessor should do all of the following, anytime it wishes to read out the
contents of a register.
 1. Place the address of the "target" register (within the XRT83L34 device) on the Address Bus input pins,
     A[6:0].
 2. While the Microprocessor is placing this address value on the Address Bus, the Address Decoding circuitry
     (within the user’s system) should assert the CS* (Chip Select) input pin of the XRT83L34 device, by tog-
     gling it "LOW". This action enables further communication between the Microprocessor and the XRT83L34
     Microprocessor Interface block
 3. Toggle the ALE/AS (Address Latch Enable) input pin "HIGH". This step enables the "Address Bus" input
     drivers, within the Microprocessor Interface block of the XRT83L34 device.
 4. After allowing the data on the Address Bus pins to settle (by waiting the appropriate "Address Data Setup
     time"), the Microprocessor should toggle the ALE/AS input pin "LOW". This step causes the XRT83L34
     device to "latch" the contents of the "Address Bus" into its internal circuitry. At this point, the address of the
     register (within the XRT83L34 device) has now been selected.
 5. Next, the Microprocessor should indicate that this current bus cycle is a "READ" operation by toggling the
     "RD*/DS*" (Read Strobe) input pin "LOW". This action also enable the bi-directional data bus output driv-
     ers of the XRT83L34 device. At this point, the "Bi-Directional" Data Bus output drivers will proceed to drive
     the contents of the "latched" addressed onto the bi-directional data bus, D[7:0].
 6. Immediately after the Microprocessor toggles the "Read Strobe" (RD*/DS*) signal "low", the XRT83L34
     device will continue to drive the RDY*/DTACK* output pin "high". The XRT83L34 device does this in order
     to inform the Microprocessor that the data (to be read from the data bus) is "NOT READY" to be "latched"
     into the Microprocessor. In this case, the Microprocessor should continue to hold the "Read Strobe" (RD*/
     DS*) signal "LOW" until it detects the "RDY*/DTACK*" output pin toggling "LOW".
 7. After some settling time, the data on the "Bi-Directional" data bus will stabilize and can be read by the
     Microprocessor. At this time, the XRT83L34 device will indicate that this data can be read by toggling the
     RDY*/DTACK* (READY) signal "LOW".
 8. After the Microprocessor detects the RDY*/DTACK* signal (from the XRT83L34 device) toggling "LOW", it
     can then terminate the READ cycle by toggling the RD*/DS* (READ Strobe) input pin "HIGH".

THE INTEL-ASYNCHRONOUS WRITE CYCLE
If the Microprocessor Interface (of the XRT83L34 device) has been configured to operate in the Intel-
Asynchronous Mode, then the Microprocessor should do all of the following anytime that it wishes to write a
byte of data into a register within the XRT83L34 device.
 1. Place the address of the "target" register (within the XRT83L34 device) on the Address Bus Input pins,
     A[6:0].
 2. While the Microprocessor is placing the address value on the Address bus, the Address Decoding circuitry
     (within the user’s system) should assert the CS* (Chip Select) input pin of the XRT83L34 device by tog-
     gling it "LOW". This action enables further communication between the Microprocessor and the XRT83L34
     Microprocessor Interface.
 3. Toggle the ALE/AS (Address Latch Enable) input pin "HIGH". This step enables the "Address Bus" input
     drivers, within the Microprocessor Interface block of the XRT83L34 device.
 4. After allowing the data on the Address Bus pins to settle (by waiting the appropriate "Address Set-up" time)
     the Microprocessor should toggle the ALE/AS input pin "LOW". This step causes the XRT83L34 device to
     "latch" the contents of the "Address Bus" into its internal circuitry. At this point, the address of the register
     (within the XRT83L34 device) has now been selected.
 5. Next, the Microprocessor should then place the byte that it intends to write into the "target" register (within
     the XRT83L34 device), on the Bi-Direction Data Bus pins (D[7:0]).
 6. Afterwards, the Microprocessor should then indicate that this current bus cycle is a "Write" Operation; by
     toggling the WR*/R/W (Write Strobe) input pin "LOW". This active also enables the "Bi-Directional" Data
     Bus Input Drivers of the XRT83L34 device. At this point, the "Bi-Directional" data bus input drivers will pro-
     ceed to drive the contents (currently residing on the Bi-Directional Data Bus into the register that corre-
     sponds with the "latched" address.
 7. Immediately after the Microprocessor toggles the "Write Strobe" (WR*/R/W*) signal "LOW" the XRT83L34
     device will continue to drive the "RDY*/DTACK*" output pin "high". The XRT83L34 device does this in
     order to inform the Microprocessor that the data (to be written into the "target" address location, within the
     XRT83L34 device) is "NOT READY" to be latched into the Microprocessor Interface block circuitry (within
                                                                    54

REV. 1.0.1 QUAD T1/E1/J1 LH/SH TRANSCEIVER WITH CLOCK RECOVERY AND JITTER ATTENUATOR
     the XRT83L34 device). In this case, the Microprocessor should continue to hold the "Write Strobe" (WR*/
     R/W*) input pin "LOW" until it detects the "RDY*/DTACK*" output pin toggling "HIGH".
 8. After waiting the appropriate amount of time for the data (on the Bi-Directional Data Bus) to stabilize and
     can be safely accepted by the Microprocessor Interface block circuitry (within the XRT83L34 device); the
     XRT83L34 device will indicate that this data can be latched into the "target" address location by toggling
     the RDY*/DTACK* output pin "LOW".
 9. After the Microprocessor detects the RDY*/DTACK* signal (from the XRT83L34 device) toggling "LOW", it
     can then terminate the WRITE cycle by toggling the WR*/R/W* (Write Strobe) input pin "HIGH".
NOTE: Once the user toggles the "WR*/R/W* (Write Strobe) input pin "HIGH", then the Microprocessor Interface (of the
        XRT83L34 device) will latch the contents of the Bi-Directional Data Bus (D[7:0]) into the "target" address location o
        of the chip.

                                  Motorola-Asynchronous Mode, then pulling this input pin "LOW enables
                                  the "input" bus drivers for the Address Bus Input pins.
                                  During each READ or WRITE operation, the user is expected to drive
                                  this input pin "LOW" after (or around the time that) he/she has places the
                                  address (of the "target" register) onto the Address Bus pins (A[6:0]). The
                                  user is then expected to hold this input pin "LOW" for the remainder of
                                  the READ or WRITE cycle.
                                  NOTE: It is permissible to tie the ALE_AS* and CS* input pins together..
                                           Read and Write operations will be performed properly if ALE_AS

                                  Input signal.

                                  "active-low" DTACK Output.
                                  During a READ or WRITE cycle, the Microprocessor Interface block will
                                  toggle this output pin to the logic low level, ONLY when it (the Micropro-
                                  cessor Interface) is ready to complete or terminate the current READ or
                                  WRITE cycle. Once the Microprocessor has determined that this input
                                  pin has toggled to the logic "LOW" level, then it is now safe for it to move
                                  on and execute the next READ or WRITE cycle.
                                  If (during a READ or WRITE cycle) the Microprocessor Interface block is
                                  output pin at a logic "HIGH" level, then the Microprocessor is expected to
                                  extend this READ or WRITE cycle, until it detects this output pin being

                                  In the Motorola Mode, a READ operation occurs if this pin is held at a

ASYNCHRONOUS MODE
The user can configure the Microprocessor Interface to operate in the Motorola-Asynchronous Mode by tying
the UPTS1 (Pin 106) to the logic "HIGH" level.
Finally, if the Microprocessor Interface has been configured to operate in the Motorola-Asynchronous Mode,
then it will perform READ and WRITE operations as described below.
THE MOTOROLA-ASYNCHRONOUS READ-CYCLE:
If the Microprocessor Interface (of the XRT83L34 device) has been configured to operate in the Motorola-
Asynchronous Mode, then the Microprocessor Interface should do all of the following, anytime it wishes to read
out the contents of a register within the XRT83L34 device.
 1. Place the address of the "target" register within the XRT83L34 device, on the Address Bus Input pins,
     A[6:0].
 2. While the Microprocessor is placing the address value on the Address Bus, the Address Decoding circuitry
     (within the user’s system) should assert the CS* (Chip Select input) pin of the XRT83L34 device, by tog-
     gling it "LOW". This action enables further communication between the MIcroprocessor and the XRT83L34
     Microprocessor Interface block.
 3. Assert the ALE/AS (Address Strobe) input pin by toggling it "LOW". This step enables the Address Bus
     input drivers, within the Microprocessor Interface block of the XRT83L34 device.
 4. Afterwards, the Microprocessor should indicate that this cycle is a "READ" cycle by setting the WR*/R/W*
     (R/W*) input pin "HIGH".
 5. Next, the Microprocessor should initiate the current bus cycle by toggling the RD*/DS* (Data Strobe) input
     pin "LOW". This step enables the bi-directional data bus output drivers, within the XRT83L34 device. At
     this point, the bi-directional data bus output drivers will proceed to drive the contents of the "Addressed"
     register onto the bi-directional data bus, D[7:0].
 6. Immediately after the Microprocessor toggles the "Data Strobe" (RD*/DS*) signal "LOW", the XRT83L34
     device will continue to drive the RDY*/DTACK* output pin "HIGH". The XRT83L34 device does this in order
     to inform the Microprocessor that the data (to be read from the data bus) is "NOT READY" to be latched
     into the Microprocessor. In this case, the Microprocessor should continue to hold the "Data Strobe" (RD*/
     DS*) signal "LOW" until it detects the "RDY*/DTACK*" output pin toggling "LOW".
 7. After some settling time, the data on the "Bi-Directional" Data Bus will stabilize and can be read by the
     Microprocessor. The XRT83L34 device will indicate that this data can be read by asserting the RDY*/
     DTACK* (DTACK) output signal (by toggling it "LOW").
 8. After the Microprocessor detects the RDY*/DTACK* signal (from the XRT83L34 device) toggling "LOW", it
     can now terminate the Ready Cycle by toggling the "RD*/DS*" (Data Strobe) input pin "HIGH".

THE MOTOROLA-ASYNCHRONOUS WRITE CYCLE
If the Microprocessor Interface (of the XRT83L34 device) has been configured to operate in the Motorola-
Asynchronous Mode, then the Microprocessor should do all of the following, anytime it wishes to write a byte of
data into a register within the XRT83L34 device.
 1. Place the address of the "target" register within the XRT83L34 device, on the Address Bus input pins,
     A[6:0].
 2. While the Microprocessor is placing the address value on the Address Bus, the Address Decoding circuitry
     (within the user’s system) should assert the CS* (Chip Select) input pin of the XRT83L34 device, by tog-
     gling it "LOW". This action enables further communication between the Microprocessor and the XRT83L34
     Microprocessor Interface.
 3. Assert the ALE/AS (Address Strobe) input pin by toggling it "LOW". This step enables the "Address Bus"
     input drivers, within the Microprocessor Interface block of the XRT83L34 device.
 4. Afterwards, the Microprocessor Interface should indicate that this current bus cycle is a "WRITE" operation
     by toggling the WR*/R/W* (R/W*) input pin "LOW".
 5. The Microprocessor should then place the byte or word that it intends to write into the "target" register, on
     the bi-direction data bus, D[7:0].
 6. Next, the Microprocessor should initiate the bus cycle by toggling the RD*/DS* (Data Strobe) input pin
     "LOW". When the XRT83L34 device senses that the WR/R/W* (R/W*) input pin is "HIGH" and that the
     RD*/DS* (Data Strobe) input pin has toggled "LOW", it will enable the "input drivers" of the bi-directional
     data bus, D[7:0].
 7. Immediately after the Microprocessor toggles the RD*/DS* (Data Strobe) signal "LOW", the XRT83L34
     device will continue to drive the "RDY*/DTACK* output pin "HIGH". The XRT83L34 device does this in
     order to inform the Microprocessor that the data (to be written into the "target" address location, within the
     XRT83L34 device) is "NOT READY" to be latched into the Microprocessor Interface circuitry (within the
     XRT83L34 device). In this case, the Microprocessor should continue to hold the "Data Strobe" (RD*/DS*)
     input pin "LOW" until it detects the "RDY*/DTACK* output pin toggling "HIGH".
                                                                    58

8. After waiting the appropriate time for the data (on the bi-directional data bus) to settle and can be safely
    accepted by the Microprocessor, the XRT83L34 device will indicate that this data can now be latched into
    the "target" address location by toggling the "RDY*/DTACK*" output pin "LOW.
9. After the Microprocessor detects the RDY*/DTACK* signal (from the XRT83L34 device) toggling "LOW", it
    can then terminate the WRITE cycle by toggling the "RD*/DS*" (Data Strobe) input pin "HIGH".
NOTE: Once the user toggles the "RD*/DS* (Data Strobe) input pin "HIGH", then the following two things will happen.
1. The XRT83L34 device will latch the contents of the bi-directional data bus into the Microprocessor Inter-
    face block.
2. The XRT83L34 device will terminate the "WRITE" cycle.

MICROPROCESSOR REGISTER TABLES
The microprocessor interface consists of 256 addressable locations. Each channel uses 16 dedicated 7 bit
registers for independent programming and control. There are four additional registers for global control of all
channels and two registers for device identification and revision numbers. The remaining registers are for
factory test and future expansion. The control register map and the function of the individual bits are
summarized in Table 18 and Table 19 respectively.

                            NLCDE0 = “0”, the chip is manually programmed to monitor
                            the receive data for the Loop-Up or Loop-Down code respec-
                            tively.When the presence of the “00001” or “001” pattern is
                            detected for more than 5 seconds, the status of the NLCD bit is
                            set to “1” and if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, an interrupt is
                            initiated.The Host has the option to control the Loop-Back
                            function manually.
                            Setting the NLCDE1 = “1” and NLCDE0 = “1” enables the
                            Automatic Loop-Code detection and Remote Loop-Back acti-
                            vation mode. As this mode is initiated, the state of the NLCD

                            itor the receive data for the Loop-Up code. If the “00001” pat-
                            tern is detected for longer than 5 seconds, the NLCD bit is set
                            “1”, Remote Loop-Back is activated and the chip is automati-

                            Down code. The NLCD bit stays set even after the chip stops
                            receiving the Loop-Up code. The Remote Loop-Back condition
                            is removed when the chip receives the Loop-Down code for
                            more than 5 seconds or if the Automatic Loop-Code detection

                              stream of the selected channel number n. Bipolar violation can
                              be inserted either in the QRSS pattern, or input data when
                              operating in single-rail mode. The state of this bit is sampled
                              on the rising edge of the respective TCLK_n.

                              to 1:2.45. In the internal termination mode the transmitter
                              transformer ratio is permanently set to 1:2 and the state of this
                              bit has no effect.

     D3           NLCD_n    Network Loop-Code Detection:                                        RO     0
                            This bit operates differently in the Manual or the Automatic
                            Network Loop-Code detection modes.
                            In the Manual Loop-Code detection mode, (NLCDE1 = “0”
                            and NLCDE0 = “1” or NLCDE1 = “1” and NLCDE0 = “0”) this
                            bit gets set to “1” as soon as the Loop-Up (“00001”) or Loop-
                            Down (“001”) code is detected in the receive data for longer
                            than 5 seconds. The NLCD bit stays in the “1” state for as long
                            as the chip detects the presence of the Loop-code in the
                            receive data and it is reset to “0” as soon as it stops receiving
                            it. In this mode, if the NLCD interrupt is enabled, the chip will
                            initiate an interrupt on every transition of the NLCD.
                            When the Automatic Loop-code detection mode, (NLCDE1
                            = “1” and NLCDE0 =”1”) is initiated, the state of the NLCD
                            interface bit is reset to “0” and the chip is programmed to mon-
                            itor the receive input data for the Loop-Up code. This bit is set
                            to a “1” to indicate that the Network Loop Code is detected for
                            more than 5 seconds. Simultaneously the Remote Loop-Back
                            condition is automatically activated and the chip is pro-
                            grammed to monitor the receive data for the Network Loop
                            Down code. The NLCD bit stays in the “1” state for as long as
                            the Remote Loop-Back condition is in effect even if the chip
                            stops receiving the Loop-Up code. Remote Loop-Back is
                            removed if the chip detects the “001” pattern for longer than 5
                            seconds in the receive data.Detecting the “001” pattern also
                            results in resetting the NLCD interface bit and initiating an
                            interrupt provided the NLCD interrupt enable bit is active.
                            When programmed in Automatic detection mode, the
                            NLCD interface bit stays “High” for the entire time the Remote
                            Loop-Back is active and initiate an interrupt anytime the status
                            of the NLCD bit changes. In this mode, the Host can monitor
                            the state of the NLCD bit to determine if the Remote Loop-
                            Back is activated.

                            cate All Ones Signal is detected by the receiver. The value of
                            this bit is based on the current status of Alarm Indication Signal
                            detector of channel n. If the AISDIE bit is enabled, any transi-
                            tion on this bit will generate an Interrupt.
     D1           RLOS_n    Receive Loss of Signal: This bit is set to a “1” to indicate that   RO     0
                            the receive input signal is lost. The value of this bit is based on
                            the current status of the receive input signal of channel n. If the
                            RLOSIE bit is enabled, any transition on this bit will generate
                            an Interrupt.
     D0          QRPD_n     Quasi-random Pattern Detection: This bit is set to a “1” to         RO     0
                            indicate the receiver is currently in synchronization with QRSS
                            pattern. The value of this bit is based on the current status of
                            Quasi-random pattern detector of channel n. If the QRPDIE bit
                            is enabled, any transition on this bit will generate an Interrupt.

CLOCK SELECT REGISTER
The input clock source is used to generate all the necessary clock references internally to the LIU. The
microprocessor timing is derived from a PLL output which is chosen by programming the Clock Select Bits and
the Master Clock Rate in register 0x41h. Therefore, if the clock selection bits or the MCLRATE bit are being
programmed, the frequency of the PLL output will be adjusted accordingly. During this adjustment, it is
important to "Not" write to any other bit location within the same register while selecting the input/output clock
frequency. For best results, whenever the user is changing bits D[6:3] (within the Clock Select Register), he/
she should execute a "Masked-Write" Operation, such that he/she will not change the remaining bits within this

Programming Examples:
Example 1: Changing bits D[6:3]
If bits D[6:3] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the microprocessor
only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 2: Changing bits D[7] and D[2:0]
If bits D[7] and D[2:0] are the only values within the register that will change in a WRITE process, the
microprocessor only needs to initiate ONE write operation.
Example 3: Changing bits within D[6:3] and the other bits
In this scenario, one must initiate TWO write operations such that bits D[6:3] and the other bits do not change
within ONE write cycle. It is recommended that bits D[6:0] and the other bits be treated as two independent
sub-registers. One can either change the clock selection bits and then change bits D[7] and D[2:0] on the
SECOND write, or vice-versa. No order or sequence is necessary.
