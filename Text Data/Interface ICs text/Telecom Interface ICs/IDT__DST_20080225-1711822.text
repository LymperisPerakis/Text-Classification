device. After the RESET pin is asserted high, all the registers are in their
default values and can be accessed after 2 ms (refer to Figure 37).

   During normal operation, the device can be reset by hardware or
software anytime. When it is hardware reset, the RESET pin should be
asserted low for at least 100 ns. Then all the registers are in their default             RESET
values and can be accessed after 2 ms (refer to Figure 38). When it is
software reset, a write signal to the Software Reset register will reset all                                               2ms

be reset by the hardware reset.
   It should be mentioned that when the setting in the T1/J1 Or E1                     Figure 38. Hardware Reset In Normal Operation

5.2      REGISTER DESCRIPTION
    Depending on the operating mode, the registers are configured for T1/J1 or E1. Before setting any other registers, the operating mode should be
selected in registers 020H, 120H, 220H and 320H.
    According to the access method, the registers can be divided into direct registers and indirect registers. In the direct registers, the registers can be
divided into global configuration registers and per-link configuration registers. The register with only one address following its name is the global
configuration register, and the register with a set of address (four addresses) following its name is the per-link configuration register.

   The following setting lists the standard values of normal amplitude in different operating modes. Each step change (one increasing or decreasing
from the standard value) will scale the amplitude of the D/A output by a certain offset. These bits are only effective when user programmable arbitrary
waveform is used.
   = 000100: Normal amplitude in T1 long haul LBO/-22.5 dB operating mode. Each step change scales about 25% offset.
   = 001000: Normal amplitude in T1 long haul LBO/-15 dB operating mode. Each step change scales about 12.5% offset.
   = 010001: Normal amplitude in T1 long haul LBO/-7.5 dB operating mode. Each step change scales about 6.25% offset.

    These bits give a binary number to define the channel offset. The channel offset is between the framing pulse on the RSFSn/MRSFS pin and the
start of the corresponding frame output on the RSDn/MRSDA(MRSDB) pin. The signaling bits on the RSIGn/MRSIGA(MRSIGB) pin are always per-
channel aligned with the data on the RSDn/MRSDA(MRSDB) pin.
    In Non-multiplexed mode, the channel offset can be configured from 0 to 23 channels (0 & 23 are included). In Multiplexed mode, the channel
offset can be configured from 0 to 127 channels (0 & 127 are included).

M2O[2:1]:
    In SF format, these two bits define the threshold of the F Bit Error numbers in N-bit sliding F bits window. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of
synchronization.
    In ESF format, these two bits define the threshold of the Frame Alignment Bit Error numbers in N-bit sliding Frame Alignment bits window.
Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.
    In T1 DM format, these two bits define the threshold of the 7-bit pattern error numbers in N-pattern sliding 7-bit patterns window. The 7-bit pattern
consists of the 6-bit DDS pattern and its following F-bit. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.
    In SLC-96 format, these two bits define the threshold of the Ft bit error numbers in N-bit sliding Ft bits window or the Fs bit error numbers in N-bit
sliding Fs bits in Frame (2n) (0<n<12 and n=36) window. Exceeding the threshold will lead to out of synchronization.

   The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
ADRM[1:0]:
   These two bits select the address comparison mode in HDLC mode.
   = 00: No address is compared.
   = 01: High byte address is compared.
   = 10: Low byte address is compared.
   = 11: Both high byte address and low byte address are compared.
RHDLCM:
   = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
   = 1: Reserved.
RRST:
   A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Receiver. The reset will clear the FIFO, the PACK bit (b0, T1/J1-095H,... /
   096H,... / 097H,...) and the EMP bit (b1, T1/J1-095H,... / 096H,... / 097H,...).

OVFLI:
   The overwritten condition will occur if data is still attempted to write into the FIFO when the FIFO has already been full (128 bytes).
   = 0: No overwriting occurs.
   = 1: The overwriting occurs.
   This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.
RMBEI:
   = 0: No block is pushed into the FIFO.
   = 1: A block of the HDLC packet is pushed into the FIFO.
   This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.

HA[7:0]:
    In HDLC mode, when high byte address comparison or both bytes address comparison is required, the high byte address position (the byte
following the opening flag) is compared with the value in these bits, or with ‘0xFC’ or ‘0xFE’. The HA[1] bit (the ‘C/R’ bit position) is excluded to
compare.

   The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
EOM:
   A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit indicates an entire HDLC packet is stored in the FIFO and starts the packet transmission.
ABORT:
   = 0: Disable the manual abort sequence insertion.
   = 1: The abort sequence (‘01111111’) is manually inserted to the current HDLC packet.
   This bit is self-cleared after the abortion.
THDLCM:
   = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
   = 1: Reserved.
TRST:
   A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Transmitter. The reset will clear the FIFO.

   The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
UDRUNI:
   When the FIFO is empty and the last transmitted byte is not the end of the current HDLC packet, the under-run occurs. This bit indicates whether
the under-run occurs.
   = 0: No under-run occurs.
   = 1: Under-run occurs.
   This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.
RDYI:
   = 0: There is no status change on the RDY bit (b0, T1/J1-0B0H,... / 0B1H,... / 0B2H,...).
   = 1: There is a transition (from ‘0’ to ‘1’) on the RDY bit (b0, T1/J1-0B0H,... / 0B1H,... / 0B2H,...).
   This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.

5.2.1.2 Indirect Register
PMON:
   The PMON Counter Mapping Registers (00H ~ 0BH) of a link are updated as a group in the following ways:
   • A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the UPDAT bit (b1, T1/J1-0C2H,...) updates all the registers;
   • If the AUTOUPD bit (b0, T1/J1-0C2H,...) is set to ‘1’, the registers will be updated every one second;

   bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than
   16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than Q dB
   below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, E1-029H,...)) for 32 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater
   than (Q + 4 dB) and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods.
   = 1: The I.431/ETSI is selected. In short haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is less than 800 mVpp for 2048
   consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming signal level is greater than 1 Vpp and has an average mark density of at least 12.5%
   and less than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit periods. In long haul application, the LOS is declared when the incoming signal level is
   less than Q dB below nominal (set in the LOS[4:0] bits (b4~0, E1-029H,...)) for 2048 consecutive bit intervals and is cleared when the incoming
   signal level is greater than (Q + 4 dB) and has an average mark density of at least 12.5% and less than 16 consecutive zeros in 32 consecutive bit

   when there is a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the CNT_TRF bit.
   = 1: The Auto Report mode is selected. The internal 16-bit EXZ counter transfers its content to the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers
   every one second automatically.
CNT_TRF:
   This bit is valid when the CNT_MD bit is ‘0’.
   A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit updates the content in the EXZ Error Counter L-Byte & H-Byte registers with the value in the internal 16-bit EXZ
counter.
   This bit must be cleared and set again for the next updating.

   The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
EMP:
   = 0: The FIFO is not empty.
   = 1: The FIFO is empty, i.e., all the blocks are read from the FIFO.
   The corresponding HDLC Receiver reset will clear this bit.
PACK:
   = 0: The byte read from the FIFO is not an overhead byte.
   = 1: The byte read from the FIFO is an overhead byte.
   The corresponding HDLC Receiver reset will clear this bit.

    The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different RHDLC.
HA[7:0]:
    In HDLC mode, when high byte address comparison or both bytes address comparison is required, the high byte address position (the byte
following the opening flag) is compared with the value in these bits, or with ‘0xFC’ or ‘0xFE’. The HA[1] bit (the ‘C/R’ bit position) is excluded to
compare.

   The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
EOM:
   A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on this bit indicates an entire HDLC packet is stored in the FIFO and starts the packet transmission.
ABORT:
   = 0: Disable the manual abort sequence insertion.
   = 1: The abort sequence (‘01111111’) is manually inserted to the current HDLC packet.
   This bit is self-cleared after the abortion.
THDLCM:
   = 0: HDLC mode is selected.
   = 1: Reserved.
TRST:
   A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the this bit resets the corresponding HDLC Transmitter. The reset will clear the FIFO.

   The function of the above three sets of registers are the same. However, they correspond to different THDLC.
UDRUNI:
   When the FIFO is empty and the last transmitted byte is not the end of the current HDLC packet, the under-run occurs. This bit indicates whether
the under-run occurs.
   = 0: No under-run occurs.
   = 1: Under-run occurs.
   This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.
RDYI:
   = 0: There is no status change on the RDY bit (b0, E1-0B0H,... / 0B1H,... / 0B2H,...).
   = 1: There is a transition (from ‘0’ to ‘1’) on the RDY bit (b0, E1-0B0H,... / 0B1H,... / 0B2H,...).
   This bit will be cleared if a ’1’ is written to it.

5.2.2.2 Indirect Register
PMON:
   The PMON Counter Mapping Registers (00H ~ 0FH) of a link are updated as a group in the following ways:
   • A transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ on the UPDAT bit (b1, E1-0C2H,...) updates all the registers;
   • If the AUTOUPD bit (b0, E1-0C2H,...) is set to ‘1’, the registers will be updated every one second;

   Code
   000         EXTEST      The external test instruction allows testing of the interconnection to other devices. When the current instruction is the EXTEST instruction,
                           the boundary scan register is placed between TDI and TDO. The signal on the input pins can be sampled by loading the boundary scan
                           register using the Capture-DR state. The sampled values can then be viewed by shifting the boundary scan register using the Shift-DR
                           state. The signal on the output pins can be controlled by loading patterns shifted in through input TDI into the boundary scan register
                           using the Update-DR state.
   010        SAMPLE /     The sample/preload instruction is used to allow scanning of the boundary-scan register without causing interference to the normal opera-
              PRELOAD      tion of the on-chip system logic. Data received at system input pins is supplied without modification to the on-chip system logic; data from
                           the on-chip system logic is driven without modification through the system output pins. SAMPLE allows a snapshot to be taken of the data
                           flowing from the system pins to the on-chip system logic or vice versa, without interfering with the normal operation of the assembled
                           board. PRELOAD allows an initial data pattern to be placed at the latched parallel outputs of boundary-scan register cells prior to selec-
                           tion of another boundary-scan test operation.
   001         IDCODE      The identification instruction is used to connect the identification register between TDI and TDO. The device’s identification code can then
                           be shifted out using the Shift-DR state.
   111         BYPASS      The BYPASS instruction shifts data from input TDI to output TDO with one TCK clock period delay. The instruction is used to bypass the
                           device.
   011          CLAMP      This instruction allows the state of the signals driven from device pins to be determined from the boundary-scan register while the bypass
                           register is selected as the serial path between TDI and TDO. The signals driven from the device pins will not change while the CLAMP
                           instruction is selected.
   010          HIGHZ      Use of the HIGHZ instruction places the device in a state in which all of its system logic outputs are placed in an inactive drive state (e.g.,
                           high impedance). In this state, and in-circuit test system may drive signals onto the connections normally driven by a device output with-
                           out incurring the risk of damage to the device.

  Test Logic In this state, the test logic is disabled to continue normal operation of the device. During initialization, the device initializes the instruction register with
    Reset    the IDCODE instruction.
             Regardless of the original state of the controller, the controller enters the Test-Logic-Reset state when the TMS input is held high for at least 5 rising
             edges of TCK. The controller remains in this state while TMS is high.
  Run-Test/  This is a controller state between scan operations. Once in this state, the controller remains in the state as long as TMS is held low. The instruction reg-
      Idle   ister and all test data registers retain their previous state. When TMS is high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Select-DR
             state.
    Select-  This is a temporary controller state and the instruction does not change in this state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its
  DR-Scan    previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-DR state and a scan
             sequence for the selected test data register is initiated. If TMS is held high and a rising edge applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Select-IR-Scan
             state.
   Capture-  In this state, the Boundary Scan Register captures input pin data if the current instruction is EXTEST or SAMPLE/PRELOAD. The instruction does not
      DR     change in this state. The other test data registers, which do not have parallel input, are not changed. When the TAP controller is in this state and a ris-
             ing edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
   Shift-DR  In this controller state, the test data register connected between TDI and TDO as a result of the current instruction shifts data on stage toward its serial
             output on each rising edge of TCK. The instruction does not change in this state. When the TAP controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to
             TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-DR state if TMS is high or remains in the Shift-DR state if TMS is low.
  Exit1-DR   This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-DR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.

Table 85: TAP Controller State Description (Continued)
    State                                                                                 Description
   Pause-    The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the test data register in the serial path between TDI and TDO.
     DR      For example, this state could be used to allow the tester to reload its pin memory from disk during application of a long test sequence. The test data
             register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this
             state as long as TMS is low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-DR state.
  Exit2-DR   This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-DR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-DR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
   Update-   The Boundary Scan Register is provided with a latched parallel output to prevent changes while data is shifted in response to the EXTEST and SAM-
     DR      PLE/PRELOAD instructions. When the TAP controller is in this state and the Boundary Scan Register is selected, data is latched into the parallel output
             of this register from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. The data held at the latched parallel output changes only in this state. All shift-reg-
             ister stages in the test data register selected by the current instruction retain their previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Select-IR- This is a temporary controller state. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous state. If TMS is held low and a rising
    Scan     edge is applied to TCK when in this state, the controller moves into the Capture-IR state, and a scan sequence for the instruction register is initiated. If
             TMS is held high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Test-Logic-Reset state. The instruction does not change during this
             state.
  Capture-   In this controller state, the shift register contained in the instruction register loads a fixed value of '100' on the rising edge of TCK. This supports fault-
      IR     isolation of the board-level serial test data path. Data registers selected by the current instruction retain their value and the instruction does not change
             during this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or
             the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
   Shift-IR  In this state, the shift register contained in the instruction register is connected between TDI and TDO and shifts data one stage towards its serial output
             on each rising edge of TCK. The test data register selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change dur-
             ing this state. When the controller is in this state and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Exit1-IR state if TMS is held high, or
             remains in the Shift-IR state if TMS is held low.
   Exit1-IR  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Pause-IR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Pause-IR   The pause state allows the test controller to temporarily halt the shifting of data through the instruction register. The test data register selected by the
             current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state. The controller remains in this state as long as TMS is
             low. When TMS goes high and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller moves to the Exit2-IR state.
   Exit2-IR  This is a temporary state. While in this state, if TMS is held high, a rising edge applied to TCK causes the controller to enter the Update-IR state, which
             terminates the scanning process. If TMS is held low and a rising edge is applied to TCK, the controller enters the Shift-IR state. The test data register
             selected by the current instruction retains its previous value and the instruction does not change during this state.
  Update-IR The instruction shifted into the instruction register is latched into the parallel output from the shift-register path on the falling edge of TCK. When the
             new instruction has been latched, it becomes the current instruction. The test data registers selected by the current instruction retain their previous
             value.
