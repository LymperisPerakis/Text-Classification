 2.0 PIN DESCRIPTIONS
There are six types of pins defined throughout this pin description and the corresponding symbol is presented
in table below. The per-channel pin is indicated by the channel number or the letter ’n’ which is appended at the
end of the signal name, for example, TxSERn, where "n" indicates channels 0 and 2. All output pins are "tri-
stated" upon hardware RESET.

     TxSER2/      L18                  The exact function of these pins depends on the mode of opera-
     TxPOS2                            tion selected, as described below.
                                       DS1/E1 Mode - TxSERn
                                       These pins function as the transmit serial data input on the system
                                       side interface, which are latched on the rising edge of the TxSER-
                                       CLKn pin. Any payload data applied to this pin will be inserted into
                                       an outbound DS1/E1 frame and output to the line. In DS1 mode,
                                       the framing alignment bits, facility data link bits, CRC-6 bits, and
                                       signaling information can also be inserted from this input pin if
                                       configured appropriately. In E1 mode, all data intended to be
                                       transported via Time Slots 1 through 15 and Time slots 17 through
                                       31 must be applied to this input pin. Data intended for Time Slots 0
                                       and 16 can also be applied to this input pin If configured accord-
                                       ingly.
                                       DS1 or E1 High-Speed Multiplexed Mode* - TxSERn
                                       In this mode, these pins are used as the high-speed multiplexed
                                       data input pin on the system side. High-speed multiplexed data of
                                       channels 0-3 must be applied to TxSER0 in a byte or bit-inter-
                                       leaved way. The framer latches in the multiplexed data on
                                       TxSER0 using TxMSYNC/TxINCLK and demultiplexes this data
                                       into 4 serial streams. The LIU block will then output the data to the
                                       line interface using TxSERCLKn.
                                       DS1 or E1 Framer Bypass Mode - TxPOSn
                                       In this mode, TxSERn is used for the positive digital input pin
                                       (TxPOSn) to the LIU.

                                      When TxSERCLKn is configured as Input:
                                      These pins will be inputs if the TxSERCLK is chosen as the timing
                                      source for the transmit framer. Users must provide a 1.544MHz
                                      clock rate to this input pin for T1 mode of operation, and

                                      In this mode, TxSERCLK is an optional clock signal input which is
                                      used as the timing source for the transmit line interface, and is
                                      only required if TxSERCLK is chosen as the timing source for the
                                      transmit framer. If TxSERCLK is chosen as the timing source, sys-
                                      tem equipment should provide 1.544MHz (For T1 mode) or

                                      MCLK PLL is chosen as the timing source of the device.
                                      High speed or multiplexed data is latched into the device using the

                                       These TxSYNCn pins are used to indicate the single frame
                                       boundary within an outbound T1/E1 frame. In both DS1 or E1
                                       mode, the single frame boundary repeats every 125 microsec-
                                       onds (8kHz).
                                       In DS1/E1 base rate, TxSYNCn can be configured as either input

                                       input fractional data, as described below.

                                       This pin indicates the boundary of each time slot of an outbound
                                       DS1/E1 frame. In T1 mode, each of these output pins is a 192kHz
                                       clock which pulses "High" during the LSB of each 24 time slots. In
                                       E1 mode, each of these output pins is a 256kHz clock which
                                       pulses "High" during the LSB of each 32 time slots. The Terminal

                                       If transmit fractional/signaling interface is enabled:
                                       TxCHCLKn is the fractional interface clock which either outputs a
                                       clock signal for the time slot that has been configured to input frac-

                                       so that fractional data can be clocked into the device using the
                                       TxSERCLK pin.

                                      These pins can be used to input robbed-bit signaling data to be
                                      inserted within an outbound DS1 frame or to input Channel Asso-

                                      described below.
                                      T1 Mode: Signaling data (A,B,C,D) of each channel must be pro-
                                      vided on bit 4,5,6,7 of each time slot on the TxSIG pin if 16-code
                                      signaling is used. If 4-code signaling is selected, signaling data
                                      (A,B) of each channel must be provided on bit 4, 5 of each time
                                      slot on the TxSIG pin. If 2-code signaling is selected, signaling
                                      data (A) of each channel must be provided on bit 4 of each time
                                      slot on the TxSIG pin.
                                      E1 Mode: Signaling data in E1 mode can be provided on the
                                      TxSIGn pins on a time-slot-basis as in T1 mode, or it can be pro-
                                      vided on time slot 16 only via the TxSIGn input pins. In the latter
                                      case, signaling data (A,B,C,D) of channel 1 and channel 17 must
                                      be inserted on the TxSIGn pin during time slot 16 of frame 1, sig-

                                      inserted on the TxSIGn pin during time slot 16 of frame 2...etc.
                                      The CAS multiframe Alignments bits (0000 bits) and the extra bits/
                                      alarm bit (xyxx) must be inserted on the TxSIGn pin during time
                                      slot 16 of frame 0.
                                      NOTE:       Transmit fractional interface can be enabled by
                                                programming to bit 4 - TxFr1544/TxFr2048 bit from

      TxOH2       P15                    The exact function of these pins depends on the mode of oper-
                                         ation selected, as described below.
                                         DS1 Mode
                                         These pins operate as the source of Datalink bits which will be
                                         inserted into the Datalink bits within an outbound DS1 frame if
                                         the framer is configured accordingly. Datalink Equipment can
                                         provide data to this input pin using the TxOHCLKn clock at
                                         either 2kHz or 4kHz depending on the transmit datalink band-
                                         width selected.
                                         NOTE: This input pin will be disabled if the framer is using the
                                                   Transmit HDLC Controller, or the TxSER input as the
                                                   source for the Data Link Bits.
                                         E1 Mode
                                         These pins operate as the source of Datalink bits or Signaling
                                         bits depending on the framer configuration, as described
                                         below.
                                         Sourcing Datalink bits from TxOHn:
                                         The E1 transmit framer will output a clock edge on TxOHCLKn
                                         for each Sa bit that has been configured to carry datalink infor-
                                         mation. Terminal equipment can then use TxOHCLKn to pro-
                                         vide datalink bits on TxOHn to be inserted into the Sa bits
                                         within an outbound E1 frame.
                                         Sourcing Signaling bits from TxOHn:
                                         Users must provide signaling data on TxOHn pins on time slot
                                         16 only. Signaling data (A,B,C,D) of channel 1 and channel 17
                                         must be inserted on the TxOHn pin during time slot 16 of frame
                                         1, signaling data (A,B,C,D) of channel 2 and channel 18 must
                                         be inserted on the TxOHn pin during time slot 16 of frame
                                         2...etc. The CAS multiframe Alignments bits (0000 bits) and
                                         the extra bits/alarm bit (xyxx) must be inserted on the TxOHn
                                         pin during time slot 16 of frame 0.
                                         NOTE:      These 8 pins are internally pulled “Low” for each
                                                   channel.

                                        below.

                                        If the TxOH pins have been configured to be the source for
                                        Datalink bits, the DS1 transmit framer will provide a clock edge
                                        for each Data Link Bit. In DS1 ESF mode, the TxOHCLK can

                                        Users must provide a signal which must pulse "High" for one
                                        period of RxSERCLK and repeats every 125µS. The receive
                                        serial Interface will output the first bit of an inbound DS1/E1
                                        frame during the provided RxSYNC pulse.
                                        NOTE:     It is imperative that the RxSYNC input signal be
                                                 synchronized with the RxSERCLK input signal.
                                        When RxSYNCn is configured as an Output:
                                        The receive T1/E1 framer will output a signal which pulses
                                        "High" for one period of RxSERCLK during the first bit of an
                                        inbound DS1/E1 frame.

                                        In this mode, RxSYNCn must be an input regardless of the slip
                                        buffer configuration. In 2.048MVIP/4.096/8.192MHz high-speed
                                        modes, RxSYNCn pins must be pulsed ’High’ for one period of
                                        RxSERCLK during the first bit of the inbound T1/E1 frame. In
                                        HMVIP mode, RxSYNC0 must be pulsed ’High’ for 4 clock
                                        cycles of the RxSERCLK signal in the position of the first two
                                        and the last two bits of a multiplexed frame. In H.100 mode,
                                        RxSYNC0 must be pulsed ’High’ for 2 clock cycles of the
                                        RxSERCLK signal in the position of the first and the last bit of a
                                        multiplexed frame.

                                        In this mode, RxSYNCn is used as the Receive negative digital
                                        output pin (RxNEG) from the LIU.

                                        NOTE: In DS1 high-speed modes, the DS-0 data is mapped

                                                 (don’t care).
                                        NOTE:     These 8 pins are internally pulled “Low” for each
                                                 channel.

                                        If receive fractional/signaling interface is disabled -

                                        These output pins (RxCHNn_4 through RxCHNn_0) reflect the
                                        five-bit binary value of the current time slot being output by the
                                        receive serial interface. System equipment can use the RxCH-
                                        CLKn to sample the five output pins of each channel to identify
                                        the time slot being output on these pins. RxCHNn_0 indicates
                                        the Least Significant Bit (LSB) of the time slot channel being
                                        output.

                                        These pins can be used to output robbed-bit signaling data
                                        within an inbound DS1 frame or to output Channel Associated
                                        Signaling (CAS) data within an inbound E1 frame, as described
                                        below.

                                        put on bit 4,5,6,7 of each time slot on the RxSIG pin if 16-code
                                        signaling is used. If 4-code signaling is selected, signaling data
                                        (A,B) of each channel will be output on bit 4, 5 of each time slot
                                        on the RxSIG pin. If 2-code signaling is selected, signaling data
                                        (A) of each channel will be output on bit 4 of each time slot on
                                        the RxSIG pin.
                                        E1 Mode: Signaling data in E1 mode will be output on the
                                        RxSIGn pins on a time-slot-basis as in T1 mode, or it can be
                                        output on time slot 16 only via the RxSIGn output pins. In the
                                        latter case, signaling data (A,B,C,D) of channel 1 and channel
                                        17 will be output on the RxSIGn pin during time slot 16 of frame
                                        1, signaling data (A,B,C,D) of channel 2 and channel 18 will be
                                        output on the RxSIGn pin during time slot 16 of frame 2...etc.
                                        The CAS multiframe Alignments bits (0000 bits) and the extra
                                        bits/alarm bit (xyxx) will be output on the RxSIGn pin during
                                        time slot 16 of frame 0.
                                        NOTE: Receive Fractional/signaling interface can be enabled
                                                  by programming to bit 4 - RxFr1544/RxFr2048 bit from

                                        RxCHN0 through RxCHN4 time slot identifier pins to determine
                                        which time slot is being output.
                                        If receive fractional/signaling interface is enabled:
                                        RxCHCLKn is the fractional interface clock which either outputs
                                        a clock signal for the time slot that has been configured to out-
                                        put fractional data, or outputs an enable signal for the fractional
                                        time slot so that fractional data can be clocked out of the device
                                        using the RxSERCLK pin.
                                        NOTE:      Receive fractional interface can be enabled by
                                                 programming to bit 4 - RxFr1544/RxFr2048 bit from

      RTIP2      J1                    RTIP is the positive differential input from the line interface. This

    RxLOS_1     G16                    The XRT86VL32 device will assert this output pin (i.e., toggle it
                                       “high”) anytime (and for the duration that) the Receive DS1/E1
                                       Framer or LIU block declares the LOS defect condition.
                                       Conversely, the XRT86VL32 device will tri-state this output pin any-
                                       time (and for the duration that) the Receive DS1/E1 Framer or LIU
                                       block is NOT declaring the LOS defect condition.
                                       NOTES:.
                                              1.  This output pin will toggle "high" (to denote that LOS is
                                                  being declared) whenever either the Receive DS1/E1
                                                  Framer or the Receive DS1/E1 LIU block (associated with
                                                  Channel N) declares the LOS defect condition. In other
                                                  words, the state of this output pin is a logic OR of the
                                                  Framer LOS and the LIU LOS condition.
                                              2.  Since the XRT86VL32 device tri-states this output pin
                                                  (anytime the channel is NOT declaring the LOS defect
                                                  condition). Therefore, the user MUST connect a "pull-
                                                  down" resistor (ranging from 1K to 10K) to each RxLOS
                                                  output pin, in order to pull this output pin to the logic
                                                  "LOW" condition, whenever the Channel is NOT declaring
                                                  the LOS defect condition.

                                                      The TCLK signal is the clock for the TAP controller, and it
                                                      generates the boundary scan data register clocking. The data

        TMS              C6          I         -      Test Mode Select: Boundary Scan Test Mode Select input.
                                                      The TMS signal controls the transitions of the TAP controller
                                                      in conjunction with the rising edge of the test clock (TCK).

                                                      The TRST signal (Active Low) asynchronously resets the TAP
                                                      controller to the Test-Logic-Reset state.

                                         These output pins are used to indicate that DMA transfers
                                         (Write) are requested by the T1/E1 Framer.
                                         On the transmit side (i.e., To transmit data from external DMA

                                         indicate that there is space for a complete message or cell.
                                         The DMA Write cycle starts by T1/E1 Framer asserting the
                                         DMA Request (REQ0) ‘low’, then the external DMA controller
                                         should drive the DMA Acknowledge (ACK0) ‘low’ to indicate
                                         that it is ready to start the transfer. The external DMA controller
                                         should place new data on the Microprocessor data bus each
                                         time the Write Signal is Strobed low if the WR is configured as
                                         a Write Strobe. If WR is configured as a direction signal, then
                                         the external DMA controller would place new data on the

                                         Strobed low.
                                         The Framer asserts this output pin (toggles it "Low") when at
                                         least one of the Transmit HDLC buffers are empty and can
                                         receive one more HDLC message.
                                         The Framer negates this output pin (toggles it “High”) when the
                                         HDLC buffer can no longer receive another HDLC message.

                                         The exact behavior of this pin depends upon the type of Micro-
                                         processor/Microcontroller the XRT86VL32 has been configured
                                         to operate in, as defined by the PTYPE[2:0] pins.
                                         Intel-Asynchronous Mode - WR* - Write Strobe Input:
                                         This input pin functions as the WR* (Active Low WRITE Strobe)
                                         input signal from the Microprocessor. Once this active-low sig-
                                         nal is asserted, then the input buffers (associated with the Bi-
                                         Directional Data Bus pin, D[7:0]) will be enabled.
                                         The Microprocessor Interface will latch the contents on the Bi-
                                         Directional Data Bus (into the “target” register or address loca-
                                         tion, within the XRT86VL32) upon the rising edge of this input
                                         pin.

                                         tion Identification Input Pin:
                                         This pin is functionally equivalent to the “R/W*” input pin. In the
                                         Motorola Mode, a “READ” operation occurs if this pin is held at
                                         a logic “1”, coincident to a falling edge of the RD/DS* (Data
                                         Strobe) input pin. Similarly a WRITE operation occurs if this pin
                                         is at a logic “0”, coincident to a falling edge of the RD/DS* (Data
                                         Strobe) input pin.

                                         This input pin will function as the “Read/Write Operation Identi-

                                         Anytime the Microprocessor Interface samples this input signal
                                         at a logic low (while also sampling the CS* input pin “low”) upon
                                         the rising edge of PCLK, then the Microprocessor Interface will
                                         (upon the very same rising edge of PCLK) latch the contents of

                                         cuitry, in preparation for this forthcoming READ operation. At
                                         some point (later in this READ operation) the Microprocessor
                                         will also assert the DBEN*/OE* input pin, and the Microproces-
                                         sor Interface will then place the contents of the “target” register
                                         (or address location within the XRT86VL32 device) upon the
                                         Bi-Directional Data Bus pins (D[7:0]), where it can be read by
                                         the Microprocessor.
                                         Anytime the Microprocessor Interface samples this input signal
                                         at a logic high (while also sampling the CS* input pin a logic
                                         “low”) upon the rising edge of PCLK, then the Microprocessor
                                         Interface will (upon the very same rising edge of PCLK) latch
                                         the contents of the Address Bus (A[14:0]) into the Microproces-

                                         Microprocessor will also assert the RD*/DS*/WE* input pin, and
                                         the Microprocessor Interface will then latch the contents of the

                                        Mode, then this input pin is used to indicate (to the Micropro-

                                        data transfer within the current burst operation.
                                        The Microprocessor should assert this input pin (by toggling it
                                        “Low”) in order to denote that the current READ or WRITE

MICROPROCESSOR INTERFACE I/O TIMING
INTEL INTERFACE TIMING - ASYNCHRONOUS
The signals used for the Intel microprocessor interface are: Address Latch Enable (ALE), Read Enable (RD),
Write Enable (WR), Chip Select (CS), Address and Data bits. The microprocessor interface uses minimum
external glue logic and is compatible with the timings of the 8051 or 80188 family of microprocessors. The ALE
signal can be tied ’HIGH’ if this signal is not available, and the corresponding timing interface is shown in
Figure 13 and Table 14.
