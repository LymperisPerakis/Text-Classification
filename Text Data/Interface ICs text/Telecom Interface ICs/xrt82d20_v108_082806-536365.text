    1     RLOS       O    Receiver Loss of Signal: This pin toggles Low to indicate the loss of signal at the
                          receive inputs.
    2    ClkLOS      O    Receiver Loss of Clock: With MuteRx=1, this pin will toggle low to indicate a loss
                          of clock has occurred when the receive signal is lost (RLOS=0). When RLOS=0, no
                          transitions occur on RClk, RPOS/RData and RNEG outputs.

          CODE            (pin 18=1), input activity on this pin determines whether the device is configured to
                          operate in single-rail or dual-rail mode. With n-rail transmit data applied to this pin,
                          the device is automatically configured to operate in dual-rail mode for both transmit
                          input and receive output.
                          If this pin is tied high for more than 16 clock cycles, the device is configured to oper-
                          ate in single-rail mode with HDB3 encoding and decoding functions enabled.
                          If this pin is tied low for more than 16 clock cycles, the device is configured to oper-
                          ate in single-rail mode with AMI encoding and decoding functions enabled. (internal
                          pull-down).
    4   RNEG/LCV     O    Receive Negative Data/Line Code Violation Output:
                          If the device is configured in Dual-rail mode with n-rail data applied to pin 3, then the
                          receive negative data will be output through this pin.
                          If the device is configured in Single-rail mode and operate with HDB3 coding
                          enabled, HDB3 code violation will be detected and cause this pin to go high.
                          If the device is configured in Single-rail mode and with AMI coding selected, every
                          bipolar violation will be reported at this pin.

                          Output receive clock signal to the terminal equipment.
    6     RPOS/      O    Receive Positive/ Data Output:
          RData           In Dual-rail mode, this signal is the p-rail receive output data. In Single-rail mode,
                          this signal is the receive output data.
    7      TClk       I   Transmitter Clock Input:
                          Input clock signal (2.048 MHz ± 50ppm)
    8     TPOS/       I   Transmit Positive / Data Input:
          TData           In Dual-rail mode, this signal is the p-rail transmit input data. In Single-rail mode,
                          this signal is the transmit input data.
    9     LLoop       I   Local Loop back enable (active low):
                          Tie this pin low to enable analog Local Loop-back.In local loop-back mode, transmit

    11      DLoop    I  Digital Loop Back enable (active low):
                        Connect this pin to ground to enable Digital Local Loop-back.In Digital loop-back
                        mode, transmit input data after the encoder is looped back to the jitter attenuator (if
                        selected) and to the receive decoder. Input data at RTIP and RRing are ignored in
                        this mode. (internal pull-up). In this mode, the XRT82D20 can operate only as a jit-
                        ter attenuator.
    12       ATM     I  Alarm Test Mode (Active-Low):
                        Connect this pin to ground to force ClkLOS, RLOS = 0 and LCV = 1 for testing with-
                        out affecting data transmission. (internal pull-up)
    13      RAOS     I  Receive All Ones:
                        With this pin tied to High, an all “1’s” signal is inserted to the receiver output at
                        RPOS and RNEG/RData using MCLK as timing reference. This control has priority
                        over Digital Loop-back if both are enabled. (internal pull-down).
    14      TAOS     I  Transmit All Ones:
                        With this pin tied High, an AMI encoded all “1’s” signal is sent to the transmit output
                        using MCLK as timing reference. This control has priority over Remote Loop-back if
                        both are enabled. (internal pull-down).
    15       MClk    I  Master Clock Input:
                        This signal is an independent 2.048 MHz clock with accuracy better than + 50 ppM
                        and duty cycle within 40% to 60%. The function of MClk is to provide timing source
                        for the PLL clock recovery circuit, reference clock to insert all “1’s” data in the trans-
                        mit as well as receive paths. This signal must be available for the device to operate.
    16     JATx/Rx   I  Jitter Attenuator Path Select:
           (DR/SR)      With the jitter attenuator enabled, (pin 18 =”1”), tie this pin “High” to select the jitter
                        attenuator in the transmit path and tie it “Low” to select in the receive path. Data
                        input/output format is then controlled automatically by the status of the TNEG input.
                        If TNEG data is present the device operates in Dual-rail data mode.
                        Dual-Rail/Single-Rail Select:
                        With the jitter attenuator disabled, (pin 18 =”0”), tie this pin “High” to select Dual-Rail
                        data format and tie it “Low” to select Single-Rail data format. (internal pull-down)
    17       DIGI    I  Digital Interface:
                        With this pin tied Low, input data at TPOS/TData and TNEG/CODE is active-high
                        and will be sampled by TClk on the falling edge, while active-high RPOS/RData and
                        RNEG output data are updated on the falling edge of RClk. See Figure 3 and 4 for
                        details.
                        With his pin tied high and in Dual-rail mode, transmit input accepts active-low
                        TPOS/TData and TNEG/CODE data and will be sampled by TClk on the falling
                        edge, while RPOS/RData and RNEG/LCV are active-low, data is updated on the
                        rising edge of RClk. (internal pull-down).
    18      JAEN     I  Jitter Attenuator Enable (active high):
                        Connect this pin high to enable the jitter attenuation function. Jitter Attenuator Path
                        select is determined by the pin 16 setting. (internal pull-down)

REV. 1.0.8                                                      SINGLE CHANNEL E1 LINE INTERFACE UNIT
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The XRT82D20 is a single channel E1 transceiver that provides an electrical interface for 2.048Mbps
applications. XRT82D20 includes a receive circuit that converts an ITU-T G.703 compliant bipolar signal into a
TTL compatible logic levels. The receiver also includes an LOS (Loss of Signal) detection circuit. Similarly, in
the Transmit Direction, the Transmitter converts TTL compatible logic levels into a G.703 compatible bipolar
signal.
The XRT82D20 consists of both a Receive Section, Jitter Attenuator and Transmit Section; each of these
sections will be discussed below.
  1.0 THE RECEIVE SECTION
At the receiver input, cable attenuated AMI signal can be coupled to the receiver using a capacitor or
transformer. The receive data first goes through the peak detector and data slicer for accurate data
recovery.The digital representation of the AMI signals go to the clock recovery circuit for timing recovery and
subsequently to the decoder (if selected) for HDB3 decoding before being output to the RPOS/RData and
RNEG/LCV pins. The digital data output can be in NRZ or RZ format depending the mode of operation
selected and with the option to be in dual-rail or single rail mode. Clock timing recovery of the line interface is
accomplished by means of a digital PLL scheme which has high input jitter tolerance.
The purpose of the Receive Output Interface block is to interface directly with the Receiving Terminal
Equipment. The Receive Output Interface block outputs the data (which has been recovered from the
incoming line signal) to the Receive Terminal Equipment via the RPOS and RNEG output pins.
If the Receive Section of the XRT82D20 has received a Positive-Polarity pulse, via the RTIP and
RRing input pins, then the Receive Output Interface will output a pulse at the RPOS output pin.
Similarly, if the Receive Section of the XRT82D20 has received a Negative-Polarity pulse, via the RTIP and
RRing input pins, then the Receive Output Interface will output a pulse at the RNEG output pin.
  1.1      JITTER ATTENUATOR
To reduce frequency jitter in the transmit clock or receive clock, a crystal-less jitter attenuator is provided. The
jitter attenuator can be selected either in the transmit or receive path or it can be disabled.
  1.2      THE TRANSMIT SECTION
In general, the purpose of the Transmit Section (within the XRT82D20) is to accept TTL/CMOS level digital
data (from the Terminal Equipment), and to encode it into a format such that it can:
 1. Be efficiently transmitted over coaxial- or twisted pair cable at the E1 data rate; and
 2. Be reliably received by the Remote Terminal Equipment at the other end of the E1 data link.
 3. Comply with the ITU-T G.703 pulse template requirements, for E1 applications
A 2.048 MHz clock is applied to the TClk input pin and NRZ data at the TPOS and TNEG input pins. The
Transmit Input Interface circuit will sample the data, at the TPOS and TNEG input pins, upon the falling edge of
TClk, as illustrated in Figure 8 below.

                TClk
In general, if the XRT82D20 samples a “1” on the TPOS input pin, then the Transmit Section will ultimately
generate a positive polarity pulse via the TTIP and TRing output pins (across a 1:2 transformer). Conversely, if
the XRT82D20 samples a “1” on the TNEG input pin, then the Transmit Section of the device will ultimately
generate a negative polarity pulse via the TTIP and TRing output pins (across a 1:2 transformer).
 1.3     The Pulse Shaping Circuit
The purpose of the Transmit Pulse Shaping circuit is to generate Transmit Output pulses that comply with the
ITU-T G.703 Pulse Template Requirements for E1 Applications.
An illustration of the ITU-T G.703 Pulse Template Requirements is presented below in Figure 9.
With input signal as described above, the XRT82D20 will take each mark (which is provided to it via the
Transmit Input Interface block, and will generate a pulse that complies with the pulse template, presented in
Figure 9 (when measured on the secondary side of the Transmit Output Transformer).

 1.4      Interfacing the Transmit Section of the XRT82D20 to the Line
ITU-T G.703 specifies that the E1 line signal can be transmitted over coaxial cable and terminated with 75Ω or
transmitted over twisted-pair and terminated with 120Ω.
In both applications (e.g., 75Ω or 120Ω, the user is advised to interface the Transmitter to the Line, in the
manner as depicted in Figure 10 and Figure 11, respectively.

The design of the XRT82D20 permits the user to transformer-couple the Receive Section to the line. As
mentioned earlier, the specifications for E1 require 75Ω termination loads, when transmitting over coaxial
cable, and 120Ω loads, when transmitting over twisted-pair. Figure 12 and Figure 13 present the various
methods that the user can employ to interface the Receiver of the XRT82D20 to the line.

 1.6      Capacitively-coupling the Receive Section(s) of the XRT82D20 to the line
Capacitive coupling provides a lower cost interface to the line. It must be noted that the line isolation is limited
to the breakdown voltage of the capactior versus the typical transformer isolation of 1,500 to 3,000 volts. With
a capacitor there is also no DC isolation to ground as there is with with a transformer.
Applications that are not sensitive to these issues can benefit from the lower cost approach of using capacitor
coupling on the receive input.
See Figure 14, Figure 15, Figure 16 and Figure 17 for                 the recommended schematics for capacitively
coupling the receiver to the line.

 2.0 DIAGNOSTIC FEATURES
In order to support diagnostic operations, the XRT82D20 supports the following loop-back modes:
• Local Loopback
• Remote Loopback
• Digital Loopback
Each of these loop-back modes will be discussed below.
 2.1     The Local Loop-Back Mode
When the XRT82D20 is configured to operate in the Local Loop-Back Mode, the XRT82D20 will ignore any
signals that are input to the RTIP and RRing input pins. The Transmitting Terminal Equipment will transmit
data into the XRT82D20 via the TPOS, TNEG and TClk input pins. This data will be processed through the
Transmit Terminal Input Interface and the Pulse Shaping circuit. Finally, this data will be output to the line via
the TTIP and TRing output pins. Additionally, this data (which is being output via the TTIP and TRing output
pins) will be looped back into the Receiver block. As a consequence, this data will also be processed through
the entire Receive Section of the XRT82D20. After this post-loop-back data has been processed through the
Receive Section it will output, to the Near-End Receiving Terminal Equipment via the RPOS and RNEG output
pins.
Figure 18, illustrates the path that the data takes (within the XRT82D20), when the chip is configured to
operate in the Local Loop-Back Mode.
The user can configure the XRT82D20 to operate in the Local Loop-Back Mode, by pulling the LLoop input pin
(pin 9) to GND.

 2.2     The Remote Loop Back Mode
When the XRT82D20 is configured to operate in the Remote Loop-Back Mode, the XRT82D20 will ignore any
signals that are input to the TPOS and TNEG input pins. The XRT82D20 will receive the incoming line signals,
via the RTIP and RRing input pins. This data will be processed through the entire Receive Section (within the
XRT82D20) and will output to the Receive Terminal Equipment via the RPOS and RNEG output pins.
Additionally, this data will also be internally looped back to the Transmit Input Interface block within the
Transmit Section. At this point, this data will be routed through the remainder of the Transmit Section of the
XRT82D20 and will be transmitted out onto the line via the TTIP and TRing output pins.
Figure 19, illustrates the path that the data takes (within the XRT82D20) when the chip is configured to
operate in the Remote Loop-Back Mode.
