               The STM32 Nucleo pack provides an affordable and easy-to-use solution for the
               evaluation of IO-Link applications, L6360 communication features and robustness,
               together with the STM32F446RET6 computation performance. The pack, hosting up
               to four STEVAL-IOM001V1 to build a quad port IO-Link master, can access the IO-
               Link physical layer and communicate with IO-Link Devices.
               You can evaluate the tool via the dedicated GUI (IO-Link Control Tool©, property of
               TEConcept GmbH) or use it as an IO-Link master bridge accessible from the
               dedicated SPI interface: source code of demo project (Low-Level IO-Link Master
               Access Demo Application, developed by TEConcept GmbH) and API specification
               are available for free.
