                      The microUSB Programming Adaptor is a USB to            The uUSB-PA5 was designed in 2012. The uUSB-
                      TTL UART bridge converter which is simple, cost         PA5-II was designed in 2015 to replace the uUSB-

                      4D SYSTEMS                                                                                        uUSB-PA5
                      5. Typical Applications
                      The microUSB (uUSB-PA5/PA5-II) are designed to accommodate many applications. Its small size and
                      convenient form factor are perfect for adding micro USB functionality to embedded applications.
                      Obviously the primary purpose of the uUSB-PA5 and uUSB-PA5-II is to be the programming interface for 4D
                      Systems products, however it has a much wider scope and can be utilized for many applications.
                      The microUSB makes an easy USB-Serial interface, so you can easily create USB to RS-232 converters, USB to
                      RS-422/RS-485 converters, upgrade legacy RS-232 devices, make PDA and cellphone USB interface cables,
                      barcode readers, POS terminals, etc.
                      In any application, make sure the TX and RX lines from the uUSB are crossed over to the attached peripheral.
                      That is, the TX from the μUSB connects to the RX of the target and the RX from the uUSB connects to the TX of
                      the target device.
                      Note: the TX and RX signal levels are between 0 Volts and 3.3 Volts, however are 5.0V tolerant.
microUSB - uUSB-PA5
                      The microUSB is designed to have a compact footprint, and be compatible with prototyping such as plugging it
                      directly into a breadboard when male 2.54mm (0.1”) headers are soldered to the row of 5 pins, along each
                      side.
