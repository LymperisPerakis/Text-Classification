                                                                                 ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
1      Introduction
This document describes the functionalities of the Evaluation Kits for the ZSSC3016, ZSSC3026, and ZSSC3036,
referred to here as the ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit. Note: Most illustrations show the ZSSC3026, but the content
applies to any ZSSC30x6 IC. This document covers the hardware components, the product specific configuration,
the evaluation software, and its handling. The software is designed for Windows®-based operating systems to
communicate with the ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit via the USB connection of the PC.

                                                                                    ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
Figure 2.1      ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Overview
The IC sample provided with the kit has the following package type depending on the product:
     •     ZSSC3016: CDIP 18 package
     •     ZSSC3026: PQFN 24 package inside an adapter, which will be plugged into the CDIP socket.
     •     ZSSC3036: PQFN 24 package inside an adapter, which will be plugged into the CDIP socket.
2.1.      Installing the Software
The Evaluation Kit uses an FDTI controller on the Communication Board to handle the USB protocol, translate
                                                                2
communications, and synchronize communications with the I C™* and/or SPI interface.
2.1.1.       Installing the USB Drivers
Before installing the ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Software, the USB drivers for the FTDI device must be installed.
Download the drivers and corresponding installation guides from www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/D2XX.htm. The
Evaluation Software accesses the FTDI controller through the D2XX DLL. The drivers will not affect the operation
of any other USB peripherals. For installation of the drivers, the user’s system must meet these requirements:
     •     x86-compatible PC
     •     64 MB RAM
     •     Hard drive with 20MB free space
     •     USB port
     •     Windows® 2000/XP/Vista/Windows® 7/Windows® 8

                                                                                  ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
2.1.2.     Installing ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Software
To install the ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Software on the user’s PC hard drive after unzipping the downloaded
ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Software zip file, navigate to the directory ZSSC30x6 EV SW_vXpxx (note: Xpxx refers to
the latest version number). Double click on the setup.exe file and follow the resulting standard installation
instructions, entering installation paths and identification as needed. The software automatically completes the
installation and creates an access link under Start -> All Programs -> ZMDI -> ZSSC30x6 Evaluation if the
defaults settings have been used.
3      Evaluation Kit Hardware
The delivered hardware consists primarily of two circuit boards: the ZSSC30x6 Communication Board and the
ZSSC3016 Evaluation Board. They are connected via the 14-pin ribbon cable. The Communication Board has a
USB interface for the connection to the master PC. The Evaluation Board has a CDIP 18 socket where the
sample IC (a.k.a. the DUT) must be inserted. An adapter is used for ZSSC3026 and ZSSC3036 samples.
3.1.     Communication Board
The ZSSC30x6 Communication Board has devices mounted on both sides. The components on the top side of
the PCB generate a stable supply voltage and an optional external programming voltage. See Figure 3.1.
                                                                 2
There is a pin header for using a jumper to select either the I C™ or SPI communication protocol for communi-
cation with the DUT in the socket on the Evaluation Board. The ribbon cable connector that connects the
Communication Board to the Evaluation Board provides access to all communication signals; e.g., for an oscillo-
scope probe.
A metal potentiometer can be used to adjust the supply voltage in the typical range from 1.7V to 3.8V. Its initial
adjustment on delivery provides a voltage VDD ≈ 2.0V to 2.2V. The intensity of the adjacent LED is proportional to
the supply voltage.

On the bottom side of the Communication Board, the largest IC is the FTDI microcontroller for protocol handling.
There are also voltage regulators for the two variable voltages (VDD and VPP) and level shifters for communi-
cation signals.

3.2.    Evaluation Board
The ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Board allows the user to use an oscilloscope to analyze all available signals to and
from the DUT and to select the communication interface for it via a jumper, which must match the setting on the
Communication Board. The Evaluation Board provides two alternatives for connecting a sensor or a sensor
replacement device: via a 16-pin square sensor connection terminal or by soldering a sensor with 4 pads on it to
an SMD footprint (see Figure 3.3).
The K1 and K2 pin header blocks (4 pins x 9 pins) adjacent to the DUT socket allow using a 2-pin jumper to
connect signal lines of the DUT (either of the 2 middle pins in each row of each header block) to either VSS (the
GND trace pin adjacent to the DUT) or VDD (the outer V_TGT trace pin, which is the supply voltage generated
from the Communication Board).
To connect the proper supply required for the DUT, use the red jumper to connect the DUT’s VDD signal line to
the V_TGT line as shown in Figure 3.3. Use the black jumper to connect the DUT’s VSS pin the GND line.

3.4.     Interface Selection
Jumpers on the Communication Board must be set as shown in Figure 3.5. Further details for the signal path can
be found in the schematics in Appendix A.
The blue jumper on the Evaluation Board defines the protocol for the DUT in the following way:
    •     Jumper on the “I2C” position → SEL = HIGH
                   2
          For the I C™ selection, the jumper does not need to be connected. In this case, the SEL input to the DUT
          is recognized as HIGH.
    •     Jumper on the “SPI” position → SEL = LOW
          For SPI, the interface jumper is required to pull the SEL signal to the LOW level.

3.5.    Connectors
The connectors on the CB and EB are labeled. The kit must be assembled by the customer. When the ribbon
cable is connected correctly, it provides all possible signals between the microcontroller on the CB and the DUT
on the EB. The minimum signals required are VDD, VSS, SDA, and SCL; these lines can provide all options for
                      2
measurements and I C™ communication.
Figure 3.6 shows the pin assignment for the available connectors at the CB.
Figure 3.6   Connectors and the Pin Assignments at the CB
Figure 3.7   Connectors and the Pin Assignments at EB
Note: The signal names on the CB and EB do not match for some signals due to different origins for the boards;
nevertheless the actual signals are provided at the same pins at the corresponding connectors.

                                                                                      ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
3.6.    Supply Voltage
The Evaluation Kit can be powered with an internal or external voltage supply for the DUT on the Evaluation
Board, which must be selected with the red jumper on the K5 pin header on the CB (see Figure 3.1). There are no
settings for selecting the supply source on the EB.
3.6.1.     Internal Supply Voltage
The internal VDD supply is generated by a regulator circuit on the CB. It is used as the HIGH level reference for
all signals that are necessary for communication with the DUT. If the red jumper on K5 is positioned as shown in
Figure 3.8 (“int” setting), then the DUT on the EB is supplied internally. With this setting, no external voltage input
is needed for the Evaluation Kit.
Figure 3.8    Jumper Settings on Communication Board for Internal Supply Voltage
3.6.2.     External Supply Voltage
An alternative for providing the supply voltage to the DUT is to input an external voltage supply source. Ensure
that the external voltage does not exceed the voltage supply specifications given in the IDT data sheet for the
DUT before connecting to the Evaluation Kit.
To use an external supply, set the K5 jumper as shown in Figure 3.9(“ext” setting). Connect the external voltage
to the 2-pin V_ext header that is immediately to the right of the K5 jumper with the orientation shown in Figure 3.9.
There are no adjustments for the external voltage on either the CB or EB.

4      Evaluation Kit Software
When the ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Software (GUI) is activated, the left side of the first screen is the General tab,
which provides basic communication status (see Figure 4.1). The largest section of the screen is the main graph
area on the right, which is for displaying the measurement results over time. The data scale for temperature
output is on the right side of the main graph; the scale for bridge measurements is on the left. The x-axis
represents the number of measurement points at a given value in a run. Both y-axes display the corresponding
bridge/temperature value in a format selectable by the user.

4.1.     Top Menu GUI Controls
At the top of the GUI screen is a banner for GUI controls that are always available. These include display fields at
the left for real-time single bridge and temperature measurement results. There are also additional controls with
the following descriptions and functions:
Table 4.1       Basic GUI Controls
              Control                                                           Description
                                    The Port button allows closing and opening the USB communication port. This is useful
                                    for making hardware changes (e.g., switching the DUT or jumper settings) without
                                    exiting the GUI. It also indicates the current status. The button is green only if proper
            Port button             communication has been established.
                                    The Status display field shows information related to the current GUI operation; e.g., if
        Status display field
                                    calculated coefficients exceed the defined limits, the Status field displays the error.
                                    The Power On/Off icon indicates whether the supply voltage is applied to the DUT in
                                    the socket on the EB.
         Power On/Off icon
                                    Checking the average values checkbox activates averaging of the measurement
     average values checkbox        results. The Select average length slider determines the number of measurements that
                                    are taken to calculate the average result, which will then be displayed in the display
                                    fields for measurement results and the main graph. Averaging extends the time until
                                    the results appear in the GUI by the factor of adjusted average values. The results are
                                    displayed in color instead of black font.
    Select average length slider
                                    The output type for measurement results can be chosen or the associated graph can
                                    be switched off with the Bridge graph and Temp graph slider bars. Raw measurements
                                    are only provided in counts. After calibration, the °C- and the %- display are available.
                                    [N] – Displays measurement results in counts.
                                    [deg. C] – Displays measurement results in degrees Celsius. This option is only
    Bridge graph/ Temp. graph       available in Normal Mode where the measurements are linearized by coefficients.
             slider bars            [%] – Shows measurement results in percent, in relation to full-scale output (FSO)
                                    (65535).

                                    For some purposes such as debugging or documentation, it is helpful to log the
                                    master-slave communication. To record this data, activate this checkbox, which results
                                    in a dialog window for selecting the name and location for a .txt file where this informa-
   log communication checkbox       tion will be written. After the .txt log file is set up, it can be opened in the menu bar:

              Control                                                           Description
                                       This button activates a cyclic bridge and/or temperature measurement. The
                                       measurement mode is defined by the Raw / DSP Corrected measurement mode slider
                                       bar to the left of this button.
                                       Raw measurements must be configured either via the External Configuration section
                                       under the EXT tab (see section 4.7), which is the recommended method, or by directly
                                       writing a configuration into the BM_Config register. The raw data output provides the
                                       results directly after AD conversion.
                                       DSP Corrected position of the slider selects the configuration from the BM_Config
    Measurement Mode Slider            register for the measurement. The digital result after the ADC will be then processed
                                       with the calculated coefficients. This measurement mode will provide valid results only
                                       after a valid calibration of the ZSSC30x6.
                                       This field indicates the period that is needed to complete a measurement command.
                                       This period is defined by the conversion time of the ADC, the IC processing time, and
                                       communication time between master and slave. Depending on the MSB/LSB
                                       segmentation settings, the conversion time can vary significantly. The default value of
          Conversion Time              200ms suffices to establish an auto-zero-corrected measurement with a MSB/LSB
                                       segmentation of 14/2. The conversion time can be derived from the ADC conversion
                                       times specifications given in the ZSSC30x6 Data Sheet.
                                       This button requests and reads the ZSSC30x6’s status byte and displays the result on
                                       the LEDs on the General tab.
                                       Reads the complete contents of the multiple-time programmable (MTP) memory of the
                                                                                                     2
                                       ZSSC30x6. The decoded basic bridge configuration and the I C™ address are
                                       displayed on the General tab.
                                       This button activates writing to the MTP of the ZSSC30x6. It will write only the
                                       addresses for which the content is shown in red font on the MTP tab. In addition to
                                       using the automatic data transfer from the Calibration tab and General tab, users can
                                       also edit the values by double clicking on the value on the MTP tab page. The
                                       ZSSC30x6 must be in Command Mode (CM) in order to write to the MTP; therefore the
                                       software performs a power-on >power-off >Start CM sequence in the background.
                                       After the write operation, the ZSSC30x6 will be set into Normal Mode again.
4.2.     Measurement Color Code
Bridge and temperature results are displayed in different colors. Different colors are also used for single and
averaged measurement results:
Table 4.2     Color Code for Bridge and Temperature Results
 Color          Indication
 Pink           Single bridge measurement.
 Light Blue     Single temperature measurement.
 Blue           Averaged bridge measurement.
 Green          Averaged temperature measurement.
 Red            Invalid measurement result. This could be due to a Conversion Time that is too short. In this case, bit 5 in
                the status byte is set to ‘1’ and the Busy virtual LED on the General tab turns on. Another reason for an
                invalid measurement result could be if ALU saturation is detected. In this case the Saturation LED turns on.

4.3.2.     Scan I C™ Bus via the Scan I2C address Feature
                                                                              2                             2
Another feature provided in the menu bar is the ability to scan the I C™ bus to determine the I C™ address of the
ZSSC30x6. Selecting Scan I2C address triggers the scan during which the ZSSC30x6 status is requested for
                                                               2
each address ranging from 00HEX to 7FHEX. When an I C™ address is acknowledged by the ZSSC30x6, the scan
stops, and this address is used for further communication during the current GUI session. The results of the scan
are indicated in the status window:
                                                         2
    •   Status window message for a successful I C™ scan: Valid I2C address found: 0xXX!
                                            2
    •   Status window message for an I C™ scan without slave acknowledge: No valid I2C address found!
      2
The I C™ address information is lost if the GUI or the communication port is closed. The communication to the
                      2
ZSSC30x6 with an I C™ address other than 00HEX can also be established by typing it manually in the menu bar
item interface setup by selecting Interface Setup > I2C Slave Address.

                              After reading the MTP, the display shows the I C™ address that is saved in the memory. If a
                              new address is entered in the window and the Copy adjusted settings to MTP button is
                              clicked, the new value is shown in red color on the MTP tab.
                              The bridge configuration area provides settings of the analog signal path and AD conversion.
                              The drop-down menus contain the available setting values.
                              Changing the parameter values here does not automatically apply them to measurements. It
                              is possible to apply the adjusted settings and use them for raw data collection. There are
                              different commands for performing raw measurements. Some of the commands use the con-
                              figuration from the BM_Config register (A0HEX, A2HEX); others (A1HEX, A3HEX) are configured
                              via the interface. For a full description of raw measurement commands, refer to Table 4.4.
                              For configuration via the interface, click on the Copy adjusted settings for Raw Data Acquisi-
                              tion button, which automatically displays the EXT tab (see section 4.7) and transfers the
                              present settings to the external configuration section.
                              The Copy adjusted settings to MTP button copies the present settings to the MTP tab. The
                              settings can then be written to the MTP memory (see section 4.6).
                              The communication status section evaluates the status byte information sent from the sample.
                              It provides following information via the virtual LEDs:
                              Powered indicates if the device is powered. If the LED is off, it does not automatically mean
                                                                                                 2
                              that VDD is not supplied. For example, the LED will be off if the I C™ communication is
                                                   2
                              attempted with an I C™ address different from the address programmed in the IC’s memory.
                              CMD Mode shows whether the IC is in Command Mode.
                              Test Mode shows whether the IC is in Test Mode (not intended for users)
                              Busy indicates if processing of the last command is finished. If it is, the LED is off.
                              Memory Error displays whether the checksum-based integrity check passed or failed. In the
                              default state of the kit, this LED should be on. Recommended approach: after writing memory
                              data (bridge configuration, coefficients…), write the signature over the memory content via the
                              MTP Write Completion (Checksum) button on the MTP tab. After a subsequent power-on-
                              reset sequence, the integrity check should pass and the LED should turn off.

                                                                                    ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
4.5.      Data Logging
The ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit software provides the option to log measurement and communication data as
described in Table 4.1.
4.5.1.      Communication Log
                                                               2
Communication with the IC can be logged for both the I C™and SPI interface. Use the log communication
checkbox on the General tab for recording the data stream. Choose a path for which the user has writing
permission for storing the log file. Open the log file via the menu bar: File -> Communication Log. The resulting
text file is an ASCII file and can be imported into Microsoft® Excel.
             2
4.5.1.1. I C™ log
                                            2
Figure 4.3 shows a short example of the I C™ communication recorded in a log file.
                2
Figure 4.3     I C™ Communication Example
                                                                                    2
The log file maps only the transferred data, not the specific frame conditions for I C™, such as START or STOP
conditions or acknowledges. Communication commands that are not available to the user are not logged. This
also applies to the SPI communication log.
The Evaluation Kit uses DF 5 (data fetch 5) by default. This means READ data from the slave has a 5-byte
structure. In the example shown in Figure 4.3, a raw bridge measurement is done in two steps:
    •   Start Command Mode (A9HEX). After this command, it is not necessary to read; however, the Evaluation Kit
        software sends a command to read the status byte to obtain the most current status of the IC. In the
        second and fourth rows of the example above, the status byte of 4c is returned in the response to the
        master sending the slave address with the read/write bit (R/ ) set to read.
    •   Get_Raw auto-zero corrected bridge data (A3HEX).

I C™ interface properties correspond to the NXP I C™ bus specification. For the I C™ log example data, the
sections of the data frame structure are explained in Figure 4.4. In this illustration for communication frames,
START conditions are indicated with S; STOP conditions are shown as P; and acknowledges are shown with A.
For information about communication frame structure, see the data sheet (see section 6).

4.5.1.2. SPI Log
Communication via SPI is accomplished with the single pins for input and output (MOSI and MISO respectively).
The MOSI data always consists of 3 bytes; MISO data is always 5 bytes.
                                                                                            2
The example shown in Figure 4.5 has the same command sequence as the I C™ example. The difference is the
F0HEX command, which is sent in the Evaluation Kit each time before reading the MISO signal. This is due to
IDT’s hardware/software setup for the kit. It is not required for the final user application.

                                                                                      ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
4.5.1.3. Measurement Log
Measurement data can be recorded as well. In raw measurement mode, the results are logged in counts, but they
are not calculated as percentage (bridge) or degree Celsius (temperature). If the IC is calibrated, the DSP-
corrected bridge results are provided in counts and percentage based on the output range. The temperature
results are logged in counts and degree Celsius numbers.
4.6.    GUI – MTP Tab
The MTP tab shows the current memory data of the user’s page. The data is displayed in four hexadecimal digits
for each of the 24 addresses in the MTP. To display the memory contents in the MTP table, read the complete
memory by clicking on the Read MTP (all) button. The resulting message in the status window at the top right of
the GUI should be “MTP Read OK.” Subsequent changes in this table are indicated with red font so that the user
is aware that this data does not correspond with the IC’s data.
As shown in Figure 4.6, the first column is the address number; the second column comprises the data in the
register. The description name for the corresponding register is given in the third column. The forth column is a
single digit, which indicates whether an internal data correction has been asserted. Each 16-bit register displayed
is also written to a redundant register. With each reading process, the origin and the redundant register are
compared bitwise. If they do not agree, the correction bit in the fourth column will be set.

                                                                                       ZSSC30x6 Evaluation Kit Description
Clicking the MTP Write Completion (Checksum) button at the bottom of the MTP tab triggers the signature
generation and writing over the current memory contents. Therefore it should be the last step to be done after
bridge measurement configuration, coefficient calculation, and writing. Once the checksum has been written, the
Memory Error LED turns off after repowering the IC (see Table 4.3).
Additional features on the MTP tab are the user memory page number and the INC CUST Page button for
increasing the memory page. Each IC provides four customer pages; therefore it is possible to increase the CUST
Page index three times.
For the MTP write(sel), MTP Write Completion (Checksum), and INC CUST Page buttons, the IC must be in
Command Mode, so the Command Mode is accessed and then exited by the software in the background.
4.7.    GUI – EXT Tab
The EXT tab is divided into two sections. The upper tab area is for communication with the IC with single
commands selectable from the drop-down menu. This section is considered as an additional communication
option but it is not necessary for typical user purposes. The lower part of this tab is relevant for the external bridge
configuration and temperature. “External” in this context means that the configuration does not have to be written
to the memory. It can be transmitted with the measurement command over the communication interface. All
commands defined in the EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION section are Get_Raw measurement requests.

In the “Bridge” and “Temperature” sections, the Type window defines the Get_Raw command and the Data
window selects the measurement configuration if required.
Example: In the “Bridge” section, an entry of 0x3 in the Type field and 0x024A in the Data field corresponds to the
GetRaw command 0xA3 024A.
4.7.1.     Get_Raw Commands
Eight Get_Raw commands for data acquisition are available, depending on the measurement type and the source
of the configuration; however, there are basically only two different commands: the single measurement and the
auto-zero measurement, which selects the ADC offset. These are applied to the bridge and temperature
measurements with different configuration origins.
All measurement command options are described in the Table 4.4.

4.7.2.    Data Output Range
Raw measurement results display AD-converted data, without passing through the digital signal processor (DSP).
Here, the ADC offset adjustment and the measurement methods determine the raw data output range. The
expected output range is dynamically shown in the GUI, below the configured parameter of the EXT tab.
Output data in Normal Mode is digitally compensated and adjusted to the full-scale output of 16 bits if the device
has been calibrated correctly.

       these two stages are selectable in the drop-down menu. Recommendation: Choose the bridge gain as high
       as possible in order to take full advantage of the ADCs’ dynamic range.
    •  Bridge Polarity: The IC has the capability to switch the polarity of the sensor input INP and INN. This
       setting is only valid if the differential sensor signal has a higher negative voltage output range than the
       positive one:
              if ( abs(Vmax) < abs (Vmin)) ) Bridge Polarity = 1
              else Bridge Polarity = 0
    •  Bridge ADC segmentation: A second-order charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to
       convert the amplifier signal. To allow optimizing the trade-off between conversion time and resolution, the
       conversion is split into a MSB coarse conversion and an LSB fine conversion.
    •  Bridge Range Shift: Depending on the sensor output, the ADC can be adjusted by a programmable offset
       from 1/16 to 8/16 of ADC’s reference voltage.
The most appropriate gain (and offset) setup for a specific sensor element can be determined by using the
following steps:
     1) Collect the sensor element’s characteristic, statistical data (over temperature, ambient sensor parameters,
         and production tolerances):
              a. Minimum differential output voltage:          Vmin
              b. Maximum differential output voltage:           Vmax
     2) If Vmin and Vmax have different signs (normally: Vmax is positive and Vmin is negative), then the required
         ADC offset shift can be selected using the ratio: RatioOffset = |Vmin| / (Vmax – Vmin)
         Then, the respective offset setup (A2D_offset) is the nearest integer of multiples of 1/16 in the range of
                                                                                                th
         1/16 to 8/16 (refer to the data sheet; see section 6): A2D_offset = Round_to_x16 {RatioOffset}.
     3) Determine which of the two following cases is valid, with Vref = Vrefp – Vrefn = 0.94·VDDB,min ~ 1.5V:
              a. If RatioOffset – A2D_offset ≤ 0 then calculate the theoretical optimum gain:
                    Gainopt =(1 – A2D_offset)  Vref / Vmax
              b. If RatioOffset – A2D_offset > 0 then calculate the theoretical optimum gain:
                    Gainopt = A2D_offset  Vref / |Vmin|
     4) Select the setup gain (Gainsetup) as the nearest gain to Gainopt where Gainsetup ≤ Gainopt.

Depending on calibration type, the corresponding number of calibration points are displayed in the main graph to
indicate the coverage of the measurement range. The “Calibration Points” table contains the relevant points for
coefficient calculation.
Entry descriptions for the calibration table:
P[%] – P stands for the bridge sensor measurement. The point should be entered as a percent of the full
measurement range for the bridge sensor measurement.
P[N] – Raw bridge measurement result in counts.
T[°C] – Temperature in degree Celsius.
T[N] – Raw temperature measurement result in counts.
Example: If the final application is specified from 800 to 1200 mbar, then 5% is 820 mbar and 95% is 1180.
Assuming the temperature range is from –40 to 80 degree Celsius, the initial calibration table for a 7-point
calibration could be defined as it is shown in Figure 4.10.
Note: The definition of the temperature range in the calibration must be entered at the bottom of the Calibration
tab. The degree Celsius entries in the “Calibration Points” table must match the range definition.

            values are concurrently selected for writing (turning red).
            For DSP-corrected bridge measurement, the BM_Config register must contain the same
    3       configuration as during calibration, so click on the Copy adjusted setting to MTP button. The      General tab
            coded configuration appears red-colored in BM_Config.
            Write the new coefficients into the MTP via the Write MTP(sel). Read the MTP contents to
    4                                                                                                          MTP tab
            ensure that the coefficients have been written to the memory.

In addition to the Evaluation Kit, a sensor replacement board
                                                                    Figure 5.1   Sensor Replacement Board
can be ordered. It allows the customer to do the first steps with
the ZSSC30x6 without a final application sensor module. The
sensor replacement board consists of two potentiometers
between the positive and negative sensor line, which can be
adjusted to represent the change in resistance of a sensor.
One is for the coarse resistance regulation; the other for the
fine adjustment. See Figure 5.1.
The SRB has an internal resistance of approximately 2kΩ. The specific resistance values between the single pins
are given in Figure 5.2.
