MAX22190 Evaluation System                                                        Evaluates: MAX22190
General Description                                        Features
The MAX22190 evaluation system (EV system) provides        ●● Easy Evaluation of the MAX22190
the hardware and software necessary to evaluate the        ●● EV Kit Logic Side is USB-Powered
MAX22190 Octal Industrial Digital Input device with
Diagnostic features. The MAX22190 EV kit has Pmod™         ●● Configured for IEC 61131-2 Type 1, 3 and Type 2
compatible connector for SPI communication. The EV         ●● Independent Slave or Daisy-Chainable SPI Interface
system includes the USB2PMB2# adapter board that           ●● Galvanic Isolation using MAX14483 and MAX12931
receives commands from a PC through the USB port to
                                                           ●● Robust Design ±2kV Surge Tolerant Line-to-Line
create an SPI interface for communication between the
software and the MAX22190 on the EV kit.                   ●● Windows® 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, and
                                                              Windows XP® Compatible Software
The EV system includes a graphical user interface (GUI)
that provides communication between the target device      ●● Fully Assembled and Tested
and the PC. The MAX22190 EV kit has two MAX22190           ●● Proven PCB Layout
devices (U1 and U2) that can operate in multiple modes,
                                                           ●● RoHS Compliant
as shown in Figure 1:
1)   Single-Channel Mode: The USB2PMB2# adapter            Ordering Information appears at end of data sheet.
     connects to either U1 or U2 on the EV kit, depending
     on which channel is preferred, and selected using
     the on-board jumpers.
2)   Independent Slave Mode: The USB2PMB2# adapter
     uses two chip-select signals (CS1 and CS2) to
     control each chip through a single connector/GUI
     interface.
3)   Daisy-Chain Mode: The USB2PMB2# adapter con-
     nects to both U1 and U2 through the MAX14483
     Digital Isolator, and SDO from U1 connects to SDI of
     U2. Both U1 and U2 are controlled from a single SPI
     interface.
