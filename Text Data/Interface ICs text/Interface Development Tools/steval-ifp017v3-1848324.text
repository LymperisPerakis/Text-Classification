                                                        Description
                                                        The STEVAL-IFP017V3 is an evaluation board
                                                        designed to analyze the features of L6362A,
                                                        including fast demagnetization, reverse polarity,
                                                        overload, overtemperature, ground and supply
                                                        open wire protections.
                                                        The highly robust design of the L6362A allows
                                                        the STEVAL-IFP017V3 to meet IEC 61000-4-4
                                                        (burst), IEC 61000-4-2 (ESD) and EN60947-5-
                                                        2/IEC 61000-4-5 (surge) without additional
                                                        external components.
                                                        The STEVAL-IFP017V3 offers dedicated input
                                                        and output screw connectors to facilitate easy
                                                        and flexible connections for user requirements.
