High-Speed Data I/O Interface Connectors
The Intersil ISL36411 Quad Lane Extender is intended to be used
at the receive end of lossy differential copper channels. The four
channels of the ISL36411 make it well-suited for high-density
applications with parallel channels subject to
frequency-dependent attenuation. The differential input(s) of the
ISL36411 should be connected to the output side of the
differential channel(s) under test (board traces or twin-axial
cables). This connection should be made using the input SMA

LOSB Indicators
The ISL36411 provides an inverted Loss-Of-Signal (LOSB) output
for each channel. The LOSB output for Channel 1 is located on
header JP1 as labeled on the ISL36411DRZ-EVALZ evaluation
board. The LOSB indicator pins for the remaining three channels
are located on header JP2. When the high-speed input signal to a
given channel on the ISL36411 is turned off or disabled, the

      you or third parties arising from such alteration, modification, copying or reverse engineering.
 5.   Renesas Electronics products are classified according to the following two quality grades: “Standard” and “High Quality”. The intended applications for each Renesas Electronics product depends on the
      product’s quality grade, as indicated below.
      "Standard":       Computers; office equipment; communications equipment; test and measurement equipment; audio and visual equipment; home electronic appliances; machine tools; personal electronic
                         equipment; industrial robots; etc.

      Unless expressly designated as a high reliability product or a product for harsh environments in a Renesas Electronics data sheet or other Renesas Electronics document, Renesas Electronics products are
      not intended or authorized for use in products or systems that may pose a direct threat to human life or bodily injury (artificial life support devices or systems; surgical implantations; etc.), or may cause
      serious property damage (space system; undersea repeaters; nuclear power control systems; aircraft control systems; key plant systems; military equipment; etc.). Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all
      liability for any damages or losses incurred by you or any third parties arising from the use of any Renesas Electronics product that is inconsistent with any Renesas Electronics data sheet, user’s manual or
