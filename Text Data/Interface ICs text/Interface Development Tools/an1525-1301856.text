Transmit Disable
The ISL35111 provides a transmit disable feature,
whereby the IC for can be made to enter a low-power
standby mode. Entry into this mode is controlled by the
TDSBL pin. By using a jumper to tie a given TDSBL pin to
VDD (as shown in Figure 3), the ISL35111 is disabled.
While disabled, all internal circuitry of the IC is powered
down, and the is incapable of driving any high-speed
signal applied to its input. If the TDSBL pin is left floating
(no jumper installed), the IC is enabled and is capable of
driving high-speed data.

Baseline Performance
The eye diagrams in Figures 4A through 4C show the
typical high-speed performance of the ISL35111DRZ-
EVALZ evaluation board. Figure 4A shows the output at
10.3125Gb/s with no output de-emphasis
(DE level = 0dB). Figure 4B shows the output at
10.3125Gb/s with maximum output de-emphasis (DE
level = 4dB). The output de-emphasis supplied by the
ISL35111 can be used to pre-compensate the signal
for subsequent frequency-dependent channel loss.
