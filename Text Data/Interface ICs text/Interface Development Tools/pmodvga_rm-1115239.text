 Pmod VGA Reference Manual
 Revised January 22, 2018
 This manual applies to the Pmod VGA Rev. C
Overview
The Pmod VGA (Rev. C) provides a VGA port to any board with Pmod connectivity. The VGA port can be used to
drive standard displays such as televisions and monitors. The host board must be capable of driving a fast parallel
data bus in order to properly drive a display with the Pmod VGA.

1.1        Physical Dimensions
The pins on the pin header are spaced 100 mil apart. The PCB is 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) long on the sides parallel to the
pins on the pin header and 1.7 inches (4.3 cm) long on the sides perpendicular to the pin header.
2          Functional Description
The Pmod VGA uses 14 input pins to create an analog VGA output port. This translates to 12-bit color depth and
two standard sync signals: Horizontal Sync (HS) and Vertical Sync (VS). The digital-to-analog conversion is done
using a simple R-2R resistor ladder. The ladder works in conjunction with the 75-ohm termination resistance of the
VGA display to create 16 analog signal levels for the red, blue, and green VGA signals. This circuit produces video
color signals that proceed in equal increments between 0V (fully off) and 0.7V (fully on). With 4 bits each for red,
blue, and green, 4096 (16x16x16) different colors can be displayed, one for each unique 12-bit pattern.
When used with an FPGA host board, a video controller circuit must be created in programmable logic to drive the
sync and color signals with the correct timing in order to produce a working display system. It may be possible to
drive the video signals using a very fast microcontroller with a parallel bus controller; however, Digilent does not
provide examples for this use case.
2.1        Interfacing with the Pmod
VGA signal timings are specified, published, copyrighted, and sold by the VESA organization (www.vesa.org). The
following VGA system timing information is provided as an example of how a VGA monitor might be driven in 640
by 480 mode.
NOTE: For more precise information, or for information on other VGA frequencies, refer to documentation
available at the VESA website. CRT-based VGA displays use amplitude-modulated moving electron beams (or
cathode rays) to display information on a phosphor-coated screen. LCD displays use an array of switches that can
impose a voltage across a small amount of liquid crystal, thereby changing light permittivity through the crystal on
a pixel-by-pixel basis. Although the following description is limited to CRT displays, LCD displays have evolved to
use the same signal timings as CRT displays (so the “signals” discussion below pertains to both CRTs and LCDs).

  Pmod VGA Reference Manual
Color CRT displays use three electron beams (one for red, one for blue, and one for green) to energize the
phosphor that coats the inner side of the display end of a cathode ray tube (see Fig. 1).
Electron beams emanate from “electron guns,” which are finely-pointed heated cathodes placed in close proximity
to a positively charged annular plate called a “grid.” The electrostatic force imposed by the grid pulls rays of
energized electrons from the cathodes, and those rays are fed by the current that flows into the cathodes. These
particle rays are initially accelerated towards the grid, but they soon fall under the influence of the much larger
electrostatic force that results from the entire phosphor-coated display surface of the CRT being charged to 20kV
(or more). The rays are focused to a fine beam as they pass through the center of the grids, and then they
accelerate to impact on the phosphor-coated display surface. The phosphor surface glows brightly at the impact
point, and it continues to glow for several hundred microseconds after the beam is removed. The larger the
current fed into the cathode, the brighter the phosphor will glow.
Between the grid and the display surface, the beam passes through the neck of the CRT where two coils of wire
produce orthogonal electromagnetic fields. Because cathode rays are composed of charged particles (electrons),
they can be deflected by these magnetic fields. Current waveforms are passed through the coils to produce
magnetic fields that interact with the cathode rays and cause them to transverse the display surface in a “raster”
pattern, horizontally from left to right and vertically from top to bottom, as shown in Fig. 2. As the cathode ray
moves over the surface of the display, the current sent to the electron guns can be increased or decreased to
change the brightness of the display at the cathode ray impact point.
Information is only displayed when the beam is moving in the “forward” direction (left to right and top to bottom),
and not during the time the beam is reset back to the left or top edge of the display. Much of the potential display
time is therefore lost in “blanking” periods when the beam is reset and stabilized to begin a new horizontal or
vertical display pass. The size of the beams, the frequency at which the beam can be traced across the display, and
the frequency at which the electron beam can be modulated determine the display resolution.
Modern VGA displays can accommodate different resolutions, and a VGA controller circuit dictates the resolution
by producing timing signals to control the raster patterns. The controller must produce synchronizing pulses at
3.3V to set the frequency at which current flows through the deflection coils, and it must ensure that video data is
applied to the electron guns at the correct time. Raster video displays define a number of “rows” that corresponds
to the number of horizontal passes the cathode makes over the display area, and a number of “columns” that
corresponds to an area on each row that is assigned to one “picture element”, or pixel. Typical displays use from
240 to 1200 rows and from 320 to 1600 columns. The overall size of a display and the number of rows and columns
determines the size of each pixel.

  Pmod VGA Reference Manual
Video data typically comes from a video refresh memory with one or more bytes assigned to each pixel location
(the Pmod VGA uses 12 bits per pixel). The controller must index into video memory as the beams move across the
display, and retrieve and apply video data to the display at precisely the time the electron beam is moving across a
given pixel.
A VGA controller circuit must generate the HS and VS timings signals and coordinate the delivery of video data
based on the pixel clock. The pixel clock defines the time available to display one pixel of information. The VS signal
defines the “refresh” frequency of the display, or the frequency at which all information on the display is redrawn.
The minimum refresh frequency is a function of the display’s phosphor and electron beam intensity, with practical
refresh frequencies falling in the 50Hz to 120Hz range. The number of lines to be displayed at a given refresh
frequency defines the horizontal “retrace” frequency. For a 640-pixel by 480-row display using a 25MHz pixel clock
and 60 +/-1Hz refresh, the signal timings shown in Fig. 3 can be derived. Timings for sync pulse-width and front and
back porch intervals (porch intervals are the pre- and post-sync pulse times during which information cannot be
displayed) are based on observations taken from actual VGA displays.

  Pmod VGA Reference Manual
A VGA controller circuit, such as the one diagrammed in Fig. 4, decodes the output of a horizontal-sync counter
driven by the pixel clock to generate HS signal timings. You can use this counter to locate any pixel location on a
given row. Likewise, the output of a vertical-sync counter that increments with each HS pulse can be used to
generate VS signal timings, and you can use this counter to locate any given row. These two continually running
counters can be used to form an address into video RAM. No time relationship between the onset of the HS pulse
and the onset of the VS pulse is specified, so you can arrange the counters to easily form video RAM addresses, or
to minimize decoding logic for sync pulse generation.
