The ISL35411 Driver is intended to be used at the transmit end
of lossy differential copper channels. The four channels of the
ISL35411 make it well-suited for high-density applications with
parallel channels. The ISL35411 is optimized for use in
conjunction with the Intersil ISL36411 quad lane extender at the
far end of the lossy channel.

The ISL35411 provides an independent transmit disable feature
for each of its channels. With this feature, idle and/or unused
channels on the ISL35411 can be made to enter a low power
standby mode. Entry into this mode is controlled by each
channel's respective TDSBL pin. The TDSBL-1 pin (for Channel 1)
is located at header JP1 on the north-side of the board. The
TDSBL pins for the remaining channels are located at header JP2
on the south-side of the board. By using a jumper to tie a given
TDSBL pin to VDD (as shown in Figure 5), the corresponding
channel on the ISL35411 is disabled. While disabled, all internal
circuitry associated with the channel is powered down, and the
channel is incapable of driving any high-speed signal applied to
its input. If the TDSBL pin is left floating (no jumper installed), the
respective channel is enabled and is capable of driving                   FIGURE 6B. 10.3125Gb/s EYE DIAGRAM AT ISL35411DRZ-EVALZ

-8dB. The open eye diagram in Figure 6C illustrates the channel

 6.   When using Renesas Electronics products, refer to the latest product information (data sheets, user’s manuals, application notes, “General Notes for Handling and Using Semiconductor Devices” in the
      reliability handbook, etc.), and ensure that usage conditions are within the ranges specified by Renesas Electronics with respect to maximum ratings, operating power supply voltage range, heat dissipation
      characteristics, installation, etc. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any malfunctions, failure or accident arising out of the use of Renesas Electronics products outside of such specified
      ranges.
 7.   Although Renesas Electronics endeavors to improve the quality and reliability of Renesas Electronics products, semiconductor products have specific characteristics, such as the occurrence of failure at a
      certain rate and malfunctions under certain use conditions. Unless designated as a high reliability product or a product for harsh environments in a Renesas Electronics data sheet or other Renesas
      Electronics document, Renesas Electronics products are not subject to radiation resistance design. You are responsible for implementing safety measures to guard against the possibility of bodily injury, injury
      or damage caused by fire, and/or danger to the public in the event of a failure or malfunction of Renesas Electronics products, such as safety design for hardware and software, including but not limited to
      redundancy, fire control and malfunction prevention, appropriate treatment for aging degradation or any other appropriate measures. Because the evaluation of microcomputer software alone is very difficult
      and impractical, you are responsible for evaluating the safety of the final products or systems manufactured by you.
 8.   Please contact a Renesas Electronics sales office for details as to environmental matters such as the environmental compatibility of each Renesas Electronics product. You are responsible for carefully and
      sufficiently investigating applicable laws and regulations that regulate the inclusion or use of controlled substances, including without limitation, the EU RoHS Directive, and using Renesas Electronics
      products in compliance with all these applicable laws and regulations. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for damages or losses occurring as a result of your noncompliance with applicable
      laws and regulations.
 9.   Renesas Electronics products and technologies shall not be used for or incorporated into any products or systems whose manufacture, use, or sale is prohibited under any applicable domestic or foreign laws
      or regulations. You shall comply with any applicable export control laws and regulations promulgated and administered by the governments of any countries asserting jurisdiction over the parties or
      transactions.
 10. It is the responsibility of the buyer or distributor of Renesas Electronics products, or any other party who distributes, disposes of, or otherwise sells or transfers the product to a third party, to notify such third
      party in advance of the contents and conditions set forth in this document.
 11. This document shall not be reprinted, reproduced or duplicated in any form, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of Renesas Electronics.
