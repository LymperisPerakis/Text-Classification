MAX22192 Evaluation System                                                          Evaluates: MAX22192
General Description                                          EV System Contents
The MAX22192 evaluation system (EV system) pro-              ●● MAX22192EVKIT#, including the MAX22192ARC+
vides the hardware and software necessary to evalu-          ●● USB2PMB2# Adapter Board
ate the MAX22192 octal industrial digital input device
with diagnostic features and digital isolation. The          ●● Micro-USB Cable
MAX22192 evaluation kit (MAX22192EVKIT#) has
Pmod™ compatible connector for SPI communication,
                                                             Features
but does not include the USB2PMB2# adapter board.            ●● Easy Evaluation of the MAX22192
The EV system (MAX22192EVSYS#) includes both the             ●● EV Kit Logic-Side is USB-Powered
MAX22192EVKIT# and the USB2PMB2# adapter board               ●● Configured for IEC 61131-2 Type 1 and 3, and Type 2
that receives commands from a PC through the USB port
to create an SPI interface for communication between the     ●● Independent Slave or Daisy-Chain SPI Interface
software and the MAX22192 on the EV kit.                     ●● Galvanic Isolation using MAX22192 and MAX12931
The EV system includes a graphical user interface (GUI)      ●● Robust Design ±1kV Surge Tolerant Line-to-Ground
that provides communication between the target device        ●● Windows® 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, and
and the PC. The MAX22192 EV kit has a MAX22192                  Windows XP® Compatible Software
device (U1) and a MAX22190 device (U2), which is an
octal industrial digital input device without digital isola- ●● Fully Assembled and Tested
tion. The EV kit can be configured to operate in multiple    ●● Proven PCB Layout
modes, as shown in Figure 1:                                 ●● RoHS Compliant
1)   Single-Channel Mode: The USB2PMB2# adapter
     communicates with either U1 or U2 on the EV kit, de-    Ordering Information appears at end of data sheet.
     pending on which channel is preferred and selected
     using the on-board jumpers.
2)   Independent Slave Mode: The USB2PMB2#
     adapter uses two chip-select signals (CS1 and CS2)
     to control each chip through a single connector/GUI
     interface.
3)   Daisy-Chain Mode: The USB2PMB2# adapter com-
     municates with both U1 and U2 in SPI daisy-chain
     mode. The OSDI from U1 connects to SDI of U2,
     and the SDO of U2 connects to FSDI of U1. Both U1
     and U2 are controlled from a single SPI interface.
