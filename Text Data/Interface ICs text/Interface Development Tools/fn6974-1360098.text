         VDD                1, 9, 12         Power supply. 1.2V supply voltage. The use of parallel 100pF and 47nF decoupling capacitors to ground is
                                             recommended for each of these pins for broad high-frequency noise suppression.
       IN[P,N]                 2, 3          Equalizer differential input, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least 6GHz frequency
                                             response is recommended.
         LOSB                   4            LOS BAR indicator. Low output when input signal is below DT threshold. This pin is internally pulled HIGH with
                                             an 11k resistor.
      CP[A,B]                  6, 7          Control pins for setting equalizer boost level. Tri-state inputs. Pins are read as a 2-digit number to set the boost
                                             level. A is the MSB, and B is the LSB.
         GND               5, 8, 13, 16      These pins must be grounded.
      OUT[P,N]               11, 10          Equalizer differential output, CML. The use of 100nF low ESL/ESR MLCC capacitor with at least 6GHz frequency
                                             response is recommended.
          DT                   15            Detection Threshold. Reference DC voltage threshold for input signal power detection. Data output OUT[P,N] is
                                             muted when the power of the input signal IN[P,N] falls below the threshold. Tie to ground to disable electrical idle
                                             preservation and always enable the output driver.
   Exposed Pad                  -            Exposed pad. For proper electrical and thermal performance, this pad should be connected to the PCB ground
                                             plane.

NOTES:
 6. The input pins IN[P,N] are DC biased to VDD. The specified cable input amplitude range is established by characterization and not production tested,
    and is valid so long as the voltages at the input pins IN[P,N] do not violate the voltage ranges specified in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on page 3.
 7. Maximum Reflection Coefficient given by equation SDDXX(dB) = -12 + 2*(f), with f in GHz. Established by characterization and not production tested.
 8. Maximum Reflection Coefficient given by equation SDDXX(dB) = -6.3 + 13Log10(f/5.5), with f in GHz. Established by characterization and not
    production tested.
 9. Reflection Coefficient given by equation SCCXX(dB) < -7 + 1.6*f, with f in GHz. Established by characterization and not production tested.
10. Limits established by characterization and are not production tested.
11. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted signal (as measured
    at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJpp + 14.1 x RJRMS
12. Measured using a PRBS 215-1 pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent, media-induced loss only.
13. Rise and fall times measured using a 2GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.
14. Compliance to limits is assured by characterization and design.
Typical Performance Characteristics
Performance is measured using the test setup illustrated in Figure 2. The signal from the pattern generator is launched into the twin-ax
cable using an SMA adapter card. The chip evaluation board is connected to the output of the cable through another adapter card. The
ISL36111 output signal is then visualized on a scope to determine signal integrity parameters such as jitter.

LOS Bar Indicator
Pin 4 (LOSB) is used to output the state of the muting circuitry to
serve as a loss of signal indicator for the device. This signal is
directly derived from the muting signal output by the detection
threshold / signal detector comparator. The LOSB signal goes
LOW when the signal detector output is below the externally
controlled detection threshold and HIGH when the detector
output goes above this threshold. This feature is meant to be
used in optical systems (e.g. SFP+) where there are no quiescent
or electrical-idle states. In these cases, the detection threshold is
used to determine the sensitivity of the LOSB indicator. Figure 7
shows the schematic of the LOSB equivalent output structure.
