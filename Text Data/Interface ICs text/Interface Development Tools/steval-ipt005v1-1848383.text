• Board design allows standalone operation for
     basic tests
• Interface to an MCU block and simple board
     configurability allow even full functioning in
     applications (i.e. set-top box)
• Onboard 10 MHz crystal clock oscillator can be
     used to provide card clock in standalone
     operation
• Card clock source selection switch allows
     selection between the onboard crystal
     oscillator as card clock source, or an external
     clock source provided by the microcontroller
     block through the MCU interface together with
     the data signals
• Provides easy, flexible card supply voltage
     selection either by onboard configuration
     switches or remotely by the microcontroller
• RoHS compliant
