      1.   After downloading the zip file to the user’s computer, extract the contents of the zip file.
      2.   Double click on the extracted setup.exe file.
      3.   Follow the resulting standard installation instructions displayed on the screen, entering the installation path if needed. If the default
           path settings have been used, the software automatically completes the installation and creates an access link on the user’s
           computer under Start > All Programs > IDT > ZSSC3018 Evaluation. The installation dialog offers the option to create a desktop
           short-cut icon for the software if selected.
      4.   Connect the kit hardware as described in section 1.3 before starting the software program for the first time. See section 1.4 for
           additional software setup and usage.
1.3        Hardware Setup
1.3.1 Overview of Hardware Connections
The ZSSC3018 Evaluation Kit contains the hardware needed for communication and a demonstration calibration of the ZSSC3018 sensor
signal conditioning ICs. The user can use the software to communicate with the ZSSC3018 DUT installed on the ZSSC3018 SSC Evaluation
Board (SSC EB) via the SSC Communication Board (SSC CB) connected to the user’s computer through a USB cable.
The SSC Sensor Replacement Board (SRB) can be connected to the SSC EB as a replacement for an actual sensor and can be used for the
first step of a calibration demonstration or a dry-run calibration. Alternatively, the user’s sensor module can be connected to the SSC EB for
configuration, calibration, and evaluation as an aid to module development.
Important: Do not connect the SRB to the SSC EB if the user’s sensor module is used.

                                                                                          ZSSC3018 SSC Evaluation Kit and MCS User Manual
The ZSSC3018 power (VDD) can be supplied from the SSC CB’s VDD_LS power supply or from an externally connected supply; for example,
a low-noise laboratory power supply or battery that is used to achieve better performance or accuracy.
Important: The maximum voltage for an external supply is 3.6V.
Important: Upon delivery, there is a dummy IC in the socket on the ZSSC3018 SSC Evaluation Board that must be replaced with an actual
ZSSC3018 device under test (DUT) as described in the next section.
See section 4 regarding the K5 Mass Calibration Board (MCB) DUT connector on the SSC EB shown in Figure 2.
Important: If using the ZSSC3018 Mass Calibration System, do not connect the SSC EB to the SSC CB. Instead, follow the instructions in
section 4.
1.3.2 Kit Hardware Connections and Power-up
Important: If using an external power supply, do not apply the power connection until instructed.
Follow these procedures to set up the kit hardware:
     1.   Install the ZSSC3018 DUT in the PQFN socket on the ZSSC3018 SSC Evaluation Board (SSC EB) taking care to orient pin 1
          properly as shown in Figure 1. Note: If the DUT is completely unconfigured, see “Memory Error” in Table 2.
     2.   If using the SSC CB’s VDD_LS power supply, place a jumper shunt across the “Int.” position on the “Int./Ext.” connector header on
          the SSC EB (see Figure 2).
          Or
          If using an external power supply, apply the shunt in the “Ext.” position on the “Int./Ext.” header.
     3.   Connect the SSC CB and SSC EB as shown in Figure 1. Refer to Table 4 for the pin assignments for this connection.
     4.   If using the SRB, connect it to the SSC EB. See Table 5 for the pin assignments for this connection.
          Or
          If using the customer’s sensor module, connect the module to the “Sensor” connector shown in Figure 2. For alternative
          connections, see Figure 23 for the ZSSC3018 Evaluation Board schematic.
     5.   Connect the USB cable from the USB connector on the SSC CB to an available USB port on the user’s computer.
          Note: If the computer is on and the SSC CB’s VDD_LS power supply was selected in step 2 above, then the kit is now powered up
          as indicated by the VDD_LS supply status LED turning on (see Figure 2).
     6.   Alternative: If an externally connected supply is to be used as selected in step 2 above instead of the internal supply, then before
          connecting it to the kit, adjust the external power supply to the proper voltage and current levels (1.68V to 3.6V). Connect the power
          supply positive voltage to the “+” pin of the two-pin header for the external power supply on the SSC EB (see Figure 2) and connect
          the power supply ground to the “-” pin.

2.      Usage Guide
The ZSSC3018 Evaluation Software is intended for demonstration purposes and calibration of single units. Upon request, IDT will provide the
user with algorithms and assistance in developing their full production calibration software.
Note: The reset button on the SSC CB (see Figure 1) initializes the CB controller to its initial state. Note that any port settings will be
overwritten.
2.1       “IC STATUS” Section
In the left panel under “IC STATUS,” the status of the device is indicated via the color of the virtual LEDs (see Figure 3). The colors are
defined in Table 2. The current status can be read by clicking the “Read status” button. A yellow virtual LED indicates that the status is active;
white indicates inactive.

       Control                                                              Virtual LED Indication
     Powered              The ZSSC3018 is powered correctly.
     CMD Mode             The ZSSC3018 is in Command Mode and remains active and ready to receive dedicated commands.
     Test Mode            The ZSSC3018 is in Test Mode (not intended for users).
     Saturation           An error has occurred due saturation of the internal ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). Normally, the virtual LED blinks for
                          every value out of range.
     Busy                 The ZSSC3018 software is receiving data from the ZSSC3018.
     Memory Error         The CRC test has failed.
                          Important note: Upon first use of an unconfigured ZSSC3018, this virtual LED should be yellow. To clear the initial
                          error indicator, write data to memory (e.g., bridge configuration, coefficients) and generate the signature of the
                          memory contents via the “Write MTP + CRC” button in the left panel (see sections 2.3 and 2.5). The settings for this
                          initial memory write operation can be random because these registers will be overwritten as part of the configuration
                          and calibration procedures.
  SM Config                   SM_Config1 is the selected configuration.
                              SM_Config2 is the selected configuration.
                          Note: The configuration is selected by the “SM_CONFIG” sub-tab under the “CONFIGURE” tab (section 2.3).

In the “SIG. CONDITIONING” sub-tab, all necessary coefficients for signal processing are stored; e.g. gain, offset, and temperature compen-
sation. Initial values are 0; the calibration procedure must be performed in order to set these parameters. See Figure 8.
Figure 8.         “SIG. CONDITIONING” Sub-tab
The “SM_CONFIG” sub-tab sets different parameters of the analog front-end (AFE) of the ZSSC3018; e.g., gain, signal polarity, and ADC
resolution. See Figure 9. Two sets of configuration parameters can be saved: SM_Config1 and SM_Config2. By default, SM_Config1 is used;
in this case, settings for SM_Config2 are not mandatory. The SM_Config2 settings are very useful in cases where there are two different
applications for one sensor. To switch to the alternative signal measurements configuration, a command must be sent. The selected config-
uration stays active until there is a reset or a configuration selection command changes the other signal measurements configuration register.
The active configuration can be selected via the buttons under “I/O Functions.”

memory can be done in the grid box in the correct address for the new value. After the data is entered, the new content must be updated in
the ZSSC3018 via the “Write” command or by clicking the “Write MTP + CRC” button. The display grid updates automatically when the
configuration changes in the “Configuration” and “Calibration” application tabs; the values that are not yet written in the ZSSC3018 memory
are shown in red. These values are NOT written automatically in the ZSSC3018—to complete this, click the “Write MTP + CRC” button.
The data is displayed as four hexadecimal digits for each of the first 20HEX (32DEC) addresses in the MTP. The final register 39HEX (57DEC)
contains the checksum of the entire memory contents. To display the ZSSC3018 memory contents in the table, read the complete memory by
clicking on the “Read MTP” button. The resulting message in the lower left corner of the window should be “MTP read complete.”

2.6         “CALIBRATION” Application Tab
The “CALIBRATION” tab is used for acquiring raw data and calculating the coefficients needed for signal linearization and temperature
compensation.
Note: If the user displays the ZSSC3018 Evaluation Software in a smaller window, the settings section becomes a scrolling window and the
area of settings that is displayed is controlled by the scroll bar below the settings section.
The first step in using the “CALIBRATION” tab is to select the type of calibration to be performed. This defines the number of measurement
points for the sensor signal at various temperatures (if temperature compensation is selected).
The output signal targets define the actual output data in percentage of the ADC range that the ZSSC3018 will output for the measured
sensor value after signal conditioning. For the example below, at a bridge sensor reading of -7301920 counts with 24-bit resolution, the
ZSSC3018 will read 10% of 224 after calibration.

3.        Example of Configuration and Calibration Procedures
This calibration example uses the Sensor Replacement Board to simulate a sensor signal. A typical calibration flow includes the five basic
steps described in the following sections: setup and initialization; data collection; coefficient calculation; memory programming; and
verification. Figure 16 shows the details for the configuration and calibration steps.
3.1         Setup and Initialization
After the GUI is started, ensure that the Evaluation Kit’s SSC Communication Board appears as an active device. Then select a
communication interface (SPI or I2C), and if needed, set the slave address and speed. Then click the “Connect using” button to connect to the
ZSSC3018. Once the correct communication is established, read the simulated data from the Sensor Replacement Board by clicking the
“Start” button on the “MAIN” application tab (note that the simulated sensor data is not calibrated).
The next step is setting the analog front-end (AFE) configuration, which can be done directly on the “CALIBRATION” tab (e.g., set the gain of
the first and the second stage, number of ADC bits resolution, and offset). See Figure 16. These parameters are described in detail in the
ZSSC3018 Data Sheet. (If the “SM_Config for calibration” section is not displayed, see section 2.6.)
The “Acquisition Settings” section has two adjustment fields: “Skip the first” and “Average.” Use the “Skip the first” entry field to select the
number of measurements to be discarded at the beginning of the measurement to avoid collecting invalid data. Use the “Average” entry field
to indicate the number of samples to use to calculate average values to get more coherent data. (If the “Acquisitions Settings” section is not
displayed, see section 2.6.)

3.2        Data Collection
The ZSSC3018 provides digital compensation of individual sensor offset, 1st and 2nd order sensor gain, and 1st and 2nd order temperature gain
and offset drift. On the “CALIBRATION” tab, choose between one of the seven different types of possible calibration scenarios from the drop-
down menus under “Calibration Type Settings.” See Figure 16. For this example, use the two-point calibration without temperature
compensation to obtain the gain and offset calibration for the simulated sensor signal from the Sensor Replacement Board (SRB). Choose the
“B:Linear” option from the drop-down menu under “Calibration Type Settings,” which enables the “S1” and “S2” data fields in the “Sensor
Targets” section. This is the target range of the ADC as a percentage of full scale; for this example; a recommended value will be within the
range of 10% and 90%.
Next, in the “Calibration points” section (for which there are only two active fields in this case), click the “Get” buttons to acquire data for the
first and the second points as follows. For point S2, adjust the potentiometer for the lowest measurable value for the dummy sensor by turning
the SRB potentiometer counter-clockwise. For the next value, turn the potentiometer clockwise and click the “Get” button for the S1 point to
obtain the second value in the calibration curve. For more details on possible calibration types, refer to the ZSSC3018 Data Sheet.
3.3        Coefficient Calculation
The coefficient calculation is done by the Dynamic Link Library (DLL) provided by IDT. This DLL is accessible by any software and is provided
to the customer as means for calibration on a large scale and integration with the customer’s existing workflow. Once the data is gathered and
the user has clicked the “Calculate coefficients” button, the “SUCCESS” message is displayed in the “Coefficient result” table if a possible
solution has been found. If the “FAILED” message is displayed, adjustments must be made to the first and second stages to achieve the
optimal resolution without saturation of the ADC.
3.4        Memory Programming
After the coefficients have been successfully calculated using the DLL, they must be written to the MTP memory. This is done either directly
by clicking the “Write coefficients to IC” button or by clicking the “Write coefficients to MTP” button and then changing to the “MEMORY EDIT”
application tab and clicking the “Write MTP+ CRC” button.
3.5        Verification
After a successful coefficient calculation and memory programming is performed, a recommended practice is to read the memory contents
and verify in the “MAIN” application tab that correct data is read from the sensor.
Measurement data values should be between the target points set during calibration (10% and 90%) as shown in Figure 17.

4.        SSC Mass Calibration System (MCS)
The ZSSC3018 software supports using the SSC Mass Calibration System (MCS) shown in Figure 18 to perform calibration, configuration,
and evaluation for multiple ZSSC3018 DUTs connected to the Mass Calibration Board (MCB). When using the MCS, the MCB is used in
place of the SSC EB at the Bu1 connection to the SSC Communication Board (SSC CB). Refer to the SSC Mass Calibration Board Data
Sheet for full details of MCS contents and operation.
To connect the ZSSC3018 DUTs to the Mass Calibration Board (MCB), there are several options, which can be combined as needed. User-
provided sensor modules and/or the ZSSC3018 SSC Evaluation Board (SSC EB) can be connected to the DUT terminals using the ribbon
cable provided with the MCS. When using the SSC EB, connect the ribbon cable from the DUT terminals on the MCB to the K5 connector on
the SSC EB.
Important note: The voltage level provided from the CB to the MCB is 5V, which is not compliant with ZSSC3018 power supply requirements.
Therefore, the “DUT Supply” and “Interface Supply” terminal blocks must be powered externally with a 1.68V to 3.6V supply. Set jumper K23
to “I2C” and K14 to “extern” to select the external supplies.
