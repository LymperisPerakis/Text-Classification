1.1.      Absolute Maximum Ratings
Note: The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. The ZSSC3036 might not function or be operable
above the recommended operating conditions. Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings might also
damage the device. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions
might affect device reliability. ZMDI does not recommend designing to the “Absolute Maximum Ratings.”

     Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
A dynamic power-on-reset circuit is implemented in order to achieve minimum current consumption in idle mode.
The VDD low level and the subsequent rise time and VDD rising slope must meet the requirements in Table 1.1 to
guarantee an overall IC reset; lower VDD low levels allow slower rising of the subsequent on-ramp of VDD. Other
combinations might also be possible. For example, the reset trigger can be influenced by increasing the power-
down time and lowering the VDD rising slope requirement.

    ZSSC3036
    Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
2 Circuit Description
2.1.     Brief Description
The ZSSC3036 provides a highly accurate amplification of bridge sensor signals. The compensation of sensor
offset, sensitivity, temperature drift, and non-linearity is accomplished via an 18-bit DSP core running a correction
algorithm with calibration coefficients stored in an MTP memory. The ZSSC3036 can be configured for a wide
                                                                       2
range of resistive bridge sensor types. A digital interface (SPI or I C™) enables communication. The ZSSC3036
supports two operational modes: Normal Mode and Command Mode. Normal Mode is the standard operating
mode. Typically in Normal Mode, the ZSSC3036 wakes up from a Sleep State (low power), runs a measurement
in Active State, and automatically returns to the Sleep State. (See section 3.3 for details on operational modes.)
2.2.     Signal Flow and Block Diagram
See Figure 2.1 for the ZSSC3036 block diagram. The sensor bridge supply VDDB and the power supply for analog
circuitry are provided by a voltage regulator, which is optimized for power supply disturbance rejection (PSRR).
See section 1.4 for a graph of PSRR versus frequency. To improve noise suppression, the digital blocks are
powered by a separate voltage regulator. A power supervision circuit monitors all supply voltages and generates
appropriate reset signals for initializing the digital blocks.
The state machine controls the analog circuitry to perform the three measurement types: bridge, temperature, and
offset measurement. The multiplexer selects the signal input to the amplifier, which can be the external signals
from the input pins INP and INN, the internal temperature reference sensor signals, or an input short for
measuring offset. A full measurement request will trigger an automatic sequence of all measurement types and all
input signals. The Temperature Reference Sensor block is based on a resistive sensing element.

     ZSSC3036
     Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
The amplifier consists of two stages with programmable gain values. The 1/f noise and inherent offset are
suppressed by auto-zero and chopper stabilizer techniques. This auto-zero sequence is performed before each
bridge sensor and temperature measurement to compensate for the inherent offset of the amplifier.
The ZSSC3036 employs a 2-stage analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on switched-capacitor technique with
inherit low-pass behavior and noise suppression. The programmable resolution from 10 to 16 bits provides
flexibility for adapting the conversion characteristics. To improve power supply noise suppression, the ADC uses
the bridge supply VDDB as its reference voltage.
The remaining IC-internal offset and the sensor element offset, i.e., the overall system offset for the amplifier and
ADC, can be canceled by an offset and auto-zero measurement, respectively.
                                                                               st           nd
The DSP accomplishes the auto-zero, span, and 1 and 2 order temperature compensation of the measured
bridge signal. The correction coefficients are stored in the MTP memory.
                                                 2
The ZSSC3036 supports SPI and I C™ interface communication for controlling the ZSSC3036, configuration, and
measurement result output.
2.3.      Analog Front End
2.3.1. Amplifier
The amplifier has a differential architecture and consists of two stages. The amplification of each stage and the
sensor bridge gain polarity are programmable via settings in the Measurement Configuration Register BM_config
(address 10HEX; see section 3.6.3) in the MTP memory (see section 2.4.2).
The first five bits of BM_config are the programmable gain settings Gain_stage1 and Gain_stage2. The options
for the programmable gain settings are listed in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2.

If needed, the polarity of the sensor bridge gain can be reversed by setting the Gain_polarity bit, which is bit 5 in
the BM_config register (see section 3.6.3). Changing the gain polarity is achieved by inverting the chopper clock.
Table 2.3 gives the settings for the Gain_polarity bit. This feature enables applying a sensor to the ZSSC3036
with swapped input signals at INN and INP; e.g., to avoid crossing wires for the final sensor module’s assembly.

   Gain_polarity (BM_config Bit 5)                   Gain            Setting Description
                    0                                 +1         No polarity change.

The inherent amplifier offset is suppressed by means of auto-zero and chopper techniques.
The optimal gain (and offset) setup for a specific sensor element can be determined by these steps:
     1) Collect sensor elements’ characteristic, statistical data (over temperature, ambient sensor parameter, and
          over production tolerances):
                a. Minimum differential output voltage:                               Vmin
                b. Maximum differential output voltage:                               Vmax
          Note: The best possible setup can only be determined if the absolute value of Vmax is bigger than the
          absolute value of Vmin. If this is not the case, the gain polarity should be reversed.
     2) If Vmin and Vmax have different signs (normally: Vmax is positive and Vmin is negative), then the required
          ADC offset shift can be selected using this ratio: RatioOffset = |Vmin| / (Vmax – Vmin).
          In this case, the respective offset setup (A2D_offset) is the nearest integer of multiples of 1/16 in the

     3) Determine which of the two following cases is valid.
                a. If RatioOffset – A2D_offset ≤ 0 then calculate
                         Theoretical optimum gain: Gainopt =(1 – A2D_offset) * Vref / Vmax
                b. If RatioOffset – A2D_offset > 0 then calculate
                         Theoretical optimum gain: Gainopt = A2D_offset * Vref / |Vmin|
                                                                                            with:         Vref = Vrefp – Vrefn = 0.94·VDDB,min  1.5V
           Finally, select the setup gain (Gainsetup) as the nearest gain to Gainopt, where Gainsetup ≤ Gainopt.
2.3.2. Analog-to-Digital Converter
A second-order charge-balancing analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to convert the amplifier signal. To
allow optimizing the trade-off between conversion time and resolution, the conversion is split into a MSB coarse
conversion and an LSB fine conversion. The final ADC resolution is determined by MSB + LSB. For the bridge
measurement, the MSB-LSB segmentation is programmable via the Msb and Lsb settings in the BM_config
register (10HEX; see section 3.6.3) stored in the MTP memory (see section 2.4.2). For the temperature
measurement, the MSB-LSB segmentation is programmable via the Temp_ADC settings in the BM_config
register.
                                                              MSB       LSB
The conversion time is proportional to 2                            +2 . During the MSB coarse conversion, the ADC input signal is
                                    MSB
sampled and integrated 2                  times, resulting in inherit low-pass behavior and noise suppression. The longer the
MSB coarse conversion is, the better the noise suppression is. Possible settings are listed below in Table 2.4 and
Table 2.5.

Useful MSB/LSB setups are with LSB = 0 (MSB-only conversions) or combinations that result in
MSB + LSB ≤ 16. Resolutions beyond 16-bit mainly digitize the collected front-end noise and typically do not
improve the system performance.
The ADC conversion times for different MSB/LSB settings are listed in Table 2.6.

The ADC offset is programmable in 8 steps so that the ADC input voltage range can be adapted to the voltage
range at the input pins INP and INN. Possible ADC input voltages are shown in Figure 2.2, where VAGND  VDDB/2.
The ADC offset is controlled by the A2D_Offset setting bits [12:10] in the Measurement Configuration Register
BM_config (10HEX; see section 3.6.3) in the MTP memory (see section 2.4.2). The ADC offset settings are listed in
Table 2.8. See section 1.4 for typical values for Vrefn and Vrefp.

      Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
2.3.3. Temperature Measurement
The ZSSC3036 provides an internal temperature sensor measurement to allow compensation for temperature
effects. See section 1.3 for the temperature sensor resolution. The temperature sensor uses bipolar transistors.
Any transistor circuitry mismatch is suppressed by dynamic element matching technique. The temperature output
signal is a differential voltage that is adapted by the amplifier for the ADC input.
For temperature measurements, the ADC offset and amplifier gain setting are defined by ZMDI. The ADC
MSB/LSB segmentation is programmable by the user for optimizing noise immunity or conversion time (see
section 2.3.2).
2.3.4. Bridge Supply
The ZSSC3036 provides dedicated bridge supply pins VDDB and VSSB. The ADC reference voltages for the
sensor bridge measurement are derived from these internal voltages so that bridge supply disturbances are
suppressed. The current drive ability of VDDB is limited (see IVDDB in section 1.2).
2.4.      Digital Section
2.4.1.       Digital Signal Processor (DSP) Core
The DSP Core block performs the algorithm for correcting the sensor signal. The resulting coefficients are stored
in the MTP memory. When the measurement results are available, the "end of conversion" signal is set at the
EOC pin. The internal EOC information is valid only if both the measurement and calculation have been
completed.
2.4.2.       MTP Memory
The ZSSC3036’s memory is designed with an OTP (one-time programmable) structure. The memory is organized
in 4 one-time programmable pages. When data in the currently valid memory page needs to be updated, normally
a new page must be selected by increasing the page counter and the whole memory content must be written in its
updated version. The user has access to a 24 x 16 bit storage area for values such as calibration coefficients.
Dedicated calibration values are stored in an area not accessible to the user. The required programming voltage
is generated internally in the ZSSC3036 whereas increased ZSSC3036 power supply requirements must be
fulfilled during programming (see Memory Programming Voltage in section 1.3). There is no over-write or erase
function for the MTP memory.
The physical memory function is such that each single bit that has not yet been set to 1 (i.e., remains 0) can still
be changed to 1, so it is possible to (partially) re-program an MTP register as shown in the following example:
               Assume MTP address 11HEX was written with 8421HEX which is 1000 0100 0010 0001BIN.
               Changing the register contents to A6A7HEX (i.e., 1010 0110 1010 0111binary) can be achieved by either
                writing A6A7HEX (any already written bit will be ignored automatically) or just writing the difference
                compared to 8421HEX, which is 2286HEX.

     Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
The content of a re-written register can generally be determined by
          contentRegister = contentold (BITWISE_OR) contentnew.
If contentRegister equals contentnew, a re-write is possible; e.g., this is not the case for contentold = FFFFHEX and
contentnew ≠ FFFFHEX. Depending on the former and the newly intended MTP addresses and register contents a
re-programming could be possible.
2.4.3.       Clock Generator
The clock generator, implemented as a ring oscillator, provides a 3MHz clock signal. The frequency is trimmed
during production test.
2.4.4.       Power Supervision
The power supervision block as a part of the voltage regulator combined with the digital section monitors all
power supplies to ensure a defined reset of all digital blocks during power-up or power supply interruptions.
2.4.5.       Interface
                                                                                                              2
The ZSSC3036 can communicate with the user’s PC via an SPI or I C™ interface *. The interface type is select-
able via the voltage level on the SEL pin:
     SEL = 0 -> SPI Mode
                       2
     SEL = 1 -> I C™ Mode
If the SEL pin is not connected, I²C™ communication will be selected (IC-internal pull-up at SEL pin). The SPI-
specific pins (SS, MISO) do not need to be connected for I²C™ operation.
To also provide interface accessibility in Sleep State (all features inactive except for the digital interface logic), the
interface circuitry is directly supplied by VDD.
* Functional I2C™ interface properties correspond to the NXP I²C™ bus specification Rev. 0.3 (June 2009).

     ZSSC3036
     Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
3       Functional Description
3.1.      Power Up
Specifications for this section are given in sections 1.2 and 1.3. On power-up, the ZSSC3036 communication
interface is able to receive the first command after a time t STA1 from when the VDD supply is within operating
specifications. The ZSSC3036 can begin the first measurement after a time of tSTA2.from when the VDD supply is
operational.
The wake up time from Sleep State to Active State (see section 3.3) after receiving the activating command is
defined as tWUP1 and tWUP2. In Command Mode, subsequent commands can be sent after tWUP1. The first
measurement starts after tWUP2 if a measurement request was sent.
3.2.      Measurements
Available measurement procedures are
     AZBM: auto-zero bridge measurement
     BM: bridge measurement
     AZTM: auto-zero temperature measurement
     TM: temperature measurement
AZBM: The configuration for bridge measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer block connects the amplifier input
to the AGND analog ground reference. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed so that the inherent system
offset for the bridge configuration is converted by the ADC to a 16-bit digital word.
BM: The configuration for bridge measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the amplifier input to the
bridge pins INP and INN. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed. The result is a 16-bit digital word.
AZTM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the amplifier input to
AGND. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed so that the inherent system offset for the temperature
configuration is converted by the ADC to a 16-bit digital word.
TM: The configuration for temperature measurements is loaded. The Multiplexer connects the Amplifier input to
the internal temperature sensor. An analog-to-digital conversion is performed. The result is a 16-bit digital word.
The typical application’s measurement cycle is a complete SSC measurement (using the command ACHEX) with
AZBM, BM, AZTM, and TM followed by a signal correction calculation.

3.3.      Operational Modes
Figure 3.1 illustrates the ZSSC3036 power-up sequence and subsequent operation depending on the selected
                                             2
interface communication mode (I C™ or SPI) as determined by the SEL pin voltage level (see section 2.4.5). With
either interface, after the voltage regulators are switched on, the ZSSC3036’s low voltage section (LV) is active
while the related interface configuration information is read from memory. Then the LV section is switched off, the
ZSSC3036 goes into Sleep State, and the interface is ready to receive commands. Since the interface is always
powered by VDD, it is referred to as the high voltage section (HV).
See Table 3.1 for definitions of the commands.
Figure 3.2 shows the ZSSC3036 operation in Normal Mode and Command Mode including when the LV and HV
sections are active as indicated by the color legend. The Normal Mode automatically returns to Sleep State after
executing the requested measurements. In Command Mode, the ZSSC3036 remains active if a dedicated
command (Start_NOM) was sent, which is helpful during calibration. Command Mode can only be entered if
Start_CM is the first command received after POR.

3.4.1.           SPI/I C™ Commands
The user-accessible section of memory includes addresses 00 HEX through 17HEX in the OTP memory that is
designated by the user memory page pointer. Because each of the four OTP memory pages cannot be rewritten
or erased, the memory page pointer must be incremented to the next OTP memory page in order to write to
memory again (see Table 3.1 for the command). After all four user-accessible OTP memory pages have been
used, further write operations are not possible and the “Memory Full” bit is returned as set in the status byte after
write operations (see section 3.5.1).

The SPI/I C™ commands supported by the ZSSC3036 are listed in Table 3.1. The command to read an address
in the user memory is the same as its address. The command to read the 16-bit memory status of the data at an
address in user memory is the address plus 20HEX. The command to write to an address in user memory is the
address plus 40HEX.
There is a ZMDI-reserved section of memory that can be read but not over-written by the user.

    ZSSC3036
    Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
3.5.     Communication Interface
3.5.1.        Common Functionality
Commands are handled by the command interpreter in the LV section. Commands that need additional data are
not treated differently than other commands because the HV interface is able to buffer the command and all the
data that belongs to the command and the command interpreter is activated as soon as a command byte is
received.
Every response starts with a status byte followed by the data word. The data word depends on the previous
                                                                                                                                                             2
command. It is possible to read the same data more than once if the read request is repeated (I C™) or a NOP
command is sent (SPI). If the next command is not a read request (I²C™) or a NOP (SPI), it invalidates any
previous data.
The status byte contains the following bits (see Table 3.3, Table 3.4, and Table 3.5 for sequence):
    Power indication (bit 6): 1 if the device is powered (VDDB on); 0 if not powered. This is needed for SPI Mode
       where the master reads all zeros if the device is not powered or in power-on reset (POR).
    Busy indication (bit 5): 1 if the device is busy, which indicates that the data for the last command is not
       available yet. No new commands are processed if the device is busy.
    Actual ZSSC3036 mode (bits 4:3): 00 = Normal Mode; 01 = Command Mode; 1X = ZMDI-reserved.
    Memory integrity/error flag (bit 2): 0 if integrity test passed, 1 if test failed. This bit indicates whether the
       checksum-based integrity check passed or failed. Correctable errors are not reported but can be queried
       with the memory status commands (see section 3.6.2). The memory error status bit is calculated only
       during the power-up sequence, so a newly written CRC will only be used for memory verification and status
       update after a subsequent ZSSC3036 power-on reset (POR).
    Data transfer/correction (bit 1): If the last command was a memory write, this bit is 0 if the last memory
       write was successful (memory not full yet); otherwise it is 1 (e.g., page increase but already on last MTP
       page). If the last command was a memory read, this bit is 1 if the data was corrected.

Further status information is provided by the EOC pin. The EOC pin is set high when a measurement and
calculation have been completed.
3.5.2.         SPI
The SPI Mode is available when the SEL pin = 0. The polarity and phase of the SPI clock are programmable via
the CKP_CKE setting in address 02HEX as described in Table 3.8. CKP_CKE is two bits: CPHA (bit 10), which
selects which edge of SCLK latches data, and CPOL (bit 11), which indicates whether SCLK is high or low when it
is idle. The polarity of the SS signal and pin are programmable via the SS_polarity setting (bit 9). The different
combinations of polarity and phase are illustrated in the figures below.

In SPI mode, each command except NOP is started as shown in Figure 3.5. After the execution of a command
(busy = 0), the expected data can be read as illustrated in Figure 3.6 or if no data are returned by the command,
the next command can be sent. The status can be read at any time with the NOP command (see Figure 3.7).

All mandatory I²C-bus protocol features are implemented. Optional features like clock stretching, 10-bit slave
address, etc., are not supported by the ZSSC3036’s interface.
In I²C-High-Speed Mode, a command consists of a fixed length of three bytes.
3.6.      Memory
In the ZSSC3036, the memory is organized page-wise and can be programmed multiple (4) times (MTP). Each
register can only be programmed once per page. The valid page is determined by the page counter which can be
incremented with the command 5EHEX – this leads to a “reset” of all registers and a re-programming is necessary.
Increasing the customer page counter will disable all old register contents of the former page. It is possible to
(re-)program a total of 4 pages. Resetting the page counter is not possible. The page counter starts with 0 and
                                                                        th
can be incremented to a maximum of 3. If the 4 memory page has been used, no further changes in the memory
are possible – careful writing and page incrementing is strongly recommended. There are two MTP page types:
     Customer Page: accessible by means of regular write operations (40HEX to 57HEX). It contains: the customer
                                ID, interface setup data, measurement setup information, calibration coefficients, etc.
   ZMDI Page:                  only accessible for write operations by ZMDI. The ZMDI page contains specific trim
                                information and is programmed during manufacturing test by ZMDI.
3.6.1.       Programming Memory
Programming memory requires a specific supply voltage level (>2.9V) at the VDD pin (see section 1.3 for
specifications). The MTP programming voltage itself is generated by means of an implemented charge pump,
generating an internal memory programming voltage (VPP); no additional, external voltage, other than VDD
needed. The program timing is shown in Figure 3.11. Supplying the ZSSC3036 with VDD>2.9V during memory
programming is required. After the memory is programmed, it must be read again to verify the validity of the
memory contents.

          g(x) = x + x + x + 1                             with the initialization value: FFFFHEX.
3.7.      Calibration Sequence
Calibration essentially involves collecting raw signal and temperature data from the sensor-IC system for different
known bridge values and temperatures. This raw data can then be processed by the calibration master (assumed
to be a PC), and the calculated calibration coefficients can then be written to MTP memory. Below is a brief
overview of the steps involved in calibrating the ZSSC3036.
There are three main steps to calibration:
      1. Assigning a unique identification to the ZSSC3036. This identification is written to shadow RAM and later
          programmed in MTP memory. This unique identification can be stored in the two 16-bit registers
          dedicated to customer ID. It can be used as an index into a database stored on the calibration PC. This
          database will contain all the raw values of bridge readings and temperature readings for that part, as well
          as the known bridge measurand conditions and temperature to which the bridge was exposed.
      2. Data collection. Data collection involves getting uncorrected or raw data from the bridge at different
          known measurand values and temperatures. Then this data is stored on the calibration PC using the
          unique identification of the device as the index to the database.
      3. Coefficient calculation and storage in MTP memory. After enough data points have been collected to
          calculate all the desired coefficients, the coefficients can be calculated by the calibrating PC and written
          to the shadow RAM. After that, MTP memory is programmed with the contents of the shadow RAM.
      4. Result. The sensor signal and the characteristic temperature effect on output will be linearized according
          to the setup-dependent maximum output range.
It is essential to perform the calibration with a fixed programming setup during the data collection phase. In order
to prevent any accidental misprocessing, it is further recommended to keep the MTP memory setup stable during
the whole calibration process as well as in the subsequent operation. A ZSSC3036 calibration only fits the single
setup used during its calibration. Changes of functional parameters after a successful calibration can decrease
the precision and accuracy performance of the ZSSC3036 as well as of the whole application.

      ZSSC3036
      Low-Power 16-Bit Sensor Signal Conditioner IC
3.7.1.       Calibration Step 1 – Assigning Unique Identification
Assign a unique identification number to the ZSSC3036 by using the memory write command (40HEX + data and
41HEX + data; see Table 3.1 and Table 3.8) to write the identification number to Cust_ID0 at memory address
00HEX and Cust_ID1 at address 01HEX as described in section 3.6.1. These two 16-bit registers allow for more than
4 trillion unique devices.
3.7.2.       Calibration Step 2 – Data Collection
The number of unique points (measurand and/or temperature) at which calibration must be performed generally
depends on the requirements of the application and the behavior of the resistive bridge in use. The minimum
number of points required is equal to the number of bridge coefficients to be corrected with a minimum of three
different temperatures at three different bridge values. For a full calibration resulting in values for all 7 possible
bridge coefficients and 3 possible temperature coefficients, a minimum of 7 pairs of bridge with temperature
measurements must be collected.
Within this minimum 3x3 measurements field, data must be collected for the specific value pairs (at known
conditions) and then processed to calculate the coefficients. In order to obtain the potentially best and most robust
coefficients, it is recommended that measurement pairs (temperature vs. measurand) be collected at the outer
corners of the intended operation range or at least at points that are located far from each other. It is also
essential to provide highly precise reference values as nominal, expected values. The measurement precision of
the external calibration-measurement equipment should be ten times more accurate than the expected
ZSSC3036 output precision after calibration in order to avoid precision losses caused by the nominal reference
values (e.g., measurand signal and temperature deviations).
Note: An appropriate selection of measurement pairs can significantly improve the overall system performance.
The determination of the measurand-related coefficients will use all of the measurement pairs. For the
temperature-related correction coefficients, 3 (at three different temperatures) of the measurement pairs will be
used.
Note: There is an inherent redundancy in the 7 bridge-related and 3 temperature-related coefficients. Since the
temperature is a necessary output (which also needs correction), the temperature-related information is
mathematically separated, which supports faster and more efficient DSP calculations during the normal usage of
the sensor-IC system.
The recommended approach for data collection is to make use of the raw-measurement commands:
               For bridge sensor values:
                o   A2HEX + 0000HEX: single bridge measurement for which the configuration register will be loaded
                                                    from the BM_Config register (10HEX in MTP); preprogramming the
                                                    measurement setup in the MTP is required.
                o   A3HEX + ssssHEX: single bridge measurement for which the BM_Config configuration register
                                                    (Gain, ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as ssss HEX and must be provided
                                                    externally via the interface.

              For temperature values:
               o   A6HEX + 0000HEX: single temperature measurement for which the configuration register will be
                                                   loaded from an internal temperature configuration register (preprogrammed by
                                                   ZMDI in MTP); preprogramming of the respective configuration is done by
                                                   ZMDI prior to IC delivery. This is the recommended approach for temperature
                                                   data collection.
               o   A7HEX + ssssHEX: single temperature measurement for which the configuration register (Gain,
                                                   ADC, Offset, etc.) will be loaded as ssss HEX and must be provided externally
                                                   via the interface. The data composition of the temperature configuration
                                                   register is similar to the BM_config (address 10HEX) register for the bridge
                                                   sensor.
3.7.3.      Calibration Step 3 – Coefficient Calculations
The math to perform the coefficient calculation is complicated and will not be discussed in detail. There is a brief
overview in the next section. ZMDI will provide software (DLLs) to perform the coefficient calculation (external to
the sensor-IC system) based on auto-zero corrected values. After the coefficients are calculated, the final step is
to write them to the MTP memory of the ZSSC3036.
3.8.     The Calibration Math
3.8.1.      Bridge Signal Compensation
The saturation check in the ZSSC3036 is enhanced compared with older SSCs from ZMDI. Even saturation
effects of the internal calculation steps are detected, allowing the final correction output to still be determined. It is
possible to get potentially useful signal conditioning results which have had an intermediate saturation during the
calculations – these cases are detectable by observing the status bit[0] for each measurement result. Details
about the saturation limits and the valid ranges for values are provided in the following equations.
SOT_curve selects whether second-order equations compensate for sensor nonlinearity with a parabolic or
S-shaped curve. The parabolic compensation is recommended.

3.8.2.        Temperature Signal Compensation
Temperature is measured internally. Temperature correction contains both linear gain and offset terms as well as
a second-order term to correct for any nonlinearities. For temperature, second-order compensation for
nonlinearity is always parabolic. Again, the correction formula is best represented as a two-step process as
follows:

The ZSSC3036 is available in die form with a chip size (including scribe line) of 1.5mm . See Figure 4.1 for
additional dimensions.
In Figure 4.1, the outer dimensions shown are estimations for a die after sawing with remaining scribe-line silicon
of approximately 20µm around the core die. Thus, the effective outer dimensions might differ slightly.
