The cLite™ SSC Modular Evaluation Kit contains the hardware needed for communication and calibration of a
cLite™ family sensor signal conditioning IC, including the ZSC31210, ZSSC3122, and ZSSC3123. A PC can
communicate with the cLite™ socketed on the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board via the SSC Communication Board
(SSC CB) through a USB connection. The kit does not include the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software, which must
be downloaded from the IDT website (www.IDT.com) to ensure receiving the latest release, as described in
section 4. The software should function on any Windows® 2000 / XP / Vista / Windows® 7/ Windows® 8 system.
The cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board can connect to a capacitive sensor or provide on-board capacitors for
simulating input from a capacitive sensor. (See Figure 3.1.)

2      USB Drivers
                    ®               ®
If using Windows 7 or Windows 8, the user’s system will automatically download and use the latest approved
USB driver from Microsoft, so the following procedures to install the USB drivers are not applicable. In this case,
ensure that a connection to the internet is established before connecting the SSC Communication Board V4.1 to a
free USB port.
For the Windows® 2000, XP, or Vista operating systems, the cLite™ SSC Modular Evaluation Kit requires instal-
lation of two USB drivers. To install the drivers, the user’s system must meet these requirements:
    •  x86-compatible PC
    •  64 MB RAM
    •  Hard drive with 20MB free space
    •  USB port
The two USB device drivers are available on the IDT website (see www.IDT.com/SSC-COMM-BD). These drivers
will make the PC’s USB port appear as a virtual COM port (typically COM3 or COM4 on most computers). The
SSC Evaluation Kit software accesses the SSC Evaluation Board through the SSC CB as if it were a COM
(RS232) port. These drivers will not affect the operation of any other USB peripherals.
Refer to SSC_AN_CommunicationBoard_Driver_Installation_Rev_X_x.pdf for instructions on installing these two
drivers and for determining the virtual COM port for the SSC Evaluation Kit, which is needed for setting up the kit.

The main purpose of the cLite™ SSC Modular Evaluation Kit is communication between the PC and the cLite™.
The PC sends commands and data via the USB / SSC CB (virtual COM port). The microcontroller on the SSC CB
                                                                   2    †
interprets these commands and relays them to the cLite™ in the I C™ bus standard format (K1 Pin 11 / SCL;
Pin 13/ SDA). The microcontroller will also forward any data bytes from the cLite™ chip back to the PC via the
USB connection. These bytes can be sensor and temperature readings to be displayed by the PC software; raw
ADC readings used during calibration; or EEPROM content bytes.

3.2    Installing the Communication and Calibration Software
The cLite™ SSC Modular Evaluation Kit does not include the software, which must be downloaded from the IDT
website (www.IDT.com) to ensure receiving the latest release. To download the software, navigate to either of the
following product pages (same software applies to the ZSC31210, ZSSC3122, and ZSSC3123):
    • ZSSC3122: www.IDT.com/ZSSC3122
    • ZSSC3123: www.IDT.com/ZSSC3123
On the product page, click on the link titled “cLite Evaluation Software Rev. X” (where X is the current revision)
and follow the dialog instructions as needed to download the zip file for the software.
Open the zip file and extract the cLiteSSC_Setup_vX.exe file.
To install the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Kit software on the user’s PC hard drive, double-click on the downloaded
cLiteSSC_Setup_vX.exe file. Respond to the dialog box to select the installation directory, and the software will
complete the installation, which results in a program shortcut on the desktop of the PC.
Note: When the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Kit software is activated for the first time, the kit type (“HW type”) and
product type (ZSC31210, ZSSC3122, or ZSSC3123) must be selected and the COM port must be entered as
described in sections 4.2 and 4.3.
3.3    Connections to the cLite™
The SSC Evaluation Board has a TSSOP-14 socket for inserting the cLite™. There is an additional 10-pin header
socket (K2; see Figure 3.1) for connection to a customer-supplied remote board.
The board can be used for in-circuit programming of the cLite™ in the user’s calibration fixture using the VDD,
VSS, SDA, SCL and READY connections on the K2 connector on the SSC Evaluation Board.
Note: Only one cLite™ IC connection option can be used at a time.
3.4    Power Supply to the Board
The K1 connector to the SSC CB provides the power supply from the SSC CB’s USB port to the SSC Evaluation
Board. Using the power via the USB port, the maximum current that can be provided is 40mA. All functions of the
board are operative down to 1.8V. The blue potentiometer regulates the supply voltage in a range from 1.8 to
5.5V.The board has a green LED labeled VSupply, which lights if the board has power.
3.5    Reset Switch
Use the push button on the SSC CB (see Figure 1.1) to reset communications if needed. When the SSC CB is
reset using the push button, the COM port in the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software must be reopened (see section
4.3).

4 cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software
4.1    Overview
The cLite™ SSC Modular Evaluation Kit is intended for demonstration purposes and calibration of single units.
The installation folder is (C:\program files\ZMDI\cLite SSC Evaluation Software). IDT can provide the user with
algorithms and assistance in developing full production calibration software. Figure 4.1 shows the main dialog
window of the cLite SSC Evaluation Software.
The six types of text files that support the software user are described in sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.
4.1.1      User Files
User files are saved in [My Documents]\ZMDI\cLite SSC Evaluation Software and consist of status files, log files,
and EEPROM files.
   • A StatusLog.txt file lists all commands sent to the cLite™, responses, and error messages. If software
       problems occur, this file can be used for detecting the root cause of the problem.
   • When the software is activated, a CommunicationLog.txt file is saved. This file is a log of the
       communication to the cLite™ during the software session and can be saved after closing the software by
       renaming the file. Otherwise, it is overwritten the next time the software is opened.
   • In Command Mode (CM), the user can save/load the EEPROM contents from an *.eep file to the EEPROM
       and vice versa.
   • In Normal Operation Mode (NOM), the user can log capacitance and temperature readings to a text file
       (.txt) of the user’s choice.
   • The calibration is documented in the CalibrationLog_ddMMMYYYY.txt file. These files are cumulative, with
       a new file for each day to prevent them from getting too long.
4.1.2      Data File calibration.db
The calibration.db file is used by the software for calibration. Where the file is saved depends on the Windows
system:
   • For Windows 2000 and Windows XP, it is saved in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
       Data\ZMDI\cLite SSC Evaluation Software.
   • For Windows® Vista, Windows® 7, and Windows® 8, it is saved in C:\ProgramData\ZMDI\cLite SSC
       Evaluation Software.

  4.12.1 IDT Config
“Meas Mode” Menu
This allows the user to select between Update Rate and Sleep Mode. Sleep Mode significantly reduces power
consumption of the cLite™ by “sleeping” until a measurement request is received. Note that in Sleep Mode, PDM
cannot be used.
“Update Rate” Menu
When operating in Update Mode, the update rate determines power consumption and response time. Select the
update rate by clicking on one of the four update rates on the “Update Rate” drop-down menu.
Note: In Sleep Mode, this setting has no effect.
“Output Mode” Menu
Three output options are available on the “Output Mode” drop-down menu:
    • I C™
        2
    • SPI
    • PDM
Note: If the “Communication Type” setting in the “Setup” menu is set to “Automatic” the communication protocol of
the SSC Communication board will be adjusted automatically to match the cLite™ DUT setting.
“Lock EEPROM” Checkbox
If “Lock EEPROM” is checked, EEPROM locations 0 through 15HEX are permanently locked preventing any future
changes.
“Lock I2C Addr” Checkbox
                             2
If needed, lock the slave I C™ address selection by clicking the “Lock I2C Addr” checkbox. Without this lock, the
                              2
cLite™ will respond to all I C™ addresses. If the address is locked, the “I2C Addr” setting (see section 4.5) must
match the “DeviceID” programmed in EEPROM.
“SotTC 2x”
If “SotTC 2x” is checked, the SOT_tcg and SOT_tco values (EEPROM words 09HEX, 07HEX) are multiplied by a
factor of 2. The check box is set by the calibration DLL as a result of the calculated calibration coefficients stored
in the EEPROM.
“GainC 4X” Checkbox
If “GainC 4X” is checked, the Gain_1 and Gain_2 values (EEPROM words 0CHEX, 0EHEX) are multiplied by a factor
of 4. The check box is set by the calibration DLL as a result of the calculated calibration coefficients stored in the
EEPROM.
“Third Order Corr” Checkbox
If “Third Order Corr” is checked, the third order nonlinearity correction is selected instead of piece-wise correction
with breakpoint math. Otherwise the piece-wise correction with break point math is enabled.

4.12.2 Customer Config
“Device ID” Field
                           2
When the cLite™ is in I C™ communication mode, the default slave address is 28HEX. If a different slave address
is required, program the part for the new address by entering the hexadecimal value of the new address in the
“Device ID” field. The value is written to EEPROM when the field is unselected. The valid address range is 00HEX
                         2
to 7FHEX. The new I C™ address will take effect on cycling power or entering Normal Operation Mode (“Start
NOM”).
Note: If “Lock I2C Addr” is on (see section 4.12.1), “DeviceID” must match the “I2C Addr” setting (see section
4.5).
“Alarm High” Menu
The “Alarm High” drop-down menu configures the Alarm High pin to be active low or active high and sets whether
it is full push-pull or open drain.
“Alarm Low” Menu
The “Alarm Low” drop-down menu configures the Alarm Low pin to be active low or active high and sets whether
it is full push-pull or open drain.
“SPI Phase” Menu
The “SPI Phase” drop-down menu configures whether the SPI master samples data on the negative edge or on
the positive edge when using SPI communication.
“Ready Open Drain” Checkbox
If checked, “Ready Open Drain” configures the Ready pin to be an open-drain style driver instead of full push-pull.
“Fast Start Up” Checkbox
If checked, “Fast Start Up” sets the Command Window length to 3ms instead of 10ms.
4.12.3 AFE Config Section
The “AFE Config” section configures the analog front-end for both the sensor and internal temperature measure-
ment. See the datasheet for details on how to configure this section properly.

5 Dry Run Calibration
The following directions perform an example of a simple 3-point nonlinear calibration using the sensor
                                                                                              2
replacement C0 (3pF, 6pF, 3+6pF) on the SSC board. The calibrated I C™output will be displayed as the
calibration result (see section 4.6).
5.1 Steps for the Dry Run Calibration
      1) Connect the SSC Communication (SSC CB) and cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board. Insert the cLite™ DUT in
           the 14-pin TSSOP socket taking care to align pin 1 as indicated in Figure 3.1).
      2) Connect a USB cable from the USB connector on the SSC CB to an available USB port on the PC. In the
           PC’s Device Manager, check which COM port is connected to “ZMDI SSC Evaluation Kit.” Verify that the
           green PWR LED is lit on the SSC CB.
      3) Start the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software.
      4) Select the proper “HW type” (SSC Eval Kit) and “Product” under the setup menu (see section 4.2)
      5) Select the proper COM port. Click on “Open Port” (see section 4.3).
      6) Click on “START CM.” If the setup is correct, the current EEPROM contents are displayed in the
           “Response” field at the right and in the EEPROM section in the lower left bottom.
      7) Click on the “Load” button and browse as needed to locate and load any *.eep file (see section 4.1).
           Using the capacitance on the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board for this example, load the default EEPROM
           file provided with the software installation for the product and revision used (ZSC31210 Rev C
                                                                                                **
           Default.eep, ZSSC3122 Rev A Default.eep, or ZSSC3123 Rev A Default.eep) .
      8) Click on “Calibrate.” The calibration window appears (see Figure 5.1).

                                                     ZSC31210 / ZSSC3122 / ZSSC3123 SSC Modular Evaluation Kit Description

    9) For the 3-point calibration, choose the coefficients Gain_1, Offset_1 and Sot_1 by highlighting the coeffi-
        cients in the upper middle section of the calibration window. The smaller graph above the coefficient list
        indicates the recommended pattern of three capacitive sensor readings at the same temperature.
    10) For calibrations using a piece-wise correction, check “Piecewise Correction” and set a break point in the
        “Break Pt” field. For this example, no breakpoint is used, so leave the default value 100% as the setting.
    11) Click on “Initialize” in the cLite™ ID section (lower left corner). The “Initialize Calibration” window appears
        (see Figure 5.2). Click “Browse” and select the same default EEPROM file as used in step 7). Click on
        “Initialize From File.”

   12) Next start data collection. Normally this would be done with a real capacitive sensor attached to the
       cLite™ on a remote board in a controlled chamber. Instead, this dry run calibration uses the C0 sensor
       replacement as the input.
       Note: The minimum number of calibration points is equal to the number of coefficients to be calculated.
       The software allows the user to collect more than the required number of calibration points. The user can
       select which points are used for calculating the calibration coefficients by checking the “Cal” column. Data
       points that are not selected in the “Cal” column will be used for validation of the output error shown the
       “Error” column.
       a) On jumper K7 on the SSC Evaluation Board, shunt C0 to CC for a 3pF capacitance input
            (see Figure 3.1).
       b) Enter 10% in the “Sensor %” field.
       c) Click on “Add New Point.” The software obtains a raw reading from the part, graphs the new data
            point, and displays the values in the middle bottom section.
       d) Remove the 3pF shunt on K7. Shunt C0 to CC on the K8 jumper for a 6pF capacitance input.
       e) Enter 50% in the “Sensor %” field.
       f)   Click on “Add New Point” again. The software obtains a new raw reading from the part and graphs
            the new data point.
       g) Add the 3pF shunt back onto K7 for a total of 9pF capacitance input.
       h) Enter 90% in the “Sensor %” field.
       i)   Click on “Add New Point” again. The software obtains a new raw reading from the part and graphs
            the new data point.
   13) Because this is a 3-point calibration, the software has all the necessary data for calculating and writing
       the coefficients. Click on “Calculate,” which should now be active.
   14) Close the calibration window. Click on “Start NOM” and then “Run” to display the digital output values in
       the lower display section.

6 Verify Calibration with PDM_C Output
In PDM mode, the cLite™ must be programmed to be in Update Mode. A simple first-order RC filter is provided
on the SSC Evaluation Board for creating an analog output by filtering the PDM signal (for more details refer to
the data sheet, section 3.7). The analog output voltage can be measured in two different ways supported by the
cLite™ SSC Modular Evaluation Kit as described below. The calibration steps explained in section 5 are also
valid for applications using the PDM_C output.
6.1 Measuring the PDM_C Output using the cLite™ Software
For this check, the 10-bit ADC of the microcontroller on the SSC CB reads the PDM_C voltage and displays the
ratio of the measured output voltage to the supply voltage of the SSC CB (5V). In order to get an accurate
reading, the VDD voltage on the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board must be known (the voltage can be adjusted via
the blue potentiometer on the board). Record the voltage into the VDD field in the main window of the cLite™
SSC Evaluation Software.
Follow the instructions in steps 1) through 14) of section 5, and then complete these additional steps.
     15) Change the output mode selection in the main menu to PDM_C.
     16) Enable PDM_C/PDM_T via the K3/K4 jumpers on the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board.
     17) Click on “Start NOM” and then “Run” to display the output voltage in [%] of the supply voltage.
7 Calculation of Calibration Coefficients Off-Line
Note This calculation is possible without connecting the kit boards to the PC. Raw and target values can copied
using the copy and paste function of any spreadsheet program.
Steps for the Off-Line Calibration Coefficient Calculation:
     1) Start the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software.
     2) Click on “Calibrate.” The calibration window appears (see Figure 5.1).
     3) Select the coefficients for the desired calibration method by highlighting the coefficients in the upper
         middle section of the calibration window. The smaller graph above the coefficient list indicates the
         recommended pattern of capacitive sensor readings and temperature readings.
     4) For calibrations using a piece-wise correction, check “Piecewise Correction” and set a break point in the
         “Break Pt” field.
     5) Click on “Initialize” in the cLite™ ID section (lower left corner). The “Initialize Calibration” window appears
         (see Figure 5.2). Click “Browse” and select any xxx.eep file stored in the folder [My Documents]\ZMDI
         \cLite SSC Evaluation Software. Click on “Initialize From File.”
         Note: This is a “blind” initialization because no part is connected.

    6) Start data collection. The target and raw values can be written/copied in the related fields. The values are
        [%] for the capacitance target and raw readings and [°C] for the temperature target and raw readings.
        a) Click on “Add New Point.”
        b) Enter the first target capacitance reading [%] in the “sensor” field and enter the raw value [%] in the
             “raw” field. For calibration with temperature compensation, also add the chamber temperature in the
             “temp” field and raw readings in the “rawT” fields.
        c) Repeat a) and b) as needed until all calibration points are entered.
    Note: See step 12) in section 5.1 for use of the “Cal” column shown in Figure 7.1.

                                                                    Validation error in calibration point (re-calculation
      Enabled values are           Target and raw values            with calculated coefficients; ignore errorT without
       used for calibration        (e.g., copied from Excel™)       temperature calibration)
    7) Check the “Valid” check box in the cLite™ ID section, and click on the “Calculate” button. The coefficients
        are stored in the CalibrationLog.txt file.
    8) Click the “View Log” button to open this file. For each calibration point, the error for the point is calculated
        in the same file.
    9) The calibration information can be exported to Microsoft Excel™ or to a CSV file by clicking on the
        “Export” button. (Use the drop-down arrow to switch between Excel™ and CSV file)
    Note     Instead of entering the raw and target values for the capacitance and temperature target and raw
             values, the user can transfer these values from an Excel™ file using the copy/paste feature. The
             number of rows in the Excel™ table must match the number of rows in the software. Ensure that the
             Excel™ table includes only numbers in the correct format (Category: Number). Copying from formula
             results is not possible.

8 cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software with the IDT SSC Terminal
8.1     Protocol
The microcontroller (type ATmega32) on the SSC Communication Board (SSC CB) enables communication with
the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Board/ cLite™ using the cLite™ SSC Evaluation Software running on the PC. The
            2
standard l C™ protocol is implemented in the microcontroller’s software. The USB_UART IC on the SSC CB
transfers the signals from the microcontroller to the USB port of the PC.
For more details, see the SSC Communication Board Data Sheet.
8.2     IDT SSC Terminal
The IDT SSC Terminal is the lowest level of communication for transferring commands from the PC to the
microcontroller on the SSC CB. Refer to the SSC Communication Board Data Sheet for instructions for
downloading this program from the SSC Evaluation Tools web page on IDT’s web site (www.IDT.com/SSC-
COMM-BD). A full summary and detailed command description of the applicable controller commands are given
