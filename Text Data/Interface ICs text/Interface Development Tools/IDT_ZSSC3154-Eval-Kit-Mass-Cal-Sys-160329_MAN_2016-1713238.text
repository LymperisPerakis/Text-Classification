The main purpose of the SSC Evaluation Kit is communication between the user’s PC and the ZSSC3154. The
PC sends commands and data via its USB port (configured as a virtual COM port) to the SSC CB. The
                                                                                                                             ‡
microcontroller on the SSC CB interprets these commands and relays them to the ZSSC3154 in the I²C™ or
OWI (One-Wire Interface) communication mode. The microcontroller will also forward any data bytes from the
ZSSC3154 back to the PC via the USB connection. These bytes can be sensor and temperature readings to be
displayed by the PC software, raw ADC data used during calibration, or EEPROM data. The SSC CB micro-
controller controls the power signals required for entering the Command Mode.
3.2.       Schematic
Figure 2.2 shows the schematic of the ZSSC3154 SSC Evaluation Board (SSC EB). The SSC EB is powered by
the KS5V supply controlled by the μC on the SSC CB. The D1 green LED on the SSC EB displays the status of
this supply (see Figure 3.1). Its forward current is not included in the measured supply current.
The SSC EB board type is hard-coded by three resistors on the backside of the PCB on K1 connector pins D5
(low), D6 (low), and D7 (high). The SSC EB is connected to the SSC CB via the K1 50-pin female connector.
The SRB can be connected to the SSC EB via its K2 50-pin male connector. Alternatively, an external bridge
sensor element and external temperature sensors can be connected using the on-board screw terminal KL1/KL2.
On-board there are several strips for simple access to all IC signals (connectors K3 and K8).

The K4 jumper can be used to remove the power supply for the ZSSC3154 manually or for a simple measure-
ment of the supply current. The K5 jumper is used to determine the Diagnostic Fault Band Mode (DFB) for the
AOUT voltage level. If left open, the level is low (DFBL); if shorted to ground, the level is high (DFBH).
The output signal of AOUT2 can also be connected to pin10 on K6 if jumper K7 is shortened.
Figure 3.2 SSC Evaluation Board Schematic
3.3.    Connections to the ZSSC3154
The SSC EB has a QFN-32 socket for inserting the QFN 5x5 ZSSC3154. The K8 connector on the SSC EB can
be used to connect directly to the ZSSC3154 for in-circuit programming.
NOTE: Only one ZSSC3154 connection option can be used at a time through the SSC CB or via individual
connections.
Multiple ZSSC3154 can be connected through the Mass Calibration Board (MCB) via individual connections or
through the ZSSC3154 EB connector K6. For more details, see section 6.
3.4.    Reset Switch
Use the push button on the SSC CB to reset communications if needed.

                                                       ZSSC3154 Evaluation Kit and Mass Calibration System Description
4.4.    General Setup of the Software
The software features described in this section are applicable to both the ZSSC3154 Evaluation Kit and the
ZSSC3154 MCS.
Because of the large number of different functionalities of the ZSSC3154, the user interface is divided into
different sections. Within each section, a number of associated functionalities are implemented. Several
submenus allow access to sub-functionalities. After the ZSSC3154 Evaluation Software is started, the main
window is displayed (see Figure 4.1). When communication is established with a ZSSC3154 inserted in the
socket on the SSC EB, the software can be adapted to the IC’s configuration by clicking the RdRAM&Set button
on the main window in the "IC Configuration” section.
Figure 4.1 Main Window of the Evaluation Software
The main window includes all the settings for configuration of the ZSSC3154 in a clear structure that hides the
corresponding HEX commands behind buttons and drop-down menus. For a detailed description of the com-
mands, refer to the ZSSC3154 Functional Description. An information box that explains functionality appears
when the cursor is placed over most buttons, drop-down menus, and check boxes.

                                                                ZSSC3154 Evaluation Kit and Mass Calibration System Description
4.4.1.      Interface Selection
                                                                  TM
The ZSSC3154 supports two interfaces: OWI and I²C
(see Figure 4.2). After starting the software, select the                 Figure 4.2 Interface Selection Section
interface for the application in the “Interface & Board Ver-
sion” section. (“USBPort-Kit” refers to the ZSSC3154 Evalu-
ation Kit.)
The one-wire digital interface (OWI) combines a simple and
easy protocol adaptation with a cost-saving pin sharing
(AOUT1). The communication principle is derived from the
 2
I C™ protocol. An advantage of OWI output signal
capability is that it enables “end-of-line” calibration. It is
designed mainly for calibration, but it can also be used to
digitally read the calibrated sensor signal continuously.
                                                                                              TM
Adjacent to the drop-down menu for the interface is a menu for selecting the I²C                  addresses to be used for
communication.
If the I²C™ interface is selected, additional settings for the I²C™ interface are enabled in the “Send Command”
dialog window. For more details about the “Send Command” menu, see section 4.10.

4.4.3.        Analog Front End (AFE) Adjustment
                                                                                                         Figure 4.5 Bridge Sensor
The ZSSC3154 has different options to adapt the analog front end (AFE) to
                                                                                                                     Adaptation
the specific sensing element. The “Sensor - Full Bridge” and “Half Bridge”
sections (shown in Figure 4.5) influence the programmable gain amplifier
(PGA) and extended zero compensation.
The sensor’s span or sensitivity is defined by mV/V and is referenced to
the bridge supply voltage.
Different reference voltages can be selected for the half bridge, which are
entered as a percentage of the positive analog supply voltage (VDDA).
Refer to the ZSSC3154 Data Sheet for details about the AFE and XZC
settings.
The polarity of the sensor signal can be selected via the                                 button and
can be changed if the PCB layout requires swapped input pins.

                                                          ZSSC3154 Evaluation Kit and Mass Calibration System Description
4.4.4.     Temperature Sensor Selection                                           Figure 4.6 Temperature Sensor
The next stage in the AFE is the multiplexer that selects the input signal for
measuring temperature (see Figure 4.6). The ZSSC3154 can use three
different temperature channels: one internal and two external. Each input
can be used for calibration calculation. External temperature sensors can
be used as an optional additional output signal during Normal Operating
Mode (NOM).
4.4.5.     ADC Settings
The last stage of the ZSSC3154’s AFE is the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The signal path within the AFE is
designed in fully differential switched capacitor technology with a selectable resolution of 13 or 14 bits. The ADC
input must be within 10% to 90% of the ADC range of the application.
Refer to the ZSSC3154 Data Sheet for details about ADC settings.
If the analog input voltage does not fit the ADC range resulting in an under-          Figure 4.7 ADC Adjust
flow or overflow, the “FullBridgeRS” or “HalfBridgeRS” drop-down menus in
the “ADC Adjust” section can be used to fine-tune the range shift of the full
bridge or half bridge inputs respectively (see Figure 4.7). A lower “Span
(mV/V)” setting (see section 4.4.3) can also be useful for fitting the ADC
range.
The “Resolution in integration phase” drop-down menu allows adjusting the
ADC resolution for the first step of the conversion integration phase, which
influences the integration time. Select a conversion time that is as long as
possible to secure a high degree of noise suppression.
If enabled, the clock divider makes the ADC operate with half of the clock
frequency. This increases accuracy and linearity.

4.5.1.     Normal Operation Mode (NOM)
In the “Commands” section, use the CYC_EEP or CYC_RAM button to exit Command Mode (CM) and start NOM
using either the EEPROM or RAM registers settings, respectively. In NOM, the ZSSC3154 continually performs
the measurement cycle and displays the results in the adjacent “ReadOut Data” section. The top virtual status
LED, which is green when the IC is running in NOM, is updated accordingly.
4.5.2.     Command Mode (CM)
In the “Commands” section, use the CmdM button to start the Command Mode of the ZSSC3154 by sending the
Start_CM command (0x7274) to the ZSSC3154.
4.5.3.     Power IC OFF
The Off button in the “Commands” section can be used to power off the ZSSC3154. If the Off button is clicked, all
communication interfaces are disabled, so no further communication is possible until the CmdM button is pressed
(entering the Command Mode) or an interface is selected. In both cases, the ZSSC3154 will be powered on and
communication established. The virtual LEDs indicate whether the ZSSC3154 is in Command Mode (CM) or
running in Normal Operation Mode (NOM).
4.5.4.     Data Read-Out
The Read and RdLoop buttons in the “ReadOut Data” section (see Figure 4.1) start a read-out of sensor data.
When a loop measurement is started, the button text will change to STOP (see Figure 4.9). Clicking again on the
button stops the loop. The “Loop Delay” field sets the rate in milliseconds of the readouts in the loop mode.
4.5.5.     Enable Error Check
The enaErrChk checkbox in the “Read Out Data” section enables the error checks selected in the “Application &
Settings” section (section 4.4.6). An error message is processed if any of the errors selected occur.
4.5.6.     Average Count and Statistics
The Avg Cnt checkbox in the “ReadOut Data” section starts the averaging and statistics calculations. It is only
enabled if the measurement is in a loop mode. The resulting data is displayed in the adjacent fields after the
specified cycles in the field are passed.

4.10. Send Command
       The “Send Command” dialog is accessed by clicking               Figure 4.14 “Send-Command” Dialog
this icon on the top banner or clicking on “Calibration” in the
top menu and then on “Send Command” in the resulting
drop-down menu (see Figure 4.14). It is used for transferring
commands from the PC to the microcontroller on the SSC
CB and reading the result of the commands. A full summary
and detailed command description of the applicable
controller commands are given in the ZSSC3154 Functional
Description.
For the communication between the SSC CB and the
ZSSC3154 DUT, the ZSSC3154’s slave address and the
communication frequency can be selected from the drop-
down menus in the “Send Command” dialog.
The “Send Command” dialog includes the following buttons:
               Sends the command entered in the adjacent field to the SSC CB. Alternatively, a *.3154_cmd
               command file can be loaded. For more information refer to SSC Command Syntax document.
               Loads a ZSSC3154 command file (*.3154_cmd).
               Reads the output data buffer of the ZSSC3154. A loop delay can also be added between the
               readings.
               Performs the same function as the “Send” command except that the command field and the data
               field are separated. The ZSSC3154 software generates the actual instruction to be sent to the
               SSC CB.
               Writes text entered in the adjacent field to the log file. The checkboxes can be used to write various
               data into the log file, such as status, commands, messages, etc.
Note: For additional functionality, the IDT SSC Terminal Software can be used as an alternative to the ZSSC3154
Evaluation Software. The SSC Terminal Software can be downloaded from IDT’s web site at
www.IDT.com/ZSSC3154KIT. This is the lowest level of communication for transferring commands from the PC to
the microcontroller on the SSC CB. A full summary and detailed command description of the applicable controller
commands are given in IDT’s SSC Command Syntax Spreadsheet, (see section 8).
Clicking on the downloaded executable file SSC TermVxyy.exe installs the terminal software and creates a IDT
SSC Terminal icon on the PC desktop. Click on this icon to activate the terminal program. For the communication
                                         2
mode, use the setting explained for I C™.

5.2.   Software Startup
    a) Start the ZSSC3154 Software by clicking on the desktop icon or activate it from the Windows Start Menu
        folder: #Start_Menu#\ZMDI\ZSSC3154\ZSSC3154.
    b) Select the “I2C – CB (USBPort-Kit)” or “OWI – CB (USBPort-Kit)” interface from the drop down menu in
        the “Interface Selection” section of the main window as described in section 4.4.1.
    c) Select the following settings as shown in Figure 5.2:
        • In the “Sensor – Full Bridge” and “Half Bridge” sections, set the “Span [mV/V]” (sensor sensitivity) drop-
            down menu to 50mV/V, which is the typical span when using the SRB. With the 5V supply, this equals
            a total span of 250mV (5V * 50mV/V = 250mV).
        • In the “ADC Adjust” section, set the resolution integration phase to 10bits. ADC resolution is set to
            14bits.

                                                             ZSSC3154 Evaluation Kit and Mass Calibration System Description
        • In the “ADC Adjust” section, set the “FullBridgeRS” and “HalfBridgeRS” (range shift) menus to           ¾,
             which fits the input signal range to the ADC output value (“analog zero”). For example for a range shift
             of ¾ and 14 bits resolution, the read-out values would be between -4096 and +12287.
        • Operational mode: for this example, set the “Out2” section mode to “Single HB” (single half bridge; see
             section 4.6).
Note: Write the configuration into the RAM by pressing on the WriteRAM button in the “IC Configuration” section
(see section 4.4.2).
   Figure 5.2 Select Span and Range Shift
5.3.    Calibration Data Acquisition
     a) Click on the          icon or select “Calibration” on the top menu and then “Calibration” from the drop-down
         menu. The “Sensor – Calibration” dialog window appears as shown in Figure 4.11 and Figure 5.3. Select
         the calibration mode from the “Calibration” drop-down menu.
         For this example, the recommended mode is
             LINEAR (two points only) for the sensor
             NO calibration for the temperature (temperature calibration requires a chamber with a controlled
              environment)
     b) In the “OutTarget” section, enter the target sensor calibration points corresponding in percent to the VDD
         supply (“[%] VDDA”). It is recommended that the output targets for the sensor points be between 10%
         and 90%. For this example, use 90% as the maximum and 10% as the minimum for both full bridge and
         half bridge entry fields (top section).
     c) Next start data collection. Normally this would be done with a real sensor attached on a remote board in a
         controlled chamber. Instead, this calibration-example run uses the SRB as the input as follows:
             Minimum [10%] sensor signal: turn the SRB counter-clockwise (CCW) to the end and click both the
              P1M button and HB1M buttons.
             Maximum [90%] sensor signal: turn the SRB clockwise (CW) to the end and click both the P2M
              button and HB2M buttons.
         Acquired data will be displayed in the text boxes next to the buttons.
         Note: only active buttons corresponding to the calibration mode are active as indicated by green shading.

5.4.    Calculation of the Coefficients and Limits
    a) Click the calcCoeff button at the right of the “Sensor – Calibration” dialog window to calculate the
         calibration coefficients. The result of the calculation (if successful) is displayed on the screen as shown in
         Figure 5.3. The ZSSC3154’s calibration microcontroller (CMC) removes the offset and temperature
         dependency so that the measured output result is within the target values (user’s %VDDA entries or in
         this case, between 10% and 90%).
        Note: The number of calibration points is equal to the number of coefficients to be calculated.
    b) Click on the Limits CMV Osc button to calculate the sensor aging (CMV) and output limits if the CMV
         check is enabled.
    c) Click on writeEEP to make these calculations effective and written in the EEPROM. Option: starting a
         measuring cycle can be triggered by clicking the cycle button.

Close the calibration window and trigger a measurement in the main window (see section 4.5.1 and Figure 4.9) by
clicking on either the Read or Read Loop button in the “ReadOut Data” section (see Figure 4.9). The ZSSC3154
is already running in Normal Operation Mode (NOM) if the cycle button was clicked in the calibration window in
the previous step.
Measurement results can also be displayed in % by clicking on “Tools” in the top menu and then “Measure Out-
put” and then selecting the output format in the checkbox in the resulting dialog window.

6      Mass Calibration System Dry Run
       The following directions perform an example of a simple calibration using the Mass Calibration System
(MCS) shown in Figure 6.1. Refer to the SSC Mass Calibration Board Data Sheet for full details of operation. The
calibrated output will be displayed as a calibration result in the ZSSC3154 Evaluation Software.
To connect the DUTs to the Mass Calibration Board (MCB), there are several options, which can be combined as
needed. The ZSSC3154 Mass Calibration Reference Board (MCR) provided with the MCS can be connected
directly into the DUT terminals on the MCB. User-provided sensor modules and/or the ZSSC3154 SSC Evaluation
Board (SSC EB) can also be connected to the DUT terminals using the ribbon cable provided with the MCS. For
the SSC EB, connect the ribbon cable to the K6 connector on the SSC EB (see section 3.1).
For the dry run example described in the next sections, MCRs and/or the SSC EB with the SRB are used instead
of actual sensor modules.

6.1.     The Mass Calibration Reference Board Setup
The SSC Mass Calibration System includes four ZSSC3154 MCRs. Each MCR has a sample ZSSC3154 QFN32
for use as the DUT. See Figure 6.2 for the schematic and layout of the MCR. The MCR simulates a typical appli-
cation circuit, which allows checking the I²C™ and/or one wire communication (OWI) of the ZSSC3154 and
simulating an easy 2-point calibration using the P1 jumper on the MCR shorted for the first calibration point and
then open for the second point.
If pin 5 of the P2 connector to the SSC Mass Calibration Board of the MCR is soldered, then the MCR is
preconfigured for I²C communication. OWI communication will fail if this pin is connected to the MCB.
For OWI communication, unsolder this pin and configure the ZSSC3154 for OWI operation mode as described in
section 6.3.

         measuring cycle can be triggered by clicking the cycle button.
Close the calibration window and trigger a measurement in the main window (see Figure 6.3) by clicking on either
the Read or Read Loop button in the “ReadOut Data” section (see Figure 4.9). The ZSSC3154 is already running
in Normal Operation Mode (NOM) because the cycle button was clicked in the calibration window.
Measurement results can also be displayed in % by clicking on “Tools” in the top menu and then “Measure Out-
put” and then selecting the output format in the checkbox in the resulting dialog window.

6.6.    Managing Multiple DUTs with the Mass Calibration System
Managing multiple DUTs connected to the MCS is handled in the “DUT(s)” section of the calibration dialog
window (see Figure 6.5). This section is used to select the active DUT (the “active DUT” field) and activate
options such as loading the current configuration of the DUT into the software or writing a new configuration to the
DUT from either a default configuration or the current configuration in the software. If the “Loop” checkbox is
enabled, calibration of a selected set of DUTs is processed in a loop.
Placing the user’s cursor over the entry fields and checkboxes in this section displays information about their
functionality.
