 2.     Functional Description
   The ISL32705E is an isolated, 4Mbps, full-duplex RS-485 transceiver. The device incorporates a patented refresh circuit
   to maintain the correct output state with respect to data input. At power-up, the bus outputs follow the truth tables shown
   in Section 2.1.
   The DE input should be held low during power-up to prevent false drive data pulses on the bus. This is accomplished
   by connecting DE through a 10kΩ pull-down resistor to GND1.
   This transceiver uses a differential input receiver for maximum noise immunity and common-mode rejection. Input
   sensitivity is ±200mV, as required by the RS-485 specification.
   The receiver input resistance meets the RS-485 Unit Load (UL) requirement of 12kΩ minimum. The receiver includes
   a “fail-safe if open” function that ensures a high-level receiver output if the receiver inputs are unconnected (floating).
   The receiver output is tri-statable through the active low RE input.
   The driver is a differential output device that delivers at least 1.5V across a 54Ω purely differential load. The driver
   features low propagation delay skew to maximize bit width and to minimize EMI.
   The driver in the ISL32705E is tri-statable through the active high DE input. The outputs of the ISL32705E driver are
   not slew rate limited, so faster output transition times allow data rates of at least 4Mbps.
   Important Notice:
   For convenience, an isolated DC/DC converter is used to provide the power supply across the isolation barrier. Its
   isolation ratings, however, are lower than those of the transceiver. Therefore, it must be ensured that the ground
   potential difference between the left side (GND1, GND2) and the right side (GND3, GND4) of the board remains
   below 50VAC (see Figure 2).

   Both supplies, VDD1 and VDD2, must be bypassed with 100nF ceramic capacitors. These should be placed as close as
   possible to the supply pins for proper operation.

                                                                                                          Notice
 1.   Descriptions of circuits, software and other related information in this document are provided only to illustrate the operation of semiconductor products and application examples. You are fully responsible for
      the incorporation or any other use of the circuits, software, and information in the design of your product or system. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any losses and damages incurred by
      you or third parties arising from the use of these circuits, software, or information.
 2.   Renesas Electronics hereby expressly disclaims any warranties against and liability for infringement or any other claims involving patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights of third parties, by or
      arising from the use of Renesas Electronics products or technical information described in this document, including but not limited to, the product data, drawings, charts, programs, algorithms, and application
      examples.
 3.   No license, express, implied or otherwise, is granted hereby under any patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of Renesas Electronics or others.
 4.   You shall not alter, modify, copy, or reverse engineer any Renesas Electronics product, whether in whole or in part. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any losses or damages incurred by
      you or third parties arising from such alteration, modification, copying or reverse engineering.
 5.   Renesas Electronics products are classified according to the following two quality grades: “Standard” and “High Quality”. The intended applications for each Renesas Electronics product depends on the
      product’s quality grade, as indicated below.
      "Standard":       Computers; office equipment; communications equipment; test and measurement equipment; audio and visual equipment; home electronic appliances; machine tools; personal electronic
                         equipment; industrial robots; etc.
      "High Quality": Transportation equipment (automobiles, trains, ships, etc.); traffic control (traffic lights); large-scale communication equipment; key financial terminal systems; safety control equipment; etc.
      Unless expressly designated as a high reliability product or a product for harsh environments in a Renesas Electronics data sheet or other Renesas Electronics document, Renesas Electronics products are
      not intended or authorized for use in products or systems that may pose a direct threat to human life or bodily injury (artificial life support devices or systems; surgical implantations; etc.), or may cause
      serious property damage (space system; undersea repeaters; nuclear power control systems; aircraft control systems; key plant systems; military equipment; etc.). Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all
      liability for any damages or losses incurred by you or any third parties arising from the use of any Renesas Electronics product that is inconsistent with any Renesas Electronics data sheet, user’s manual or
      other Renesas Electronics document.
 6.   When using Renesas Electronics products, refer to the latest product information (data sheets, user’s manuals, application notes, “General Notes for Handling and Using Semiconductor Devices” in the
      reliability handbook, etc.), and ensure that usage conditions are within the ranges specified by Renesas Electronics with respect to maximum ratings, operating power supply voltage range, heat dissipation
      characteristics, installation, etc. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for any malfunctions, failure or accident arising out of the use of Renesas Electronics products outside of such specified
      ranges.
 7.   Although Renesas Electronics endeavors to improve the quality and reliability of Renesas Electronics products, semiconductor products have specific characteristics, such as the occurrence of failure at a
      certain rate and malfunctions under certain use conditions. Unless designated as a high reliability product or a product for harsh environments in a Renesas Electronics data sheet or other Renesas
      Electronics document, Renesas Electronics products are not subject to radiation resistance design. You are responsible for implementing safety measures to guard against the possibility of bodily injury, injury
      or damage caused by fire, and/or danger to the public in the event of a failure or malfunction of Renesas Electronics products, such as safety design for hardware and software, including but not limited to
      redundancy, fire control and malfunction prevention, appropriate treatment for aging degradation or any other appropriate measures. Because the evaluation of microcomputer software alone is very difficult
      and impractical, you are responsible for evaluating the safety of the final products or systems manufactured by you.
 8.   Please contact a Renesas Electronics sales office for details as to environmental matters such as the environmental compatibility of each Renesas Electronics product. You are responsible for carefully and
      sufficiently investigating applicable laws and regulations that regulate the inclusion or use of controlled substances, including without limitation, the EU RoHS Directive, and using Renesas Electronics
      products in compliance with all these applicable laws and regulations. Renesas Electronics disclaims any and all liability for damages or losses occurring as a result of your noncompliance with applicable
      laws and regulations.
 9.   Renesas Electronics products and technologies shall not be used for or incorporated into any products or systems whose manufacture, use, or sale is prohibited under any applicable domestic or foreign laws
      or regulations. You shall comply with any applicable export control laws and regulations promulgated and administered by the governments of any countries asserting jurisdiction over the parties or
      transactions.
 10. It is the responsibility of the buyer or distributor of Renesas Electronics products, or any other party who distributes, disposes of, or otherwise sells or transfers the product to a third party, to notify such third
      party in advance of the contents and conditions set forth in this document.
 11. This document shall not be reprinted, reproduced or duplicated in any form, in whole or in part, without prior written consent of Renesas Electronics.
 12. Please contact a Renesas Electronics sales office if you have any questions regarding the information contained in this document or Renesas Electronics products.
