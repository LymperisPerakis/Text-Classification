The SSC Evaluation Kit contains the hardware needed for communication and calibration of ZSC31050 sensor
signal conditioning ICs. A PC can communicate with the ZSC31050 via the Communication Board (SSC CB)
through a USB connection. The Sensor Replacement Board (SRB) provides a replacement for an actual sensor
and can be used for the first step of calibration or a dry-run calibration as described in section 4. On the SRB, the
sensor replacement signal is controlled by a potentiometer (see Figure 1.1).
The software will run under Windows® 98/ME/XP/NT/Vista/Windows® 7/ Windows® 8 operating systems.
Note: The ZSC31050 Software refers to the sensor signal as the “pressure” measurement; however, the
ZSC31050 can function with any bridge sensor type (e.g., piezo-resistive, ceramic-thickfilm, or steel membrane-
based).

The main purpose of the SSC Evaluation Kit is communication between the PC and the ZSC31050. The PC
sends commands and data via its USB port (configured as a virtual COM port) to the SSC CB. The
                                                                                                                     2     †
microcontroller on the SSC CB interprets these commands and relays them to the ZSC31050 in the SPI, I C™ ,
or OWI (One-Wire Interface) communication mode. The microcontroller will also forward any data bytes from the
ZSC31050 back to the PC via the USB connection. These bytes can be sensor and temperature readings to be
displayed by the PC software, raw ADC data used during calibration, or EEPROM data. The SSC CB
microcontroller controls the power signals required for entering the Command Mode.
2.2.     Schematic
Figure 2.2 shows the schematic of the ZSC31050 SSC Evaluation Board (SSC EB). The SSC EB is powered by
the KS5V or KS12V supply controlled by the microcontroller on the SSC CB and the position of jumpers K12 and
K17. The red LED displays the status of the supply. Its forward current is not included in the measured supply
current.
Jumper K17 can be used to manually remove the KS12V power supply for the ZSC31050 or for a simple
measurement of the supply current.

The SSC EB board type is hard-coded by three resistors on K1 connector pins D7 (low), D6 (low), and D5 (high).
The SSC EB is connected to the SSC CB via a 50-pin female connector. On-board there are several pin-header
strips for simple access to all IC signals (K3, K4, K5, K6, K7, K8, K9, K10, and K16).
The SRB can be connected to the SSC EB via its 50-pin male connector. Alternatively, an external bridge sensor
element, external supply, and an external temperature sensor can be connected using the on-board screw
terminal KL1/KL2.
2.3.     Connections to the ZSC31050
The SSC EB has an SSOP-16 socket for inserting the SSOP-16 ZSC31050. Note the pin orientation shown in
Figure 2.1.
The connectors K3 through K10 on the SSC EB can be used to connect directly to the ZSC31050 for in-circuit
programming. NOTE: Only one ZSC31050 connection option can be used at a time (i.e., either through the SSC
CB or via individual connections).
2.4.     Reset Switch
Use the push button on the SSC CB to reset communications if needed. See Figure 4.1 for the location of the
reset button.

The one-wire digital interface (also called OWI) combines a simple and easy protocol adaptation with a cost-
                                                                                   2
saving pin sharing (AOUT). The communication principle is derived from the I C™ protocol. An advantage of OWI
output signal capability is that it enables “end of line” calibration. It is designed mainly for calibration, but it may
also be used to digitally read the calibrated sensor signal continuously.
                                            2
To use SPI communication instead of I C™ or OWI, use the following procedure to enable SPI communication:
                             2
     1. Using either the I C™ or OWI interface, set bit [0] of register 17HEX to 1 to enable SPI (see section 3.8 for
         instructions for changing bits in registers).
     2. Select the clock edge (bit [2], SPICKE) and clock polarity (bit [1], SPICKP) in register 17HEX as needed to
         configure the SPI. (See the ZSC31050 Functional Description for details on SPI clock phase and polarity.)
     3. Write the registers to the EEPROM as described in section 3.8.
     4. Adjust the Evaluation Software SPI configuration from the main Window or the Send Command Window
         (see section 3.10) by sending the following bits for the “SPIconfig” field as shown in Figure 3.3:
              o   Bit [0] & Bit [1] for Chip Select (CS) to 11 (CS on, idle = high)
              o   Bit [2] to SPICKE
              o   Bit [3] to SPICKP
     5. Select the “Disconnected” interface in the “Interface & Settings” section and slide switch S2 to SPI on the
         SSC Evaluation Board.
     6. Select the “SPI – Comm. Board” interface from the drop down menu.
                                                              2
Note: After enabling the SPI communication, no OWI or I C™ communication is possible.

For the example in Figure 3.3, register 17HEX contains ...DHEX (...1101BIN), which enables SPI communication with
SPICKE=1 and SPICKP=0; therefore SPIConfig should be configured as 0111BIN for proper communication.

                                                                                ZSC31050 SSC Evaluation Kit Description
3.4.3.     Analog Front End (AFE) Adjustment
The ZSC31050 has different options to adapt the analog front end            Figure 3.5 Bridge Adaptation and Mode
(AFE) to the specific sensing element. The “Bridge Sensor
Adaptation” and “Bridge Mode” sections (see Figure 3.5) configure
the programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and the extended zero
compensation (XZC).
Refer to the ZSC31050 Data Sheet for details about PGA and XZC
settings.
The next stage of the AFE is the ADC. The signal path within the
AFE is fully differential, so it is necessary to provide an input signal
within the common mode range. Otherwise, the ADC will provide a
                                                  ADC_Resolution
signal that is equal to 0000HEX (underflow) or 2                 (overflow)
in the “Sensor – Calibration” menu during calibration.
Refer to the ZSC31050 Data Sheet for details about ADC settings.
If the analog input voltage does not fit the ADC range and an
underflow or overflow occurs, the “ADC Range Shift P” option can
be used for fine-tuning. A lower “Span” setting in the “Sensor
Adaptation” section can also be useful for fitting the ADC range.
Polarity of the sensor signal can be selected by the radio button and can be changed if using a user sensor
module and the PCB layout requires swapped input pins. The drop-down menu can select the sensor operation
mode, which can be voltage or current.
3.4.4.     Temperature Sensor Selection
The last stage in the AFE is the multiplexer that selects the input signal for     Figure 3.6 Temperature Sensor
measuring temperature. The digital raw value for the sensor signal is
processed with a correction formula to remove the temperature
dependency based on the result of this measurement.
The temperature signal source can be the bridge voltage drop, thermistor,
internal diode, and/or external diode (pn-junction).
The ZSC31050 can use different temperature channels:
     •   T1 (internal or external temperature sensor): used for calibration
         calculation, temperature correction, and an optional temperature
         output signal during Normal Operating Mode (NOM).
     •   T2 (optional): the external voltage mode can also provide a
         radiometric signal measurement of a half bridge or a voltage
         source referenced to an internal voltage divider or source.
For example, T2 can be used for measurement of the ambient temperature
during NOM.
Note: The temperature measure source T1 sensor type for the temperature
correction is required (only T1 can be used for correction).

3.4.5.     Application Settings
The internal microcontroller of the ZSC31050 can detect various errors and perform different types of
measurement cycles. It controls multiple protection options that can be configured by the ZSC31050 Evaluation
Software. Figure 3.7 illustrates the application options for the ZSC31050, which can be enabled/disabled via
checkboxes and drop-down menus. For more details about the related options, refer to the ZSC31050 Functional
Description.

                                                                            Figure 3.7 Application Settings
    checked, the rough setting of VDDA in regulated VDDA mode
    (3-6V) can be set to one of four discrete steps from the Course
    Voltage Regulator drop-down menu. An accurate adjustment can
    be chosen by adjusting the Fine value.
•   Press. Meas.Cyle increases the average sampling rate of the
    different inputs (the number of main sensor readings between two
    special readings).
•   Enable Start-Up ROM Test enables the ROM check after power-
    on. If enabled, the start-up time will be increased by approximately
    10ms. If a ROM error occurs, the ZSC31050 will change to the
    Diagnostic Mode (DM).
•   Enable CMV Measurement enables the Common Mode Voltage
    (aging) test.
•   Disable Sensor Conn. Check disables the Sensor Connection
    Check.
The next segment selects the clock source. If the external clock is
selected, the chip will halt if no clock is connected. The external clock
is useful for a synchronized mode or a precise PWM frequency.
•    Bandgap TC Adjust is used to adjust the temperature behavior of the regulated analog supply voltage.
•    Bias Current is adjustable for moving the total current consumption of the ZSC31050 into a required range.
     Current consumption can be decreased or increased by this value, but this may cause worse or better
     analog performance.
•    Coarse Oscillator and Fine adjust the setting for the system clock and influence the conversion time and
     PWM frequency.
•    VFC ClkDiv enables an additional clock divider for the clock frequency of ADC. This will increase the
     accuracy of conversion result, but doubles the conversion time.

          signal via conditioning calculations and output limits are stored
          in six registers (registers AHEX to FHEX).
      •   There are seven words for the configuration of the ZSC31050,
          which can be entered via fields in the main window (registers
          16HEX to 1CHEX, with yellow background).
      •   Eight registers for storing limits and different types of settings
          (registers 8HEX, 9HEX, and 10HEX to 15HEX).
      •   One register is used for storing the EEPROM signature, which is used in NOM to check the validity of the
          EEPROM contents after power-on, (register 1DHEX).
      •   Two additional 16-bit registers are available for optional user data (registers 1EHEX and 1FHEX).
The “Write” columns show the PC data in hex format, which can be modified manually or by reading in a *.31050
file. The “Read” columns show the data that was read last in hex format.

                                                                             ZSC31050 SSC Evaluation Kit Description
Figure 4.2    Select Interface
                                                                              Typical interface selection
    c) Select the following settings as shown in Figure 4.3:
        • In the “Bridge Sensor Adaptation” section, set the “Span [mV/V]” (sensor sensitivity) menu to 32mV/V,
            which is the typical span when using the SRB. With the 5V supply, this equals a total span of 160mV.
        • In the “Bridge Sensor Adaptation” section, set the “ADC Bit-Resolution” menu to 14 bits (equivalent to
            16384 steps of the ADC).
        • In the “Bridge Sensor Adaptation” section, set the “ADC Range Shift” menu to      ¾, which fits the input
            signal range to the ADC output value (“analog zero”). For example for a range shift of ¾ and 14 bits
            resolution, the read-out values would be between -4096 and +12287.
        Note: Write the configuration into the RAM by pressing on the Write button in the “IC-Configuration”
        section.

                                                                               ZSC31050 SSC Evaluation Kit Description
4.3.    Calibration Data Acquisition
    a) Click on the         icon or select “Calibration” on the top menu and then “Calibration” from the drop-down
        menu. The “Sensor – Calibration” window appears as shown in Figure 4.4. Select the calibration mode
        from the drop down menu.
        For this example, the recommended mode is
            LINEAR (two points only) for the sensor
            NO calibration for the temperature (temperature calibration requires a chamber with a controlled
             environment)
    b) Type the desired sensor target corresponding in percent to the VDDA supply. It is recommended that the
        output targets for the sensor points be in between 10% and 90%.
    c) Next start data collection. Normally this would be done with a real sensor attached on a remote board in a
        controlled chamber. Instead, this calibration example run uses the SRB as the input as follows:
            Minimum [10%] Sensor Signal: turn the potentiometer on the SRB counter-clockwise (CCW) to the
             end and click the P1M button.
            Maximum [90%] Sensor Signal: turn the potentiometer on the SRB clockwise (CW) to the end and
             click the P2M button.
        Acquired data will be displayed in the text boxes next to the buttons.
        Note: only active buttons corresponding to the calibration mode are green.

                                                                                        ZSC31050 SSC Evaluation Kit Description
4.4.     Calculation of the Coefficients and Limits
     a) The calcCoeff button at the right of the “Sensor – Calibration” screen calculates the calibration
          coefficients. The result of the calculation (if successful) is displayed on the screen (see Figure 4.4). The
          calibration microcontroller (CMC) removes the offset and temperature dependency so that the measuring
          output result is within the target values (%VDDA or in this case between 10% and 90%).
         Note: The number of calibration points is equal to the number of coefficients to be calculated.
     b) The Lim&CMV&A button calculates sensor aging (CMV) and oscillator limits.
     c) Click on writeEEP to make these calculations effective and written in the EEPROM. Option: starting a
          measuring cycle can be triggered by pressing the cycleRAM button.
Close the calibration window and trigger a measurement in the main window (see Figure 3.1) by clicking on either
the Read or ReadLoop button in the Main Window. The ZSC31050 is already running in Normal Operation Mode
(NOM) if the cycleRAM button was pressed in the calibration window. Measurement results can also be displayed
in % by opening the “Tools -> Measure Output” window and selecting the output format in the checkbox.
