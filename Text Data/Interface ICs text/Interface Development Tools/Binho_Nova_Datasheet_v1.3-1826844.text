                                              ***NOTICE***
The best source of the latest and most up-to-date information regarding the features of this product and
the very specifics of how to operate the device can be found on our customer support portal. This
support portal features a full set of comprehensive documentation and can be found at
https://support.binho.io​. More details on all of the items below can be found in the support portal.
8.1       Device Firmware Update
The Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter features field-upgradeable firmware over USB. This
allows for new features to be developed and released to all devices, such as support for new protocols.
8.2       Cross-Platform Support
The Binho Nova works well on all modern PC operating systems, such as Windows, Mac OS, and Ubuntu
(Linux). One way in which this is achieved is by implementing the USB connection as a CDC (Virtual COM
Port) device, and as a mass-storage device while performing a firmware update. This means there is no
need to install custom device drivers, allowing the device to be used on any operating system which
provides a system driver for these device classes. Additionally, numerous examples and tools are
provided as open-source python scripts which can be run on any platform.
8.3       ASCII Command Set
The Binho Nova is controlled via a human-readable ASCII command set. The commands and responses
were intelligently designed for easy use via manual entry in a serial console program and at the same
time are robust enough for effective automation.
8.4       Multi-Adapter/Gang-able Operation
Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapters can be operated in gang-able fashion with many units
connected to the same host PC. This allows for making complicated automated test fixtures or custom
gang programming stations a breeze. Many examples exist demonstrating how easy it is to work with
multiple devices.

The Binho Nova features a programmable RGB status LED. This can be used to distinguish a certain
adapter when used in a multi-adapter setup/test fixture, to indicate that a particular part of the test
script is being performed, or anything else you can imagine.

8.6     Digital IO
Each of the five IO pins on the Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter can be used as a digital
input or digital output pin. Some pins also feature the ability to operate as an interrupt pin, which can be
configured to fire on rising edge, falling edge, or both. Furthermore, some pins also feature the ability to
provide a PWM output.
8.7     Analog IO
Each of the five IO pins on the Binho Nova can be used as an analog input pin. These pins go to a 12-bit
ADC (VREF=3.3V). Please note that the ADC is not calibrated, and this functionality is not meant to serve
as an oscilloscope or other precise piece of analog test equipment. It is not characterized for
performance on AC signals and should be considered suitable for measurement of ~DC signals.
Additionally, there is one pin that is capable of generating an analog output signal from the internal
10-bit DAC.

9 Supported Protocols
                                               ***NOTICE***
The best source of the latest and most up-to-date information regarding the supported protocols and
the very specifics of how to use them can be found on our customer support portal. This support portal
features a full set of comprehensive documentation and can be found at ​https://support.binho.io​. More
details on all of the items below can be found in the support portal.
9.1      I2C Protocol
The Binho Nova supports communication as an I2C Master device. Support for I2C Slave device is coming
soon. The I2C CLK frequency is programmable from 100kHz to 3.4MHz in 1kHz steps. The device also
features internal 2.2kOhm pull-up resistors on the SCL and SDA signals which can be programmatically
engaged/disengaged as desired. While working as an I2C Master, it’s possible to use the other 3
available pins as desired. Support for I2C Slave operation is coming soon and will be made available to all
existing devices via firmware update.
9.2      SPI Protocol
The Binho Nova supports communication as a SPI Master device. Support for SPI Slave device is coming
soon. The SPI SCL frequency is programmable from 1MHz to 12MHz in 1kHz steps. While working as an
SPI Master, it’s possible to use the available pins for either 1) CS pin and INT pin, 2) CS0 pin and CS1 pin
to support communication with 2 SPI Slave Devices, or 3) any combination of CS, INT, or other available
pin function. Support for SPI Slave operation is coming soon and will be made available to all existing
devices via firmware update.
9.3      UART Protocol
The Binho Nova supports communication as a UART pass-through, supporting baud rates up to
1000000bps. This allows communication over the Virtual COM port as if it were a typical USB to UART
adapter. Note that the use of hardware flow control (CTS/RTS signals) is not supported. While working in
UART mode, it’s possible to use the other 3 available pins as desired.
9.4      1-WIRE Protocol
The Binho Nova supports communication as a Dallas 1-WIRE Master device. This protocol can be
configured to work on any of the five IO pins. It is especially convenient to use with IO0 or IO2 as it’s
possible to engage a suitable internal pull up resistor on these channels, eliminating the need for an
external resistor. Support for 1-WIRE Slave device is coming soon and will be made available to all
existing devices via firmware update.

9.5     Single-Wire Interface Protocol
The Binho Nova Multi-Protocol USB Host Adapter supports communication as an Atmel SWI (Single-Wire
Interface) Master device. This protocol can be configured to work on any of the five IO pins. It is
especially convenient to use with IO0 or IO2 as it’s possible to engage a suitable internal pull up resistor
on these channels, eliminating the need for an external resistor.
