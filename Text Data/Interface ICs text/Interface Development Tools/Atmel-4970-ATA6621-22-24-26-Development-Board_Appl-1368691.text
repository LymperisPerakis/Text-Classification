Introduction
The development board for the Atmel® ATA6621/22/24/26 (ATA6621-EK, ATA6622-EK,
ATA6624-EK, ATA6626-EK) is designed to give designers a quick start with the ICs and for
prototyping and testing of new LIN designs.
The Atmel ATA6621, Atmel ATA6622, Atmel ATA6624 and Atmel ATA6626 are system
basis chips (SBCs) with fully integrated LIN transceiver, window watchdog with adjustable
trigger times and low-drop voltage regulator providing 5V/85mA (3.3V/85mA for the Atmel
ATA6622). The output current of the regulator can be boosted by using an external NPN
transistor.
The Atmel ATA6622 and the Atmel ATA6624 are totally pin- and function-compatible, the
only difference between these circuits is the regulator’s output voltage.
The ATA6626 has the same functionality as the ATA6624 without TXD time-out timer. The
ATA6626 is able to switch the LIN pin without any time limitation to dominant level via the
TXD input and is therefore particularly suited for low data rates.
The Atmel ATA6621 differs in a few more ways — an initial overview of these differences
starts with the different pins listed in Table 1.

      Another difference is unequal watchdog timing (see Section 1.3 on page 4).
      The combination of the features included in the Atmel® ATA6621/22/24/26 makes it possible to develop simple, but powerful
      and cheap, slave nodes in LIN-bus systems.
      The ICs are designed to handle the low-speed data communication in vehicles, for example, in convenience electronics.
      Improved slope control at the LIN driver ensures secure data communication up to 20Kbaud.
      Sleep Mode and Silent Mode guarantee a very low current consumption.

Quick Start
      The development board for the Atmel ATA6621/22/24/26 is shipped with all necessary components and a default jumper
      setting to start with the development of a LIN slave node immediately.
      After connecting an external 12V DC power supply between the terminals VB and GND, the circuit is in the Pre-normal mode
      (Fail-safe mode) and a 5V (3.3V) DC voltage provided by the internal voltage regulator can be measured between VCC and
      GND. (The Pre-normal mode is called Fail-safe mode in the datasheets of the devices Atmel ATA6622/24/26). Furthermore,
      the following voltages or states can be measured at the pins WD_OSC, TEMP, INH, RXD and LIN:

      As the window watchdog of the Atmel® ATA6621/22/24/26 is already active in the Pre-normal mode (Fail-safe mode), a
      periodic reset signal will be generated at the pin NRES as long as no trigger signal can be received at the watchdog trigger
      input. Normally the connected microcontroller will be monitored by the watchdog, so it has to generate the required trigger
      signal as described in Section 1.3 on page 4 and in more detail in the datasheet of the corresponding device. For the quick
      start it is sufficient to generate a square-wave signal with VPP = VCC and f = 75Hz at pin NTRIG or PTRIG for the Atmel
      ATA6621 or with f = 50Hz at pin NTRIG for the Atmel ATA6622/24/26 (this is recommended only for testing purposes). In
      order to check that the watchdog is triggered in the expected way, the reset pin NRES can be monitored until a continuous
      high level is available.
      Please note that the communication is still inactive in Pre-normal mode (Fail-safe mode).
      In order to communicate via the LIN bus interface you have to switch to normal mode by applying the VCC voltage (5V or
      3.3V, as appropriate) at pin EN.

                                                                                                         4970C–AUTO–06/15


1.  Hardware Description
    In the following sections only the normal operating conditions will be described. For further information concerning one of the
    mentioned features, refer to the corresponding datasheet.
1.1 Power Supply (VB and GND)
    In order to get the development board running, an external 5.7V to 18V DC power supply is required between the terminals
    VB and GND. The input circuit is protected against inverse-polarity with the protection diode D1, so that there is normally a
    difference between the VB and VS level of approximately 0.7V.
1.2 Voltage Regulator (PVCC and VCC)
    The internal 5V/3.3V voltage regulator is capable of driving loads up to 85mA so the SBCs are able to supply a
    microcontroller, sensors and/or other ICs. The voltage regulator is protected against overloads by means of current limitation
    and overtemperature shutdown. To boost the maximum load current, an external NPN transistor may be used, with its base
    being connected to the VCC pin and its emitter connected to PVCC. If this is done, the regulated output voltage of 5V or 3.3V
    is available at pin PVCC. For this reason, the pin PVCC and not the pin VCC is led to the connector available off the board.
    But in normal operation, the pins PVCC and VCC have to be connected directly. This is done by setting jumper J1.
1.3 The Window Watchdog (PTRIG, NTRIG and NRES)
    The watchdog anticipates a trigger signal from the microcontroller at the NTRIG input (negative edge) within a defined time
    window. The Atmel ATA6621 has an additional PTRIG input, so it is also possible to trigger the watchdog with a positive
    edge. If no correct trigger signal is received, a reset signal will be generated at the NRES output. During Silent or Sleep
    Mode the watchdog is switched off to reduce current consumption.
    The minimum time for the first watchdog pulse is required after the undervoltage reset at the NRES pin disappears and is
    defined as lead time td.
    The timing basis of the watchdog is provided by the internal oscillator, whose time period tOSC is adjustable via the external
    resistor R3 at the pin WD_OSC. For the Atmel ATA6621, the voltage at this pin is 2.5V, for the Atmel ATA6622/24/26 it is
    1.23V (see Table 2 on page 3 through Table 4 on page 3). Due to these different voltages at the devices, the resulting timings
    are also different. There is a resistor R3 with a value of 51k mounted on the development board, which results in the
    following timing sequence for the Atmel ATA6621:

      For the Atmel® ATA6622/24/26 the resistor R3 at pin WD_OSC with the same value of 51k results in the different timing
      sequence shown in Figure 1-2:

                                                                    t1 = 20ms        t2 = 21ms
                                                                               twd
                          NTRIG
                                                                          ttrigg > 200ns
      If you want to change the watchdog times mentioned above it is only necessary to change the value of the external resistor
      R3 (refer to the corresponding datasheet).
1.4   LIN Interface (LIN, TXD and RXD)
1.4.1 Bus Pin (LIN)
      A low-side driver with internal current limitation and thermal shutdown as well as an internal pull-up resistor in compliance
      with the LIN specification 2.0 is implemented. LIN receiver thresholds are compatible with the LIN protocol specification.
      At the LIN pin there is a 220-pF capacitor to ground on the board. Additionally, when using the development board for a LIN
      master application, there is the opportunity to mount the two necessary extra components diode D2 (LL4148) in series with
      resistor R1 (1k) on the board at their designated placeholders.
1.4.2 Input Pin (TXD)
      In Normal Mode this pin is the microcontroller interface to control the state of the LIN output. TXD must be pulled to ground
      in order to have the LIN bus low. If TXD is high, the LIN output transistor is turned off and the bus is in the recessive state,
      pulled up by the internal resistor. If TXD is low, the LIN output transistor is turned on and the bus is in the dominant state.
      An internal timer prevents the bus line from being driven permanently in the dominant state. If TXD is forced to low longer
      than tDOM > 20ms, the LIN bus driver is switched to the recessive state. This time-out function is disabled in the Atmel
      ATA6626.
1.4.3 Output Pin (RXD)
      This pin reports the state of the LIN bus to the microcontroller. LIN high (recessive state) is reported by a high level at RXD,
      LIN low (dominant state) is reported by a low level at RXD. The output has an internal pull-up resistor with typ. 5k to VCC.
      The output is short-circuit protected.
                                                                                 ATA6621/22/24/26 [APPLICATION NOTE]                   5
                                                                                                             4970C–AUTO–06/15


1.5 Temp Pin (TEMP) (Atmel ATA6621 Only)
    Besides the internal temperature monitoring of the voltage regulator, an additional sensor measures the junction
    temperature and provides a linearized voltage at the TEMP pin. Together with the analog functions of the microcontroller (for
    example, the analog comparator and/or the analog-to-digital converter), this enables the application to detect overload
    conditions. Further actions in order to prevent the IC from damage can be implemented.
1.6 Mode and TM Input Pins (MODE and TM)
    The TM input is only used for Atmel® internal-testing purposes and therefore connected directly to GND. The Mode input is
    pulled to GND by the 4.7-k resistor R1 and therefore the watchdog is active in the normal operation mode. Especially
    during the early development phase it can be helpful to have the possibility to deactivate the watchdog in order to debug the
    application program without disturbing RESETS caused by the watchdog. Therefore the watchdog can be switched off by
    connecting the MODE pin to VCC externally.
1.7 Reset Output (NRES)
    After ramping up the battery voltage or after a wake-up from Sleep mode, the 5V regulator is switched on and the VCC
    voltage exceeds the undervoltage threshold. The implemented undervoltage delay keeps the NRES output at low level for
    approximately 10ms after VCC reaches its nominal value. Then it switches to high and the watchdog waits for the trigger
    sequence from the microcontroller.
    The NRES pin switches to low if the watchdog is not triggered correctly (see Section 1.3 on page 4).
    In the ATA6621 the Reset output is a push-pull state supplied by the VCC voltage.
    In the Atmel ATA6622/24/26 the Reset output is an open drain output implemented with a single MOS transistor which is
    switched on in case of a VCC undervoltage or if the watchdog is not triggered correctly. In order to pull up the NRES output
    of the Atmel ATA6622/24/26 an external resistor connected to VCC is necessary. This resistor (R9) is taken into account on
    the development board.
    If a reset occurs (NRES is Low), the circuit switches to Pre-normal mode (Fail-safe mode).
1.8 KL_15 Input (KL_15) (Atmel ATA6622/24/26 Only)
    This pin is a high voltage input used to wake up the device from Sleep or Silent mode. It is an edge sensitive pin (rising
    edge). It is usually connected to the ignition in order to generate a local wake-up in the application if the ignition is switched
    on. To protect the pin against voltage transients, a series resistor R12 and a 100-nF ceramic capacitor C8 have to be used.
    If this pin is not needed, it must be connected to GND.
1.9 Inhibit Output (INH) (Atmel ATA6622/24/26 Only)
    This pin is a high-side switch and it is normally used to switch on an external voltage regulator during Normal mode or Fail-
    safe mode. In Sleep mode or Silent mode the INH output is switched off.
    For master node applications it is possible to switch off the external master resistor (R4) by the INH pin.

2. Boosting the Voltage Regulator
   For some applications there is a need for a higher current than the internal voltage regulator can deliver (85mA). So it is
   possible to boost the maximum current by using an external NPN transistor. On the development board there is already a
   placeholder for this part, into which would fit, for example, the MJD31C in a D-PAK package. In addition to the transistor
   itself there are two more components to be placed on the development board, the resistor R7 (3.3) and the electrolytic
   capacitor C4 (2.2µF). The jumper J1 has to be removed in this case.
   Note that the output voltage is no longer short-circuit protected when boosting the output current with an external NPN
   transistor.
   The limiting parameter for the output current is the maximum power dissipation of the external NPN transistor. In the version
   at this stage the thermal resistance of the MJD31C soldered on the minimum pad size is 80K/W, meaning the maximum
   possible output current in the case of VS = 12V is approximately 230mA at room temperature. It is not recommended to
   exceed this limit, because the transistor could be damaged as a result of overtemperature. If a higher output current is
   required, additional cooling of the external transistor has to be ensured (see Figure 2-2, Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 on page
   8).
   Figure 2-1. Boosting the Voltage Regulator
                                                                        ATA6621/22/24/26 [APPLICATION NOTE]                    7

    Figure 2-2, Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 show the maximum output current (Imax) of the voltage regulator as a function of the
    supply voltage (VS) at different coolings or thermal resistances (RthJA) of the external NPN transistor T1.

4.   The Development Board in a Simple Application
     To show just how easy it is to develop a LIN-based application with the development board for the Atmel®
     ATA6621/22/24/26, here is a little example for a complete LIN slave node consisting of the Atmel ATA6621 and the
     microcontroller ATmega88, a flasher controlled via the LIN bus.
     The LIN interface of the slave is implemented with the Atmel ATA6624 and the control of the flasher as well as the protocol
     handling is done by the Atmel ATmega88 microcontroller. In the schematic of this slave node it is obvious that there are
     almost no other external components needed to fulfill the requirements of this application, other than the development board
     of the Atmel ATA6621/22/24/26 and the Atmel ATmega88.

   For testing purposes two jumpers (JP1 and JP2) have been added to the LIN part of this application in order to have the
   opportunity to easily change some parameters at the pins NRES and VCC/PVCC. Additionally, the switch S1 has been
   included to generate a wake pulse.
   For the microcontroller part of this slave node, only a few blocking capacitors are necessary. XISP1 is the programming
   interface and D1, D2, R1 and R2 report the internal status of the slave node. Because the flasher runs with 12V DC, the
   transistor T1 is needed to transfer the 5V from the microcontroller to the 12V level. Furthermore, the flasher produces some
   glitches, so that there are some capacitors needed in order to block the 12V power supply.
