1.       Introduction
The ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board (ZSSC41xx SSC EB) is the main board in the modular ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Kits. These kits are
designed for sensor module evaluation, laboratory setup, and module calibration development for the ZSSC41xx Sensor Signal Conditioner
ICs (SSC), including the ZSSC4151, ZSSC4161, ZSSC4162, ZSSC4165, ZSSC4169 and ZSSC4175 (i.e., the device under test). Unless
otherwise noted, all references to the ZSSC41xx apply to these products.
Refer to the product-specific kit user manuals for the specific contents, hardware setup details, software setup, basic operation, and order codes
for the kits. Refer to the product-specific software manuals for full instructions for using the software for communication, calibration, configuration,
and evaluation of the device under test (DUT). These manuals and the product-specific software are available for download on the IDT web
pages for the specific products (see section 5).
The ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Kits contain the SSC Communication Board (SSC-CB), the ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board, and the Sensor
Replacement Board (SSC-SRB). These boards can be connected in the following configurations:
    The kit can be set up using the Sensor Replacement Board in place of a real sensor only for demonstration purposes as illustrated in
     Figure 1 (see details in section 2.1).
 The user’s sensor can be connected on the KL1/KL2/KL3 screw terminals (see Figure 2) on the ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board instead
     of using the Sensor Replacement Board.
 The “Sensor 1” or “Sensor 2” headers can be used to connect through the Evaluation Board to a complete user’s module (including the
     user’s sensor, ZSSC41xx DUT, and external circuit); in this case, do not use the 24-QFN socket or Sensor Replacement Board.
     Note: Sensor 2 is not applicable to the ZSSC4151.
Note: The SSC Communication Board (SSC-CB) must be version 4.1 with the current firmware version (see section 5) to function properly with
the ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board.
Note: On delivery, the ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board has a “dummy” IC in the socket that must be replaced with an actual ZSSC41xx DUT.
Refer to Figure 1 for the location of pin 1 for proper IC orientation.

2.       Hardware Description
2.1        Kit Overview
A primary purpose of the ZSSC41xx Evaluation Kit is communication between the user’s computer and the ZSSC41xx DUT on the ZSSC41xx
SSC EB. The computer sends commands and data via its USB port (configured as a virtual COM port) to the SSC-CB. The microcontroller on
the SSC-CB interprets these commands and relays them to the ZSSC41xx in the I2C or OWI* (One-Wire Interface) communication mode. Refer
to the SSC Communication Board Datasheet for additional information about this board (see section 5).
The optional SSC-SRB provides a replacement for an actual resistive sensor and can be used for the first step of a calibration demonstration
or a “dry-run” calibration. On the SSC-SRB, the sensor replacement signal is controlled by a potentiometer and provides a signal ranging from
2mV to 110mV to the analog front-end of the ZSSC41xx (BR1N and BR1P pins) and a temperature sensor signal from a 1N4148 diode to the
ZSSC41xx temperature input (TS1 or TS2 pin, selectable by jumper K8, not applicable to the ZSSC4175D-01). Refer to the SSC Sensor
Replacement Board Datasheet for additional information about this board (see section 5).
The SENT (Single Edge Nibble Transmission) interface signal (not applicable to the ZSSC4151) is a one-way transmission of values from the
DUT to the SSC-CB microcontroller (intended for Normal Operation Mode only). The SENT interface allows high-resolution data transmission
with a lower system cost than other serial data solutions. If enabled (see Table 1), the “Sensor 2” header can be used as a SENT input from an
external user module for the ZSSC416x and ZSSC417x families (not applicable to the ZSSC4151). The “Sensor 1” header can be used for
either a SENT input (not applicable to ZSSC4151) or an OWI interface (required for ZSSC4151) for an external user module.

                                                                                        the user s sensor if the SSC-SRB is not used
                                                                        Sensor Module                                             Sensor Module
                                                                       with AOUT/OWI                                              with SENT
The microcontroller will forward any data bytes from the ZSSC41xx back to the user’s computer via the USB connection. These bytes can be
sensor and temperature readings to be displayed by the software on the computer, raw analog-to-digital converter (ADC) data used during
calibration, or EEPROM data. The SSC-CB microcontroller controls the power signals required for entering the Command Mode.
The ZSSC41xx power (VDDE) can be supplied from the CB KS5V power supply (jumper K7 closed; see Figure 3) or from an external supply
(VDDE2) connected across the VDDE2 and VSSE post on the KL1 screw terminal (jumper K7 must be open).
Important: Ensure that jumper K7 is open before connecting an external VDDE2 power supply.
If connected, the VDDE2 supply can be switched ON or OFF by the CB-controlled KS5V signal and the IC4 power MOSFET as needed to
establish OWI communication.
* OWI is also referred to as ZACwire™.

 The reset button on the SSC-CB (see Figure 1) sets the controller to its initial state. Note that any SSC-CB port settings will be overwritten.
 The Mass Calibration Board DUT connector is intended for connecting the ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board to a Mass Calibration Board (MCB)
 for evaluation. The connector provides an I2C and OWI interface through the MCB and provides power to it.
 Important: Do not connect the SSC-CB to the ZSSC41xx SSC EB if the MCB is used.
 2.2         ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board Overview
 The operation of the ZSSC41xx SSC Evaluation Board is similar for all applicable products except as follows:
    For the ZSSC4151, the S1 jumper identified in Figure 3 must be in the OWI position. SENT transmission is not applicable to this product.
  For the ZSSC4151, the DOUT labels on the board and callouts in Figure 3 and in the schematic in Figure 4 refer to the ZSSC4151’s
     AOUT pin.
  The BR2N and BR2P pins do not apply to the ZSSC4151.
