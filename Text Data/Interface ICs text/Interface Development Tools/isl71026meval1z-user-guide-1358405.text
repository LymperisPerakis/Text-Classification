 2.      Functional Description
   The ISL71026MEVAL1Z evaluation board provides easy access to the pins of the ISL71026M IC and convenient
   connectors/test points for connecting test equipment. The schematic, bill of materials, and top silkscreen for the board
   are available in “PCB Layout Guidelines” on page 11.
   “Typical Performance Curves” on page 15 shows performance data taken using the ISL71026MEVAL1Z evaluation
   board and basic lab equipment.
   In the following sections, we will discuss using the evaluation board.
   2.1        Basic Layout of Evaluation Board
       The basic layout of the evaluation board is described in the following sections. For more information, see “Board
       Layout” on page 14 or the actual ISL71026MEVAL1Z evaluation board.
       Located in the upper center of the board is the IS71026MVZ transceiver IC (U1). The evaluation board has a pin 1
       dot, to show how the IC should be oriented onto the evaluation board. The IC pin 1 indicator dot needs to be
       aligned with the evaluation board pin 1 dot indicator. The board comes with the IC soldered onto the board.
       Power for the IC is located at the left side of the board through banana jacks labeled VCC and GND. A DC voltage
       source of 3.3V must be connected between VCC and GND to power the part. Test points TP13 (VCC) and TP2
       (GND) are available to measure the VCC voltage to the part.
       Access to the D input to the transceiver is at the BNC connector labeled D at the upper right corner of the
       evaluation board. You would connect the digital source of the CAN digital test pattern at this connector.
       Access to the R output of the transceiver is at the test point labeled TP4 located at the top center of the evaluation
       board. There is a through hole labeled R that could have a wire soldered to it, if you want to feed the digital output
       into a CAN controller board.
       Control of the RS pin is through jumpers J5, J6, J7, and J8 located at middle left side of the evaluation board. Only
       one of these jumper locations should have a jumper installed at any one time. Putting the jumper at J5 will put the
       transceiver in the listen mode. Putting the jumper at J6 will put the transceiver driver in the slow speed mode, at J7
       in the medium speed mode, and at J8 in the fast speed mode. Note: J4 and R3 are not populated. They can be used
       to put a mechanical potentiometer at the RS pin.
       Access to the differential pins (CANH and CANL) are through the test points TP7 and TP8 or through the BNC
       connectors labeled CANH and CANL (not populated) or through the D-SUB 9 pin male connector J1, located at
       the bottom of the board. Use the J1 connector to connect two evaluation boards together for evaluating the
       performance of two boards communicating with each other over various length cables. The CANH and CANL
       BNCs can be used to apply voltages to the differential pins to evaluate the receiver of the transceiver.
       The board comes populated with a 60Ω resistor (R9) installed across the CANH and CANL lines. Many
       performance tests for the transceiver such as propagation delay, rise time, fall time, and skew are done with a 60Ω
       resistor. In a normal CAN system the bus is terminated at both ends with a 120Ω resistor, which gives a differential
       loading of 60Ω.
       See the board schematic (“Schematic” on page 12) for the reference designators of the jumpers, resistors and
       connectors associated with each I/O.
   2.2        Power Supply
       The ISL71026M IC requires a DC power supply in the range of 3.0V to 3.6V for proper operation.
       The power supply is connected at banana jacks VCC and GND. The power supply should be capable of delivering
       100mA of current.
   2.3        Evaluation Board Logic Control
       The ISL71026M IC has three logic control input pins; the D (pin 1), RS (pin 8), and LBK (pin 5).

ISL71026MEVAL1Z                                                                                        2. Functional Description
    2.3.1       D Pin
         The D pin is the digital input to the driver of the transceiver. A digital bit pattern is applied at this pin. A logic 1
         on the D pin puts the CANH and CANL differential pins in the recessive state. A logic 0 on the D pin, puts the
         CANH and CANL differential pins in the dominant state.
         The logic 1 VIH level is from 2.0V to 5.5V with a VCC supply voltage of 3.0V to 3.6V. The logic 0 VIL level is
         from 0.8V to 0V.
    2.3.2       RS Pin
         The output driver has three distinct speed selections that may be chosen by using a resistor from the RS pin to
         GND. Connecting the RS pin directly to GND (Jumper at J6) results in output switching times that are the
         fastest, limited only by the drive capability of the output stage. RS = 10kΩ (Jumper at J7) provides for a typical
         slew rate of 8V/µs and RS = 50kΩ (Jumpter at J8) provides for a typical slew rate of 4V/µs.
         Putting a high logic level to the RS pin (Jumper at J5) places the transceiver in a low current listen mode.
    2.3.3       LBK Pin
         When a high level is applied to the LBK pin, the device enters the loop-back state. The transceiver CANH and
         CANL pins are disconnected from the bus. The driver and receiver circuitry of the transceiver remains active to
         allow for diagnostic testing of the node. Installing a jumper at position 1 to 2 on jumper J9 of the evaluation
         board will connect the LBK pin to VCC putting the part in loop-back state. Removing the jumper will put the
         part back into normal operation. LBK pin of the transceiver has an internal pull-down.
   2.4      Test Points
      The board has various test points for ease of connecting probes to make measurements. The test points available are
      described in Table 2.1.

 3. Using the Board to Measure Propagation Delay, Skew, and
 Rise/Fall Time
   Refer to Figure 2.1 on page 6.
   3.1        Lab Equipment
      The equipment, external supplies, and signal sources needed to operate the board:
      • 3.3V DC power supply
      • Function/signal generator (HP 8112A pulse generator or equivalent)
      • Four channel oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS5140 digital oscilloscope or equivalent)
   3.2        Initial Board Setup Procedure
      (1) Attach the main evaluation board to the DC power supply to the banana jacks labeled VCC and GND as
            shown in Figure 2.1 on page 6. Positive terminal at VCC and negative terminal at GND. The supply should be
            capable of delivering 3.0V to 3.6V and 100mA of current. Set the supply voltage to 3.3V.
      (2) Configure the board for high speed mode by installing a jumper at J8. No jumpers should be installed at J5, J6,
            J7, and J9.
      (3) Connect the oscilloscope to the evaluation board as indicated in Figure 2.1 on page 6.
           (a) Connect the Channel 1 probe to the D pin by connecting the oscilloscope probe at TP3 on the evaluation
                board and the probe ground at TP1.
           (b) Connect the Channel 2 probe to the CANH differential pin by connecting the oscilloscope probe at TP7 on
                the evaluation board and the probe ground at TP9.
           (c) Connect the Channel 3 probe to the CANL differential pin by connecting the oscilloscope probe at TP8 on
                the evaluation board and the probe ground at TP11.
           (d) Connect the Channel 4 probe to the R pin by connecting the oscilloscope probe at TP4 on the evaluation
                board and the probe ground at TP2.
      (4) Connect the function/signal generator at the BNC connector labeled D on the evaluation board as shown in
            Figure 2.1 on page 6. Set the generator to output a 125kHz square wave, 0V to 3.3V amplitude, 50% duty
            cycle with a trise = tfall ≤6ns. Disable the generator output.
      (5) Verify that a 60Ω resistor is installed at location R9 on the evaluation board.
   3.3        Calculating VDIFF and Taking Measurements
      (1)   Set the oscilloscope to 2.0µs/division.
      (2)   Set channel CH1 of the oscilloscope to 5V/division.
      (3)   Set CH2, CH3, and CH4 of the oscilloscope to 2V/division.
      (4)   Using the math function of the oscilloscope, set the math 1 selection to measure CH2 - CH3 and display the
            M1 trace on the oscilloscope screen.
            M1 = CH2 - CH3 = VDIFF = VOD = CANH - CANL.
      (5) Use the “Measure” menu on the oscilloscope to set up the following four measurements:
          • LOW to HIGH propagation delay (tPLH) to measure the time from the 50% point of the falling edge of CH1 (D
            pin) to the 900mV point on the rising edge of the M1 trace (VDIFF).
          • HIGH to LOW propagation delay (tPHL) to measure the time from the 50% point of the rising edge of CH1 (D
            pin) to the 500mV point on the falling edge of M1 trace (VDIFF).
          • Output rise time (tr) to measure the 10% to 90% time of the rise edge of the M1 trace (VDIFF).
          • Output fall time (tf) to measure the 90% to 10% time of the falling edge of the M1 trace (VDIFF).
      (6) Ensure that a jumper is installed at J8 (selects fast driver edges by connecting the RS pin to ground) and no
            jumpers are installed at J5, J6, J7, and J9.
      (7) Enable the function generator. The scope plots should look like the ones shown in Figure 4.1 on page 9.

     (8) In fast speed mode (RS = 0V):
         • tPLH should be around 75ns and no greater than 150ns.
         • tPHL should be around 80ns and no greater than 155ns.
         • trise should be around 55ns and no less than 20ns or greater than 100ns.
         • tfall should be around 25ns and no less than 10ns or greater than 75ns.
     (9) Move the jumper from J8 to J7 (selects medium driver edges by connecting the RS pin to ground through a
           10kΩ resistor). Note: No jumpers should be installed at J5, J6, J8, and J9.
     (10) The scope plot should look like the ones in Figure 4.2 on page 9.
     (11) In medium speed mode (RS = 10kΩ):
         • tPLH should be around 520ns and no greater than 850ns.
         • tPHL should be around 460ns and no greater than 800ns.
         • tr should be around 400ns and no less than 200ns or greater than 780ns.
         • tf should be around 300ns and no less than 175ns or greater than 500ns.
     (12) Move the jumper from J7 to J6 (selects slow driver edges by connecting the RS pin to ground through a 50kΩ
           resistor). Note: No jumpers should be installed at J5, J7, J8, and J9.
     (13) The scope plot should look like the ones in Figure 4.3 on page 10.
     (14) In slow speed mode (RS = 50kΩ):
         • tPLH should be around 850ns and no greater than 1400ns.
         • tPHL should be around 725ns and no greater than 1300ns.
         • tr should be around 700ns and no less than 400ns or greater than 1400ns.
         • tf should be around 650ns and no less than 300ns or greater than 1000ns.
