    LOSB4              16          LOS BAR indicator 4. Low output when IN4 signal is below DT threshold.
     GND         17, 23, 40, 46    These pins should be grounded.

                                   output OUT3 and OUT4 are muted when the power of IN3 and IN4, respectively, fall below the threshold. Tie to
                                   ground to disable electrical idle preservation and always enable the limiting amplifier.

NOTES:
  6. Compliance to datasheet limits is assured by one or more methods: production test, characterization and/or design.
  7. After channel loss, differential amplitudes at ISL36411 inputs must meet the input voltage range specified in “Absolute Maximum Ratings” on
     page 5.
  8. Maximum Reflection Coefficient given by equation SDDXX(dB)= -12 + 2*(f), with f in GHz. Established by characterization and not production tested.
  9. Maximum Reflection Coefficient given by equation SDDXX(dB)= -6.3+13Log10(f/5.5), with f in GHz. Established by characterization and not
     production tested.
10. Reflection Coefficient given by equation SCCXX(dB) < -7 + 1.6*f, with f in GHz. Established by characterization and not production tested.
11. Output residual jitter is the difference between the total jitter at the lane extender output and the total jitter of the transmitted signal (as measured
     at the input to the channel). Total jitter (TJ) is DJP-P + 14.1 x RJRMS.
12. Measured using a PRBS 27-1 pattern. Deterministic jitter at the input to the lane extender is due to frequency-dependent, media-induced loss only.
13. Rise and fall times measured using a 1GHz clock with a 20ps edge rate.
14. For active data mode, cable input amplitude is 300mVP-P (differential) or greater. For line silence mode, cable input amplitude is 20mVP-P
     (differential) or less. Established by characterization and not production tested.
15. Limits established by characterization and are not production tested.

ISL36411
Typical Performance Characteristics
Performance is measured using the test setup illustrated in Figure 1. The signal from the pattern generator is launched into the twin-axial cable using an
SMA adapter card. The chip evaluation board is connected to the output of the cable through another adapter card. The ISL36411 output signal is then
visualized on a scope to determine signal integrity parameters such as jitter.

Adjustable Equalization Boost
Each channel in the ISL36411 features a settable (in pairs)
equalizer for custom signal restoration. The flexibility of this
adjustable compensation architecture enables signal fidelity to
be optimized on a channel-by-channel basis, providing support
for a wide variety of channel characteristics and data rates
ranging from 2.5Gbps to 11.1Gbps. Because the boost level is
externally set rather than internally adapted, the ISL36411
provides reliable communication from the very first bit
transmitted. There is no time needed for adaptation and control
loop convergence. Furthermore, there are no pathological data
patterns that will cause the ISL36411 to move to an incorrect
boost level.

About Q:ACTIVE Technology
Intersil has long realized that to enable the complex server
clusters of next generation data centers, it is critical to manage
the signal integrity issues of electrical interconnects. To address
this, Intersil has developed its groundbreaking Q:ACTIVE™
product line. By integrating its analog ICs inside cabling
interconnects, Intersil is able to achieve unsurpassed
improvements in reach, power consumption, latency and cable
gauge size as well as increased airflow in tomorrow’s data
centers. This new technology transforms passive cabling into
intelligent “roadways” that yield lower operating expenses and
capital expenditures for the expanding data center.
Intersil Lane Extenders allow greater reach over existing cabling
while reducing the need for thicker cables. This significantly
reduces cable weight and clutter, increases airflow and improves
power consumption.
