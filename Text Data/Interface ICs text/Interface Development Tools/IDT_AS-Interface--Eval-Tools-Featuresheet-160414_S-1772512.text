The IDT AS-Interface Programmer provides support                    • EEPROM programming for IDT’s AS-Interface
                                                                                                 2                2
for newcomers and experienced users for imple-                        products: ASI4U, SAP5, A SI-Light* and A SI*
menting IDT’s AS-Interface ICs.                                     • Integrated AS-Interface power generation
An easy-to-use graphical user interface allows con-                 • Static AS-Interface network evaluation and
trol of the AS-Interface functionality; e.g., EEPROM                  configuration
programming, telegram-by-telegram debugging for
                                                                    • Control of the AS-Interface Programmer by the
AS-Interface networks, and configuration or reading
                                                                      open serial protocol
of the digital parameter port and input/output ports.
