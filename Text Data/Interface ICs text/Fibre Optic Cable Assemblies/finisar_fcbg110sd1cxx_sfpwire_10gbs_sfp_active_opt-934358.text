Finisar’s FCBG110SD1Cxx 10Gb/s SFPwire® SFP+ active optical cables are designed
for use in 10-Gigabit Ethernet links. They are electrically compliant with SFF-84311, and
the mechanical SFP+ plug is compatible with SFF-84322. SFPwire is SFI limiting. No
host electrical transmitter pre-emphasis is required. No host electrical receiver linear
equalization is required. Host board designers using an EDC PHY IC should follow the
IC manufacturer’s recommended settings for interoperating the host-board EDC PHY
with a limiting receiver. SFPwire is compliant per the RoHS Directive 2011/65/EU. See
Finisar Application Note AN-2038 for more details.
