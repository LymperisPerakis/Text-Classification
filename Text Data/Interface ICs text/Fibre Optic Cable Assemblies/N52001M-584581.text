Tripp Lite's 1-meter multimode duplex Fibre Channel optic LC/LC patch cable is manufactured from
50/125 zipcord fiber. The cable has LC connectors on each end. It has a PVC jacket and is FDDI and
                                                                                                       Package Includes
OFNR rated. 50/125 Duplex multimode fiber is most commonly used in Fibre Channel applications. It is   ● 1M duplex MMF cable LC/LC
backward compatible with 62.5 micron fiber and provides built-in headroom for future applications. The   50/125 fiber
cable provides higher bandwidth optimized for Gigabit and 10Gbps networks as well. Also available in
lengths up to 152 meters. Enter "N520-" in the search field to bring up all lengths. For LC-SC cables,
search "N516-", and for SC-SC, search "N506-".
