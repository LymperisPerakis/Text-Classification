Active Optical Cables


Active Optical Cables
Finisar’s family of active optical cables accelerate data connectivity for storage, networking
and high-performance computing (HPC) applications. This product line includes C.wire® for
100GbE and InfiniBand 12xQDR/12xFDR/12xEDR; Quadwire® for 40/100GbE and InfiniBand
QDR/FDR/EDR; and SFPwire® for applications up to 25 Gb/s.
Each cable solution leverages Finisar’s fiber optic technology for the transmission of data while
reducing the weight, density and power consumption of traditional copper solutions. Key
advantages of active optical cables include low weight for high port count architectures; small
bend radius for easy installations; and low power consumption enabling a greener environment
thereby providing the lowest total cost solution for data centers.
