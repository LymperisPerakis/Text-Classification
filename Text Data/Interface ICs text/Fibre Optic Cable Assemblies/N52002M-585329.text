Tripp Lite's 2-meter multimode duplex Fibre Channel optic LC/LC patch cable is manufactured from
50/125 zipcord fiber. The cable has LC connectors on each end. It has a PVC jacket and is FDDI and
                                                                                                               Package Includes
OFNR rated. 50/125 Duplex multimode fiber is most commonly used in Fibre Channel applications. It is           ● 2M duplex MMF cable LC/LC
backward compatible with 62.5 micron fiber and provides built-in headroom for future applications. The           50/125 fiber
cable provides higher bandwidth optimized for Gigabit and 10Gbps networks as well. Also available in 1,
3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 50 meter lengths. Enter "N520-" in the search field to bring up all lengths. For
