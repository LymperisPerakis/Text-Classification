Description
The N370-30M Duplex Singlemode 8.3/125 Fiber Patch Cable transmits fast, clear data signals through your LAN with data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps.
Designed for network equipment that requires singlemode fiber optic patch cables, this 30-meter (100-foot) cable has attenuation loss that meets or exceeds
current standards.
The FDDI-rated N370-30M has 8.3/125 duplex (zipcord) fiber made from glass, instead of polymer. The sturdy LC male connectors meet stringent insertion
loss standards and feature beveled edges on their glass ends for easy insertion into a patch panel or switch. The OFNR-rated PVC jacket is yellow to easily
identify it as a singlemode cable.
