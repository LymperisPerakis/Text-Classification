Tripp Lite's 20-meter multimode duplex Fibre Channel SC/LC patch cable is manufactured from 50/125         ● Any fiber optic hardware or NIC
zipcord fiber. The cable has SC connectors on one end, and LC at the other, a PVC jacket, and is FDDI        card requiring multimode duplex
and OFNR rated. 50/125 Duplex multimode fiber is most commonly used in Fibre Channel applications. It
                                                                                                             cable with LC/SC connectors
is backward compatible with 62.5 micron fiber and built-in headroom for future applications. The cable
provides higher bandwidth optimized for Gigabit and 10Gbps networks as well. Also available in 1, 2, 3, 5, Package Includes
10, 15, 30, and 50 meter lengths. Search "N516-" to bring up all lengths. Also search "N506-" for SC-SC    ● 20M duplex MMF cable LC/SC
cables, and "N520-" for LC-LC cables.
                                                                                                             50/125 fiber
