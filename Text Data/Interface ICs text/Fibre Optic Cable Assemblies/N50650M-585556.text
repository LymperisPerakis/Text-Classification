Tripp Lite's 50-meter multimode duplex Fibre Channel SC/SC patch cable is manufactured from 50/125
zipcord fiber. The cable has SC connectors on each end, a PVC jacket and is FDDI and OFNR rated.
                                                                                                           Package Includes
50/125 Duplex multimode fiber is most commonly used in Fibre Channel applications. It is backward          ● 50M duplex MMF cable SC/SC
compatible with 62.5 micron fiber and built-in headroom for future applications. The cable provides higher   50/125 fiber
bandwidth optimized for Gigabit and 10Gbps networks as well. Also available in 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 30
meter lengths. Search "N506-" to bring up all lengths. Also search "N516-" for SC-LC cables, and "N520-"
for LC-LC cables.
