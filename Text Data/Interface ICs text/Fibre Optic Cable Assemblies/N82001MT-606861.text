installations; install or remove the cable with one hand without needing additional tools. LOMMF cable allows
10GbE serial transmission over extended distances in the 850nm wavelength window, where low-cost Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs)
enable a cost-effective, high-bandwidth solution. LOMMF is ideally suited for LAN's, SAN's, and high-speed parallel interconnects for head-ends, central
offices, and data centers. A slim, uniboot design provides space savings, while premium-grade ceramic ferrules are designed for 10GbE and faster
applications. Backward compatible with existing 50/125 fiber. Sturdy plastic housing for long lasting durability.
