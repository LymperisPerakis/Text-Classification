Description
Tripp Lite's N820-12M is an OM3 Laser-Optimized Multimode Fiber (LOMMF) "Aqua" cable, for use with 10Gb Ethernet applications. 50/125um, LC/LC Fiber
Optic cables provide nearly four times the bandwidth over conventional 62.5um multimode fiber, with performance rivaling that of Single mode cable, at a much
reduced cost. LOMMF cable allows 10Gb serial transmission over extended distances in the 850nm wavelength window, where low-cost Vertical Cavity
Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) enable a cost-effective, high-bandwidth solution. LOMMF is ideally suited for LAN's, SAN's, and high-speed parallel
interconnects for head-ends, central offices, and data centers.
Features
   12M (39-ft.) LC/LC, OM3 Rated
   10gb Ethernet speed to 300 meters @850nm
   Use with VCSEL and LED laser light sources
   High-Speed, High-Bandwidth, Low-Cost
   Backward compatible with legacy LAN's
   Ideal for Fibre Channel (SAN) applications
   IEEE 802.3ae and TIA LOMMF compliant
