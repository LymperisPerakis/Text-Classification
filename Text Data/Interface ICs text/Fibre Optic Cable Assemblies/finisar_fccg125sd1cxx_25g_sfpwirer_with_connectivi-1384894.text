Notes:
1. Circuit ground is internally isolated from chassis ground.
2. Open collector/drain output, which should be pulled up with a 4.7k – 10k Ohms resistor on the host
     board if intended for use. Pull up voltage should be between 2.0V to Vcc + 0.3V.
3. A high output indicates a transmitter fault caused by either the TX bias current or the TX output power
     exceeding the preset alarm thresholds. A low output indicates normal operation. In the low state, the
     output is pulled to <0.8V.
4. Laser output disabled on TDIS >2.0V or open, enabled on TDIS <0.8V.
5. Internally pulled down per SFF-8431 Rev 4.1.
6. LOS is open collector output. Should be pulled up with 4.7k – 10k on host board to a voltage between
     2.0V and 3.6V. Logic 0 indicates normal operation; logic 1 indicates loss of signal.
7. Internally connected.

VI. Connectivity Diagnostics® Technology
    Finisar FCCG125SD1Cxx are equipped with Connectivity Diagnostics®, which
combines the pull-tabs’ LED lights with the out-of-band signaling between the transceivers
at the two ends of the AOC. Three features are currently implemented:
                                  Helps locate the other end of the AOC. Manually pushing-in
                                  either pull tab will light up their LED lights on both ends.
                                  Reports the health status of the AOC. Any Digital Diagnostic
                                  Monitoring warning/alarm events, transmitter’s fault or
                                  receiver’s loss of signal, will light up the pull-tab LED lights
                                  of both ends.
                                  Allows the host to control the AOC pull-tabs’ LED lights.
                                  Writing a command via the 2-wire communication interface
                                  of the near-end AOC transceiver will light up the pull-tabs’
                                  LED lights of both ends.
    A detailed description of Connectivity Diagnostics® is provided in Finisar’s
Application Note AN-2158[6].
