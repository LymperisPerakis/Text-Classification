Tripp Lite's 10-meter multimode duplex Fibre Channel SC/LC patch cable is manufactured from 50/125           connectors
zipcord fiber. The cable has SC connectors on one end, and LC at the other, a PVC jacket, and is FDDI
and OFNR rated. 50/125 Duplex multimode fiber is most commonly used in Fibre Channel applications. It      Package Includes
is backward compatible with 62.5 micron fiber and built-in headroom for future applications. The cable     ● 10M Duplex MMF Cable LC/SC
provides higher bandwidth optimized for Gigabit and 10Gbps networks as well. Also available in 1, 2, 3, 5,   50/125 Fiber
15, 20, 30, and 50 meter lengths. Search "N516-" to bring up all lengths. Also search "N506-" for SC-SC
cables, and "N520-" for LC-LC cables.
