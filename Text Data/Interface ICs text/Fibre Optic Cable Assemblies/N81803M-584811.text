Description
Tripp Lite introduces it's new OM3 Laser-Optimized Multimode Fiber (LOMMF) "Aqua" cables, for use with 10Gb Ethernet applications. These new technology,
50/125um, ST/LC Fiber Optic cables, provide nearly four times the bandwidth over conventional 62.5um multimode fiber, with performance rivaling that of
Singlemode cable, at a much reduced cost. LOMMF cable allows 10Gb serial transmission over extended distances in the 850nm wavelength window, where
low-cost Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) enable a cost-effective, high-bandwidth solution. LOMMF is ideally suited for LAN's, SAN's, and
high-speed parallel interconnects for head-ends, central offices, and data centers.
Features
   3 Meter ( 10ft ) LC/ST, OM3 rated
   Use with VCSEL and LED laser light sources
   High-Speed, High-Bandwidth, Low-Cost
   Backward compatible with legacy LAN's
   Ideal for Fibre Channel (SAN) applications
   IEEE 802.3ae and TIA LOMMF compliant
   10gb Ethernet speed to 300 meters @850nm
