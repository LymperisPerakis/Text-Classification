Description                                                                                                             8.3/125 Fiber Patch Cable, 50 m
The N366-50M Duplex Singlemode 8.3/125 Fiber Patch Cable transmits fast, clear data signals through your
LAN with a higher bandwidth than multimode cable for up to twice the throughput. Designed for network equipment that requires singlemode fiber optic patch
cables, this 50-meter (164-foot) cable has attenuation loss that meets or exceeds current standards.
The N366-50M has 8.3/125 duplex (zipcord) fiber made from glass, instead of polymer. The sturdy LC and SC male connectors meet stringent insertion loss
standards and feature beveled edges on their glass ends for easy insertion into a patch panel or switch. The FDDI- and OFNR-rated PVC jacket is yellow to
easily identify it as a singlemode cable.
