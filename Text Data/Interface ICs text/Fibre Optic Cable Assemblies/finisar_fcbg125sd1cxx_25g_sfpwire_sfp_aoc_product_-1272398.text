Notes:
1. Circuit ground is internally isolated from chassis ground.
2. Open collector/drain output, which should be pulled up with a 4.7k – 10k Ohms resistor on the host
     board if intended for use. Pull up voltage should be between 2.0V to Vcc + 0.3V.
3. A high output indicates a transmitter fault caused by either the TX bias current or the TX output power
     exceeding the preset alarm thresholds. A low output indicates normal operation. In the low state, the
     output is pulled to <0.8V.
4. Laser output disabled on TDIS >2.0V or open, enabled on TDIS <0.8V.
5. Internally pulled down per SFF-8431 Rev 4.1.
6. LOS is open collector output. Should be pulled up with 4.7k – 10k on host board to a voltage between
     2.0V and 3.6V. Logic 0 indicates normal operation; logic 1 indicates loss of signal.
7. Internally connected.
