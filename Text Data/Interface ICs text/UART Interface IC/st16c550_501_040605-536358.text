SYMBOL DESCRIPTION
   Symbol        Pin       Signal                      Pin Description
             40  44   48    type
A0           28  31   28       I  Address-0 Select Bit Internal registers address selection.
A1           27  30   27       I  Address-1 Select Bit Internal registers address selection.
A2           26  29   26       I  Address-2 Select Bit Internal registers address selection.
IOR          22  25   20       I  Read data strobe. Its function is the same as -IOR (see -
                                  IOR), except it is active high. Either an active -IOR or IOR
                                  is required to transfer data from 16C550 to CPU during a
                                  read operation. Connect to logic 0 when using -IOR.
CS0          12  14    9       I  Chip Select-0. Logical 1 on this pin provides the chip select-
                                  0 function. Connect CS0 to logic 1 if using CS1 or -CS2.
CS1          13  15   10       I  Chip Select-1. Logical 1 on this pin provides the chip select-
                                  1 function. Connect CS1 to logic 1 if using CS0 or -CS2.
 -CS2        14  16   11       I  Chip Select -2. Logical 0 on this pin provides the chip select-
                                  2 function. Connect to logic 0 if using CS0 or CS1.
IOW          19  21   17       I  Write data strobe. Its function is the same as -IOW (see -
                                  IOW), but it acts as an active high input signal. Either -IOW
                                  or IOW is required to transfer data from the CPU to
                                  ST16C550 during a write operation. Connect to logic 0 when
                                  using -IOW.
-AS          25  28   24       I  Address Strobe. A logic 1 transition on -AS latches the state
                                  of the chip selects and the register select bits, A0-A2. This
                                  input is used when address and chip selects are not stable
                                  for the duration of a read or write operation, i.e., a micropro-
                                  cessor that needs to de-multiplex the address and data bits.
                                  If not required, the -AS input can be permanently tied to a
                                  logic 0.
D0-D7        1-8 2-9 43-47
                      2-4    I/O  Data Bus (Bi-directional) - These pins are the eight bit, tri-

                              transfers the contents of the ST16C550 data bus to the CPU.
                              Connect to logic 1 when using IOR.
-IOW         18 20  16    I   Write data strobe (active low strobe). A logic 0 on this pin
                              transfers the contents of the CPU data bus to the addressed
                              internal register. Connect to logic 1 when using IOW.
INT          30 33  30    O   Interrupt Request (active high). Interrupts are enabled in the
                              interrupt enable register (IER), and when an interrupt con-
                              dition exists. Interrupt conditions include: receiver errors,
                              available receiver buffer data, transmit buffer empty, or
                              when a modem status flag is detected.
-RXRDY       29 32  29    O   Receive Ready. When operating in the FIFO mode, one of
                              two types of DMA signaling can be selected using the FIFO
                              control register bit-3. When operating in the ST16C450
                              mode, only DMA mode “0” is allowed. Mode “0” supports
                              single transfer DMA in which a transfer is made between
                              CPU bus cycles. Mode “1” supports multi-transfer DMA in
                              which multiple transfers are made continuously until the
                              receiver FIFO has been emptied. In DMA mode “0” -RXRDY
                              is low, when there is at least one character in the receiver
                              FIFO or receive holding register. In DMA mode “1”, -RXRDY
                              is low, when the trigger level or the time-out has been
                              reached.
-TXRDY       24 27  23    O   Transmit Ready. When operating in the FIFO mode, one of
                              two types of DMA signaling can be selected using the FIFO
                              control register bit-3. When operating in the ST16C450
                              mode, only DMA mode “0” is allowed. Mode “0” supports

                              which multiple transfers are made continuously until the
                              transmit FIFO has been filled.
-BAUDOUT     15 17  12    O   Baud Rate Generator Output. This pin provides the 16X
                              clock of the selected data rate from the baud rate generator.
                              The RCLK pin must be connected externally to -BAUDOUT
                              when the receiver is operating at the same data rate.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION                                         FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
The ST16C550 provides serial asynchronous receive           Internal Registers
data synchronization, parallel-to-serial and serial-to-
parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and      The ST16C550 provides 12 internal registers for
receiver sections. These functions are necessary for        monitoring and control. These registers are shown in
converting the serial data stream into parallel data that   Table 3 below. These registers function as data hold-

for the serial data stream is accomplished by adding        registers (IER/ISR), a FIFO control register (FCR),

any transmission bit errors. The electronic circuitry to
provide all these functions is fairly complex especially
when manufactured on a single integrated silicon
chip. The ST16C550 represents such an integration
with greatly enhanced features. The ST16C550 is
fabricated with an advanced CMOS process.
The ST16C550 is an upward solution that provides 16
bytes of transmit and receive FIFO memory, instead
of 1 byte provided in the 16C450. The ST16C550 is
designed to work with high speed modems and shared
network environments, that require fast data process-
ing time. Increased performance is realized in the
ST16C550 by the larger transmit and receive FIFO’s.
This allows the external processor to handle more
networking tasks within a given time. The 4 selectable
levels of FIFO trigger provided for maximum data
throughput performance especially when operating in
a multi-channel environment. The combination of the
above greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of
the external controlling CPU, increases performance,
and reduces power consumption.
The ST16C550 is capable of operation to 1.5Mbps
with a 24 MHz crystal or external clock input.
With a crystal of 14.7464 MHz and through a software
option, the user can select data rates up to 460.8Kbps
or 921.6Kbps.

entered into the transmit holding register via the user

that is then made available at the user data interface,

ST16C550
Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
The ST16C550 provides four levels of prioritized inter-
rupts to minimize external software interaction. The
Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with six
interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR
will provide the user with the highest pending interrupt
level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowl-
edged until the pending interrupt is serviced. Whenever
the interrupt status register is read, the interrupt status
is cleared. However it should be noted that only the
current pending interrupt is cleared by the read. A lower
level interrupt may be seen after rereading the interrupt
status bits. The Interrupt Source Table 5 (below) shows
the data values (bit 0-3) for the four prioritized interrupt
levels and the interrupt sources associated with each
of these interrupt levels:
