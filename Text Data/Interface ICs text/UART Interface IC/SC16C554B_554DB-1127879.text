                             Rev. 4 — 8 June 2010                                              Product data sheet
1. General description
                          The SC16C554B/554DB is a 4-channel Universal Asynchronous Receiver and
                          Transmitter (QUART) used for serial data communications. Its principal function is to
                          convert parallel data into serial data and vice versa. The UART can handle serial data
                          rates up to 5 Mbit/s. It comes with an Intel (16 mode) or Motorola (68 mode) interface.
                          The SC16C554B/554DB is pin compatible with the ST16C554 and TL16C554 and it will
                          power-up to be functionally equivalent to the 16C454. Programming of control registers
                          enables the added features of the SC16C554B/554DB. Some of these added features are
                          the 16-byte receive and transmit FIFOs, four receive trigger levels. The
                          SC16C554B/554DB also provides DMA mode data transfers through FIFO trigger levels
                          and the TXRDY and RXRDY signals. (TXRDY and RXRDY signals are not available in the
                          HVQFN48 package.) On-board status registers provide the user with error indications,
                          operational status, and modem interface control. System interrupts may be tailored to
                          meet user requirements. An internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics.
                          The SC16C554B/554DB operates at 5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V, and the industrial temperature
                          range, and is available in plastic PLCC68, LQFP64, LQFP80, and HVQFN48 packages.
                          On the HVQFN48 package only, channel C has all the modem pins. Channels A and B
                          have only RTSn and CTSn pins and channel D does not have any modem pin.

6. Functional description
                   The SC16C554B/554DB provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization,
                   parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and
                   receiver sections. These functions are necessary for converting the serial data stream into
                   parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization for the serial data
                   stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to form a data
                   character. Data integrity is insured by attaching a parity bit to the data character. The
                   parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit errors. The electronic circuitry
                   to provide all these functions is fairly complex, especially when manufactured on a single
                   integrated silicon chip. The SC16C554B/554DB represents such an integration with
                   greatly enhanced features. The SC16C554B/554DB is fabricated with an advanced
                   CMOS process to achieve low drain power and high speed requirements.
                   The SC16C554B/554DB is an upward solution that provides 16 bytes of transmit and
                   receive FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C454. The SC16C554B/554DB is
                   designed to work with high speed modems and shared network environments that require
                   fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in the SC16C554B/554DB
                   by the larger transmit and receive FIFOs. This allows the external processor to handle
                   more networking tasks within a given time. In addition, the four selectable levels of FIFO
                   trigger interrupt is uniquely provided for maximum data throughput performance,
                   especially when operating in a multi-channel environment. The combination of the above
                   greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of the external controlling CPU, increases
                   performance, and reduces power consumption.
                   The SC16C554B/554DBAI68 combines the package interface modes of the 16C454/554
                   and 68C454/554 series on a single integrated chip. The 16 mode interface is designed to
                   operate with the Intel-type of microprocessor bus, while the 68 mode is intended to
                   operate with Motorola and other popular microprocessors. Following a reset, the
                   SC16C554B/554DBAI68 is downward compatible with the 16C454/554 or the
                   68C454/554, dependent on the state of the interface mode selection pin, 16/68.
                   The SC16C554B/554DB is capable of operation to 1.5 Mbit/s with a 24 MHz crystal and
                   up to 5 Mbit/s with an external clock input (at 3.3 V and 5 V; at 2.5 V the maximum speed
                   is 3 Mbit/s).
                   The rich feature set of the SC16C554B/554DB is available through internal registers.
                   Selectable receive FIFO trigger levels, selectable transmit and receive baud rates, and
                   modem interface controls are all standard features. In the 16 mode, INTSEL and MCR[3]
                   can be configured to provide a software controlled or continuous interrupt capability. Due
                   to pin limitations of the 64-pin package, this feature is offered by two different LQFP64
                   packages. The SC16C554DB operates in the continuous interrupt enable mode by
                   bonding INTSEL to VCC internally. The SC16C554B operates in conjunction with MCR[3]
                   by bonding INTSEL to GND internally.

                   6.1 Interface options
                       Two user interface modes are selectable for the PLCC68 package. These interface
                       modes are designated as the ‘16 mode’ and the ‘68 mode’. This nomenclature
                       corresponds to the early 16C454/554 and 68C454/554 package interfaces respectively.
                6.1.1 The 16 mode interface
                       The 16 mode configures the package interface pins for connection as a standard
                       16 series (Intel) device and operates similar to the standard CPU interface available on
                       the 16C454/554. In the 16 mode (pin 16/68 = logic 1), each UART is selected with
                       individual chip select (CSn) pins, as shown in Table 3.

                       The 68 mode configures the package interface pins for connection with Motorola, and
                       other popular microprocessor bus types. The interface operates similar to the
                       68C454/554. In this mode, the SC16C554B/554DB decodes two additional addresses,
                       A3 to A4, to select one of the four UART ports. The A3 to A4 address decode function is
                       used only when in the 68 mode (16/68 = logic 0), and is shown in Table 4.

                   6.2 Internal registers
                       The SC16C554B/554DB provides 12 internal registers for monitoring and control. These
                       registers are shown in Table 5. These registers function as data holding registers
                       (THR/RHR), interrupt status and control registers (IER/ISR), a FIFO Control Register
                       (FCR), line status and control registers (LCR/LSR), modem status and control registers
                       (MCR/MSR), programmable data rate (clock) control registers (DLL/DLM), and a user

                   6.3 FIFO operation
                       The 16 byte transmit and receive data FIFOs are enabled by the FIFO Control Register
                       (FCR) bit 0. With SC16C554B devices, the user can set the receive trigger level, but not
                       the transmit trigger level. The receiver FIFO section includes a time-out function to ensure
                       data is delivered to the external CPU. An interrupt is generated whenever the Receive
                       Holding Register (RHR) has not been read following the loading of a character or the
                       receive trigger level has not been reached.

                     6.4 Autoflow control (see Figure 9)
                          Autoflow control is comprised of auto-CTS and auto-RTS. With auto-CTS, the CTS input
                          must be active before the transmitter FIFO can emit data. With auto-RTS, RTS becomes
                          active when the receiver needs more data and notifies the sending serial device. When
                          RTS is connected to CTS, data transmission does not occur unless the receiver FIFO has
                          space for the data; thus, overrun errors are eliminated using UART 1 and UART 2 from a
                          SC16C554B/554DB with the autoflow control enabled. If not, overrun errors occur when
                          the transmit data rate exceeds the receiver FIFO read latency.

  Fig 9.      Autoflow control (auto-RTS and auto-CTS) example
                   6.4.1 Auto-RTS (see Figure 9)
                          Auto-RTS data flow control originates in the receiver timing and control block (see block
                          diagrams in Figure 1 and Figure 2) and is linked to the programmed receiver FIFO trigger
                          level. When the receiver FIFO level reaches a trigger level of 1, 4, or 8 (see Figure 11),
                          RTS is de-asserted. With trigger levels of 1, 4, and 8, the sending UART may send an
                          additional byte after the trigger level is reached (assuming the sending UART has another
                          byte to send) because it may not recognize the de-assertion of RTS until after it has
                          begun sending the additional byte. RTS is automatically reasserted once the RX FIFO is
                          emptied by reading the receiver buffer register. When the trigger level is 14 (see
                          Figure 12), RTS is de-asserted after the first data bit of the 16th character is present on
                          the RX line. RTS is reasserted when the RX FIFO has at least one available byte space.
                          Remark: Auto-RTS is not supported in channel D of the HVQFN48 package, therefore
                          MCR[5] of channel D should not be written.
                   6.4.2 Auto-CTS (see Figure 9)
                          The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before sending the next data byte. When CTS is
                          active, it sends the next byte. To stop the transmitter from sending the following byte, CTS
                          must be released before the middle of the last stop bit that is currently being sent (see
                          Figure 10). The auto-CTS function reduces interrupts to the host system. When flow
                          control is enabled, CTS level changes do not trigger host interrupts because the device
                          automatically controls its own transmitter. Without auto-CTS, the transmitter sends any
                          data present in the transmit FIFO and a receiver overrun error may result.

                              Remark: Auto-CTS is not supported in channel D of the HVQFN48 package, therefore
                              MCR[5] of channel D should not be written.

         (1) When CTS is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
         (2) If CTS goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current byte, the transmitter finishes sending the current byte, but
              is does not send the next byte.
         (3) When CTS goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

                              The receiver FIFO trigger level can be set to 1 byte, 4 bytes, 8 bytes, or 14 bytes. These
                              are described in Figure 11 and Figure 12.

        (1) RTS is de-asserted when the receiver receives the first data bit of the sixteenth byte. The receive FIFO is full after finishing the
              sixteenth byte.
        (2) RTS is asserted again when there is at least one byte of space available and no incoming byte is in processing, or there is more
              than one byte of space available.
        (3) When the receive FIFO is full, the first receive buffer register read re-asserts RTS.

                       6.5 Hardware/software and time-out interrupts
                               Following a reset, if the transmitter interrupt is enabled, the SC16C554B/554DB will issue
                               an interrupt to indicate that the Transmit Holding Register is empty. This interrupt must be
                               serviced prior to continuing operations. The LSR register provides the current singular
                               highest priority interrupt only. Only after servicing the higher pending interrupt will the
                               lower priority interrupt(s) be reflected in the status register. Servicing the interrupt without
                               investigating further interrupt conditions can result in data errors.
                               When two interrupt conditions have the same priority, it is important to service these
                               interrupts correctly. Receive Data Ready and Receive Time-Out have the same interrupt
                               priority (when enabled by IER[0]). The receiver issues an interrupt after the number of
                               characters have reached the programmed trigger level. In this case, the
                               SC16C554B/554DB FIFO may hold more characters than the programmed trigger level.
                               Following the removal of a data byte, the user should re-check LSR[0] for additional
                               characters. A Receive Time-Out will not occur if the receive FIFO is empty. The time-out
                               counter is reset at the center of each stop bit received or each time the Receive Holding
                               Register (RHR) is read. The actual time-out value is 4 character time.
                               In the 16 mode for the PLCC68 package, the system/board designer can optionally
                               provide software controlled 3-state interrupt operation. This is accomplished by INTSEL
                               and MCR[3]. When INTSEL interface pin is left open or made a logic 0, MCR[3] controls
                               the 3-state interrupt outputs, INTA to INTD. When INTSEL is a logic 1, MCR[3] has no
                               effect on the INTA to INTD outputs, and the package operates with interrupt outputs
                               enabled continuously.
                       6.6 Programmable baud rate generator
                               The SC16C554B/554DB supports high speed modem technologies that have increased
                               input data rates by employing data compression schemes. For example, a 33.6 kbit/s
                               modem that employs data compression may require a 115.2 kbit/s input data rate.
                               A 128.0 kbit/s ISDN modem that supports data compression may need an input data rate
                               of 460.8 kbit/s.

                   A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver, allowing
                   independent TX/RX channel control. The programmable Baud Rate Generator is capable
                   of accepting an input clock up to 80 MHz (for 3.3 V and 5 V operation), as required for
                   supporting a 5 Mbit/s data rate. The SC16C554B/554DB can be configured for internal or
                   external clock operation. For internal clock oscillator operation, an industry standard
                   microprocessor crystal (parallel resonant/22 pF to 33 pF load) is connected externally
                   between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 13). Alternatively, an external clock can
                   be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the internal baud rate generator for standard or
                   custom rates (see Table 8).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                           SC16C554B/554DB
                                                5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 16-byte FIFOs
                   6.7 DMA operation
                       The SC16C554B/554DB FIFO trigger level provides additional flexibility to the user for
                       block mode operation. LSR[6:5] provide an indication when the transmitter is empty or has
                       an empty location(s). The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive FIFOs in
                       the DMA mode (FCR[3]). When the transmit and receive FIFOs are enabled and the DMA
                       mode is de-activated (DMA Mode 0), the SC16C554B/554DB activates the interrupt
                       output pin for each data transmit or receive operation. When DMA mode is activated
                       (DMA Mode 1), the user takes the advantage of block mode operation by loading or
                       unloading the FIFO in a block sequence determined by the preset trigger level. In this
                       mode, the SC16C554B/554DB sets the interrupt output pin when the characters in the
                       receive FIFOs are above the receive trigger level.
                       Remark: DMA operation is not supported in the HVQFN48 package.
                   6.8 Loopback mode
                       The internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. In the Loopback mode, the
                       normal modem interface pins are disconnected and reconfigured for loopback internally.
                       MCR[3:0] register bits are used for controlling loopback diagnostic testing. In the
                       Loopback mode, OP2 and OP1 in the MCR register (bits 3:2) control the modem RI and
                       CD inputs, respectively. MCR signals RTS and DTR (bits 1:0) are used to control the
                       modem CTS and DSR inputs, respectively. The transmitter output (TX) and the receiver
                       input (RX) are disconnected from their associated interface pins, and instead are
                       connected together internally (see Figure 14). The CTS, DSR, CD, and RI are
                       disconnected from their normal modem control input pins, and instead are connected
                       internally to RTS, DTR, OP2 and OP1. Loopback test data is entered into the Transmit
                       Holding Register via the user data bus interface, D0 to D7. The transmit UART serializes
                       the data and passes the serial data to the receive UART via the internal loopback
                       connection. The receive UART converts the serial data back into parallel data that is then
                       made available at the user data interface D0 to D7. The user optionally compares the
                       received data to the initial transmitted data for verifying error-free operation of the UART
                       TX/RX circuits.
                       In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The Modem
                       Control Interrupts are also operational. However, the interrupts can only be read using
                       lower four bits of the Modem Status Register (MSR[3:0]) instead of the four Modem Status
                       Register bits 7:4. The interrupts are still controlled by the IER.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                             SC16C554B/554DB
                                                  5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.1 Transmit Holding Register (THR) and Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                       The serial transmitter section consists of an 8-bit Transmit Hold Register (THR) and
                       Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The status of the THR is provided in the Line Status
                       Register (LSR). Writing to the THR transfers the contents of the data bus (D7 to D0) to the
                       THR, providing that the THR or TSR is empty. The THR empty flag in the LSR register will
                       be set to a logic 1 when the transmitter is empty or when data is transferred to the TSR.
                       Note that a write operation can be performed when the THR empty flag is set
                       (logic 0 = FIFO full; logic 1 = at least one FIFO location available).
                       The serial receive section also contains an 8-bit Receive Holding Register (RHR).
                       Receive data is removed from the SC16C554B/554DB and receive FIFO by reading the
                       RHR register. The receive section provides a mechanism to prevent false starts. On the
                       falling edge of a start or false start bit, an internal receiver counter starts counting clocks at
                       the 16× clock rate. After 71∨2 clocks, the start bit time should be shifted to the center of the
                       start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled, and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated.
                       Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false
                       character. Receiver status codes will be posted in the LSR.
                   7.2 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                       The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receiver ready, transmitter
                       empty, line status and modem status registers. These interrupts would normally be seen
                       on the INTA to INTD output pins in the 16 mode, or on wire-OR IRQ output pin in the
                       68 mode.

                                                  5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 16-byte FIFOs
                 7.2.1 IER versus Receive FIFO interrupt mode operation
                        When the receive FIFO (FCR[0] = logic 1), and receive interrupts (IER[0] = logic 1) are
                        enabled, the receive interrupts and register status will reflect the following:
                          • The receive data available interrupts are issued to the external CPU when the FIFO
                             has reached the programmed trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops
                             below the programmed trigger level.
                          • FIFO status will also be reflected in the user accessible ISR register when the FIFO
                             trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register status bit and the interrupt will be
                             cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                          • The data ready bit (LSR[0]) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift
                             register to the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
                 7.2.2 IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO polled mode operation
                        When FCR[0] = logic 1, resetting IER[3:0] enables the SC16C554B/554DB in the FIFO
                        polled mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the
                        LSR, either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or
                        receive control bit(s).
                          •  LSR[0] will be a logic 1 as long as there is one byte in the receive FIFO.
                          •  LSR[4:1] will provide the type of errors encountered, if any.
                          •  LSR[5] will indicate when the transmit FIFO is empty.
                          •  LSR[6] will indicate when both the transmit FIFO and Transmit Shift Register are
                             empty.
                          • LSR[7] will indicate any FIFO data errors.
                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                        This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the receive FIFO trigger
                        levels, and select the DMA mode.
                 7.3.1 DMA mode
                7.3.1.1 Mode 0 (FCR bit 3 = 0)
                        Set and enable the interrupt for each single transmit or receive operation, and is similar to
                        the 16C454 mode. Transmit Ready (TXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever an empty
                        transmit space is available in the Transmit Holding Register (THR). Receive Ready
                        (RXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is loaded with
                        a character.
                7.3.1.2 Mode 1 (FCR bit 3 = 1)
                        Set and enable the interrupt in a block mode operation. The transmit interrupt is set when
                        there are one or more FIFO locations empty. The receive interrupt is set when the receive
                        FIFO fills to the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO continues to fill regardless
                        of the programmed level until the FIFO is full. RXRDY remains a logic 0 as long as the
                        FIFO fill level is above the programmed trigger level.

                                                 FIFO interrupt.
                                                 An interrupt is generated when the number of characters in the FIFO equals
                                                 the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO will continue to be loaded
                                                 until it is full. Refer to Table 12.

                                                 characters in the transmit FIFO or Transmit Holding Register, the TXRDY
                                                 pin will be a logic 0. Once active, the TXRDY pin will go to a logic 1 after the

                       The SC16C554B/554DB provides four levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external
                       software interaction. The Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with four
                       interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR will provide the user with the
                       highest pending interrupt level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowledged until
                       the pending interrupt is serviced. Whenever the Interrupt Status Register is read, the
                       interrupt status is cleared. However, it should be noted that only the current pending
                       interrupt is cleared by the read. A lower level interrupt may be seen after re-reading the
                       interrupt status bits. Table 13 “Interrupt source” shows the data values (bits 0 to 5) for the
                       four prioritized interrupt levels and the interrupt sources associated with each of these
                       interrupt levels.

                   7.5 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       The Line Control Register is used to specify the asynchronous data communication
                       format. The word length, the number of stop bits, and the parity are selected by writing the
                       appropriate bits in this register.
                       Table 15.  Line Control Register bits description
                        Bit     Symbol          Description
                        7       LCR[7]          Divisor latch enable. The internal baud rate counter latch and Enhance
                                                Feature mode enable.
                                                    logic 0 = divisor latch disabled (normal default condition)
                                                    logic 1 = divisor latch enabled
                        6       LCR[6]          Set break. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to
                                                be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This condition
                                                exists until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.
                                                    logic 0 = no TX break condition (normal default condition)
                                                    logic 1 = forces the transmitter output (TX) to a logic 0 for alerting the
                                                    remote receiver to a line break condition
                        5       LCR[5]          Set parity. If the parity bit is enabled, LCR[5] selects the forced parity format.
                                                Programs the parity conditions (see Table 16).
                                                    logic 0 = parity is not forced (normal default condition)
                                                    LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 0: parity bit is forced to a logic 1 for the

                                                    LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 1: parity bit is forced to a logic 0 for the
                                                    transmit and receive data
                        4       LCR[4]          Even parity. If the parity bit is enabled with LCR[3] set to a logic 1, LCR[4]
                                                selects the even or odd parity format.
                                                    logic 0 = odd parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1s in
                                                    the transmitted data. The receiver must be programmed to check the same
                                                    format (normal default condition).
                                                    logic 1 = even parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1s in
                                                    the transmitted data. The receiver must be programmed to check the same
                                                    format.
                        3       LCR[3]          Parity enable. Parity or no parity can be selected via this bit.
                                                    logic 0 = no parity (normal default condition)
                                                    logic 1 = a parity bit is generated during the transmission, receiver checks

                        2       LCR[2]          Stop bits. The length of stop bit is specified by this bit in conjunction with the
                                                programmed word length (see Table 17).

                   7.6 Modem Control Register (MCR)
                       This register controls the interface with the modem or a peripheral device.
                       Table 19.   Modem Control Register bits description
                       Bit       Symbol           Description
                       7:6       MCR[7:6]         Reserved; set to ‘0’.
                       5         MCR[5]           Autoflow control enable.
                       4         MCR[4]           Loopback. Enable the local Loopback mode (diagnostics). In this mode the
                                                  transmitter output (TXn) and the receiver input (RXn), CTS, DSR, CD, and
                                                  RI are disconnected from the SC16C554B/554DB I/O pins. Internally the
                                                  modem data and control pins are connected into a loopback data
                                                  configuration (see Figure 14). In this mode, the receiver and transmitter
                                                  interrupts remain fully operational. The Modem Control Interrupts are also
                                                  operational, but the interrupts’ sources are switched to the lower four bits of
                                                  the Modem Control. Interrupts continue to be controlled by the IER register.
                                                      logic 0 = disable Loopback mode (normal default condition)

                       3         MCR[3]           OP2, INTn enable. Used to control the modem CD signal in the Loopback
                                                  mode.
                                                      logic 0 = forces INTA to INTD outputs to the 3-state mode during the
                                                      16 mode (normal default condition). In the Loopback mode, sets OP2
                                                      (CD) internally to a logic 1.
                                                      logic 1 = forces the INTA to INTD outputs to the active mode during the
                                                      16 mode. In the Loopback mode, sets OP2 (CD) internally to a logic 0.
                       2         MCR[2]           OP1. This bit is used in the Loopback mode only. In the Loopback mode,
                                                  this bit is used to write the state of the modem RI interface signal via OP1.

                                                      logic 0 = force RTS output to a logic 1 (normal default condition)

                                                  Automatic RTS may be used for hardware flow control by enabling MCR[5].

                        7     LSR[7]       FIFO data error.
                                                logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)
                                                logic 1 = at least one parity error, framing error or break indication is in the
                                                current FIFO data. This bit is cleared when LSR register is read.
                        6     LSR[6]       THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator. This bit is set to a
                                           logic 1 whenever the Transmit Holding Register and the Transmit Shift Register
                                           are both empty. It is reset to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a
                                           data character. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set to logic 1 whenever the transmit
                                           FIFO and Transmit Shift Register are both empty.
                        5     LSR[5]       THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit
                                           indicates that the UART is ready to accept a new character for transmission. In
                                           addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to CPU when the THR
                                           interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
                                           transferred from the Transmit Holding Register into the Transmitter Shift
                                           Register. The bit is reset to a logic 0 concurrently with the loading of the
                                           transmitter holding register by the CPU. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when
                                           the transmit FIFO is empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the
                                           transmit FIFO.
                        4     LSR[4]       Break interrupt.
                                                logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                                logic 1 = the receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one
                                                character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded
                                                into the FIFO.
                        3     LSR[3]       Framing error.
                                                logic 0 = no framing error (normal default condition)
                                                logic 1 = framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s).
                                                In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the top of the
                                                FIFO.
                        2     LSR[2]       Parity error.
                                                logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition)
                                                logic 1 = parity error. The receive character does not have correct parity
                                                information and is suspect. In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the
                                                character at the top of the FIFO.
                        1     LSR[1]       Overrun error.
                                                logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                                logic 1 = overrun error. A data overrun error occurred in the Receive Shift
                                                Register. This happens when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In
                                                this case, the previous data in the shift register is overwritten. Note that under
                                                this condition, the data byte in the Receive Shift Register is not transferred
                                                into the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.
                        0     LSR[0]       Receive data ready.
                                                logic 0 = no data in Receive Holding Register or FIFO (normal default
                                                condition)
                                                logic 1 = data has been received and is saved in the Receive Holding
                                                Register or FIFO

                                                5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This register provides the current state of the control interface signals from the modem, or
                       other peripheral device to which the SC16C554B/554DB is connected. Four bits of this
                       register are used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1
                       whenever a control input from the modem changes state. These bits are set to a logic 0
                       whenever the CPU reads this register.
                       Table 21.   Modem Status Register bits description
                        Bit     Symbol           Description
                        7       MSR[7]           CD (active HIGH, logic 1). Normally this bit is the complement of the CD
                                                 input. In the Loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the OP2 bit in the MCR
                                                 register.
                        6       MSR[6]           RI (active HIGH, logic 1). Normally this bit is the complement of the RI input.
                                                 In the Loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the OP1 bit in the MCR
                                                 register.
                        5       MSR[5]           DSR (active HIGH, logic 1). Normally this bit is the complement of the DSR
                                                 input. In Loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the DTR bit in the MCR
                                                 register.
                        4       MSR[4]           CTS (active HIGH, logic 1). CTS functions as hardware flow control signal
                                                 input if it is enabled via MCR[5]. Flow control (when enabled) allows starting
                                                 and stopping the transmissions based on the external modem CTS signal. A
                                                 logic 1 at the CTS pin will stop SC16C554B/554DB transmissions as soon as
                                                 current character has finished transmission. Normally MSR[4] is the
                                                 complement of the CTS input. However, in the Loopback mode, this bit is
                                                 equivalent to the RTS bit in the MCR register.
                        3       MSR[3]           ΔCD [1]
                                                      Logic 0 = No CD change (normal default condition).
                                                      Logic 1 = The CD input to the SC16C554B/554DB has changed state
                                                      since the last time it was read. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.

                                                      Logic 0 = No RI change (normal default condition).
                                                      Logic 1 = The RI input to the SC16C554B/554DB has changed from a
                                                      logic 0 to a logic 1. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.
                        1       MSR[1]           ΔDSR [1]
                                                      Logic 0 = No DSR change (normal default condition).
                                                      Logic 1 = The DSR input to the SC16C554B/554DB has changed state
                                                      since the last time it was read. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.

                                                      Logic 0 = No CTS change (normal default condition).
                                                      Logic 1 = The CTS input to the SC16C554B/554DB has changed state

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 35) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 27 and 28
