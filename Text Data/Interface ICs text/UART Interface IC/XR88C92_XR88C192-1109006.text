  DESCRIPTION
The XR88C92/192 is a Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter with 8 (XR88C92) / 16 (XR88C192)
bytes transmit and receive FIFO. The XR88C92/192 is a pin and functional replacement for the SC26C92 and an
improved version of the Philips SCC2692 UART with faster data access and other additional features. The operating
speed of the receiver and transmitter can be selected independently from a table of eighteen fixed baud rates, a 16X
clock derived from a programmable counter/timer, or an external 1X or 16X clock. The baud rate generator and counter/
timer can operate directly from a crystal or from external clock input. The XR88C92/192 provides a power-down mode
in which the oscillator is stopped but the register contents are retained. The XR88C92/192 is fabricated in an advanced
CMOS process to achieve low power and high speed requirements.

Four change-of-state detectors are associated with
inputs IP0, IP1, IP2, and IP3. If a high-to-low or low-to-
high transition occurs on any of these inputs, the
corresponding bit in the input port change register
(IPCR - address 0x04) will be set accordingly. The
sampling clock of the change detectors is the XTAL1/
96 tap of the baud rate generator, which is 38.4kHz if
XTAL1 is 3.6864MHz. A new input level must be sampled
on two consecutive sampling clocks to detect a change.                  Figure 1: Crystal Connection

Output ports (OP0-OP7), when used as general pur-
pose outputs, can be asserted (set to low) by writing a
“1” to the corresponding bit in this register. Once an
output is asserted, it can be negated only by issuing a
command through the Reset Output Port Register (see
below).
However, note that SOPR and ROPR cannot be used to
assert and negate outputs that are programmed for
alternate functions (see description under OPCR). For
example, if OP0 is programmed to output -RTSA (see
'Configuring Multi-purpose Outputs), it cannot be con-
trolled by SOPR or ROPR. In that case, commands from
the Command Register should be issued to assert (CRA
bits 7:4 = 0x8) and negate (CRA bits 7:4 = 0x9) OP0.
SOPR Bit 0-7:
0 = No change (same state).
1 = Assert the corresponding output (Set it low).

Each output port bit can be changed to high state by
writing a “1” to each individual bit.

PROGRAMMING EXAMPLES
The following examples show how to initialize the XR88C92/192 for various operating conditions:
A) The first example will initialize channel A of an XR88C92 device for regular RX/TX. The operating parameters will
   be 9600 baud, 8 word length, no parity and 1 stop bit.
 Operation Register         Value        Remarks
   Write        CRA         0x20         ; reset RX (receiver)
   Write        CRA         0x30         ; reset TX (transmitter)
   Write        CRA         0x40         ; reset error status
   Write        CRA         0xB0         ; reset MR pointer to MR0
   Write        MR0A        0x00         ; use normal baud rate table. Now MR pointer points to MR1
   Write        MR1A        0x13         ; select word length & parity. Now MR pointer points to MR2
   Write        MR2A        0x07         ; normal mode (not loopback) & 1 stop bit
   Write        CSRA        0xBB         ; 9600 baud for RX & TX - clock source is XTAL1
   Write        CRA         0x05         ; enable RX & TX
   Read         SRA                      ; should get a value 0x0C
B) This example will show how to use hardware flow control for both RX (RTS via OP0) and TX (CTS via IP0):
   Write        CRA         0x10         ; reset MR pointer to MR1
   Write        MR1A        0x93         ; select auto RTS control. The -RTS signal is sent via output OP0
   Write        MR2A        0x17         ; select auto CTS control. The input IP0 serves as the -CTS signal
C) This example will configure clock sources for TX and RX of both channels and C/T. Specifically, XTAL1 will be
   used as channel A's TX clock; IP4 as channel A's 16X RX clock; IP5 as channel B's 1X TX clock and XTAL1 as
   channel B's RX clock. Also, the C/T will be initialized in the timer mode and IP2 will be used as its clock source.
   Some of these will be programmed to appear at the multi-purpose output pins:
   Write        ACR         0x40         ; C/T initialized in timer mode & IP2 chosen as its clock source
                                         ; also, bit-7 = 0, therefore baud rate Set1 has been selected
   Write        CTPU        0x00         ; It is essential to program CTPU & CTPL before programming OP3
   Write        CTPL        0x05         ; as C/T output (see below)
   Write        CSRA        0xEB         ; channel A RX clock source: IP4-16X, TX clock source: XTAL1 (if MR0A
                                         ; bits 2 and 0 = 0, the TX baud rate is 9600)
   Write        CSRB        0xBF         ; channel B RX clock source: XTAL1 (9600 baud), TX clock source: IP5-1X
   Read         STCR                     ; Start the C/T
   Write        OPCR        0x06         ; C/T output appears at OP3 and channel A's TX 1X clock (this is XTAL1
                                         ; clock divided by 16) at OP2.
D) The next example will show how to configure and run channel B's transmitter in a multi-drop application. Note that
   all other relevant parameters should be configured already, like baud rate etc.
   Write        CRB         0x10         ; reset MR pointer to MR1
   Write        MR1B        0x1B         ; word length = 8 and use A/D tag in the place of parity
   Write        CRB         0x04         ; Enable transmitter of channel B
   Write        TXB         address      ; Send the address first (A/D tag = 1)
   Write        CRB         0x10         ; reset MR pointer to MR1
   Write        MR1B        0x13         ; change A/D tag = 0
   Write        TXB         data         ; You can load the data (A/D tag = 0) immediately after the address. There
                                         ; is no need to wait till the transmitter is empty. Load all the data.
   Read         SRB                      ; Check to see if the transmitter is empty & ready. You need to do this
                                         ; before you can load the next address.
                                         ; Repeat the last 5 steps to load different addresses and their data.
