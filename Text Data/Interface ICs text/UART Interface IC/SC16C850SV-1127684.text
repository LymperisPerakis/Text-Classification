1. General description
              The SC16C850SV is a 1.8 V, low power single channel Universal Asynchronous Receiver
              and Transmitter (UART) used for serial data communications. Its principal function is to
              convert parallel data into serial data and vice versa. The UART can handle serial data
              rates up to 20 Mbit/s (4 sampling rate). SC16C850SV can be programmed to operate in
              extended mode where additional advanced UART features are available (see
              Section 6.2).The SC16C850SV family UART provides enhanced UART functions with
              128-byte FIFOs, modem control interface and IrDA encoder/decoder. On-board status
              registers provide the user with error indications and operational status. System interrupts
              and modem control features may be tailored by software to meet specific user
              requirements. An internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. Independent
              programmable baud rate generators are provided to select transmit and receive baud
              rates.
              The SC16C850SV with Intel XScale processor VLIO interface operates at 1.8 V and is
              available in the HVQFN32 package.

 Symbol        Pin          Type     Description
 INT           20           O        Interrupt output. The output state is defined by the user through the software setting of
                                     MCR[5]. INT is set to the active mode when MCR[5] is set to a logic 0. INT is set to the
                                     open-source mode when MCR[3] is set to a logic 1. See Table 19.
 IOR           14           I        Read strobe (active LOW). A HIGH to LOW transition on this signal starts the read cycle.
                                     The SC16C850SV reads a byte from the internal register and puts the byte on the data bus
                                     for the host to retrieve.
 IOW           12           I        Write strobe (active LOW). A HIGH to LOW transition on this signal starts the write cycle,
                                     and a LOW to HIGH transition transfers the data on the data bus to the internal register.
 LLA           19           I        Latch Lower Address (active LOW). A logic LOW on this pin puts the VLIO interface in the
                                     address phase of the transaction, where the lower 8 bits of the VLIO (specifying the UART
                                     register and the channel address) are loaded into the address latch of the device through
                                     the AD7 to AD0 bus. A logic HIGH puts the VLIO interface in the data phase where data can
                                     are transferred between the host and the UART.
 LOWPWR 9                   I        Low Power. When asserted (active HIGH), the device immediately goes into low-power
                                     mode. The oscillator is shut-off and some host interface pins are isolated from the host’s bus
                                     to reduce power consumption. The device only returns to normal mode when the LOWPWR
                                     pin is de-asserted. On the negative edge of a de-asserting LOWPWR signal, the device is
                                     automatically reset and all registers return to their default reset states. This pin has an
                                     internal pull-down resistor, therefore, it can be left unconnected.

 RI            27           I        Ring Indicator (active LOW). A logic 0 on this pin indicates the modem has received a
                                     ringing signal from the telephone line. A logic 1 transition on this input pin will generate an
                                     interrupt is modem status interrupt is enabled. Status can be tested by reading MCR[6].
 RTS           21           O        Request to Send (active LOW). A logic 0 on the RTS pin indicates the transmitter has data
                                     ready and waiting to send. Writing a logic 1 in the modem control register MCR[1] will set
                                     this pin to a logic 0, indicating data is available. After a reset this pin will be set to a logic 1.

                                     receiving data. During the local Loopback mode, the RX input pin is disabled and TX data is
                                     connected to the UART RX input internally.
 TX            7            O        UART transmit data. The TX signal will be a logic 1 during reset, idle (no data), or when the

                                      Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
6. Functional description
                       The SC16C850SV provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization,
                       parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and
                       receiver sections. These functions are necessary for converting the serial data stream into
                       parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization for the serial data
                       stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to form a data
                       character (character orientated protocol). Data integrity is ensured by attaching a parity bit
                       to the data character. The parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit
                       errors. The electronic circuitry to provide all these functions is fairly complex, especially
                       when manufactured on a single integrated silicon chip. The SC16C850SV represents
                       such an integration with greatly enhanced features. The SC16C850SV is fabricated with
                       an advanced CMOS process.
                       The SC16C850SV is an upward solution to the SC16C650B with a VLIO interface that
                       provides a single UART capability with 128 bytes of transmit and receive FIFO memory,
                       instead of 32 bytes for the SC16C650B. The SC16C850SV is designed to work with high
                       speed modems and shared network environments that require fast data processing time.
                       Increased performance is realized in the SC16C850SV by the transmit and receive
                       FIFOs. This allows the external processor to handle more networking tasks within a given
                       time. In addition, the four selectable receive and transmit FIFO trigger interrupt levels are
                       provided in normal mode, or 128 programmable levels are provided in extended mode for
                       maximum data throughput performance especially when operating in a multi-channel
                       environment (see Section 6.2 “Extended mode (128-byte FIFO)”). The FIFO memory
                       greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of the external controlling CPU, and increases
                       performance.
                       A low power pin (LOWPWR) is provided to further reduce power consumption by isolating
                       the host interface bus.
                       The SC16C850SV is capable of operation up to 20 Mbit/s with an external 80 MHz clock.
                       With a 24 MHz crystal, the SC16C850SV is capable of operation up to 6 Mbit/s.
                       The rich feature set of the SC16C850SV is available through internal registers. These
                       features are: selectable and programmable receive and transmit FIFO trigger levels,
                       selectable TX and RX baud rates, and modem interface controls (all standard features).
                       Following a power-on reset an external reset or a software reset, the SC16C850SV is
                       software compatible with the previous generation SC16C650B.
                   6.1 UART selection
                       The UART provides the user with the capability to bidirectionally transfer information
                       between a CPU and an external serial device. The CS pin together with addresses A6 and
                       A7 determine if the UART is being accessed; see Table 3.
                       Table 3.    Serial port selection
                       H = HIGH; L = LOW; X = Don’t care.

                                       Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                   6.2 Extended mode (128-byte FIFO)
                       The device is in the extended mode when any of these four registers contains any value
                       other than 0: FLWCNTH, FLWCNTL, TXINTLVL, RXINTLVL.
                   6.3 Internal registers
                       The SC16C850SV provides a set of 25 internal registers for monitoring and controlling the
                       functions of the UART. These registers are shown in Table 4.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                          SC16C850SV
                                          Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                       [2]  These registers are accessible only when LCR[7] is a logic 1.
                       [3]  Second special registers are accessible only when EFCR[0] = 1.
                       [4]  Enhanced feature registers are only accessible when LCR = 0xBF.
                       [5]  First extra feature registers are only accessible when EFCR[2:1] = 01b.
                       [6]  Second extra feature registers are only accessible when EFCR[2:1] = 10b.
                   6.4 FIFO operation
                6.4.1 32-byte FIFO mode
                       When all four of these registers (TXINTLVL, RXINTLVL, FLWCNTH, FLWCNTL) in the
                       First Extra Register Set are empty (0x00) the transmit and receive trigger levels are set by
                       FCR[7:4]. In this mode the transmit and receive trigger levels are backward compatible to
                       the SC16C650B (see Table 5), and the FIFO sizes are 32 entries. The transmit and
                       receive data FIFOs are enabled by the FIFO Control Register bit 0 (FCR[0]). It should be
                       noted that the user can set the transmit trigger levels by writing to the FCR, but activation
                       will not take place until EFR[4] is set to a logic 1. The receiver FIFO section includes a
                       time-out function to ensure data is delivered to the external CPU (see Section 6.8). Please
                       refer to Table 10 and Table 11 for the setting of FCR[7:4].

                6.4.2 128-byte FIFO mode
                       When either TXINTLVL, RXINTLVL, FLWCNTH or FLWCNTL in the First Extra Register
                       Set contains any value other than 0x00, the transmit and receive trigger levels are set by
                       TXINTLVL and RXINTLVL registers. TXINTLVL sets the trigger levels for the transmit
                       FIFO, and the transmit trigger levels can be set to any value between 1 and 128 with
                       granularity of 1. RXINTLVL sets the trigger levels for the receive FIFO, the receive trigger
                       levels can be set to any value between 1 and 128 with granularity of 1.
                       When the effective FIFO size changes (that is, when FCR[0] toggles or when the
                       combined content of TXINTLVL, RXINTLVL, FLWCNTH and FLWCNTL changes between
                       equal and unequal to 0x00), both RX FIFO and TX FIFO will be reset (data in the FIFO will
                       be lost).
                   6.5 Hardware flow control
                       When automatic hardware flow control is enabled, the SC16C850SV monitors the CTS
                       pin for a remote buffer overflow indication and controls the RTS pin for local buffer
                       overflows. Automatic hardware flow control is selected by setting EFR[6] (RTS) and
                       EFR[7] (CTS) to a logic 1. If CTS transitions from a logic 0 to a logic 1 indicating a flow
                       control request, ISR[5] will be set to a logic 1 (if enabled via IER[7:6]), and the
                       SC16C850SV will suspend TX transmissions as soon as the stop bit of the character in
                       process is shifted out. Transmission is resumed after the CTS input returns to a logic 0,
                       indicating more data may be sent.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  SC16C850SV
                                       Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                       When AFCR1[2] is set to 1, then the function of CTS pin is mapped to the DSR pin, and
                       the function of RTS is mapped to DTR pin. DSR and DTR pins will behave as described
                       above for CTS and RTS.
                       With the automatic hardware flow control function enabled, an interrupt is generated when
                       the receive FIFO reaches the programmed trigger level. The RTS (or DTR) pin will not be
                       forced to a logic 1 (RTS off) until the receive FIFO reaches the next trigger level. However,
                       the RTS (or DTR) pin will return to a logic 0 after the receive buffer (FIFO) is unloaded to
                       the next trigger level below the programmed trigger level. Under the above described
                       conditions, the SC16C850SV will continue to accept data until the receive FIFO is full.
                       When TXINTLVL, RXINTLVL, FLWCNTH and FLWCNTL in the First Extra Register Set
                       are all zeroes, the hardware and software flow control trigger levels are set by FCR[7:4];
                       see Table 5.
                       When either TXINTLVL, RXINTLVL, FLWCNTH or FLWCNTL in the First Extra Register
                       Set contains any value other than 0x00, the hardware and software flow control trigger
                       levels are set by FLWCNTH and FLWCNTL. The content in FLWCNTH determines how
                       many bytes are in the receive FIFO before RTS (or DTR) is de-asserted or Xoff is sent.
                       The content of FLWCNTL determines how many bytes are in the receive FIFO before
                       RTS (or DTR) is asserted, or Xon is sent.
                       In 128-byte FIFO mode, hardware and software flow control trigger levels can be set to
                       any value between 1 and 128 in granularity of 1. The value of FLWCNTH should always
                       be greater than FLWCNTL. The UART does not check for this condition automatically, and
                       if this condition is not met spurious operation of the device might occur. When using
                       FLWCNTH and FWLCNTL, these registers must be initialized to the proper values before
                       hardware or software flow control is enabled via the EFR register.
                   6.6 Software flow control
                       When software flow control is enabled, the SC16C850SV compares one or two
                       sequentially received data characters with the programmed Xon or Xoff character
                       value(s). If the received character(s) match the programmed Xoff values, the
                       SC16C850SV will halt transmission (TX) as soon as the current character(s) has
                       completed transmission. When a match occurs, ISR bit 4 will be set (if enabled via IER[5])
                       and the interrupt output pin (if receive interrupt is enabled) will be activated. Following a
                       suspension due to a match of the Xoff characters’ values, the SC16C850SV will monitor
                       the receive data stream for a match to the Xon1/Xon2 character value(s). If a match is
                       found, the SC16C850SV will resume operation and clear the flags (ISR[4]).
                       Reset initially sets the contents of the Xon/Xoff 8-bit flow control registers to a logic 0.
                       Following reset, the user can write any Xon/Xoff value desired for software flow control.
                       Different conditions can be set to detect Xon/Xoff characters and suspend/resume
                       transmissions (see Table 24). When double 8-bit Xon/Xoff characters are selected, the
                       SC16C850SV compares two consecutive receive characters with two software flow
                       control 8-bit values (Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2) and controls TX transmissions accordingly.
                       Under the above described flow control mechanisms, flow control characters are not
                       placed (stacked) in the receive FIFO. When using software flow control, the Xon/Xoff
                       characters cannot be used for data transfer.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  SC16C850SV
                                       Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                       In the event that the receive buffer is overfilling, the SC16C850SV automatically sends an
                       Xoff character (when enabled) via the serial TX output to the remote UART. The
                       SC16C850SV sends the Xoff1/Xoff2 characters as soon as the number of received data in
                       the receive FIFO passes the programmed trigger level. To clear this condition, the
                       SC16C850SV will transmit the programmed Xon1/Xon2 characters as soon as the
                       number of characters in the receive FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
                   6.7 Special character detect
                       A special character detect feature is provided to detect an 8-bit character when EFR[5] is
                       set. When an 8-bit character is detected, it will be placed on the user-accessible data
                       stack along with normal incoming RX data. This condition is selected in conjunction with
                       EFR[3:0] (see Table 24). Note that software flow control should be turned off when using
                       this special mode by setting EFR[3:0] to all zeroes.
                       The SC16C850SV compares each incoming receive character with Xoff2 data. If a match
                       occurs, the received data will be transferred to the FIFO, and ISR[4] will be set to indicate
                       detection of a special character. Although Table 7 “SC16C850SV internal registers” shows
                       Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2 with eight bits of character information, the actual number of bits
                       is dependent on the programmed word length. Line Control Register bits LCR[1:0] define
                       the number of character bits, that is, either 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits or 8 bits. The word length
                       selected by LCR[1:0] also determine the number of bits that will be used for the special
                       character comparison. Bit 0 in the Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2 registers corresponds with the
                       LSB bit for the received character.
                   6.8 Interrupt priority and time-out interrupts
                       The interrupts are enabled by IER[7:0]. Care must be taken when handling these
                       interrupts. Following a reset, if Interrupt Enable Register (IER) bit 1 = 1, the SC16C850SV
                       will issue a Transmit Holding Register interrupt. This interrupt must be serviced prior to
                       continuing operations. The ISR indicates the current singular highest priority interrupt
                       only. A condition can exist where a higher priority interrupt masks the lower priority
                       interrupt(s) (see Table 12). Only after servicing the higher pending interrupt will the lower
                       priority interrupt(s) be reflected in the status register. Servicing the interrupt without
                       investigating further interrupt conditions can result in data errors.
                       Receive Data Ready and Receive Time Out have the same interrupt priority (when
                       enabled by IER[0]), and it is important to serve these interrupts correctly. The receiver
                       issues an interrupt after the number of characters have reached the programmed trigger
                       level. In this case, the SC16C850SV FIFO may hold more characters than the
                       programmed trigger level. Following the removal of a data byte, the user should re-check
                       LSR[0] to see if there are any additional characters. A Receive Time Out will not occur if
                       the receive FIFO is empty. The time-out counter is reset at the center of each stop bit
                       received or each time the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is read. The actual time-out
                       value is 4 character time, including data information length, start bit, parity bit, and the size
                       of stop bit, that is, 1, 1.5, or 2 bit times.

                                       Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                   6.9 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C850SV UART contains a programmable rational baud rate generator that
                       takes any clock input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1 and (216  1). The
                       SC16C850SV offers the capability of dividing the input frequency by rational divisor. The
                       fractional part of the divisor is controlled by the CLKPRES register in the First Extra
                       Register Set.
                                                                           f XTAL1

                       where:
                          N is the integer part of the divisor in DLL and DLM registers;
                          M is the fractional part of the divisor in CLKPRES register;
                          fXTAL1 is the clock frequency at XTAL1 pin;
                          SAMPR is the sampling rate in SAMPR register (16, 8, 4); M / SAMPR should
                          always be less than 1.
                       Prescaler = 1 when MCR[7] is set to 0.
                       Prescaler = 4 when MCR[7] is set to 1.

                       A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver. The
                       programmable Baud Rate Generator is capable of operating with a frequency of up to
                       80 MHz. To obtain maximum data rate, it is necessary to use full rail swing on the clock
                       input. The SC16C850SV can be configured for internal or external clock operation. For
                       internal clock operation, an industry standard crystal is connected externally between the
                       XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 4). Alternatively, an external clock can be connected
                       to the XTAL1 pin (see Figure 5) to clock the internal baud rate generator for standard or
                       custom rates (see Table 6).
                       The generator divides the input 16 clock by any divisor from 1 to (216  1). The
                       SC16C850SV divides the basic external clock by 16. The baud rate is configured via the
                       CLKPRES, DLL and DLM internal register functions. Customized baud rates can be
                       achieved by selecting the proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB sections of baud
                       rate generator. However, the user can also select 8, 4 sampling rate to operate at four
                       times, or two times faster than the 16 sampling rate (see Section 7.20 “Sampling rate
                       (SAMPR)”).

                             If fXTAL1 frequency is greater than 50 MHz, then a DC blocking capacitor is required.
                             XTAL2 pin should be left unconnected when an external clock is used.

                6.10 Loopback mode
                     The internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. In the Loopback mode, the
                     normal modem interface pins are disconnected and reconfigured for loopback internally
                     (see Figure 6). MCR[3:0] register bits are used for controlling loopback diagnostic testing.
                     In the Loopback mode, the transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX) are
                     disconnected from their associated interface pins, and instead are connected together
                     internally. The CTS, DSR, CD, and RI are disconnected from their normal modem control
                     inputs pins, and instead are connected internally to RTS, DTR, MCR[3] (OP2) and MCR[2]
                     (OP1). Loopback test data is entered into the transmit holding register via the user data
                     bus interface, AD[7:0]. The transmit UART serializes the data and passes the serial data
                     to the receive UART via the internal loopback connection. The receive UART converts the
                     serial data back into parallel data that is then made available at the user data interface
                     AD[7:0]. The user optionally compares the received data to the initial transmitted data for
                     verifying error-free operation of the UART TX/RX circuits.
                     In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The modem
                     control interrupts are also operational.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                 SC16C850SV
                                     Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                 6.11 Sleep mode
                      Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the SC16C850SV UART. It is enabled when
                      EFR[4], the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] bit is also set.
               6.11.1 Conditions to enter Sleep mode
                      Sleep mode is entered when:
                        • Modem input pins are not toggling.
                        • The serial data input line, RX, is idle for 4 character time (logic HIGH) and AFCR1[4]
                           is 0. When AFCR1[4] is 1, the device will go to sleep regardless of the state of the RX
                           pin (see Section 7.22 for the description of AFCR1 bit 4).
                        • The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
                        • There are no interrupts pending.
                        • The RX FIFO is empty.
                      In Sleep mode, the UART clock and baud rate clock are stopped. Since most registers are
                      clocked using these clocks, the power consumption is greatly reduced.
                      Remark: Writing to the divisor latches, DLL and DLM, to set the baud clock, must not be
                      done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advisable to disable Sleep mode using IER[4]
                      before writing to DLL or DLM.
               6.11.2 Conditions to resume normal operation
                      SC16C850SV resumes normal operation by any of the following:
                        • Receives a start bit on RX pin.
                        • Data is loaded into transmit FIFO.
                        • A change of state on any of the modem input pins.
                      If the device is awakened by one of the conditions described above, it will return to the
                      Sleep mode automatically after all the conditions described in Section 6.11.1 are met. The
                      device will stay in Sleep mode until it is disabled by setting any channel’s IER bit 4 to a
                      logic 0.
                      When the SC16C850SV is in Sleep mode and the host interface bus (AD7 to AD0, IOW,
                      IOR, CS) remains in steady state, either HIGH or LOW, the sleep current will be in the
                      microampere range as specified in Table 37 “Static characteristics”. If any of these signals
                      is toggling or floating then the sleep current will be higher.
                6.12 Low power feature
                      A low power feature is provided by the SC16C850SV to prevent the switching of the host
                      data bus from influencing the sleep current. When the pin LOWPWR is activated (logic
                      HIGH), the device immediately and unconditionally goes into Low Power mode. All clocks
                      are stopped and most host interface pins are isolated to reduce power consumption. The
                      device only returns to normal mode when the LOWPWR pin is de-asserted. The pin can
                      be left unconnected because it has an internal pull-down resistor.

                                       Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
                 6.13 RS-485 Features
               6.13.1 Auto RS-485 RTS control
                       Normally the RTS pin is controlled by MCR bit 1, or if hardware flow control is enabled, the
                       logic state of the RTS pin is controlled by the hardware flow control circuitry. EFCR2
                       register bit 4 will take the precedence over the other two modes; once this bit is set, the
                       transmitter will control the state of the RTS pin. The transmitter automatically asserts the
                       RTS pin (logic 0) once the host writes data to the transmit FIFO, and de-asserts the RTS
                       pin (logic 1) once the last bit of the data has been transmitted.
                       To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode, the software would have to disable the hardware flow
                       control function.
               6.13.2 RS-485 RTS inversion
                       EFCR2 bit 5 reverses the polarity of the RTS pin if the UART is in auto RS-485 RTS
                       mode.
                       When the transmitter has data to be sent, it will de-assert the RTS pin (logic 1), and when
                       the last bit of the data has been sent out, the transmitter asserts the RTS pin (logic 0).
               6.13.3 Auto 9-bit mode (RS-485)
                       EFCR2 bit 0 is used to enable the 9-bit mode (Multi-drop or RS-485 mode). In this mode
                       of operation, a ‘master’ station transmits an address character followed by data characters
                       for the addressed ‘slave’ stations. The slave stations examine the received data and
                       interrupt the controller if the received character is an address character (parity bit = 1).
                       To use the auto 9-bit mode the software would have to disable the hardware and software
                       flow control functions.
              6.13.3.1 Normal Multi-drop mode
                       The 9-bit Mode in EFCR (bit 0) is enabled, but not Special Character Detect (EFR bit 5).
                       The receiver is set to Force Parity 0 (LCR[5:3] = 111) in order to detect address bytes.
                       With the receiver initially disabled, it ignores all the data bytes (parity bit = 0) until an
                       address byte is received (parity bit = 1). This address byte will cause the UART to set the
                       parity error. The UART will generate a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to ‘1’ at
                       this time), and at the same time puts this address byte in the RX FIFO. After the controller
                       examines the byte it must make a decision whether or not to enable the receiver; it should
                       enable the receiver if the address byte addresses its ID address, and must not enable the
                       receiver if the address byte does not address its ID address.
                       If the controller enables the receiver, the receiver will receive the subsequent data until
                       being disabled by the controller after the controller has received a complete message
                       from the ‘master’ station. If the controller does not disable the receiver after receiving a
                       message from the ‘master’ station, the receiver will generate a parity error upon receiving
                       another address byte. The controller then determines if the address byte addresses its ID
                       address, if it is not, the controller then can disable the receiver. If the address byte
                       addresses the ‘slave’ ID address, the controller take no further action, the receiver will
                       receive the subsequent data.

                                       Single UART with 128-byte FIFOs, IrDA, and XScale VLIO bus interface
              6.13.3.2 Auto address detection
                       If Special Character Detect is enabled (EFR[5] is set and the Xoff2 register contains the
                       address byte), the receiver will try to detect an address byte that matches the
                       programmed character in the Xoff2 register. If the received byte is a data byte or an
                       address byte that does not match the programmed character in the Xoff2 register, the
                       receiver will discard these data. Upon receiving an address byte that matches the Xoff2
                       character, the receiver will be automatically enabled if not already enabled, and the
                       address character is pushed into the RX FIFO along with the parity bit (in place of the
                       parity error bit). The receiver also generates a line status interrupt (IER[2] must be set to
                       logic 1 at this time). The receiver will then receive the subsequent data from the ‘master’
                       station until being disabled by the controller after having received a message from the
                       ‘master’ station.
                       If another address byte is received and this address byte does not match Xoff2 character,
                       the receiver will be automatically disabled and the address byte is ignored. If the address
                       byte matches Xoff2 character, the receiver will put this byte in the RX FIFO along with the
                       parity bit in the parity error bit (LSR bit 2).

                   7.1 Transmit and Receive Holding Registers (THR and RHR)
                       The serial transmitter section consists of an 8-bit Transmit Holding Register (THR) and
                       Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The status of the THR is provided in the Line Status
                       Register (LSR). Writing to the THR transfers the contents of the data bus (AD7 to AD0) to
                       the transmit FIFO. The THR empty flag in the LSR will be set to a logic 1 when the
                       transmit FIFO is empty or when data is transferred to the TSR.
                       The serial receive section also contains an 8-bit Receive Holding Register (RHR) and a
                       Receive Serial Shift Register (RSR). Receive data is removed from the SC16C850SV
                       receive FIFO by reading the RHR. The receive section provides a mechanism to prevent
                       false starts. On the falling edge of a start or false start bit, an internal receiver counter
                       starts counting clocks at the sampling rate. After SAMPR⁄2 clocks (SAMPR is the sampling
                       rate of 16, 8, or 4), the start bit time should be shifted to the center of the start bit. At
                       this time the start bit is sampled, and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated. Evaluating the start
                       bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false character. Receiver status
                       codes will be posted in the LSR.
                   7.2 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                       The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receiver ready, transmitter
                       empty, line status and modem status registers. These interrupts would normally be seen
                       on the INT output pin.

                       1      IER[1]    Transmit Holding Register interrupt. In the non-FIFO mode, this interrupt will be
                                        issued whenever the THR is empty, and is associated with LSR[5]. In the FIFO
                                        modes, this interrupt will be issued whenever the FIFO is empty.

                       0      IER[0]    Receive Holding Register. In the non-FIFO mode, this interrupt will be issued
                                        when the RHR has data, or is cleared when the RHR is empty. In the FIFO mode,
                                        this interrupt will be issued when the FIFO has reached the programmed trigger
                                        level or is cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                                              logic 0 = disable the receiver ready (ISR level 2, RXRDY) interrupt (normal
                                              default condition)
                                              logic 1 = enable the RXRDY (ISR level 2) interrupt
                7.2.1 IER versus transmit/receive FIFO interrupt mode operation
                      When the receive FIFO is enabled (FCR[0] = logic 1), and receive interrupts
                      (IER[0] = logic 1) are enabled, the receive interrupts and register status will reflect the
                      following:
                        • The receive RXRDY interrupt (Level 2 ISR interrupt) is issued to the external CPU
                           when the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level. It will be cleared
                           when the receive FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
                        • Receive FIFO status will also be reflected in the user accessible ISR register when
                           the receive FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register receive status bit and
                           the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                        • The receive data ready bit (LSR[0]) is set as soon as a character is transferred from
                           the shift register (RSR) to the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
                        • When the Transmit FIFO and interrupts are enabled, an interrupt is generated when
                           the transmit FIFO is empty due to the unloading of the data by the TSR and UART for
                           transmission via the transmission media. The interrupt is cleared either by reading the
                           ISR, or by loading the THR with new data characters.
                7.2.2 IER versus receive/transmit FIFO polled mode operation
                      When FCR[0] = logic 1, setting IER[3:0] = zeroes puts the SC16C850SV in the FIFO
                      polled mode of operation. In this mode, interrupts are not generated and the user must
                      poll the LSR register for TX and/or RX data status. Since the receiver and transmitter have
                      separate bits in the LSR either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting
                      respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
                        •  LSR[0] will be a logic 1 as long as there is one byte in the receive FIFO.
                        •  LSR[4:1] will provide the type of receive errors, or a receive break, if encountered.
                        •  LSR[5] will indicate when the transmit FIFO is empty.
                        •  LSR[6] will indicate when both the transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are empty.
                        •  LSR[7] will show if any FIFO data errors occurred.

                   7.4 Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
                       The SC16C850SV provides six levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external
                       software interaction. The Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with six
                       interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR will provide the user with the
                       highest pending interrupt level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowledged until
                       the pending interrupt is serviced. A lower level interrupt may be seen after servicing the
                       higher level interrupt and re-reading the interrupt status bits. Table 12 “Interrupt source”
                       shows the data values (bits 5:0) for the six prioritized interrupt levels and the interrupt
                       sources associated with each of these interrupt levels.

                                                     used in the non-FIFO mode. They are set to a logic 1 when the FIFOs are
                                                     enabled in the SC16C850SV mode.

                        5:4      ISR[5:4]            INT priority bits 4:3. These bits are enabled when EFR[4] is set to a logic 1.
                                                     ISR[4] indicates that matching Xoff character(s) have been detected. ISR[5]
                                                     indicates that CTS, RTS have been generated. Note that once set to a
                                                     logic 1, the ISR[4] bit will stay a logic 1 until Xon character(s) are received.

                                                        pointer to the appropriate interrupt service routine
                                                        logic 1 = no interrupt pending (normal default condition)
                   7.5 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       The Line Control Register is used to specify the asynchronous data communication
                       format. The word length, the number of stop bits, and the parity are selected by writing the
                       appropriate bits in this register.
                       Table 14.   Line Control Register bits description

                        6      LCR[6]           Set break. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to be
                                                transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This condition exists
                                                until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.

                        2      LCR[2]           Stop bits. The length of stop bit is specified by this bit in conjunction with the
                                                programmed word length (see Table 16).

                        1:0    LCR[1:0]         Word length bits 1, 0. These two bits specify the word length to be transmitted
                                                or received (see Table 17).

                       This register controls the interface with the modem or a peripheral device.

                       Bit   Symbol       Description

                                               logic 0 = enable the standard modem receive and transmit input/output
                                               interface (normal default condition)
                                               logic 1 = enable infrared IrDA receive and transmit inputs/outputs. While in
                                               this mode, the TX/RX output/inputs are routed to the infrared
                                               encoder/decoder. The data input and output levels will conform to the IrDA
                                               infrared interface requirement. As such, while in this mode, the infrared TX
                                               output will be a logic 0 during idle data conditions.

                       4     MCR[4]       Loopback. Enable the local Loopback mode (diagnostics). In this mode the
                                          transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX), CTS, DSR, CD, and RI are
                                          disconnected from the SC16C850SV I/O pins. Internally the modem data and
                                          control pins are connected into a loopback data configuration (see Figure 6). In
                                          this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts remain fully operational. The
                                          Modem Control Interrupts are also operational, but the interrupts’ sources are
                                          switched to the lower four bits of the Modem Control. Interrupts continue to be
                                          controlled by the IER register.
                                               logic 0 = disable Loopback mode (normal default condition)
                                               logic 1 = enable local Loopback mode (diagnostics)
                       3     MCR[3]       OP2. This bit is used for internal Loopback mode only. In Loopback mode, this
                                          bit is used to write the state of the modem CD interface signal.
                       2     MCR[2]       OP1. This bit is used for internal Loopback mode only. In Loopback mode, this
                                          bit is used to write the state of the modem RI interface signal.

                       This register provides the status of data transfers between the SC16C850SV and
                       the CPU.
                       Table 20.  Line Status Register bits description
                        Bit  Symbol Description
                        7    LSR[7]    FIFO data error.
                                           logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = at least one parity error, framing error or break indication is in the
                                           current FIFO data. This bit is cleared when there are no remaining error flags
                                           associated with the remaining data in the FIFO.
                        6    LSR[6]    THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator. This bit is set to a
                                       logic 1 whenever the transmit holding register and the transmit shift register are
                                       both empty. It is reset to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a data
                                       character. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set to logic 1 whenever the transmit FIFO
                                       and transmit shift register are both empty.
                        5    LSR[5]    THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit
                                       indicates that the UART is ready to accept a new character for transmission. In
                                       addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to CPU when the THR
                                       interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
                                       transferred from the transmit holding register into the transmitter shift register. The
                                       bit is reset to a logic 0 concurrently with the loading of the transmitter holding
                                       register by the CPU. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is
                                       empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the transmit FIFO.
                        4    LSR[4]    Break interrupt.
                                           logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = the receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one
                                           character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded
                                           into the FIFO.
                        3    LSR[3]    Framing error.
                                           logic 0 = no framing error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). In
                                           the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the top of the FIFO.
                        2    LSR[2]    Parity error.
                                           logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition
                                           logic 1 = parity error. The receive character does not have correct parity
                                           information and is suspect. In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the
                                           character at the top of the FIFO.
                        1    LSR[1]    Overrun error.
                                           logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = overrun error. A data overrun error occurred in the Receive Shift
                                           Register. This happens when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In this
                                           case, the previous data in the shift register is overwritten. Note that under this
                                           condition, the data byte in the Receive Shift Register is not transferred into the
                                           FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.

                   7.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This register shares the same address as EFCR register. This is a read-only register and
                       it provides the current state of the control interface signals from the modem, or other
                       peripheral device to which the SC16C850SV is connected. Four bits of this register are
                       used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a
                       control input from the modem changes state. These bits are set to a logic 0 whenever the
                       CPU reads this register.
                       When write, the data will be written to EFCR register.

                                             this bit in the loopback mode produces the state of MCR[2] (OP1).
                        5      MSR[5]        DSR. During normal operation, this bit is the complement of the DSR input.
                                             During the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to MCR[0] (DTR).
                        4      MSR[4]        CTS. During normal operation, this bit is the complement of the CTS input.

                7.10 Scratchpad Register (SPR)
                       The SC16C850SV provides a temporary data register to store 8 bits of user information.
                 7.11 Division Latch (DLL and DLM)
                       These are two 8-bit registers which store the 16-bit divisor for generation of the baud clock
                       in the baud rate generator. DLM stores the most significant part of the divisor. DLL stores
                       the least significant part of the divisor.
                7.12 Transmit FIFO Level Count (TXLVLCNT)
                       This register is a read-only register. It reports the number of spaces available in the
                       transmit FIFO.
                7.13 Receive FIFO Level Count (RXLVLCNT)
                       This register is a read-only register. It reports the fill level of the receive FIFO (the number
                       of characters in the RXFIFO).

                                         generated when the receive FIFO is filled to the programmed trigger level and
                                         RTS will go to a logic 1 at the next trigger level. RTS will return to a logic 0 when
                                         data is unloaded below the next lower trigger level (programmed trigger level 1).
                                         The state of this register bit changes with the status of the hardware flow
                                         control. RTS functions normally when hardware flow control is disabled.
                                              logic 0 = automatic RTS flow control is disabled (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = enable automatic RTS flow control
                      5      EFR[5]      Special Character Detect.
                                              logic 0 = special character detect disabled (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = special character detect enabled. The SC16C850SV compares each
                                              incoming receive character with Xoff2 data. If a match exists, the received
                                              data will be transferred to FIFO and ISR[4] will be set to indicate detection of
                                              special character. Bit-0 in the X-registers corresponds with the LSB bit for the
                                              receive character. When this feature is enabled, the normal software flow
                                              control must be disabled (EFR[3:0] must be set to a logic 0).
                      4      EFR[4]      Enhanced function control bit. The content of IER[7:4], ISR[5:4], FCR[5:4], and
                                         MCR[7:5] can be modified and latched. After modifying any bits in the enhanced
                                         registers, EFR[4] can be set to a logic 0 to latch the new values. This feature
                                         prevents existing software from altering or overwriting the SC16C850SV
                                         enhanced functions.
                                              logic 0 = disable/latch enhanced features[1]
                                              logic 1 = enables the enhanced functions[1]. When this bit is set to a logic 1,
                                              all enhanced features of the SC16C850SV are enabled and user settings
                                              stored during a reset will be restored.
                      3:0    EFR[3:0] Cont-3:0 Tx, Rx control. Logic 0 or cleared is the default condition.
                                         Combinations of software flow control can be selected by programming these
                                         bits. See Table 24.

                     line driver, after the last bit of data has been shifted out of the transmit shift register the
                     UART will count down the value in this register. When the count value reaches zero, the
                     UART will assert the RTS or DTR pin (logic 0) to turn the external RS-485 transceiver
                     around for receiving.

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 16) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
