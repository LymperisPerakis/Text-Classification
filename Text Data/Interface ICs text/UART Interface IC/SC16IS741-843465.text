                 Rev. 01 — 29 April 2010                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
              The SC16IS741 is a slave I2C-bus/SPI interface to a single-channel high performance
              UART. It offers data rates up to 5 Mbit/s and guarantees low operating and sleeping
              current. The device comes in the TSSOP16 package, which makes it ideally suitable for
              handheld, battery operated applications. This device enables seamless protocol
              conversion from I2C-bus or SPI to and RS-232/RS-485 and are fully bidirectional.
              The SC16IS741’s internal register set is backward-compatible with the widely used and
              widely popular 16C450. This allows the software to be easily written or ported from
              another platform.
              The SC16IS741 also provides additional advanced features such as auto hardware and
              software flow control, automatic RS-485 support, and software reset. This allows the
              software to reset the UART at any moment, independent of the hardware reset signal.

7. Functional description
                   The UART will perform serial-to-I2C conversion on data characters received from
                   peripheral devices or modems, and I2C-to-serial conversion on data characters
                   transmitted by the host. The complete status the SC16IS741 UART can be read at any
                   time during functional operation by the host.
                   The SC16IS741 can be placed in an alternate mode (FIFO mode) relieving the host of
                   excessive software overhead by buffering received/transmitted characters. Both the
                   receiver and transmitter FIFOs can store up to 64 characters (including three additional
                   bits of error status per character for the receiver FIFO) and have selectable or
                   programmable trigger levels.
                   The SC16IS741 has selectable hardware flow control and software flow control. Hardware
                   flow control significantly reduces software overhead and increases system efficiency by
                   automatically controlling serial data flow using the RTS output and CTS input signals.
                   Software flow control automatically controls data flow by using programmable Xon/Xoff
                   characters.
                   The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that can divide the timing
                   reference clock input by a divisor between 1 and (216 – 1).

                                              Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                   7.1 Trigger levels
                       The SC16IS741 provides independently selectable and programmable trigger levels for
                       both receiver and transmitter interrupt generation. After reset, both transmitter and
                       receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of one
                       character. The selectable trigger levels are available via the FCR. The programmable
                       trigger levels are available via the TLR. If TLR bits are cleared then selectable trigger level
                       in FCR is used. If TLR bits are not cleared then programmable trigger level in TLR is used.
                   7.2 Hardware flow control
                       Hardware flow control is comprised of auto CTS and auto RTS (see Figure 4). Auto CTS
                       and auto RTS can be enabled/disabled independently by programming EFR[7:6].
                       With auto CTS, CTS must be active before the UART can transmit data.
                       Auto RTS only activates the RTS output when there is enough room in the FIFO to receive
                       data and de-activates the RTS output when the RX FIFO is sufficiently full. The halt and
                       resume trigger levels in the TCR determine the levels at which RTS is
                       activated/deactivated. If TCR bits are cleared then selectable trigger levels in FCR are
                       used in place of TCR.
                       If both auto CTS and auto RTS are enabled, when RTS is connected to CTS, data
                       transmission does not occur unless the receiver FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun
                       errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if
                       the transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

                                                           Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                    7.2.1 Auto RTS
                               Figure 5 shows RTS functional timing. The receiver FIFO trigger levels used in auto RTS
                               are stored in the TCR or FCR. RTS is active if the RX FIFO level is below the halt trigger
                               level in TCR[3:0]. When the receiver FIFO halt trigger level is reached, RTS is deasserted.
                               The sending device (for example, another UART) may send an additional character after
                               the trigger level is reached (assuming the sending UART has another character to send)
                               because it may not recognize the deassertion of RTS until it has begun sending the
                               additional character. RTS is automatically reasserted once the receiver FIFO reaches the
                               resume trigger level programmed via TCR[7:4]. This re-assertion allows the sending
                               device to resume transmission.

                    7.2.2 Auto CTS
                               Figure 6 shows CTS functional timing. The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before
                               sending the next data byte. When CTS is active, the transmitter sends the next byte. To
                               stop the transmitter from sending the following byte, CTS must be deasserted before the
                               middle of the last stop bit that is currently being sent. The auto CTS function reduces
                               interrupts to the host system. When flow control is enabled, CTS level changes do not
                               trigger host interrupts because the device automatically controls its own transmitter.
                               Without auto CTS, the transmitter sends any data present in the transmit FIFO and a
                               receiver overrun error may result.

         (1) When CTS is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
         (2) When CTS goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current character, the transmitter finishes sending the current
             character, but it does not send the next character.
         (3) When CTS goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

                   7.3 Software flow control
                       Software flow control is enabled through the enhanced feature register and the Modem
                       Control Register. Different combinations of software flow control can be enabled by setting
                       different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 3 shows software flow control options.

                                                                       receiver compares Xon1 and Xon2, Xoff1 and Xoff2

                       There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
                         • Xon Any function (MCR[5]): Receiving any character will resume operation after
                            recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that an Xon1 character is recognized as
                            an Xon Any character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be written to the RX
                            FIFO.
                         • Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the
                            special character sets the Xoff interrupt (IIR[4]) but does not halt transmission. The
                            Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR. The special character is transferred to the
                            RX FIFO.
                7.3.1 RX
                       When software flow control operation is enabled, the SC16IS741 will compare incoming
                       data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in certain cases, Xoff1 and Xoff2 must be
                       received sequentially). When the correct Xoff characters are received, transmission is
                       halted after completing transmission of the current character. Xoff detection also sets
                       IIR[4] (if enabled via IER[5]) and causes IRQ to go LOW.
                       To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases
                       Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xon characters are
                       received, IIR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                             SC16IS741
                                               Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                7.3.2 TX
                      Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO has passed the HALT trigger level
                      programmed in TCR[3:0] or the selectable trigger level in FCR[7:6]
                      Xon1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO reaches the RESUME trigger level
                      programmed in TCR[7:4] or RX FIFO falls below the lower selectable trigger level in
                      FCR[7:6].
                      The transmission of Xoff/Xon(s) follows the exact same protocol as transmission of an
                      ordinary character from the FIFO. This means that even if the word length is set to be 5, 6,
                      or 7 bits, then the 5, 6, or 7 least significant bits of XOFF1/XOFF2 or XON1/XON2 will be
                      transmitted. (Note that the transmission of 5, 6, or 7 bits of a character is seldom done, but
                      this functionality is included to maintain compatibility with earlier designs.)
                      It is assumed that software flow control and hardware flow control will never be enabled
                      simultaneously. Figure 7 shows an example of software flow control.

                       The SC16IS741 has interrupt generation and prioritization capability. The Interrupt Enable
                       Register (IER) enables each of the interrupts and the IRQ signal in response to an
                       interrupt generation. When an interrupt is generated, the IIR indicates that an interrupt is
                       pending and provides the type of interrupt through IIR[5:0]. Table 6 summarizes the
                       interrupt control functions.

                       It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, LSR[7]
                       generates the interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO,
                       and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always
                       represent the error status for the received character at the top of the RX FIFO. Reading
                       the RX FIFO updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the new character at the top of
                       the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all zeros.
                       For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt
                       is cleared by an Xon flow character detection. If a special character detection caused the
                       interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR.

                7.5.1 Interrupt mode operation
                      In Interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is 1) the host is informed of the status of the
                      receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal, IRQ. Therefore, it is not necessary to
                      continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be
                      serviced. Figure 8 shows Interrupt mode operation.
                                                                                        IIR

                7.5.2 Polled mode operation
                      In Polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be
                      checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR). This mode is an alternative to the FIFO
                      Interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
                      automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 9 shows FIFO Polled
                      mode operation.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                          SC16IS741
                                                             Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                   7.6 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the SC16IS741 UART. It is enabled when EFR[4],
                       the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set. Sleep mode is entered when:
                         • The serial data input line, RX, is idle (see Section 7.7 “Break and time-out
                            conditions”).
                         • The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
                         • There are no interrupts pending except THR.
                       Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the RX FIFO.
                       In Sleep mode, the clock to the UART is stopped. Since most registers are clocked using
                       these clocks, the power consumption is greatly reduced. The UART will wake up when
                       any change is detected on the RX line, when there is any change in the state of the
                       modem input pins, or if data is written to the TX FIFO.
                       Remark: Writing to the divisor latches, DLL and DLH, to set the baud clock, must not be
                       done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advisable to disable Sleep mode using IER[4]
                       before writing to DLL or DLH.
                   7.7 Break and time-out conditions
                       When the UART receives a number of characters and these data are not enough to set off
                       the receive interrupt (because they do not reach the receive trigger level), the UART will
                       generate a time-out interrupt instead, 4 character times after the last character is
                       received. The time-out counter will be reset at the center of each stop bit received or each
                       time the receive FIFO is read.
                       A break condition is detected when the RX pin is pulled LOW for a duration longer than
                       the time it takes to send a complete character plus Start, Stop and Parity bits. A break
                       condition can be sent by setting LCR[6]. When this happens the TX pin will be pulled LOW
                       until LSR[6] is cleared by the software.
                   7.8 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16IS741 UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that takes any clock
                       input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1 and (216 – 1). An additional
                       divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as shown in
                       Figure 10. The output frequency of the baud rate generator is 16 times the baud rate. The
                       formula for the divisor is given in Equation 1:
                                    ⎛ XTAL1
                                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------⎞
                                                           crystal input frequency
                                    ⎝                              prescaler                                             ⎠
                        divisor = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  (1)
                                                  desired baud rate × 16
                       where:
                          prescaler = 1, when MCR[7] is set to ‘0’ after reset (divide-by-1 clock selected)
                          prescaler = 4, when MCR[7] is set to ‘1’ after reset (divide-by-4 clock selected).
                       Remark: The default value of prescaler after reset is divide-by-1.
                       Figure 10 shows the internal prescaler and baud rate generator circuitry.

                     Fig 10. Prescaler and baud rate generator block diagram
                   DLL and DLH must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLH are the
                   least significant and most significant byte of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLH are both
                   zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
                   Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit
                   and receive clock rates.

                                              Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                   8.1 Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                       The receiver section consists of the Receiver Holding Register (RHR) and the Receiver
                       Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The RSR receives serial data
                       from the RX pin. The data is converted to parallel data and moved to the RHR. The
                       receiver section is controlled by the Line Control Register. If the FIFO is disabled, location
                       zero of the FIFO is used to store the characters.
                   8.2 Transmit Holding Register (THR)
                       The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR) and the Transmit
                       Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The THR receives data and
                       shifts it into the TSR, where it is converted to serial data and moved out on the TX pin. If
                       the FIFO is disabled, the FIFO is still used to store the byte. Characters are lost if overflow
                       occurs.
                   8.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This is a write-only register that is used for enabling the FIFOs, clearing the FIFOs, setting
                       transmitter and receiver trigger levels. Table 11 shows FIFO Control Register bit settings.
                       Table 11.     FIFO Control Register bits description
                        Bit    Symbol         Description
                        7:6    FCR[7] (MSB), RX trigger. Sets the trigger level for the RX FIFO.
                               FCR[6] (LSB)     00 = 8 characters
                                                01 = 16 characters
                                                10 = 56 characters
                                                11 = 60 characters
                        5:4    FCR[5] (MSB), TX trigger. Sets the trigger level for the TX FIFO.
                               FCR[4] (LSB)     00 = 8 spaces
                                                01 = 16 spaces
                                                10 = 32 spaces
                                                11 = 56 spaces
                                              FCR[5:4] can only be modified and enabled when EFR[4] is set. This is
                                              because the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.

                       [1]  FIFO reset requires at least two XTAL1 clocks, therefore, they cannot be reset without the presence of the
                            XTAL1 clock.
                   8.4 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       This register controls the data communication format. The word length, number of stop
                       bits, and parity type are selected by writing the appropriate bits to the LCR. Table 12
                       shows the Line Control Register bit settings.
                       Table 12.    Line Control Register bits description

                        6          LCR[6]           Break control bit. When enabled, the break control bit causes a break
                                                    condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state).
                                                    This condition exists until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.
                                                       logic 0 = no TX break condition (normal default condition).

                       When the LSR is read, LSR[4:2] reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the
                       top of the RX FIFO (next character to be read). Therefore, errors in a character are
                       identified by reading the LSR and then reading the RHR.
                       LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when
                       there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO.

                8.10 Enhanced Features Register (EFR)
                      This 8-bit register enables or disables the enhanced features of the UART. Table 22
                      shows the enhanced feature register bit settings.

                                           logic 0 = RTS flow control is disabled (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = RTS flow control is enabled. The RTS pin goes HIGH when the
                                           receiver FIFO halt trigger level TCR[3:0] is reached, and goes LOW when the
                                           receiver FIFO resume transmission trigger level TCR[7:4] is reached.

                                           Xoff2 data. If a match occurs, the received data is transferred to FIFO and
                                           IIR[4] is set to a logical 1 to indicate a special character has been detected.

                 8.11 Division registers (DLL, DLH)
                      These are two 8-bit registers which store the 16-bit divisor for generation of the baud clock
                      in the baud rate generator. DLH stores the most significant part of the divisor. DLL stores
                      the least significant part of the divisor.
                      Remark: DLL and DLH can only be written to before Sleep mode is enabled, that is,
                      before IER[4] is set.

                8.12 Transmission Control Register (TCR)
                     This 8-bit register is used to store the RX FIFO threshold levels to stop/start transmission
                     during hardware/software flow control. Table 23 shows Transmission Control Register bit
                     settings.

                      7:4         TCR[7:4]       RX FIFO trigger level to resume
                      3:0         TCR[3:0]       RX FIFO trigger level to halt transmission
                     TCR trigger levels are available from 0 to 60 characters with a granularity of four.
                     Remark: TCR can only be written to when EFR[4] = 1 and MCR[2] = 1. The programmer
                     must program the TCR such that TCR[3:0] > TCR[7:4]. There is no built-in hardware
                     check to make sure this condition is met. Also, the TCR must be programmed with this
                     condition before auto RTS or software flow control is enabled to avoid spurious operation
                     of the device.
                8.13 Trigger Level Register (TLR)
                     This 8-bit register is used to store the transmit and received FIFO trigger levels used for
                     interrupt generation. Trigger levels from 4 to 60 can be programmed with a granularity
                     of 4. Table 24 shows trigger level register bit settings.
                     Table 24.    Trigger Level Register bits description
                      Bit         Symbol         Description
                      7:4         TLR[7:4]       RX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of characters available.
                      3:0         TLR[3:0]       TX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of spaces available.
                     Remark: TLR can only be written to when EFR[4] = 1 and MCR[2] = 1. If TLR[3:0] or
                     TLR[7:4] are logical 0, the selectable trigger levels via the FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                     are used for the transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels. Trigger levels from 4 characters
                     to 60 characters are available with a granularity of four. The TLR should be programmed
                     for N⁄4, where N is the desired trigger level.
                     When the trigger level setting in TLR is zero, the SC16IS741 uses the trigger level setting
                     defined in FCR. If TLR has non-zero trigger level value, the trigger level defined in FCR is
                     discarded. This applies to both transmit FIFO and receive FIFO trigger level setting.
                     When TLR is used for RX trigger level control, FCR[7:6] should be left at the default state,
                     that is, ‘00’.
                8.14 Transmitter FIFO Level register (TXLVL)
                     This register is a read-only register, it reports the number of spaces available in the
                     transmit FIFO.

9. RS-485 features
                   9.1 Auto RS-485 RTS control
                       Normally the RTS pin is controlled by MCR bit 1, or if hardware flow control is enabled, the
                       logic state of the RTS pin is controlled by the hardware flow control circuitry. EFCR
                       register bit 4 will take the precedence over the other two modes; once this bit is set, the
                       transmitter will control the state of the RTS pin. The transmitter automatically asserts the
                       RTS pin (logic 0) once the host writes data to the transmit FIFO, and deasserts RTS pin
                       (logic 1) once the last bit of the data has been transmitted.
                       To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow
                       control function.
                   9.2 RS-485 RTS output inversion
                       EFCR bit 5 reverses the polarity of the RTS pin if the UART is in auto RS-485 RTS mode.
                       When the transmitter has data to be sent it will deasserts the RTS pin (logic 1), and when
                       the last bit of the data has been sent out the transmitter asserts the RTS pin (logic 0).
                   9.3 Auto RS-485
                       EFCR bit 0 is used to enable the RS-485 mode (multidrop or 9-bit mode). In this mode of
                       operation, a ‘master’ station transmits an address character followed by data characters
                       for the addressed ‘slave’ stations. The slave stations examine the received data and
                       interrupt the controller if the received character is an address character (parity bit = 1).
                       To use the auto RS-485 mode the software would have to disable the hardware and
                       software flow control functions.
                9.3.1 Normal multidrop mode
                       The 9-bit Mode in EFCR (bit 0) is enabled, but not Special Character Detect (EFR bit 5).
                       The receiver is set to Force Parity 0 (LCR[5:3] = 111) in order to detect address bytes.
                       With the receiver initially disabled, it ignores all the data bytes (parity bit = 0) until an
                       address byte is received (parity bit = 1). This address byte will cause the UART to set the
                       parity error. The UART will generate a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to ‘1’ at
                       this time), and at the same time puts this address byte in the RX FIFO. After the controller
                       examines the byte it must make a decision whether or not to enable the receiver; it should
                       enable the receiver if the address byte addresses its ID address, and must not enable the
                       receiver if the address byte does not address its ID address.
                       If the controller enables the receiver, the receiver will receive the subsequent data until
                       being disabled by the controller after the controller has received a complete message
                       from the ‘master’ station. If the controller does not disable the receiver after receiving a
                       message from the ‘master’ station, the receiver will generate a parity error upon receiving
                       another address byte. The controller then determines if the address byte addresses its ID
                       address, if it is not, the controller then can disable the receiver. If the address byte
                       addresses the ‘slave’ ID address, the controller take no further action, the receiver will
                       receive the subsequent data.

                9.3.2 Auto address detection
                      If Special Character Detect is enabled (EFR[5] is set and the XOFF2 register contains the
                      address byte) the receiver will try to detect an address byte that matches the programmed
                      character in the XOFF2 register. If the received byte is a data byte or an address byte that
                      does not match the programmed character in the XOFF2 register, the receiver will discard
                      these data. Upon receiving an address byte that matches the Xoff2 character, the receiver
                      will be automatically enabled if not already enabled, and the address character is pushed
                      into the RX FIFO along with the parity bit (in place of the parity error bit). The receiver also
                      generates a line status interrupt (IER[2] must be set to ‘1’ at this time). The receiver will
                      then receive the subsequent data from the ‘master’ station until being disabled by the
                      controller after having received a message from the ‘master’ station.
                      If another address byte is received and this address byte does not match Xoff2 character,
                      the receiver will be automatically disabled and the address byte is ignored. If the address
                      byte matches Xoff2 character, the receiver will put this byte in the RX FIFO along with the
                      parity bit in the parity error bit (LSR bit 2).
10. I2C-bus operation
                      The two lines of the I2C-bus are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both
                      lines are connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor, and remain HIGH when the
                      bus is not busy. Each device is recognized by a unique address whether it is a
                      microcomputer, LCD driver, memory or keyboard interface and can operate as either a
                      transmitter or receiver, depending on the function of the device. A device generating a
                      message or data is a transmitter, and a device receiving the message or data is a
                      receiver. Obviously, a passive function like an LCD driver could only be a receiver, while a
                      microcontroller or a memory can both transmit and receive data.
                10.1 Data transfers
                      One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse (see Figure 12). The data on the SDA
                      line must remain stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse in order to be valid.
                      Changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals. A HIGH-to-LOW
                      transition of the data line (SDA) while the clock signal (SCL) is HIGH indicates a START
                      condition, and a LOW-to-HIGH transition of the SDA while SCL is HIGH defines a STOP
                      condition (see Figure 13). The bus is considered to be busy after the START condition
                      and free again at a certain time interval after the STOP condition. The START and STOP
                      conditions are always generated by the master.

                              The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP condition from
                              transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte, which must be eight bits long, is
                              transferred serially with the most significant bit first, and is followed by an acknowledge bit
                              (see Figure 14). The clock pulse related to the acknowledge bit is generated by the
                              master. The device that acknowledges has to pull down the SDA line during the
                              acknowledge clock pulse, while the transmitting device releases this pulse (see
                              Figure 15).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                               SC16IS741
                                                 Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                        There are two exceptions to the ‘acknowledge after every byte’ rule. The first occurs when
                        a master is a receiver: it must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not signalling an
                        acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. The acknowledge
                        related clock, generated by the master should still take place, but the SDA line will not be
                        pulled down. In order to indicate that this is an active and intentional lack of
                        acknowledgement, we shall term this special condition as a ‘negative acknowledge’.
                        The second exception is that a slave will send a negative acknowledge when it can no
                        longer accept additional data bytes. This occurs after an attempted transfer that cannot be
                        accepted.
                 10.2 Addressing and transfer formats
                        Each device on the bus has its own unique address. Before any data is transmitted on the
                        bus, the master transmits on the bus the address of the slave to be accessed for this
                        transaction. A well-behaved slave with a matching address, if it exists on the network,
                        should of course acknowledge the master's addressing. The addressing is done by the
                        first byte transmitted by the master after the START condition.
                        An address on the network is seven bits long, appearing as the most significant bits of the
                        address byte. The last bit is a direction (R/W) bit. A ‘0’ indicates that the master is
                        transmitting (write) and a ‘1’ indicates that the master requests data (read). A complete
                        data transfer, comprised of an address byte indicating a ‘write’ and two data bytes is
                        shown in Figure 16.

                                                                                                                  002aab046
  Fig 16. A complete data transfer
                        When an address is sent, each device in the system compares the first seven bits after
                        the START with its own address. If there is a match, the device will consider itself
                        addressed by the master, and will send an acknowledge. The device could also determine
                        if in this transaction it is assigned the role of a slave receiver or slave transmitter,
                        depending on the R/W bit.
                        Each node of the I2C-bus network has a unique seven-bit address. The address of a
                        microcontroller is of course fully programmable, while peripheral devices usually have
                        fixed and programmable address portions.
                        When the master is communicating with one device only, data transfers follow the format
                        of Figure 16, where the R/W bit could indicate either direction. After completing the
                        transfer and issuing a STOP condition, if a master would like to address some other
                        device on the network, it could start another transaction by issuing a new START.

                           a ‘repeated START’. After the last byte of the transaction was transferred, including its
                           acknowledge (or negative acknowledge), the master issues another START, followed by
                           address byte and data—without effecting a STOP. The master may communicate with a
                           number of different devices, combining ‘reads’ and ‘writes’. After the last transfer takes
                           place, the master issues a STOP and releases the bus. Possible data formats are
                           demonstrated in Figure 17. Note that the repeated START allows for both change of a
                           slave and a change of direction, without releasing the bus. We shall see later on that the
                           change of direction feature can come in handy even when dealing with a single device.
                           In a single master system, the repeated START mechanism may be more efficient than
                           terminating each transfer with a STOP and starting again. In a multimaster environment,
                           the determination of which format is more efficient could be more complicated, as when a
                           master is using repeated STARTs it occupies the bus for a long time and thus preventing
                           other devices from initiating transfers.

                10.3 Addressing
                     Before any data is transmitted or received, the master must send the address of the
                     receiver via the SDA line. The first byte after the START condition carries the address of
                     the slave device and the read/write bit. Table 28 shows how the SC16IS741’s address can
                     be selected by using A1 and A0 pins. For example, if these 2 pins are connected to VDD,
                     then the SC16IS741’s address is set to 0x90, and the master communicates with it
                     through this address.

                10.4 Use of subaddresses
                      When a master communicates with the SC16IS741 it must send a subaddress in the byte
                     following the slave address byte. This subaddress is the internal address of the word the
                     master wants to access for a single byte transfer, or the beginning of a sequence of
                     locations for a multi-byte transfer. A subaddress is an 8-bit byte. Unlike the device
                     address, it does not contain a direction (R/W) bit, and like any byte transferred on the bus
                     it must be followed by an acknowledge.
                     Table 29 shows the breakdown of the subaddress (register address) byte. Bit 0 is not
                     used, bits [2:1] are both set to zeroes, bits [6:3] are used to select one of the device’s
                     internal registers, and bit 7 is not used.
                     A register write cycle is shown in Figure 18. The START is followed by a slave address
                     byte with the direction bit set to ‘write’, a subaddress byte, a number of data bytes, and a
                     STOP signal. The subaddress indicates which register the master wants to access, and
                     the data bytes which follow will be written one after the other to the subaddress location.

                              UART internal registers. Bit 7 is not used with the I2C-bus interface, but it is used by the
                              SPI interface to indicate a read or a write operation.

  Fig 18. Master writes to slave
                              The register read cycle (see Figure 19) commences in a similar manner, with the master
                              sending a slave address with the direction bit set to ‘write’ with a following subaddress.
                              Then, in order to reverse the direction of the transfer, the master issues a repeated
                              START followed again by the device address, but this time with the direction bit set to
                              ‘read’. The data bytes starting at the internal subaddress will be clocked out of the device,
                              each followed by a master-generated acknowledge. The last byte of the read cycle will be
                              followed by a negative acknowledge, signalling the end of transfer. The cycle is
                              terminated by a STOP signal.

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                17.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                17.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 34) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
