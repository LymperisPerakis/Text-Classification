2.25V TO 5.5V DUART WITH 64-BYTE FIFO                                                                       REV. 1.2.1
 1.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The XR16L2750 (2750) integrates the functions of 2 enhanced 16C550 Universal Asynchronous Receiver and
Transmitter (UART). Each UART is independently controlled having its own set of device configuration
registers. The configuration registers set is 16550 UART compatible for control, status and data transfer.
Additionally, each UART channel has 64-bytes of transmit and receive FIFOs, automatic RTS/CTS hardware
flow control with hysteresis control, automatic Xon/Xoff and special character software flow control,
programmable transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels, FIFO level counters, infrared encoder and decoder
(IrDA ver 1.0), programmable baud rate generator with a prescaler of divide by 1 or 4, and data rate up to 6.25
Mbps with 8X sampling clock rate or 3.125 Mbps in the 16X rate. The XR16L2750 is a 2.25 to 5.5V device with
5 volt tolerant inputs. The 2750 is fabricated with an advanced CMOS process.
Enhanced Features
The 2750 DUART provides a solution that supports 64 bytes of transmit and receive FIFO memory, instead of
128 bytes provided in the XR16C2850 and 16 bytes in the ST16C2550, or one byte in the ST16C2450. The
2750 is designed to work with low supply voltage and high performance data communication systems, that
require fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in the 2750 by the larger transmit and
receive FIFOs, FIFO trigger level control, FIFO level counters and automatic flow control mechanism. This
allows the external processor to handle more networking tasks within a given time. For example, the
ST16C2550 with a 16 byte FIFO, unloads 16 bytes of receive data in 1.53 ms (This example uses a character
length of 11 bits, including start/stop bits at 115.2 Kbps). This means the external CPU will have to service the
receive FIFO at 1.53 ms intervals. However with the 64 byte FIFO in the 2750, the data buffer will not require
unloading/loading for 6.1 ms. This increases the service interval giving the external CPU additional time for
other applications and reducing the overall UART interrupt servicing time. In addition, the programmable FIFO
level trigger interrupt and automatic hardware/software flow control is uniquely provided for maximum data
throughput performance especially when operating in a multi-channel system. The combination of the above
greatly reduces the CPU’s bandwidth requirement, increases performance, and reduces power consumption.
The 2750 supports a half-duplex output direction control signaling pin, RTS# A/B, to enable and disable the
external RS-485 transceiver operation. It automatically switches the logic state of the output pin to the receive
state after the last stop-bit of the last character has been shifted out of the transmitter. After receiving, the logic
state of the output pin switches back to the transmit state when a data byte is loaded in the transmitter. The
auto RS-485 direction control pin is not activated after reset. To activate the direction control function, user has
to set FCTR Bit-3 to “1”. This pin is normally high for receive state, low for transmit state.
Data Rate
The 2750 is capable of operation up to 3.125 Mbps at 5V with 16X internal sampling clock rate, and 6.25 Mbps
at 5V with 8X sampling clock rate. The device can operate with an external 24 MHz crystal on pins XTAL1 and
XTAL2, or external clock source of up to 50 MHz on XTAL1 pin. With a typical crystal of 14.7456 MHz and
through a software option, the user can set the prescaler bit for data rates of up to 1.84 Mbps.
The rich feature set of the 2750 is available through the internal registers. Automatic hardware/software flow
control, selectable transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels, selectable TX and RX baud rates, infrared
encoder/decoder interface, modem interface controls, and a sleep mode are all standard features.
Following a power on reset or an external reset, the 2750 is software compatible with previous generation of
UARTs, 16C450, 16C550 and 16C650A as well as the 16C850.

 2.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
 2.1     CPU Interface
The CPU interface is 8 data bits wide with 3 address lines and control signals to execute data bus read and
write transactions. The 2750 data interface supports the Intel compatible types of CPUs and it is compatible to
the industry standard 16C550 UART. No clock (oscillator nor external clock) is required to operate a data bus
transaction. Each bus cycle is asynchronous using CS#, IOR# and IOW# signals. Both UART channels share
the same data bus for host operations. The data bus interconnections are shown in Figure 3.

 2.2     5-Volt Tolerant Inputs
The 2750 can accept up to 5V inputs even when operating at 3.3V or 2.5V. But note that if the 2750 is
operating at 2.5V, its VOH may not be high enough to meet the requirements of the VIH of a CPU or a serial
transceiver that is operating at 5V. Caution: XTAL1 is not 5 volt tolerant.
 2.3     Device Reset
The RESET input resets the internal registers and the serial interface outputs in both channels to their default
state (see Table 16). An active high pulse of longer than 40 ns duration will be required to activate the reset
function in the device.
 2.4     Device Identification and Revision
The XR16L2750 provides a Device Identification code and a Device Revision code to distinguish the part from
other devices and revisions. To read the identification code from the part, it is required to set the baud rate
generator registers DLL and DLM both to 0x00. Now reading the content of the DLM will provide 0x0A for the
XR16L2750 and reading the content of DLL will provide the revision of the part; for example, a reading of 0x01
means revision A.
 2.5     Channel A and B Selection
The UART provides the user with the capability to bi-directionally transfer information between an external
CPU and an external serial communication device. A logic 0 on chip select pins, CSA# or CSB#, allows the
user to select UART channel A or B to configure, send transmit data and/or unload receive data to/from the
UART. Selecting both UARTs can be useful during power up initialization to write to the same internal registers,
but do not attempt to read from both uarts simultaneously. Individual channel select functions are shown in
Table 1.

 2.6       Channel A and B Internal Registers
Each UART channel in the 2750 has a set of enhanced registers for control, monitoring and data loading and
unloading. The configuration register set is compatible to those already available in the standard single
16C550 and dual ST16C2550. These registers function as data holding registers (THR/RHR), interrupt status
and control registers (ISR/IER), a FIFO control register (FCR), receive line status and control registers (LSR/
LCR), modem status and control registers (MSR/MCR), programmable data rate (clock) divisor registers (DLL/
DLM), and a user accessible Scratchpad Register (SPR).
Beyond the general 16C2550 features and capabilities, the 2750 offers enhanced feature registers (EMSR,
FLVL, EFR, Xon/Xoff 1, Xon/Xoff 2, FCTR, TRG, FC) that provide automatic RTS and CTS hardware flow
control, Xon/Xoff software flow control, automatic RS-485 half-duplex direction output enable/disable, FIFO
trigger level control, and FIFO level counters. All the register functions are discussed in full detail later in
“Section 3.0, UART INTERNAL REGISTERS” on page 20.
 2.7       DMA Mode
The device does not support direct memory access. The DMA Mode (a legacy term) in this document doesn’t
mean “direct memory access” but refers to data block transfer operation. The DMA mode affects the state of
the RXRDY# A/B and TXRDY# A/B output pins. The transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels provide additional
flexibility to the user for block mode operation. The LSR bits 5-6 provide an indication when the transmitter is
empty or has an empty location(s) for more data. The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive
FIFO in the DMA mode (FCR bit-3=1). When the transmit and receive FIFO are enabled and the DMA mode is
disabled (FCR bit-3 = 0), the 2750 is placed in single-character mode for data transmit or receive operation.
When DMA mode is enabled (FCR bit-3 = 1), the user takes advantage of block mode operation by loading or
unloading the FIFO in a block sequence determined by the programmed trigger level. In this mode, the 2750
sets the TXRDY# pin when the transmit FIFO becomes full, and sets the RXRDY# pin when the receive FIFO
becomes empty. The following table shows their behavior. Also see Figures 18 through 23.

 2.9     Crystal Oscillator or External Clock Input
The 2750 includes an on-chip oscillator (XTAL1 and XTAL2) to produce a clock for both UART sections in the
device. The CPU data bus does not require this clock for bus operation. The crystal oscillator provides a
system clock to the Baud Rate Generators (BRG) section found in each of the UART. XTAL1 is the input to the
oscillator or external clock buffer input with XTAL2 pin being the output. Please note that the input XTAL1 is not
5V tolerant and so the maximum at the pin should be VCC. For programming details, see “Programmable
Baud Rate Generator.”

The on-chip oscillator is designed to use an industry standard microprocessor crystal (parallel resonant,
fundamental frequency with 10-22 pF capacitance load, ESR of 20-120 ohms and 100 ppm frequency
tolerance) connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 4). The programmable Baud
Rate Generator is capable of operating with a crystal oscillator frequency of up to 24 MHz. However, with an
external clock input on XTAL1 pin and a 2K ohms pull-up resistor on XTAL2 pin (as shown in Figure 5) it can
extend its operation up to 50 MHz (6.25 Mbps serial data rate) at 5V with an 8X sampling rate.

 2.10    Programmable Baud Rate Generator
Each UART has its own Baud Rate Generator (BRG) with a prescaler. The prescaler is controlled by a
software bit in the MCR register. The MCR register bit-7 sets the prescaler to divide the input crystal or external
clock by 1 or 4. The clock output of the prescaler goes to the BRG. The BRG further divides this clock by a
programmable divisor between 1 and (216 -1) to obtain a 16X sampling rate clock of the serial data rate. The
sampling rate clock is used by the transmitter for data bit shifting and receiver for data sampling. The BRG
divisor defaults to the maximum baud rate (DLL = 0x01 and DLM = 0x00) upon power up.

 2.11     Transmitter
The transmitter section comprises of an 8-bit Transmit Shift Register (TSR) and 64 bytes of FIFO which
includes a byte-wide Transmit Holding Register (THR). TSR shifts out every data bit with the 16X/8X internal
clock. A bit time is 16 (8) clock periods (see EMSR bit-7). The transmitter sends the start-bit followed by the
number of data bits, inserts the proper parity-bit if enabled, and adds the stop-bit(s). The status of the FIFO and
TSR are reported in the Line Status Register (LSR bit-5 and bit-6).
  2.11.1     Transmit Holding Register (THR) - Write Only
The transmit holding register is an 8-bit register providing a data interface to the host processor. The host
writes transmit data byte to the THR to be converted into a serial data stream including start-bit, data bits,
parity-bit and stop-bit(s). The least-significant-bit (Bit-0) becomes first data bit to go out. The THR is the input
register to the transmit FIFO of 64 bytes when FIFO operation is enabled by FCR bit-0. Every time a write
operation is made to the THR, the FIFO data pointer is automatically bumped to the next sequential data
location.
  2.11.2     Transmitter Operation in non-FIFO Mode
The host loads transmit data to THR one character at a time. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set when the
data byte is transferred to TSR. THR flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when it is enabled
by IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR becomes completely empty.

  2.11.3     Transmitter Operation in FIFO Mode
The host may fill the transmit FIFO with up to 64 bytes of transmit data. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set
whenever the FIFO is empty. The THR empty flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when the
amount of data in the FIFO falls below its programmed trigger level. The transmit empty interrupt is enabled by
IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR/FIFO becomes empty.

 2.12     Receiver
The receiver section contains an 8-bit Receive Shift Register (RSR) and 64 bytes of FIFO which includes a
byte-wide Receive Holding Register (RHR). The RSR uses the 16X/8X clock (EMSR bit-7) for timing. It verifies
and validates every bit on the incoming character in the middle of each data bit. On the falling edge of a start or
false start bit, an internal receiver counter starts counting at the 16X/8X clock rate. After 8 clocks (or 4 if 8X) the
start bit period should be at the center of the start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled and if it is still a logic
0 it is validated. Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false character.
The rest of the data bits and stop bits are sampled and validated in this same manner to prevent false framing.
If there were any error(s), they are reported in the LSR register bits 2-4. Upon unloading the receive data byte
from RHR, the receive FIFO pointer is bumped and the error tags are immediately updated to reflect the status
of the data byte in RHR register. RHR can generate a receive data ready interrupt upon receiving a character
or delay until it reaches the FIFO trigger level. Furthermore, data delivery to the host is guaranteed by a
receive data ready time-out interrupt when data is not received for 4 word lengths as defined by LCR[1,0] plus
12 bits time. This is equivalent to 3.7-4.6 character times. The RHR interrupt is enabled by IER bit-0.

 2.12.1      Receive Holding Register (RHR) - Read-Only
The Receive Holding Register is an 8-bit register that holds a receive data byte from the Receive Shift
Register. It provides the receive data interface to the host processor. The RHR register is part of the receive
FIFO of 64 bytes by 11-bits wide, the 3 extra bits are for the 3 error tags to be reported in LSR register. When
the FIFO is enabled by FCR bit-0, the RHR contains the first data character received by the FIFO. After the
RHR is read, the next character byte is loaded into the RHR and the errors associated with the current data
byte are immediately updated in the LSR bits 2-4.

output is used to request remote unit to suspend/resume data transmission. The auto RTS flow control
features is enabled to fit specific application requirement (see Figure 11):
• Enable auto RTS flow control using EFR bit-6.
• The auto RTS function must be started by asserting RTS# output pin (MCR bit-1 to logic 1 after it is enabled).
If using the Auto RTS interrupt:
• Enable RTS interrupt through IER bit-6 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the
   RTS# pin makes a transition from low to high: ISR bit-5 will be set to logic 1.
 2.14     Auto RTS Hysteresis
The 2750 has a new feature that provides flow control trigger hysteresis while maintaining compatibility with
the XR16C850, ST16C650A and ST16C550 family of UARTs. With the Auto RTS function enabled, an interrupt
is generated when the receive FIFO reaches the programmed RX trigger level. The RTS# pin will not be forced
HIGH (RTS off) until the receive FIFO reaches the upper limit of the hysteresis level. The RTS# pin will return
LOW after the RX FIFO is unloaded to the lower limit of the hysteresis level. Under the above described
conditions, the 2750 will continue to accept data until the receive FIFO gets full. The Auto RTS function is
initiated when the RTS# output pin is asserted LOW (RTS On). Table 13 shows the complete details for the
Auto RTS# Hysteresis levels. Please note that this table is for programmable trigger levels only (Table D). The
hysteresis values for Tables A-C are the next higher and next lower trigger levels in the corresponding table.
 2.15     Auto CTS Flow Control
Automatic CTS flow control is used to prevent data overrun to the remote receiver FIFO. The CTS# input is
monitored to suspend/restart the local transmitter. The auto CTS flow control feature is selected to fit specific
application requirement (see Figure 11):
• Enable auto CTS flow control using EFR bit-7.
If using the Auto CTS interrupt:
• Enable CTS interrupt through IER bit-7 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the
   CTS# pin is de-asserted (HIGH): ISR bit-5 will be set to 1, and UART will suspend transmission as soon as
   the stop bit of the character in process is shifted out. Transmission is resumed after the CTS# input is re-
   asserted (LOW), indicating more data may be sent.

  The local UART (UARTA) starts data transfer by asserting RTSA# (1). RTSA# is normally connected to CTSB# (2) of
  remote UART (UARTB). CTSB# allows its transmitter to send data (3). TXB data arrives and fills UARTA receive FIFO
  (4). When RXA data fills up to its receive FIFO trigger level, UARTA activates its RXA data ready interrupt (5) and con-
  tinues to receive and put data into its FIFO. If interrupt service latency is long and data is not being unloaded, UARTA
  monitors its receive data fill level to match the upper threshold of RTS delay and de-assert RTSA# (6). CTSB# follows
  (7) and request UARTB transmitter to suspend data transfer. UARTB stops or finishes sending the data bits in its trans-
  mit shift register (8). When receive FIFO data in UARTA is unloaded to match the lower threshold of RTS delay (9),
  UARTA re-asserts RTSA# (10), CTSB# recognizes the change (11) and restarts its transmitter and data flow again until
  next receive FIFO trigger (12). This same event applies to the reverse direction when UARTA sends data to UARTB
  with RTSB# and CTSA# controlling the data flow.

 2.16     Auto Xon/Xoff (Software) Flow Control
When software flow control is enabled (See Table 15), the 2750 compares one or two sequential receive data
characters with the programmed Xon or Xoff-1,2 character value(s). If receive character(s) (RX) match the
programmed values, the 2750 will halt transmission (TX) as soon as the current character has completed
transmission. When a match occurs, the Xoff (if enabled via IER bit-5) flag will be set and the interrupt output
pin will be activated. Following a suspension due to a match of the Xoff character, the 2750 will monitor the
receive data stream for a match to the Xon-1,2 character. If a match is found, the 2750 will resume operation
and clear the flags (ISR bit-4).
Reset initially sets the contents of the Xon/Xoff 8-bit flow control registers to a logic 0. Following reset the user
can write any Xon/Xoff value desired for software flow control. Different conditions can be set to detect Xon/
Xoff characters (See Table 15) and suspend/resume transmissions. When double 8-bit Xon/Xoff characters are
selected, the 2750 compares two consecutive receive characters with two software flow control 8-bit values
(Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2) and controls TX transmissions accordingly. Under the above described flow control
mechanisms, flow control characters are not placed (stacked) in the user accessible RX data buffer or FIFO.
In the event that the receive buffer is overfilling and flow control needs to be executed, the 2750 automatically
sends an Xoff message (when enabled) via the serial TX output to the remote modem. The 2750 sends the
Xoff-1,2 characters two-character-times (= time taken to send two characters at the programmed baud rate)
after the receive FIFO crosses the programmed trigger level (for all trigger tables A-D). To clear this condition,
the 2750 will transmit the programmed Xon-1,2 characters as soon as receive FIFO is less than one trigger
level below the programmed trigger level (for Trigger Tables A, B, and C) or when receive FIFO is less than the
trigger level minus the hysteresis value (for Trigger Table D). This hysteresis value is the same as the Auto
RTS Hysteresis value in Table 14. Table 6 below explains this when Trigger Table-B (See Table 10) is selected.

* After the trigger level is reached, an xoff character is sent after a short span of time (= time required to send 2 characters);
for example, after 2.083ms has elapsed for 9600 baud and 10-bit word length setting.
 2.17      Special Character Detect
A special character detect feature is provided to detect an 8-bit character when bit-5 is set in the Enhanced
Feature Register (EFR). When this character (Xoff2) is detected, it will be placed in the FIFO along with normal
incoming RX data.
The 2750 compares each incoming receive character with Xoff-2 data. If a match exists, the received data will
be transferred to FIFO and ISR bit-4 will be set to indicate detection of special character. Although the Internal
Register Table shows Xon, Xoff Registers with eight bits of character information, the actual number of bits is
dependent on the programmed word length. Line Control Register (LCR) bits 0-1 defines the number of
character bits, i.e., either 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits, or 8 bits. The word length selected by LCR bits 0-1 also
determines the number of bits that will be used for the special character comparison. Bit-0 in the Xon, Xoff
Registers corresponds with the LSB bit for the receive character.
 2.18      Auto RS485 Half-duplex Control
The auto RS485 half-duplex direction control changes the behavior of the transmitter when enabled by FCTR
bit-3. By default, it de-asserts RTS# (HIGH) output following the last stop bit of the last character that has been
transmitted. This helps in turning around the transceiver to receive the remote station’s response. When the
host is ready to transmit next polling data packet again, it only has to load data bytes to the transmit FIFO. The
                                                                 16

transmitter automatically re-asserts RTS# (LOW) output prior to sending the data. The RS485 half-duplex
direction control output can be inverted by enabling EMSR bit-3.
2.19     Infrared Mode
The 2750 UART includes the infrared encoder and decoder compatible to the IrDA (Infrared Data Association)
version 1.0. The IrDA 1.0 standard that stipulates the infrared encoder sends out a 3/16 of a bit wide HIGH-
pulse for each “0” bit in the transmit data stream. This signal encoding reduces the on-time of the infrared LED,
hence reduces the power consumption. See Figure 12 below.
The infrared encoder and decoder are enabled by setting MCR register bit-6 to a ‘1’. When the infrared feature
is enabled, the transmit data output, TX, idles at logic zero level. Likewise, the RX input assumes an idle level
of logic zero from a reset and power up, see Figure 12.
Typically, the wireless infrared decoder receives the input pulse from the infrared sensing diode on the RX pin.
Each time it senses a light pulse, it returns a logic 1 to the data bit stream. However, this is not true with some
infrared modules on the market which indicate a logic 0 by a light pulse. So the 2750 has a provision to invert
the input polarity to accommodate this. In this case user can enable FCTR bit-2 to invert the input signal.

 2.20      Sleep Mode with Auto Wake-Up
The 2750 supports low voltage system designs, hence, a sleep mode is included to reduce its power
consumption when the chip is not actively used.
All of these conditions must be satisfied for the 2750 to enter sleep mode:
      ■ no interrupts pending for both channels of the 2750 (ISR bit-0 = 1)
      ■ sleep mode of both channels are enabled (IER bit-4 = 1)
      ■ modem inputs are not toggling (MSR bits 0-3 = 0)
      ■ RX input pins are idling HIGH
The 2750 stops its crystal oscillator to conserve power in the sleep mode. User can check the XTAL2 pin for
no clock output as an indication that the device has entered the sleep mode.
The 2750 resumes normal operation by any of the following:
      ■ a receive data start bit transition (HIGH to LOW)
      ■ a data byte is loaded to the transmitter, THR or FIFO
      ■ a change of logic state on any of the modem or general purpose serial inputs: CTS#, DSR#, CD#, RI#
If the 2750 is awakened by any one of the above conditions, it will return to the sleep mode automatically after
all interrupting conditions have been serviced and cleared. If the 2750 is awakened by the modem inputs, a
read to the MSR is required to reset the modem inputs. In any case, the sleep mode will not be entered while
an interrupt is pending from channel A or B. The 2750 will stay in the sleep mode of operation until it is disabled
by setting IER bit-4 to a logic 0.
If the address lines, data bus lines, IOW#, IOR#, CSA#, CSB#, and modem input lines remain steady when the
2750 is in sleep mode, the maximum current will be in the microamp range as specified in the DC Electrical
Characteristics on page 37. If the input lines are floating or are toggling while the 2750 is in sleep mode, the
current can be up to 100 times more. If any of those signals are toggling or floating, then an external buffer
would be required to keep the address, data and control lines steady to achieve the low current. As an
alternative, please refer to the XR16L2751 which is pin-to-pin and software compatible with the 2750 but with
(some additional pins and) the PowerSave feature that eliminates any unnecessary external buffer.
A word of caution: owing to the starting up delay of the crystal oscillator after waking up from sleep mode, the
first few receive characters may be lost. The number of characters lost during the restart also depends on your
operating data rate. More characters are lost when operating at higher data rate. Also, it is important to keep
RX A/B inputs idling HIGH or “marking” condition during sleep mode to avoid receiving a “break” condition
upon the restart. This may occur when the external interface transceivers (RS-232, RS-485 or another type)
are also put to sleep mode and cannot maintain the “marking” condition. To avoid this, the designer can use a
47k-100k ohm pull-up resistor on the RXA and RXB pins.

2.21         Internal Loopback
The 2750 UART provides an internal loopback capability for system diagnostic purposes. The internal
loopback mode is enabled by setting MCR register bit-4 to logic 1. All regular UART functions operate normally.
Figure 13 shows how the modem port signals are re-configured. Transmit data from the transmit shift register
output is internally routed to the receive shift register input allowing the system to receive the same data that it
was sending. The TX, RTS# and DTR# pins are held while the CTS#, DSR# CD# and RI# inputs are ignored.
Caution: the RX input pin must be held HIGH during loopback test else upon exiting the loopback test the
UART may detect and report a false “break” signal. Also, Auto RTS/CTS flow control is not supported during
internal loopback.

  4.3.1     IER versus Receive FIFO Interrupt Mode Operation
When the receive FIFO (FCR BIT-0 = 1) and receive interrupts (IER BIT-0 = 1) are enabled, the RHR interrupts
(see ISR bits 2 and 3) status will reflect the following:
A. The receive data available interrupts are issued to the host when the FIFO has reached the programmed
     trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
B. FIFO level will be reflected in the ISR register when the FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register
     status bit and the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
C. The receive data ready bit (LSR BIT-0) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift register to
     the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
  4.3.2     IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO Polled Mode Operation
When FCR BIT-0 equals a logic 1 for FIFO enable; resetting IER bits 0-3 enables the XR16L2750 in the FIFO
polled mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR either or both can
be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
A. LSR BIT-0 indicates there is data in RHR or RX FIFO.
B. LSR BIT-1 indicates an overrun error has occurred and that data in the FIFO may not be valid.
C. LSR BIT 2-4 provides the type of receive data errors encountered for the data byte in RHR, if any.
D. LSR BIT-5 indicates THR is empty.
E. LSR BIT-6 indicates when both the transmit FIFO and TSR are empty.
F. LSR BIT-7 indicates a data error in at least one character in the RX FIFO.
IER[0]: RHR Interrupt Enable
The receive data ready interrupt will be issued when RHR has a data character in the non-FIFO mode or when
the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level in the FIFO mode.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receive data ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver data ready interrupt.
IER[1]: THR Interrupt Enable
This bit enables the Transmit Ready interrupt which is issued whenever the THR becomes empty in the non-
FIFO mode or when data in the FIFO falls below the programmed trigger level in the FIFO mode. If the THR is
empty when this bit is enabled, an interrupt will be generated.
• Logic 0 = Disable Transmit Ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Transmit Ready interrupt.
IER[2]: Receive Line Status Interrupt Enable
If any of the LSR register bits 1, 2, 3 or 4 is a logic 1, it will generate an interrupt to inform the host controller
about the error status of the current data byte in FIFO. LSR bit-1 generates an interrupt immediately when the
character has been received. LSR bits 2-4 generate an interrupt when the character with errors is read out of
the FIFO (default). Instead, LSR bits 2-4 can be programmed to generate an interrupt immediately, by setting
EMSR bit-6 to a logic 1.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receiver line status interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver line status interrupt.
IER[3]: Modem Status Interrupt Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable the modem status register interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the modem status register interrupt.
IER[4]: Sleep Mode Enable (requires EFR bit-4 = 1)
• Logic 0 = Disable Sleep Mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Sleep Mode. See Sleep Mode section for further details.

IER[5]: Xoff Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the software flow control, receive Xoff interrupt. (default)
• Logic 1 = Enable the software flow control, receive Xoff interrupt. See Software Flow Control section for
  details.
IER[6]: RTS# Output Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the RTS# interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the RTS# interrupt. The UART issues an interrupt when the RTS# pin makes a transition
  from low to high.
IER[7]: CTS# Input Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the CTS# interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the CTS# interrupt. The UART issues an interrupt when CTS# pin makes a transition from
  low to high.
 4.4     Interrupt Status Register (ISR) - Read-Only
The UART provides multiple levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external software interaction. The
Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with six interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the
ISR will give the user the current highest pending interrupt level to be serviced, others are queued up to be
serviced next. No other interrupts are acknowledged until the pending interrupt is serviced. The Interrupt
Source Table, Table 9, shows the data values (bit 0-5) for the interrupt priority levels and the interrupt sources
associated with each of these interrupt levels.
 4.4.1      Interrupt Generation:
• LSR is by any of the LSR bits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
• RXRDY is by RX trigger level.
• RXRDY Time-out is by a 4-char plus 12 bits delay timer.
• TXRDY is by TX trigger level or TX FIFO empty (or transmitter empty in auto RS-485 control).
• MSR is by any of the MSR bits 0, 1, 2 and 3.
• Receive Xoff/Special character is by detection of a Xoff or Special character.
• CTS# is when its transmitter toggles the input pin (from LOW to HIGH) during auto CTS flow control.
• RTS# is when its receiver toggles the output pin (from LOW to HIGH) during auto RTS flow control.
 4.4.2      Interrupt Clearing:
• LSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the LSR register.
• RXRDY interrupt is cleared by reading data until FIFO falls below the trigger level.
• RXRDY Time-out interrupt is cleared by reading RHR.
• TXRDY interrupt is cleared by a read to the ISR register or writing to THR.
• MSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the MSR register.
• Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR or when Xon character(s) is received.
• Special character interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR or after the next character is received.
• RTS# and CTS# flow control interrupts are cleared by a read to the MSR register.

ISR[3:1]: Interrupt Status
These bits indicate the source for a pending interrupt at interrupt priority levels (See Interrupt Source Table 9).
ISR[5:4]: Interrupt Status
These bits are enabled when EFR bit-4 is set to a logic 1. ISR bit-4 indicates that the receiver detected a data
match of the Xoff character(s). Note that once set to a logic 1, the ISR bit-4 will stay a logic 1 until a Xon
character is received. ISR bit-5 indicates that CTS# or RTS# has changed state.
ISR[7:6]: FIFO Enable Status
These bits are set to a logic 0 when the FIFOs are disabled. They are set to a logic 1 when the FIFOs are
enabled.
  4.5     FIFO Control Register (FCR) - Write-Only
This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the transmit/receive FIFO trigger levels, and
select the DMA mode. The DMA, and FIFO modes are defined as follows:
FCR[0]: TX and RX FIFO Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable the transmit and receive FIFO (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the transmit and receive FIFOs. This bit must be set to logic 1 when other FCR bits are
   written or they will not be programmed.
FCR[1]: RX FIFO Reset
This bit is only active when FCR bit-0 is a ‘1’.
• Logic 0 = No receive FIFO reset (default)
• Logic 1 = Reset the receive FIFO pointers and FIFO level counter logic (the receive shift register is not
   cleared or altered). This bit will return to a logic 0 after resetting the FIFO.

FCR[2]: TX FIFO Reset
This bit is only active when FCR bit-0 is a ‘1’.
• Logic 0 = No transmit FIFO reset (default).
• Logic 1 = Reset the transmit FIFO pointers and FIFO level counter logic (the transmit shift register is not
   cleared or altered). This bit will return to a logic 0 after resetting the FIFO.
FCR[3]: DMA Mode Select
Controls the behavior of the TXRDY# and RXRDY# pins. See DMA operation section for details.
• Logic 0 = Normal Operation (default).
• Logic 1 = DMA Mode.
FCR[5:4]: Transmit FIFO Trigger Select
(logic 0 = default, TX trigger level = 1)
These 2 bits set the trigger level for the transmit FIFO. The UART will issue a transmit interrupt when the
number of characters in the FIFO falls below the selected trigger level, or when it gets empty in case that the
FIFO did not get filled over the trigger level on last re-load. Table 10 below shows the selections. EFR bit-4
must be set to ‘1’ before these bits can be accessed. Note that the receiver and the transmitter cannot use
different trigger tables. Whichever selection is made last applies to both the RX and TX side.
FCR[7:6]: Receive FIFO Trigger Select
(logic 0 = default, RX trigger level =1)
The FCTR Bits 5-4 are associated with these 2 bits. These 2 bits are used to set the trigger level for the receive
FIFO. The UART will issue a receive interrupt when the number of the characters in the FIFO crosses the
trigger level. Table 10 shows the complete selections. Note that the receiver and the transmitter cannot use
different trigger tables. Whichever selection is made last applies to both the RX and TX side.

LCR[4]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled with LCR bit-3 set to a logic 1, LCR BIT-4 selects the even or odd parity format.
• Logic 0 = ODD Parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format (default).
• Logic 1 = EVEN Parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format.
LCR[5]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled, LCR BIT-5 selects the forced parity format.
• LCR BIT-5 = logic 0, parity is not forced (default).
• LCR BIT-5 = logic 1 and LCR BIT-4 = logic 0, parity bit is forced to a logical 1 for the transmit and receive
   data.

LCR[6]: Transmit Break Enable
When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a
“space", LOW state). This condition remains, until disabled by setting LCR bit-6 to a logic 0.
• Logic 0 = No TX break condition. (default)
• Logic 1 = Forces the transmitter output (TX) to a “space”, LOW, for alerting the remote receiver of a line
   break condition.
LCR[7]: Baud Rate Divisors Enable
Baud rate generator divisor (DLL/DLM) enable.
• Logic 0 = Data registers are selected. (default)
• Logic 1 = Divisor latch registers are selected.
 4.7     Modem Control Register (MCR) or General Purpose Outputs Control - Read/Write
The MCR register is used for controlling the serial/modem interface signals or general purpose inputs/outputs.
MCR[0]: DTR# Output
The DTR# pin is a modem control output. If the modem interface is not used, this output may be used as a
general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force DTR# output HIGH (default).
• Logic 1 = Force DTR# output LOW.

MCR[1]: RTS# Output
The RTS# pin is a modem control output and may be used for automatic hardware flow control by enabled by
EFR bit-6. If the modem interface is not used, this output may be used as a general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force RTS# HIGH (default).
• Logic 1 = Force RTS# LOW.
MCR[2]: Reserved
OP1# is not available as an output pin on the 2750. But it is available for use during Internal Loopback Mode.
In the Loopback Mode, this bit is used to write the state of the modem RI# interface signal.
MCR[3]: OP2# Output / INT Output Enable
This bit enables or disables the operation of INT, interrupt output. If INT output is not used, OP2# can be used
as a general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = INT (A-B) outputs disabled (three state mode) and OP2# output set HIGH(default).
• Logic 1 = INT (A-B) outputs enabled (active mode) and OP2# output set LOW.
MCR[4]: Internal Loopback Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable loopback mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable local loopback mode, see loopback section and Figure 13.
MCR[5]: Xon-Any Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable Xon-Any function (for 16C550 compatibility, default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Xon-Any function. In this mode, any RX character received will resume transmit operation.
  The RX character will be loaded into the RX FIFO, unless the RX character is an Xon or Xoff character and
  the 2750 is programmed to use the Xon/Xoff flow control.
MCR[6]: Infrared Encoder/Decoder Enable
• Logic 0 = Enable the standard modem receive and transmit input/output interface. (Default)
• Logic 1 = Enable infrared IrDA receive and transmit inputs/outputs. The TX/RX output/input are routed to the
  infrared encoder/decoder. The data input and output levels conform to the IrDA infrared interface
  requirement. While in this mode, the infrared TX output will be a logic 0 during idle data conditions.
MCR[7]: Clock Prescaler Select
• Logic 0 = Divide by one. The input clock from the crystal or external clock is fed directly to the Programmable
  Baud Rate Generator without further modification, i.e., divide by one (default).
• Logic 1 = Divide by four. The prescaler divides the input clock from the crystal or external clock by four and
  feeds it to the Programmable Baud Rate Generator, hence, data rates become one forth.
 4.8     Line Status Register (LSR) - Read Only
This register provides the status of data transfers between the UART and the host.
LSR[0]: Receive Data Ready Indicator
• Logic 0 = No data in receive holding register or FIFO (default).
• Logic 1 = Data has been received and is saved in the receive holding register or FIFO.
LSR[1]: Receiver Overrun Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No overrun error (default).
• Logic 1 = Overrun error. A data overrun error condition occurred in the receive shift register. This happens
  when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In this case the previous data in the receive shift register
  is overwritten. Note that under this condition the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into
  the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.

LSR[2]: Receive Data Parity Error Tag
• Logic 0 = No parity error (default).
• Logic 1 = Parity error. The receive character in RHR does not have correct parity information and is suspect.
   This error is associated with the character available for reading in RHR.
LSR[3]: Receive Data Framing Error Tag
• Logic 0 = No framing error (default).
• Logic 1 = Framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). This error is associated with
   the character available for reading in RHR.
LSR[4]: Receive Break Error Tag
• Logic 0 = No break condition (default).
• Logic 1 = The receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for at least one character frame time). In the
   FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded into the FIFO.
LSR[5]: Transmit Holding Register Empty Flag
This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when the last data byte
is transferred from the transmit holding register to the transmit shift register. The bit is reset to logic 0
concurrently with the data loading to the transmit holding register by the host. In the FIFO mode this bit is set
when the transmit FIFO is empty, it is cleared when the transmit FIFO contains at least 1 byte.
LSR[6]: THR and TSR Empty Flag
This bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmitter goes idle. It is set to logic 0 whenever either the THR or
TSR contains a data character. In the FIFO mode this bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmit FIFO and
transmit shift register are both empty.
LSR[7]: Receive FIFO Data Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No FIFO error (default).
• Logic 1 = A global indicator for the sum of all error bits in the RX FIFO. At least one parity error, framing error
   or break indication is in the FIFO data. This bit clears when there is no more error(s) in any of the bytes in the
   RX FIFO.
 4.9      Modem Status Register (MSR) - Read Only
This register provides the current state of the modem interface input signals. Lower four bits of this register are
used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a signal from the modem
changes state. These bits may be used for general purpose inputs when they are not used with modem
signals.
MSR[0]: Delta CTS# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CTS# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The CTS# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
   will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[1]: Delta DSR# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on DSR# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The DSR# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
   will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[2]: Delta RI# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on RI# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The RI# input has changed from a LOW to HIGH, ending of the ringing signal. A modem status
   interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).

MSR[3]: Delta CD# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CD# input (default).
• Logic 1 = Indicates that the CD# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem
   status interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[4]: CTS Input Status
CTS# pin may function as automatic hardware flow control signal input if it is enabled and selected by Auto
CTS (EFR bit-7). Auto CTS flow control allows starting and stopping of local data transmissions based on the
modem CTS# signal. A HIGH on the CTS# pin will stop UART transmitter as soon as the current character has
finished transmission, and a LOW will resume data transmission. Normally MSR bit-4 bit is the compliment of
the CTS# input. However in the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the RTS# bit in the MCR register. The
CTS# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
MSR[5]: DSR Input Status
Normally this bit is the complement of the DSR# input. In the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the DTR#
bit in the MCR register. The DSR# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is
not used.
MSR[6]: RI Input Status
Normally this bit is the complement of the RI# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-2 in the
MCR register. The RI# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
MSR[7]: CD Input Status
Normally this bit is the complement of the CD# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-3 in the
MCR register. The CD# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
 4.10     Scratch Pad Register (SPR) - Read/Write
This is a 8-bit general purpose register for the user to store temporary data. The content of this register is
preserved during sleep mode but becomes 0xFF (default) after a reset or a power off-on cycle.
 4.11     Enhanced Mode Select Register (EMSR)
This register replaces SPR (during a Write) and is accessible only when FCTR[6] = 1.
EMSR[1:0]: Receive/Transmit FIFO Level Count (Write-Only)
When Scratchpad Swap (FCTR[6]) is asserted, EMSR bits 1-0 controls what mode the FIFO Level Counter is
operating in.

During Alternate RX/TX FIFO Level Counter Mode, the first value read after EMSR bits 1-0 have been
asserted will always be the RX FIFO Level Counter. The second value read will correspond with the TX FIFO
Level Counter. The next value will be the RX FIFO Level Counter again, then the TX FIFO Level Counter and
so on and so forth.

EMSR[6]: LSR Interrupt Mode
• Logic 0 = LSR Interrupt Delayed (for 16C2550 compatibility, default). LSR bits 2, 3, and 4 will generate an
  interrupt when the character with the error is in the RHR.
• Logic 1 = LSR Interrupt Immediate. LSR bits 2, 3, and 4 will generate an interrupt as soon as the character is
  received into the FIFO.
EMSR[7]: 16X Sampling Rate Mode
Logic 0 = 8X Sampling Rate.
Logic 1 = 16X Sampling Rate (for 16C550 compatibility, default).
 4.12    FIFO Level Register (FLVL) - Read-Only
The FIFO Level Register replaces the Scratchpad Register (during a Read) when FCTR[6] = 1. Note that this is
not identical to the FIFO Data Count Register which can be accessed when LCR = 0xBF.
FLVL[7:0]: FIFO Level Register
This register provides the FIFO counter level for the RX FIFO or the TX FIFO or both depending on EMSR[1:0].
See Table 12 for details.
 4.13    Baud Rate Generator Registers (DLL and DLM) - Read/Write
The concatenation of the contents of DLM and DLL gives the 16-bit divisor value which is used to calculate the
baud rate:
• Baud Rate = (Clock Frequency / 16) / Divisor
See MCR bit-7 and the baud rate table also.
 4.14    Device Identification Register (DVID) - Read Only
This register contains the device ID (0x0A for XR16L2750). Prior to reading this register, DLL and DLM should
be set to 0x00.

 4.15    Device Revision Register (DREV) - Read Only
This register contains the device revision information. For example, 0x01 means revision A. Prior to reading
this register, DLL and DLM should be set to 0x00.
 4.16    Trigger Level Register (TRG) - Write-Only
User Programmable Transmit/Receive Trigger Level Register.
TRG[7:0]: Trigger Level Register
These bits are used to program desired trigger levels when trigger Table-D is selected. FCTR bit-7 selects
between programming the RX Trigger Level (a logic 0) and the TX Trigger Level (a logic 1).
 4.17    RX/TX FIFO Level Count Register (FC) - Read-Only
This register is accessible when LCR = 0xBF. Note that this register is not identical to the FIFO Level Count
Register which is located in the general register set when FCTR bit-6 = 1 (Scratchpad Register Swap). It is
suggested to read the FIFO Level Count Register at the Scratchpad Register location when FCTR bit-6 = 1.
See Table 12.
FC[7:0]: RX/TX FIFO Level Count
Receive/Transmit FIFO Level Count. Number of characters in Receiver FIFO (FCTR[7] = 0) or Transmitter
FIFO (FCTR[7] = 1) can be read via this register.
 4.18      Feature Control Register (FCTR) - Read/Write
This register controls the XR16L2750 new functions that are not available in ST16C2450 or ST16C2550.
FCTR[1:0]: RTS Hysteresis
User selectable RTS# hysteresis levels for hardware flow control application. After reset, these bits are set to
“0” to select the next trigger level for hardware flow control. See Table 13 for more details.
FCTR[2]: IrDa RX Inversion
• Logic 0 = Select RX input as encoded IrDa data (Idle state will be LOW).
• Logic 1 = Select RX input as inverted encoded IrDa data (Idle state will be HIGH).
FCTR[3]: Auto RS-485 Direction Control
• Logic 0 = Standard ST16C550 mode. Transmitter generates an interrupt when transmit holding register
  becomes empty and transmit shift register is shifting data out.
• Logic 1 = Enable Auto RS485 Direction Control function. The direction control signal, RTS# pin, changes its
  output logic state from LOW to HIGH one bit time after the last stop bit of the last character is shifted out.
  Also, the Transmit interrupt generation is delayed until the transmitter shift register becomes empty. The
  RTS# output pin will automatically return to a LOW when a data byte is loaded into the TX FIFO. However,
  RTS# behavior can be inverted by setting EMSR[3] = 1.

 4.19    Enhanced Feature Register (EFR)
Enhanced features are enabled or disabled using this register. Bit 0-3 provide single or dual consecutive
character software flow control selection (see Table 15). When the Xon1 and Xon2 and Xoff1 and Xoff2 modes
are selected, the double 8-bit words are concatenated into two sequential characters. Caution: note that
whenever changing the TX or RX flow control bits, always reset all bits back to logic 0 (disable) before
programming a new setting.

EFR[4]: Enhanced Function Bits Enable
Enhanced function control bit. This bit enables IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, FCR bits 4-5, and MCR bits 5-7 to be
modified. After modifying any enhanced bits, EFR bit-4 can be set to a logic 0 to latch the new values. This
feature prevents legacy software from altering or overwriting the enhanced functions once set. Normally, it is
recommended to leave it enabled, logic 1.
• Logic 0 = modification disable/latch enhanced features. IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, FCR bits 4-5, and MCR
  bits 5-7 are saved to retain the user settings. After a reset, the IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, FCR bits 4-5, and
  MCR bits 5-7 are set to a logic 0 to be compatible with ST16C550 mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enables the above-mentioned register bits to be modified by the user.
EFR[5]: Special Character Detect Enable
• Logic 0 = Special Character Detect Disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Special Character Detect Enabled. The UART compares each incoming receive character with
  data in Xoff-2 register. If a match exists, the receive data will be transferred to FIFO and ISR bit-4 will be set
  to indicate detection of the special character. Bit-0 corresponds with the LSB bit of the receive character. If
  flow control is set for comparing Xon1, Xoff1 (EFR [1:0]= ‘10’) then flow control and special character work
  normally. However, if flow control is set for comparing Xon2, Xoff2 (EFR[1:0]= ‘01’) then flow control works
  normally, but Xoff2 will not go to the FIFO, and will generate an Xoff interrupt and a special character
  interrupt, if enabled via IER bit-5.
EFR[6]: Auto RTS Flow Control Enable
RTS# output may be used for hardware flow control by setting EFR bit-6 to logic 1. When Auto RTS is
selected, an interrupt will be generated when the receive FIFO is filled to the programmed trigger level and
RTS de-asserts HIGH at the next upper trigger level or hysteresis level. RTS# will return LOW when FIFO data
falls below the next lower trigger level. The RTS# output must be asserted (LOW) before the auto RTS can
take effect. RTS# pin will function as a general purpose output when hardware flow control is disabled.
• Logic 0 = Automatic RTS flow control is disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Automatic RTS flow control.
EFR[7]: Auto CTS Flow Control Enable
Automatic CTS Flow Control.
• Logic 0 = Automatic CTS flow control is disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Automatic CTS flow control. Data transmission stops when CTS# input de-asserts HIGH.
  Data transmission resumes when CTS# returns LOW.
 4.19.1    Software Flow Control Registers (XOFF1, XOFF2, XON1, XON2) - Read/Write
These registers are used as the programmable software flow control characters xoff1, xoff2, xon1, and xon2.

D7, IOR#, IOW#, CSA#, CSB# and all modem inputs. Also, RXA and RXB inputs must idle at logic 1 state
while asleep. Floating inputs will result in sleep currents in the mA range. For PowerSave feature that isolates
address, data and control signals, please see the XR16L2751 datasheet.
