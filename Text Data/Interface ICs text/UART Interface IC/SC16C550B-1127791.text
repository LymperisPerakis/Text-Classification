                              Rev. 6 — 16 December 2014                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
                          The SC16C550B is a Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) used for
                          serial data communications. Its principal function is to convert parallel data into serial data,
                          and vice versa. The UART can handle serial data rates up to 3 Mbit/s.
                          The SC16C550B is pin compatible with the ST16C550, TL16C550 and PC16C550, and it
                          will power-up to be functionally equivalent to the 16C450. The SC16C550B also provides
                          DMA mode data transfers through FIFO trigger levels and the TXRDY and RXRDY
                          signals (TXRDY and RXRDY are not supported in the HVQFN32 package). On-board
                          status registers provide the user with error indications, operational status, and modem
                          interface control. System interrupts may be tailored to meet user requirements. An internal
                          loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics.
                          The SC16C550B operates at 5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V, and the Industrial temperature range,
                          and is available in plastic HVQFN32, DIP40, PLCC44 and LQFP48 packages.

6. Functional description
                              The SC16C550B provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization,
                              parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and
                              receiver sections. These functions are necessary for converting the serial data stream into
                              parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization for the serial data
                              stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to form a data
                              character (character orientated protocol). Data integrity is insured by attaching a parity bit
                              to the data character. The parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit
                              errors. The SC16C550B is fabricated with an advanced CMOS process to achieve low
                              drain power and high speed requirements.
                              The SC16C550B is an upward solution that provides 16 bytes of transmit and receive
                              FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C450. The SC16C550B is designed to work with
                              high speed modems and shared network environments that require fast data processing
                              time. Increased performance is realized in the SC16C550B by the larger transmit and
                              receive FIFOs. This allows the external processor to handle more networking tasks within
                              a given time. In addition, the four selectable levels of FIFO trigger interrupt are provided
                              for maximum data throughput performance, especially when operating in a multi-channel
                              environment. The combination of the above greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of
                              the external controlling CPU, increases performance, and reduces power consumption.
                              The SC16C550B is capable of operation up to 3 Mbit/s with a 48 MHz external clock input
                              (at 5 V).

                       interrupt status and control registers (IER/ISR), a FIFO Control Register (FCR), line status

                   6.2 FIFO operation
                       The 16-byte transmit and receive data FIFOs are enabled by the FIFO Control Register
                       bit 0 (FCR[0]). With 16C550 devices, the user can set the receive trigger level, but not the
                       transmit trigger level. The receiver FIFO section includes a time-out function to ensure
                       data is delivered to the external CPU. An interrupt is generated whenever the Receive
                       Holding Register (RHR) has not been read following the loading of a character or the
                       receive trigger level has not been reached.

                                                                                                5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V UART with 16-byte FIFOs
                   6.3 Autoflow control
                        Autoflow control is comprised of auto-CTS and auto-RTS (see Figure 6). With auto-CTS,
                        the CTS input must be active before the transmitter FIFO can emit data. With auto-RTS,
                        RTS becomes active when the receiver needs more data and notifies the sending serial
                        device. When RTS is connected to CTS, data transmission does not occur unless the
                        receiver FIFO has space for the data; thus, overrun errors are eliminated using UART 1
                        and UART 2 from a SC16C550B with the autoflow control enabled. If not, overrun errors
                        occur when the transmit data rate exceeds the receiver FIFO read latency.

  Fig 6.    Autoflow control (auto-RTS and auto-CTS) example
                 6.3.1 Auto-RTS
                        Auto-RTS data flow control originates in the receiver timing and control block (refer to
                        Figure 1 “Block diagram of SC16C550B”) and is linked to the programmed receiver FIFO
                        trigger level (see Figure 6). When the receiver FIFO level reaches a trigger level of 1, 4,
                        or 8 (see Figure 8), RTS is de-asserted. With trigger levels of 1, 4, and 8, the sending
                        UART may send an additional byte after the trigger level is reached (assuming the
                        sending UART has another byte to send) because it may not recognize the de-assertion
                        of RTS until after it has begun sending the additional byte. RTS is automatically
                        reasserted once the RX FIFO is emptied by reading the receiver buffer register. When the
                        trigger level is 14 (see Figure 9), RTS is de-asserted after the first data bit of the 16th
                        character is present on the RX line. RTS is reasserted when the RX FIFO has at least one
                        available byte space.
                 6.3.2 Auto-CTS
                        The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before sending the next data byte (see Figure 6).
                        When CTS is active, it sends the next byte. To stop the transmitter from sending the
                        following byte, CTS must be released before the middle of the last stop bit that is currently
                        being sent (see Figure 7). The auto-CTS function reduces interrupts to the host system.
                        When flow control is enabled, CTS level changes do not trigger host interrupts because
                        the device automatically controls its own transmitter. Without auto-CTS, the transmitter
                        sends any data present in the transmit FIFO and a receiver overrun error may result.

         (1) When CTS is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
         (2) If CTS goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current byte, the transmitter finishes sending the current byte, but
             it does not send the next byte.
         (3) When CTS goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

        (1) RTS is de-asserted when the receiver receives the first data bit of the sixteenth byte. The receive FIFO is full after finishing the
            sixteenth byte.
        (2) RTS is asserted again when there is at least one byte of space available and no incoming byte is in processing, or there is more
            than one byte of space available.
        (3) When the receive FIFO is full, the first receive buffer register read re-asserts RTS.

                     6.4 Hardware/software and time-out interrupts
                             Following a reset, the transmitter interrupt is enabled, the SC16C550B will issue an
                             interrupt to indicate that the Transmit Holding Register is empty. This interrupt must be
                             serviced prior to continuing operations. The ISR register provides the current singular
                             highest priority interrupt only. Only after servicing the higher pending interrupt will the
                             lower priority be reflected in the status register. Servicing the interrupt without
                             investigating further interrupt conditions can result in data errors.
                             When two interrupt conditions have the same priority, it is important to service these
                             interrupts correctly. Receive Data Ready and Receive Time-Out have the same interrupt
                             priority (when enabled by IER[0]). The receiver issues an interrupt after the number of
                             characters have reached the programmed trigger level. In this case, the SC16C550B
                             FIFO may hold more characters than the programmed trigger level. Following the removal
                             of a data byte, the user should re-check LSR[0] for additional characters. A Receive
                             Time-Out will not occur if the receive FIFO is empty. The time-out counter is reset at the
                             center of each stop bit received or each time the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is read.
                             The actual time-out value is 4 character time, including data information length, start bit,
                             parity bit, and the size of stop bit, that is, 1, 1.5, or 2 bit times.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                               SC16C550B
                                                                                              5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V UART with 16-byte FIFOs
                   6.5 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C550B supports high speed modem technologies that have increased input
                       data rates by employing data compression schemes. For example, a 33.6 kbit/s modem
                       that employs data compression may require a 115.2 kbit/s input data rate. A 128.0 kbit/s
                       ISDN modem that supports data compression may need an input data rate of 460.8 kbit/s.
                       The SC16C550B can support a standard data rate of 921.6 kbit/s.
                       A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver, allowing
                       independent TX/RX channel control. The programmable baud rate generator is capable of
                       accepting an input clock up to 48 MHz, as required for supporting a 3 Mbit/s data rate.
                       The SC16C550B can be configured for internal or external clock operation. For internal
                       clock oscillator operation, an industry standard microprocessor crystal is connected
                       externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 10). Alternatively, an external
                       clock can be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the internal baud rate generator for
                       standard or custom rates (see Table 6).

                       The generator divides the input 16 clock by any divisor from 1 to (216  1). The
                       SC16C550B divides the basic crystal or external clock by 16. The frequency of the
                       BAUDOUT output pin is exactly 16 (16 times) the selected baud rate
                       (BAUDOUT = 16  baud rate). Customized baud rates can be achieved by selecting the
                       proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB sections of the baud rate generator.
                       Programming the baud rate generator registers DLM (MSB) and DLL (LSB) provides a
                       user capability for selecting the desired final baud rate. The examples in Table 6 shows
                       selectable baud rates when using a 1.8432 MHz crystal.
                       For custom baud rates, the divisor value can be calculated using the following equation:
                                                          XTAL1 clock frequency

                   6.6 DMA operation
                       The SC16C550B FIFO trigger level provides additional flexibility to the user for block
                       mode operation. The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive FIFOs in the
                       DMA mode (FCR[3]). The DMA mode affects the state of the RXRDY and TXRDY output
                       pins. Table 7 and Table 8 show this.
                       Remark: DMA operation is not supported in the HVQFN32 package.

                                                                                              5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V UART with 16-byte FIFOs
                   6.7 Loopback mode
                       The internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. In the loopback mode, the
                       normal modem interface pins are disconnected and reconfigured for loopback internally.
                       MCR[3:0] register bits are used for controlling loopback diagnostic testing. In the loopback
                       mode, OUT1 (bit 2) and OUT2 (bit 3) in the MCR register control the modem RI and DCD
                       inputs, respectively. MCR signals DTR and RTS (bits 0:1) are used to control the modem
                       CTS and DSR inputs, respectively. The transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX)
                       are disconnected from their associated interface pins, and instead are connected together
                       internally (see Figure 11). The inputs CTS, DSR, DCD, and RI are disconnected from their
                       normal modem control input pins, and instead are connected internally to DTR, RTS,
                       OUT1 and OUT2. Loopback test data is entered into the transmit holding register via the
                       user data bus interface, D0 to D7. The transmit UART serializes the data and passes the
                       serial data to the receive UART via the internal loopback connection. The receive UART
                       converts the serial data back into parallel data that is then made available at the user data
                       interface D0 to D7. The user optionally compares the received data to the initial
                       transmitted data for verifying error-free operation of the UART TX/RX circuits.
                       In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The Modem
                       Control Interrupts are also operational. However, the interrupts can only be read using the
                       lower four bits of the Modem Status Register (MSR[3:0]) instead of the four Modem Status
                       Register bits 7:4. The interrupts are still controlled by the IER.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                      SC16C550B
                                                                                                5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V UART with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.1 Transmit Holding Register (THR) and Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                       The serial transmitter section consists of an 8-bit Transmit Holding Register (THR) and
                       Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The status of the THR is provided in the Line Status
                       Register (LSR). Writing to the THR transfers the contents of the data bus (D[7:0]) to the
                       THR, providing that the THR or TSR is empty. The THR empty flag in the LSR register will
                       be set to a logic 1 when the transmitter is empty or when data is transferred to the TSR.
                       Note that a write operation can be performed when the THR empty flag is set
                       (logic 0 = FIFO full; logic 1 = at least one FIFO location available).
                       The serial receive section also contains an 8-bit Receive Holding Register (RHR).
                       Receive data is removed from the SC16C550B and receive FIFO by reading the RHR
                       register. The receive section provides a mechanism to prevent false starts. On the falling
                       edge of a start or false start bit, an internal receiver counter starts counting clocks at the
                       16 clock rate. After 71⁄2 clocks, the start bit time should be shifted to the center of the
                       start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled, and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated.
                       Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false
                       character. Receiver status codes will be posted in the LSR.
                   7.2 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                       The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receiver ready, transmitter
                       empty, line status and modem status registers. These interrupts would normally be seen
                       on the INT output pin.

                        2      IER[2]        Receive Line Status interrupt. This interrupt will be issued whenever a fully
                                             assembled receive character is transferred from RSR to the RHR/FIFO, that is,
                                             data ready, LSR[0].
                                                  logic 0 = disable the receiver line status interrupt (normal default condition)

                                                                                              5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V UART with 16-byte FIFOs
                7.2.1 IER versus Receive FIFO interrupt mode operation
                       When the receive FIFO (FCR[0] = logic 1), and receive interrupts (IER[0] = logic 1) are
                       enabled, the receive interrupts and register status will reflect the following:
                         • The receive data available interrupts are issued to the external CPU when the FIFO
                           has reached the programmed trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops
                           below the programmed trigger level.
                         • FIFO status will also be reflected in the user accessible ISR register when the FIFO
                           trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register status bit and the interrupt will be
                           cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                         • The data ready bit (LSR[0]) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift
                           register to the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
                7.2.2 IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO polled mode operation
                       When FCR[0] = logic 1, resetting IER[0:3] enables the SC16C550B in the FIFO polled
                       mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR,
                       either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive
                       control bit(s).
                         • LSR[0] will be a logic 1 as long as there is one byte in the receive FIFO.
                         • LSR[1:4] will provide the type of errors encountered, if any.
                         • LSR[5] will indicate when the transmit FIFO is empty.
                         • LSR[6] will indicate when both the transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are empty.
                         • LSR[7] will indicate any FIFO data errors.
                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the receive FIFO trigger
                       levels, and select the DMA mode.
                7.3.1 DMA mode
                       (DMA mode does not exist in the HVQFN32 package; see Table 9.)
               7.3.1.1 Mode 0 (FCR bit 3 = 0)
                       Set and enable the interrupt for each single transmit or receive operation, and is similar to
                       the 16C450 mode. Transmit Ready (TXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever an empty
                       transmit space is available in the Transmit Holding Register (THR). Receive Ready
                       (RXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is loaded with
                       a character.
               7.3.1.2 Mode 1 (FCR bit 3 = 1)
                       Set and enable the interrupt in a block mode operation. The transmit interrupt is set when
                       the transmit FIFO is empty. The receive interrupt is set when the receive FIFO fills to the
                       programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO continues to fill regardless of the
                       programmed level until the FIFO is full. RXRDY remains a logic 0 as long as the FIFO fill
                       level is above the programmed trigger level.

                   7.4 Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
                       The SC16C550B provides four levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external software
                       interaction. The Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with four interrupt status
                       bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR will provide the user with the highest pending
                       interrupt level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowledged until the pending
                       interrupt is serviced. Whenever the interrupt status register is read, the interrupt status is
                       cleared. However, it should be noted that only the current pending interrupt is cleared by
                       the read. A lower level interrupt may be seen after re-reading the interrupt status bits.
                       Table 13 “Interrupt source” shows the data values (bits 3:0) for the four prioritized interrupt
                       levels and the interrupt sources associated with each of these interrupt levels.

                   7.5 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       The Line Control Register is used to specify the asynchronous data communication
                       format. The word length, the number of stop bits, and the parity are selected by writing the
                       appropriate bits in this register.

                                               Feature mode enable.
                                                  logic 0 = divisor latch disabled (normal default condition)
                                                  logic 1 = divisor latch and enhanced feature register enabled
                        6     LCR[6]           Set break. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to
                                               be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This condition exists
                                               until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.
                                                  logic 0 = no TX break condition (normal default condition)
                                                  logic 1 = forces the transmitter output (TX) to a logic 0 for alerting the
                                                  remote receiver to a line break condition
                        5     LCR[5]           Set parity. If the parity bit is enabled, LCR[5] selects the forced parity format.
                                               Programs the parity conditions (see Table 16).
                                                  logic 0 = parity is not forced (normal default condition)

                                                  the transmit and receive data
                        4     LCR[4]           Even parity. If the parity bit is enabled with LCR[3] set to a logic 1, LCR[4]
                                               selects the even or odd parity format.
                                                  logic 0 = odd parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1s in the
                                                  transmitted data. The receiver must be programmed to check the same
                                                  format (normal default condition).
                                                  logic 1 = even parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1s in
                                                  the transmitted data. The receiver must be programmed to check the same
                                                  format.
                        3     LCR[3]           Parity enable. Parity or no parity can be selected via this bit.

                        2     LCR[2]           Stop bits. The length of stop bit is specified by this bit in conjunction with the
                                               programmed word length (see Table 17).

                   7.6 Modem Control Register (MCR)
                       This register controls the interface with the modem or a peripheral device.
                       Table 19.  Modem Control Register bits description
                       Bit       Symbol             Description

                       5         MCR[5]             Auto flow control enable.
                       4         MCR[4]             Loopback. Enable the local loopback mode (diagnostics). In this mode the
                                                    transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX), CTS, DSR, DCD, and
                                                    RI are disconnected from the SC16C550B I/O pins. Internally the modem
                                                    data and control pins are connected into a loopback data configuration
                                                    (see Figure 11). In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts
                                                    remain fully operational. The Modem Control Interrupts are also
                                                    operational, but the interrupts’ sources are switched to the lower four bits
                                                    of the Modem Control. Interrupts continue to be controlled by the IER
                                                    register.
                                                        logic 0 = disable loopback mode (normal default condition)
                                                        logic 1 = enable local loopback mode (diagnostics)
                       3         MCR[3]             OUT2. Used to control the modem DCD signal in the loopback mode.
                                                        logic 0 = OUT2 is at logic 1. In the loopback mode, sets OUT2 (DCD)
                                                        internally to a logic 1.
                                                        logic 1 = OUT2 is at logic 0. In the loopback mode, sets OUT2 (DCD)
                                                        internally to a logic 0.
                       2         MCR[2]             OUT1. This bit is used in the Loopback mode only. In the loopback mode,
                                                    this bit is used to write the state of the modem RI interface signal via
                                                    OUT1.

                   7.7 Line Status Register (LSR)
                       This register provides the status of data transfers between the SC16C550B and the CPU.
                       Table 20.  Line Status Register bits description
                       Bit    Symbol    Description
                       7      LSR[7]    FIFO data error.
                                              logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = at least one parity error, framing error or break indication is in the
                                              current FIFO data. This bit is cleared when LSR register is read.
                       6      LSR[6]    THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator. This bit is set to a
                                        logic 1 whenever the transmit holding register and the transmit shift register are
                                        both empty. It is reset to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a data
                                        character. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set to ‘1’ whenever the transmit FIFO and
                                        transmit shift register are both empty.
                       5      LSR[5]    THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit
                                        indicates that the UART is ready to accept a new character for transmission. In
                                        addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to CPU when the THR
                                        interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
                                        transferred from the transmit holding register into the transmitter shift register.
                                        The bit is reset to a logic 0 concurrently with the loading of the transmitter holding
                                        register by the CPU. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is
                                        empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the transmit FIFO.
                       4      LSR[4]    Break interrupt.
                                              logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = the receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one
                                              character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded
                                              into the FIFO.
                       3      LSR[3]    Framing error.
                                              logic 0 = no framing error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). In
                                              the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the top of the
                                              FIFO.
                       2      LSR[2]    Parity error.
                                              logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = parity error. The receive character does not have correct parity
                                              information and is suspect. In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the
                                              character at the top of the FIFO.
                       1      LSR[1]    Overrun error.
                                              logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = overrun error. A data overrun error occurred in the receive shift
                                              register. This happens when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In
                                              this case, the previous data in the shift register is overwritten. Note that under
                                              this condition, the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into
                                              the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.
                       0      LSR[0]    Receive data ready.
                                              logic 0 = no data in receive holding register or FIFO (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = data has been received and is saved in the receive holding register or
                                              FIFO

                   7.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This register provides the current state of the control interface signals from the modem, or
                       other peripheral device to which the SC16C550B is connected. Four bits of this register
                       are used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a
                       control input from the modem changes state. These bits are set to a logic 0 whenever the
                       CPU reads this register.
                       Table 21.  Modem Status Register bits description
                        Bit     Symbol          Description
                        7       MSR[7]          Data Carrier Detect. DCD (active HIGH, logical 1). Normally this bit is the
                                                complement of the DCD input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to
                                                the OUT2 bit in the MCR register.
                        6       MSR[6]          Ring Indicator. RI (active HIGH, logical 1). Normally this bit is the
                                                complement of the RI input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the
                                                OUT1 bit in the MCR register.
                        5       MSR[5]          Data Set Ready. DSR (active HIGH, logical 1). Normally this bit is the
                                                complement of the DSR input. In loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the
                                                DTR bit in the MCR register.
                        4       MSR[4]          Clear To Send. CTS. CTS functions as hardware flow control signal input if it
                                                is enabled via MCR[5]. The transmit holding register flow control is
                                                enabled/disabled by MSR[4]. Flow control (when enabled) allows starting and
                                                stopping the transmissions based on the external modem CTS signal. A logic
                                                1 at the CTS pin will stop SC16C550B transmissions as soon as current
                                                character has finished transmission. Normally MSR[4] is the complement of
                                                the CTS input. However, in the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the
                                                RTS bit in the MCR register.

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are

                                                                                            5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V UART with 16-byte FIFOs
                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 28) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 27 and 28

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 28.

13. Soldering of through-hole mount packages
                13.1 Introduction to soldering through-hole mount packages
                     This text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.
                     Wave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages
                     on a printed-circuit board.
                13.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave
                     Driven by legislation and environmental forces the worldwide use of lead-free solder
                     pastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from
                     3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 C or 265 C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb
                     or Pb-free respectively.
                     The total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.
                     The device may be mounted up to the seating plane, but the temperature of the plastic
                     body must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (Tstg(max)). If the
                     printed-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately
                     after soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.
                13.3 Manual soldering
                     Apply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the
                     seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If the temperature of the soldering iron bit is
                     less than 300 C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is
                     between 300 C and 400 C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.
