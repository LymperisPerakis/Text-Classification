1. General description
                          The SC16C650B is a Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) used for
                          serial data communications. Its principal function is to convert parallel data into serial
                          data, and vice versa. The UART can handle serial data rates up to 3 Mbit/s.
                          The SC16C650B is pin compatible with the ST16C650A and it will power-up to be
                          functionally equivalent to the 16C450. Programming of control registers enables the
                          added features of the SC16C650B. Some of these added features are the 32-byte receive
                          and transmit FIFOs, automatic hardware or software flow control and infrared
                          encoding/decoding. The selectable auto-flow control feature significantly reduces software
                          overload and increases system efficiency while in FIFO mode by automatically controlling
                          serial data flow using RTS output and CTS input signals. The SC16C650B also provides
                          DMA mode data transfers through FIFO trigger levels and the RXRDY and TXRDY
                          signals. On-board status registers provide the user with error indications, operational
                          status, and modem interface control. System interrupts may be tailored to meet user
                          requirements. An internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics.
                          The SC16C650B operates at 5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V, and the industrial temperature range,
                          and is available in plastic PLCC44, LQFP48, and HVQFN32 packages.

CTS            40        38           25        I            Clear to send. CTS is a modem status signal. Its condition can be
                                                             checked by reading bit 4 (CTS) of the Modem Status Register
                                                             (MSR). MSR[0] (∆CTS) indicates that CTS has changed states
                                                             since the last read from the MSR. If the modem status interrupt is
                                                             enabled when CTS changes levels and the auto-CTS mode is not
                                                             enabled, an interrupt is generated. CTS is also used in the

 DCD          42        40        -    I         Data carrier detect. DCD is a modem status signal. Its condition
                                                 can be checked by reading MSR[7] (DCD). MSR[3] (∆DCD)
                                                 indicates that DCD has changed states since the last read from the
                                                 MSR. If the modem status interrupt is enabled when DCD changes
                                                 levels, an interrupt is generated.
 DDIS         26        22        -    O         Driver disable. DDIS is active (LOW) when the CPU is reading
                                                 data. When inactive (HIGH), DDIS can disable an external
                                                 transceiver.
 DSR          41        39        26   I         Data set ready. DSR is a modem status signal. Its condition can be
                                                 checked by reading MSR[5] (DSR). MSR[1] (∆DSR) indicates DSR
                                                 has changed levels since the last read from the MSR. If the modem
                                                 status interrupt is enabled when DSR changes levels, an interrupt is
                                                 generated.
 DTR          37        33        22   O         Data terminal ready. When active (LOW), DTR informs a modem
                                                 or data set that the UART is ready to establish communication. DTR
                                                 is placed in the active level by setting the DTR bit of the Modem
                                                 Control Register. DTR is placed in the inactive level either as a
                                                 result of a Master Reset, during loopback mode operation, or
                                                 clearing the DTR bit.
 INT          33        30        20   O         Interrupt. When active (HIGH), INT informs the CPU that the UART
                                                 has an interrupt to be serviced. Four conditions that cause an
                                                 interrupt to be issued are: a receiver error, received data that is
                                                 available or timed out (FIFO mode only), an empty transmitter
                                                 holding register or an enabled modem status interrupt. INT is reset
                                                 (deactivated) either when the interrupt is serviced or as a result of a
                                                 Master Reset.
 OUT1         38        34        -    O         Outputs 1 and 2. These are user-designated output terminals that
 OUT2         35        31        -    O         are set to the active (low) level by setting respective Modem Control
                                                 Register (MCR) bits (OUT1 and OUT2). OUT1 and OUT2 are set to
 OUT          -         -         23   O         the inactive (HIGH) level as a result of Master Reset, during
                                                 loopback mode operations, or by clearing bit 2 (OUT1) or bit 3
                                                 (OUT2) of the MCR.
 RCLK         10        5         4    I         Receiver clock. RCLK is the 16× baud rate clock for the receiver
                                                 section of the UART.
 IOR          25        20        -    I         Read inputs. When either IOR or IOR is active (LOW or HIGH,
 IOR          24        19        14   I         respectively) while the UART is selected, the CPU is allowed to
                                                 read status information or data from a selected UART register. Only
                                                 one of these inputs is required for the transfer of data during a read
                                                 operation; the other input should be tied to its inactive level (i.e.,
                                                 IOR tied LOW or IOR tied HIGH).

 RESET        39        35        24    I         Master Reset. When active (HIGH), MR clears most UART
                                                  registers and sets the levels of various output signals.
 RI           43        41        -     I         Ring indicator. RI is a modem status signal. Its condition can be
                                                  checked by reading MSR[6] (RI). MSR[2] (∆RI) indicates that RI has
                                                  changed from a LOW to a HIGH level since the last read from the
                                                  MSR. If the modem status interrupt is enabled when this transition
                                                  occurs, an interrupt is generated.
 RTS          36        32        21    O         Request to send. When active, RTS informs the modem or data
                                                  set that the UART is ready to receive data. RTS is set to the active
                                                  level by setting the RTS modem control register bit and is set to the
                                                  inactive (HIGH) level either as a result of a Master Reset or during
                                                  loopback mode operations or by clearing bit 1 (RTS) of the MCR. In
                                                  the auto-RTS mode, RTS is set to the inactive level by the receiver
                                                  threshold control logic.
 RXRDY        32        29        19    O         Receiver ready. Receiver direct memory access (DMA) signaling is
                                                  available with RXRDY. When operating in the FIFO mode, one of
                                                  two types of DMA signaling can be selected using the FIFO Control
                                                  Register bit 3 (FCR[3]). When operating in the 16C450 mode, only
                                                  DMA mode 0 is allowed. Mode 0 supports single-transfer DMA in
                                                  which a transfer is made between CPU bus cycles. Mode 1
                                                  supports multi-transfer DMA in which multiple transfers are made
                                                  continuously until the receiver FIFO has been emptied. In DMA
                                                  mode 0 (FCR[0] = 0 or FCR[0] = 1, FCR[3] = 0), when there is at
                                                  least one character in the receiver FIFO or Receive Holding
                                                  Register, RXRDY is active (LOW). When RXRDY has been active
                                                  but there are no characters in the FIFO or holding register, RXRDY
                                                  goes inactive (HIGH). In DMA mode 1 (FCR[0] = 1, FCR[3] = 1),
                                                  when the trigger level or the time-out has been reached, RXRDY
                                                  goes active (LOW); when it has been active but there are no more
                                                  characters in the FIFO or holding register, it goes inactive (HIGH).
 RX           11        7         5     I         Serial data input. RX is serial data input from a connected
                                                  communications device.
 TX           13        8         6     O         Serial data output. TX is composite serial data output to a
                                                  connected communication device. TX is set to the marking (HIGH)
                                                  level as a result of Master Reset.
 TXRDY        27        23        15    O         Transmitter ready. Transmitter DMA signaling is available with
                                                  TXRDY. When operating in the FIFO mode, one of two types of
                                                  DMA signaling can be selected using FCR[3]. When operating in
                                                  the 16C450 mode, only DMA mode 0 is allowed. Mode 0 supports
                                                  single-transfer DMA in which a transfer is made between CPU bus
                                                  cycles. Mode 1 supports multi-transfer DMA in which multiple
                                                  transfers are made continuously until the transmit FIFO has been
                                                  filled.

 IOW          21        17        -     I         Write inputs. When either IOW or IOW is active (LOW or HIGH,
 IOW          20        16        11    I         respectively) and while the UART is selected, the CPU is allowed to
                                                  write control words or data into a selected UART register. Only one
                                                  of these inputs is required to transfer data during a write operation;
                                                  the other input should be tied to its inactive level (i.e., IOW tied LOW
                                                  or IOW tied HIGH).

[1]   HVQFN32 package die supply ground is connected to both GND pin and exposed center pad. GND pin must be connected to supply
      ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be
      soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias
      need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

6. Functional description
                             The SC16C650B provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization,
                             parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and
                             receiver sections. These functions are necessary for converting the serial data stream into
                             parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization for the serial data
                             stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to form a data
                             character (character orientated protocol). Data integrity is insured by attaching a parity bit
                             to the data character. The parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit
                             errors. The SC16C650B is fabricated with an advanced CMOS process to achieve low
                             drain power and high speed requirements.
                             The SC16C650B is an upward solution that provides 32 bytes of transmit and receive
                             FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C450, or 16 bytes in the 16C550. The
                             SC16C650B is designed to work with high speed modems and shared network
                             environments that require fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in
                             the SC16C650B by the larger transmit and receive FIFOs. This allows the external
                             processor to handle more networking tasks within a given time. In addition, the four
                             selectable levels of FIFO trigger interrupt and automatic hardware/software flow control is
                             uniquely provided for maximum data throughput performance, especially when operating
                             in a multi-channel environment. The combination of the above greatly reduces the
                             bandwidth requirement of the external controlling CPU, increases performance, and
                             reduces power consumption.
                             The SC16C650B is capable of operation up to 3 Mbit/s with a 48 MHz external clock input
                             (at 5 V).
                             The rich feature set of the SC16C650B is available through internal registers. Automatic
                             hardware/software flow control, selectable transmit and receive FIFO trigger level,
                             selectable TX and RX baud rates, modem interface controls, and a Sleep mode are some
                             of these features.

                   6.1 Internal registers
                       The SC16C650B provides 17 internal registers for monitoring and control. These registers
                       are shown in Table 3. Twelve registers are similar to those already available in the
                       standard 16C550. These registers function as data holding registers (THR/RHR), interrupt
                       status and control registers (IER/ISR), a FIFO control register (FCR), line status and
                       control registers (LCR/LSR), modem status and control registers (MCR/MSR),
                       programmable data rate (clock) control registers (DLL/DLM), and a user accessible
                       ScratchPad Register (SPR). Beyond the general 16C550 features and capabilities, the
                       SC16C650B offers an enhanced feature register set (EFR, Xon1/Xoff1, Xon2/Xoff2) that
                       provides on-board hardware/software flow control. Register functions are more fully

                       The 32-byte transmit and receive data FIFOs are enabled by the FIFO Control Register
                       bit 0 (FCR[0]). With 16C550 devices, the user can set the receive trigger level, but not the
                       transmit trigger level. The SC16C650B provides independent trigger levels for both
                       receiver and transmitter. To remain compatible with SC16C550, the transmit interrupt
                       trigger level is set to 16 following a reset. It should be noted that the user can set the
                       transmit trigger levels by writing to the FCR register, but activation will not take place until
                       EFR[4] is set to a logic 1. The receiver FIFO section includes a time-out function to ensure

                       data is delivered to the external CPU. An interrupt is generated whenever the Receive
                       Holding Register (RHR) has not been read following the loading of a character or the
                       receive trigger level has not been reached.

                   6.3 Hardware flow control
                       When automatic hardware flow control is enabled, the SC16C650B monitors the CTS pin
                       for a remote buffer overflow indication and controls the RTS pin for local buffer overflows.
                       Automatic hardware flow control is selected by setting EFR[6] (RTS) and EFR[7] (CTS) to
                       a logic 1. If CTS changes from a logic 0 to a logic 1 indicating a flow control request,
                       ISR[5] will be set to a logic 1 (if enabled via IER[6,7]), and the SC16C650B will suspend
                       TX transmissions as soon as the stop bit of the character in process is shifted out.
                       Transmission is resumed after the CTS input returns to a logic 0, indicating more data may
                       be sent.
                       With the auto-RTS function enabled, an interrupt is generated when the receive FIFO
                       reaches the programmed trigger level. The RTS pin will not be forced to a logic 1 (RTS
                       off), until the receive FIFO reaches the next trigger level. However, the RTS pin will return
                       to a logic 0 after the data buffer (FIFO) is unloaded to the next trigger level below the
                       programmed trigger level. However, under the above described conditions, the
                       SC16C650B will continue to accept data until the receive FIFO is full.
                   6.4 Software flow control
                       When software flow control is enabled, the SC16C650B compares one or two sequential
                       receive data characters with the programmed Xon or Xoff character value(s). If received
                       character(s) match the programmed Xoff values, the SC16C650B will halt transmission
                       (TX) as soon as the current character(s) has completed transmission. When a match
                       occurs, the receive ready (if enabled via Xoff IER[5]) flags will be set and the interrupt
                       output pin (if receive interrupt is enabled) will be activated. Following a suspension due to
                       a match of the Xoff characters’ values, the SC16C650B will monitor the receive data
                       stream for a match to the Xon1, Xon2 character value(s). If a match is found, the
                       SC16C650B will resume operation and clear the flags (ISR[4]).
                       Reset initially sets the contents of the Xon/Xoff 8-bit flow control registers to a logic 0.
                       Following reset, the user can write any Xon/Xoff value desired for software flow control.
                       Different conditions can be set to detect Xon/Xoff characters and suspend/resume
                       transmissions. When double 8-bit Xon/Xoff characters are selected, the SC16C650B
                       compares two consecutive receive characters with two software flow control 8-bit values
                       (Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2) and controls TX transmissions accordingly. Under the above
                       described flow control mechanisms, flow control characters are not placed (stacked) in the
                       user accessible RX data buffer or FIFO. When using a software flow control the Xon/Xoff
                       characters cannot be used for data transfer.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                              SC16C650B
                                                             UART with 32-byte FIFOs and IrDA encoder/decoder
                       In the event that the receive buffer is overfilling and flow control needs to be executed, the
                       SC16C650B automatically sends an Xoff message (when enabled) via the serial TX
                       output to the remote modem. The SC16C650B sends the Xoff1/Xoff2 characters as soon
                       as received data passes the programmed trigger level. To clear this condition, the
                       SC16C650B will transmit the programmed Xon1/Xon2 characters as soon as receive data
                       drops below the next low or programmed trigger level.
                   6.5 Special feature software flow control
                       A special feature is provided to detect an 8-bit character when EFR[5] is set. When 8-bit
                       character is detected, it will be placed on the user-accessible data stack along with normal
                       incoming RX data. This condition is selected in conjunction with EFR[3:0]. Note that
                       software flow control should be turned off when using this special mode by setting
                       EFR[3:0] to a logic 0.
                       The SC16C650B compares each incoming receive character with Xoff2 data. If a match
                       exists, the received data will be transferred to the FIFO, and ISR[4] will be set to indicate
                       detection of a special character. Although Table 8 “SC16C650B internal registers” shows
                       each X-register with eight bits of character information, the actual number of bits is
                       dependent on the programmed word length. Line Control Register bits LCR[1:0] define the
                       number of character bits, i.e., either 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits or 8 bits. The word length selected
                       by LCR[1:0] also determine the number of bits that will be used for the special character
                       comparison. Bit 0 in the X-registers corresponds with the LSB bit for the receive character.
                   6.6 Hardware/software and time-out interrupts
                       Three special interrupts have been added to monitor the hardware and software flow
                       control. The interrupts are enabled by IER[7:5]. Care must be taken when handling these
                       interrupts. Following a reset, the transmitter interrupt is enabled, the SC16C650B will
                       issue an interrupt to indicate that the Transmit Holding Register is empty. This interrupt
                       must be serviced prior to continuing operations. The ISR register provides the current
                       singular highest priority interrupt only. It could be noted that CTS and RTS interrupts have
                       lowest interrupt priority. A condition can exist where a higher priority interrupt may mask
                       the lower priority CTS/RTS interrupt(s). Only after servicing the higher pending interrupt
                       will the lower priority CTS/RTS interrupt(s) be reflected in the status register. Servicing the
                       interrupt without investigating further interrupt conditions can result in data errors.
                       When two interrupt conditions have the same priority, it is important to service these
                       interrupts correctly. Receive Data Ready and Receive Time-Out have the same interrupt
                       priority (when enabled by IER[0]). The receiver issues an interrupt after the number of
                       characters have reached the programmed trigger level. In this case, the SC16C650B
                       FIFO may hold more characters than the programmed trigger level. Following the removal
                       of a data byte, the user should re-check LSR[0] for additional characters. A Receive
                       Time-Out will not occur if the receive FIFO is empty. The time-out counter is reset at the
                       center of each stop bit received or each time the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is read.
                       The actual time-out value is 4 character time.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                                SC16C650B
                                                                         UART with 32-byte FIFOs and IrDA encoder/decoder
                   6.7 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C650B supports high speed modem technologies that have increased input
                       data rates by employing data compression schemes. For example, a 33.6 kbit/s modem
                       that employs data compression may require a 115.2 kbit/s input data rate. A 128.0 kbit/s
                       ISDN modem that supports data compression may need an input data rate of 460.8 kbit/s.
                       A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver, allowing
                       independent TX/RX channel control. The programmable baud rate generator is capable of
                       accepting an input clock up to 48 MHz, as required for supporting a 3 Mbit/s data rate.
                       The SC16C650B can be configured for internal or external clock operation. For internal
                       clock oscillator operation, an industry standard microprocessor crystal (parallel resonant,
                       22 pF to 33 pF load) is connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see
                       Figure 5). Alternatively, an external clock can be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the
                       internal baud rate generator for standard or custom rates (see Table 5).

                       The generator divides the input 16× clock by any divisor from 1 to (216 − 1). The
                       SC16C650B divides the basic crystal or external clock by 16. The frequency of the
                       BAUDOUT output pin is exactly 16× (16 times) the selected baud rate
                       (BAUDOUT = 16 × baud rate). Customized baud rates can be achieved by selecting the
                       proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB sections of baud rate generator.
                       Setting MCR[7] to a logic 1 provides an additional divide-by-4, whereas setting MCR[7] to
                       a logic 0 only divides by 1 (see Table 5 and Figure 6).
                       Programming the baud rate generator registers DLM (MSB) and DLL (LSB) provides a
                       user capability for selecting the desired final baud rate. The example in Table 5 shows
                       selectable baud rates when using a 1.8432 MHz crystal and setting MCR[7] to a logic 0.
                       For custom baud rates, the divisor value can be calculated using Equation 1:
                                                  XTAL1 clock frequency

NXP Semiconductors                                                                              SC16C650B
                                                               UART with 32-byte FIFOs and IrDA encoder/decoder
                   6.8 DMA operation
                       The SC16C650B FIFO trigger level provides additional flexibility to the user for block
                       mode operation. The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive FIFOs in the
                       DMA mode (FCR[3]). The DMA mode affects the state of the RXRDY and TXRDY output
                       pins. Table 6 and Table 7 show this.
                       Remark: DMA operation is not supported in the HVQFN32 package.
                       Table 6.      Effect of DMA mode on state of RXRDY pin
                        Non-DMA mode                    DMA mode
                        1 = FIFO empty                  0-to-1 transition when FIFO empties
                        0 = at least 1 byte in FIFO     1-to-0 transition when FIFO reaches trigger level, or time-out occurs
                       Table 7.      Effect of DMA mode on state of TXRDY pin
                        Non-DMA mode                    DMA mode
                        1 = at least 1 byte in FIFO     0-to-1 transition when FIFO becomes full
                        0 = FIFO empty                  1-to-0 transition when FIFO has 1 empty space
                   6.9 Sleep mode
                       The SC16C650B is designed to operate with low power consumption. A special Sleep
                       mode is included to further reduce power consumption when the chip is not being used.
                       With EFR[4] and IER[4] enabled (set to a logic 1), the SC16C650B enters the Sleep
                       mode, but resumes normal operation when a start bit is detected, a change of state on
                       any of the modem input pins RI, CTS, DSR, DCD, RX pin, or a transmit data is provided
                       by the user. If the Sleep mode is enabled and the SC16C650B is awakened by one of the
                       conditions described above, it will return to the Sleep mode automatically after the last
                       character is transmitted or read by the user. In any case, the Sleep mode will not be
                       entered while an interrupt(s) is pending. The SC16C650B will stay in the Sleep mode of
                       operation until it is disabled by setting IER[4] to a logic 0.
                6.10 Loopback mode
                       The internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. In the loopback mode, the
                       normal modem interface pins are disconnected and reconfigured for loopback internally.
                       MCR[3:0] register bits are used for controlling loopback diagnostic testing. In the loopback
                       mode, OUT1 (bit 2) and OUT2 (bit 3) in the MCR register control the modem RI and DCD
                       inputs, respectively. MCR signals DTR (bit 0) and RTS (bit 1) are used to control the
                       modem DSR and CTS inputs, respectively. The transmitter output (TX) and the receiver
                       input (RX) are disconnected from their associated interface pins, and instead are
                       connected together internally (see Figure 7). The CTS, DSR, DCD, and RI are
                       disconnected from their normal modem control input pins, and instead are connected
                       internally to DTR, RTS, OUT1 and OUT2. Loopback test data is entered into the Transmit
                       Holding Register via the user data bus interface, D0 to D7. The transmit UART serializes
                       the data and passes the serial data to the receive UART via the internal loopback
                       connection. The receive UART converts the serial data back into parallel data that is then
                       made available at the user data interface D0 to D7. The user optionally compares the
                       received data to the initial transmitted data for verifying error-free operation of the UART
                       TX/RX circuits.

                            In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The Modem
                            Control Interrupts are also operational. However, the interrupts can only be read using
                            lower four bits of the Modem Status Register (MSR[3:0]) instead of the four Modem Status
                            Register bits 7:4. The interrupts are still controlled by the IER.

[7]   The Special register set is accessible only when LCR[7] is set to a logic 1.
[8]   Enhanced Feature Register (EFR), Xon1, Xon2 Xoff1, Xoff2 are accessible only when LCR is set to BFh.
                       7.1 Transmit Holding Register (THR) and Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                              The serial transmitter section consists of an 8-bit Transmit Holding Register (THR) and
                              Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The status of the THR is provided in the Line Status
                              Register (LSR). Writing to the THR transfers the contents of the data bus (D[7:0]) to the
                              THR, providing that the THR or TSR is empty. The THR empty flag in the LSR register will
                              be set to a logic 1 when the transmitter is empty or when data is transferred to the TSR.
                              Note that a write operation can be performed when the THR empty flag is set
                              (logic 0 = FIFO full; logic 1 = at least one FIFO location available).
                              The serial receive section also contains an 8-bit Receive Holding Register (RHR).
                              Receive data is removed from the SC16C650B and receive FIFO by reading the RHR
                              register. The receive section provides a mechanism to prevent false starts. On the falling
                              edge of a start or false start bit, an internal receiver counter starts counting clocks at the
                              16× clock rate. After 71⁄2 clocks, the start bit time should be shifted to the center of the
                              start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled, and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated.
                              Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false
                              character. Receiver status codes will be posted in the LSR.
                       7.2 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                              The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receiver ready, transmitter
                              empty, line status and modem status registers. These interrupts would normally be seen
                              on the INT output pin.

                                                     logic 1 = enable the CTS interrupt. The SC16C650B issues an interrupt when
                                                     the CTS pin transitions from a logic 0 to a logic 1.

                       Bit    Symbol      Description
                       2      IER[2]      Receive Line Status interrupt. This interrupt will be issued whenever a fully
                                          assembled receive character is transferred from RSR to the RHR/FIFO, i.e.,
                                          data ready, LSR[0].
                                             logic 0 = disable the receiver line status interrupt (normal default condition)
                                             logic 1 = enable the receiver line status interrupt
                       1      IER[1]      Transmit Holding Register interrupt. This interrupt will be issued whenever the
                                          THR is empty, and is associated with LSR[1].
                                             logic 0 = disable the transmitter empty interrupt (normal default condition)
                                             logic 1 = enable the transmitter empty interrupt
                       0      IER[0]      Receive Holding Register interrupt. This interrupt will be issued when the FIFO
                                          has reached the programmed trigger level, or is cleared when the FIFO drops
                                          below the trigger level in the FIFO mode of operation.
                                             logic 0 = disable the receiver ready interrupt (normal default condition)
                                             logic 1 = enable the receiver ready interrupt
                7.2.1 IER versus receive FIFO interrupt mode operation
                      When the receive FIFO (FCR[0] = logic 1), and receive interrupts (IER[0] = logic 1) are
                      enabled, the receive interrupts and register status will reflect the following:
                        • The receive data available interrupts are issued to the external CPU when the FIFO
                           has reached the programmed trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops
                           below the programmed trigger level.
                        • FIFO status will also be reflected in the user accessible ISR register when the FIFO
                           trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register status bit and the interrupt will be
                           cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                        • The data ready bit (LSR[0]) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift
                           register to the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
                7.2.2 IER versus receive/transmit FIFO polled mode operation
                      When FCR[0] = logic 1, resetting IER[3:0] enables the SC16C650B in the FIFO polled
                      mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR,
                      either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive
                      control bit(s).
                        •  LSR[0] will be a logic 1 as long as there is one byte in the receive FIFO.
                        •  LSR[4:1] will provide the type of errors encountered, if any.
                        •  LSR[5] will indicate when the transmit FIFO is empty.
                        •  LSR[6] will indicate when both the transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are empty.
                        •  LSR[7] will indicate any FIFO data errors.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 SC16C650B
                                                              UART with 32-byte FIFOs and IrDA encoder/decoder
                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the receive FIFO trigger
                       levels, and select the DMA mode.
                7.3.1 DMA mode
               7.3.1.1 Mode 0 (FCR bit 3 = 0)
                       Set and enable the interrupt for each single transmit or receive operation, and is similar to
                       the 16C450 mode. Transmit Ready (TXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever an empty
                       transmit space is available in the Transmit Holding Register (THR). Receive Ready
                       (RXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is loaded with
                       a character.
               7.3.1.2 Mode 1 (FCR bit 3 = 1)
                       Set and enable the interrupt in a block mode operation. The transmit interrupt is set when
                       the transmit FIFO is below the programmed trigger level. The receive interrupt is set when
                       the receive FIFO fills to the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO continues to fill
                       regardless of the programmed level until the FIFO is full. RXRDY remains a logic 0 as long
                       as the FIFO fill level is above the programmed trigger level.
                7.3.2 FIFO mode
                       Table 10.  FIFO Control Register bits description
                        Bit     Symbol            Description
                        7:6     FCR[7] (MSB),     RCVR trigger. These bits are used to set the trigger level for the receive
                                FCR[6] (LSB)      FIFO interrupt.
                                                  An interrupt is generated when the number of characters in the FIFO
                                                  equals the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO will continue to
                                                  be loaded until it is full. Refer to Table 11.
                        5:4     FCR[5] (MSB),     Logic 0 or cleared is the default condition; TX trigger level = 16.
                                FCR[4] (LSB)      These bits are used to set the trigger level for the transmit FIFO
                                                  interrupt. The SC16C650B will issue a transmit empty interrupt when
                                                  the number of characters in FIFO drops below the selected trigger level.
                                                  Refer to Table 12.
                        3       FCR[3]            DMA mode select.
                                                     logic 0 = set DMA mode ‘0’ (normal default condition)
                                                     logic 1 = set DMA mode ‘1’
                                                  Transmit operation in mode ‘0’: When the SC16C650B is in the
                                                  16C450 mode (FIFOs disabled; FCR[0] = logic 0) or in the FIFO mode
                                                  (FIFOs enabled; FCR[0] = logic 1; FCR[3] = logic 0), and when there
                                                  are no characters in the transmit FIFO or transmit holding register, the
                                                  TXRDY pin will be a logic 0. Once active, the TXRDY pin will go to a
                                                  logic 1 after the first character is loaded into the transmit holding
                                                  register.
                                                  Receive operation in mode ‘0’: When the SC16C650B is in 16C450
                                                  mode, or in the FIFO mode (FCR[0] = logic 1; FCR[3] = logic 0) and
                                                  there is at least one character in the receive FIFO, the RXRDY pin will
                                                  be a logic 0. Once active, the RXRDY pin will go to a logic 1 when there
                                                  are no more characters in the receiver.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                   SC16C650B

                   7.4 Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
                       The SC16C650B provides six levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external software
                       interaction. The Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with six interrupt status
                       bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR will provide the user with the highest pending
                       interrupt level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowledged until the pending
                       interrupt is serviced. Whenever the interrupt status register is read, the interrupt status is
                       cleared. However, it should be noted that only the current pending interrupt is cleared by
                       the read. A lower level interrupt may be seen after re-reading the interrupt status bits.
                       Table 13 “Interrupt source” shows the data values (bits 0:5) for the six prioritized interrupt
                       levels and the interrupt sources associated with each of these interrupt levels.

                   7.5 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       The Line Control Register is used to specify the asynchronous data communication
                       format. The word length, the number of stop bits, and the parity are selected by writing the
                       appropriate bits in this register.
                       Table 15.  Line Control Register bits description

                                              logic 1 = divisor latch and enhanced feature register enabled
                        6     LCR[6]        Set break. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to
                                            be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This condition exists
                                            until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.
                                              logic 0 = no TX break condition (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = forces the transmitter output (TX) to a logic 0 for alerting the
                                              remote receiver to a line break condition
                        5     LCR[5]        Set parity. If the parity bit is enabled, LCR[5] selects the forced parity format.
                                            Programs the parity conditions (see Table 16).
                                              logic 0 = parity is not forced (normal default condition)
                                              LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 0: parity bit is forced to a logic 1 for the
                                              transmit and receive data
                                              LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 1: parity bit is forced to a logic 0 for the

                        4     LCR[4]        Even parity. If the parity bit is enabled with LCR[3] set to a logic 1, LCR[4]
                                            selects the even or odd parity format.
                                              logic 0 = odd parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1s in the
                                              transmitted data. The receiver must be programmed to check the same
                                              format (normal default condition).
                                              logic 1 = even parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1s in
                                              the transmitted data. The receiver must be programmed to check the same

                        3     LCR[3]        Parity enable. Parity or no parity can be selected via this bit.
                                              logic 0 = no parity (normal default condition)

                        2     LCR[2]        Stop bits. The length of stop bit is specified by this bit in conjunction with the
                                            programmed word length (see Table 17).

                                            requirement. As such, while in this mode, the infrared TX output will be a

                   5     MCR[5]  INT type select.
                                    logic 0 = enable interrupt output mode (normal default condition)
                                    logic 1 = enable open source interrupt output mode. Provides shared
                                    interrupts by producing a wire-OR output driver capability for interrupts. This
                                    output appears at the INT pin. When using this option, an external pull-down
                                    resistor of 200 Ω to 500 Ω must be tied from the INT pin to ground to provide
                                    an acceptable logic 0 level
                   4     MCR[4]  Loopback. Enable the local loopback mode (diagnostics). In this mode the
                                 transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX), CTS, DSR, DCD, and RI are
                                 disconnected from the SC16C650B I/O pins. Internally the modem data and
                                 control pins are connected into a loopback data configuration (see Figure 7). In
                                 this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts remain fully operational. The
                                 Modem Control Interrupts are also operational, but the interrupts’ sources are
                                 switched to the lower four bits of the Modem Control. Interrupts continue to be
                                 controlled by the IER register.
                                    logic 0 = disable loopback mode (normal default condition)
                                    logic 1 = enable local loopback mode (diagnostics)
                   3     MCR[3]  OUT2. In the loopback mode this bit is used to control the modem DCD signal
                                 via OUT2.
                                    logic 0 = OUT2 is at logic 1. In the loopback mode, sets OUT2 (DCD)
                                    internally to a logic 1.
                                    logic 1 = OUT2 is at logic 0. In the loopback mode, sets OUT2 (DCD)
                                    internally to a logic 0.
                   2     MCR[2]  OUT1, OUT. In the loopback mode, this bit is used to control modem RI interface
                                 signal via OUT1 (OUT in the HVQFN32 package).
                                    logic 0 = OUT1/OUT is at logic 1. In the loopback mode, sets RI internally to
                                    logic 1.
                                    logic 1 = OUT1/OUT is set at logic 0. In the loopback mode, sets RI internally
                                    to logic 0.
                   1     MCR[1]  RTS
                                    logic 0 = force RTS output to a logic 1 (normal default condition)
                                    logic 1 = force RTS output to a logic 0
                   0     MCR[0]  DTR
                                    logic 0 = force DTR output to a logic 1 (normal default condition)
                                    logic 1 = force DTR output to a logic 0

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 SC16C650B
                                                              UART with 32-byte FIFOs and IrDA encoder/decoder
                   7.7 Line Status Register (LSR)
                       This register provides the status of data transfers between the SC16C650B and the CPU.
                       Table 20.  Line Status Register bits description
                       Bit    Symbol     Description
                       7      LSR[7]     FIFO data error.
                                            logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = at least one parity error, framing error or break indication is in the
                                            current FIFO data. This bit is cleared when LSR register is read.
                       6      LSR[6]     THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator. This bit is set to a
                                         logic 1 whenever the transmit holding register and the transmit shift register are
                                         both empty. It is reset to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a
                                         data character. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set to ‘1’ whenever the transmit
                                         FIFO and transmit shift register are both empty.
                       5      LSR[5]     THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit
                                         indicates that the UART is ready to accept a new character for transmission. In
                                         addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to CPU when the THR
                                         interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
                                         transferred from the transmit holding register into the transmitter shift register.
                                         The bit is reset to a logic 0 concurrently with the loading of the transmit holding
                                         register by the CPU. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is
                                         empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the transmit FIFO.
                       4      LSR[4]     Break interrupt.
                                            logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = the receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one
                                            character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded
                                            into the FIFO.
                       3      LSR[3]     Framing error.
                                            logic 0 = no framing error (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s).
                                            In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the top of the
                                            FIFO.
                       2      LSR[2]     Parity error.
                                            logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = parity error. The receive character does not have correct parity
                                            information and is suspect. In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with
                                            the character at the top of the FIFO.
                       1      LSR[1]     Overrun error.
                                            logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition).
                                            logic 1 = overrun error. A data overrun error occurred in the receive shift
                                            register. This happens when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In
                                            this case, the previous data in the shift register is overwritten. Note that under
                                            this condition, the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into
                                            the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.
                       0      LSR[0]     Receive data ready.
                                            logic 0 = no data in receive holding register or FIFO (normal default
                                            condition)
                                            logic 1 = data has been received and is saved in the receive holding register
                                            or FIFO

                   7.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This register provides the current state of the control interface signals from the modem, or
                       other peripheral device to which the SC16C650B is connected. Four bits of this register
                       are used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a
                       control input from the modem changes state. These bits are set to a logic 0 whenever the
                       CPU reads this register.
                       Table 21.  Modem Status Register bits description
                        Bit    Symbol     Description
                        7      MSR[7]     Data Carrier Detect. DCD (active HIGH, logic 1). Normally this bit is the
                                          complement of the DCD input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the
                                          OUT2 bit in the MCR register.
                        6      MSR[6]     Ring Indicator. RI (active HIGH, logic 1). Normally this bit is the complement of
                                          the RI input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the OUT1 bit in the
                                          MCR register.
                        5      MSR[5]     Data Set Ready. DSR (active HIGH, logic 1). Normally this bit is the
                                          complement of the DSR input. In loopback mode this bit is equivalent to the
                                          DTR bit in the MCR register.
                        4      MSR[4]     Clear To Send. CTS. CTS functions as hardware flow control signal input if it is
                                          enabled via EFR[7]. Flow control (when enabled) allows starting and stopping
                                          the transmissions based on the external modem CTS signal. A logic 1 at the
                                          CTS pin will stop SC16C650B transmissions as soon as current character has
                                          finished transmission. Normally MSR[4] is the complement of the CTS input.
                                          However, in the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the RTS bit in the MCR
                                          register.

                                             time it was read. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.
                        2      MSR[2]     ∆RI [1]
                                             logic 0 = no RI change (normal default condition)
                                             logic 1 = the RI input to the SC16C650B has changed from a logic 0 to a
                                             logic 1. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.
                        1      MSR[1]     ∆DSR [1]
                                             logic 0 = no DSR change (normal default condition)
                                             logic 1 = the DSR input to the SC16C650B has changed state since the last
                                             time it was read. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.

                                                             UART with 32-byte FIFOs and IrDA encoder/decoder
                   7.9 Scratchpad Register (SPR)
                       The SC16C650B provides a temporary data register to store 8 bits of user information.
                7.10 Enhanced Feature Register (EFR)
                       Enhanced features are enabled or disabled using this register.
                       Bits 0 through 4 provide single or dual character software flow control selection. When the
                       Xon1 and Xon2 and/or Xoff1 and Xoff2 modes are selected, the double 8-bit words are
                       concatenated into two sequential numbers.
                       Table 22.   Enhanced Feature Register bits description
                       Bit     Symbol    Description
                       7       EFR[7]    Automatic CTS flow control.
                                            logic 0 = Automatic CTS flow control is disabled (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = enable Automatic CTS flow control. Transmission will stop when
                                            CTS goes to a logic 1. Transmission will resume when the CTS pin returns to
                                            a logic 0.
                       6       EFR[6]    Automatic RTS flow control. Automatic RTS may be used for hardware flow
                                         control by enabling EFR[6]. When Auto-RTS is selected, an interrupt will be
                                         generated when the receive FIFO is filled to the programmed trigger level and
                                         RTS will go to a logic 1 at the next trigger level. RTS will return to a logic 0 when
                                         data is unloaded below the next lower trigger level (programmed trigger level 1).
                                         The state of this register bit changes with the status of the hardware flow
                                         control. RTS functions normally when hardware flow control is disabled.
                                            0 = Automatic RTS flow control is disabled (normal default condition)
                                            1 = enable Automatic RTS flow control
                       5       EFR[5]    Special Character Detect.
                                            logic 0 = special character detect disabled (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = special character detect enabled. The SC16C650B compares each
                                            incoming receive character with Xoff2 data. If a match exists, the received
                                            data will be transferred to FIFO and ISR[4] will be set to indicate detection of
                                            special character. Bit 0 in the X-registers corresponds with the LSB bit for the
                                            receive character. When this feature is enabled, the normal software flow
                                            control must be disabled (EFR[3:0] must be set to a logic 0).
                       4       EFR[4]    Enhanced function control bit. The content of IER[7:4], ISR[5:4], FCR[5:4], and
                                         MCR[7:5] can be modified and latched. After modifying any bits in the
                                         enhanced registers, EFR[4] can be set to a logic 0 to latch the new values. This
                                         feature prevents existing software from altering or overwriting the SC16C650B
                                         enhanced functions.
                                            logic 0 = disable (normal default condition)
                                            logic 1 = enable
                       3:0     EFR[3:0]  Cont-3:0 Tx, Rx control. Logic 0 or cleared is the default condition.
                                         Combinations of software flow control can be selected by programming these
                                         bits. See Table 23.

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 25) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 29 and 30
