1. General description
             The SC28L92 is a pin and function replacement for the SCC2692 and SC26C92 operating
             at 3.3 V or 5 V supply with added features and deeper FIFOs. Its configuration on
             power-up is that of the SC26C92. Its differences from the SCC2692 and SC26C92 are:
             16 character receiver, 16 character transmit FIFOs, watchdog timer for each receiver,
             mode register 0 is added, extended baud rate and overall faster speeds, programmable
             receiver and transmitter interrupts. (Neither the SC26C92 nor the SCC2692 is being
             discontinued.)
             Pin programming will allow the device to operate with either the Motorola or Intel bus
             interface. The bit 3 of the MR0A register allows the device to operate in an 8 byte FIFO
             mode if strict compliance with the SC26C92 FIFO structure is required.
             The NXP Semiconductors SC28L92 Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
             (DUART) is a single-chip CMOS-LSI communications device that provides two full-duplex
             asynchronous receiver/transmitter channels in a single package. It interfaces directly with
             microprocessors and may be used in a polled or interrupt driven system with modem and
             DMA interface.
             The operating mode and data format of each channel can be programmed independently.
             Additionally, each receiver and transmitter can select its operating speed as one of 28
             fixed baud rates; a 16× clock derived from a programmable counter/timer, or an external
             1× or 16× clock. The baud rate generator and counter/timer can operate directly from a
             crystal or from external clock inputs. The ability to independently program the operating
             speed of the receiver and transmitter make the DUART particularly attractive for
             dual-speed channel applications such as clustered terminal systems.
             Each receiver and transmitter is buffered by 8 or 16 character FIFOs to minimize the
             potential of receiver overrun, transmitter underrun and to reduce interrupt overhead in
             interrupt driven systems. In addition, a flow control capability is provided via RTS/CTS
             signaling to disable a remote transmitter when the receiver buffer is full.
             Also provided on the SC28L92 are a multipurpose 7-bit input port and a multipurpose 8-bit
             output port. These can be used as general purpose I/O ports or can be assigned specific
             functions (such as clock inputs or status/interrupt outputs) under program control.
             The SC28L92 is available in three package versions: PLCC44, QFP44, and HVQFN48.

            The data pins TxD and RxD are considered idle at the logic 1 (HIGH) level when inactive, or active when at the logic 0
            (LOW) level. Comments about these levels when RS232 is referenced often refer to Mark and Space levels. Mark usually
            means inactive and Space means active. The voltage levels represented by the terms Mark and Space are often reversed
            from those above: Mark is low voltage, and Space is high voltage.

[1]   HVQFN48 package die supply ground is connected to both GND pin and exposed center pad. GND pin must be connected to supply
      ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be
      soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias
      need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.

6. Functional description
                      6.1 Block diagram
                             The SC28L92 DUART consists of the following eight major sections: data bus buffer,
                             operation control, interrupt control, timing, communications channels A and B, input port
                             and output port. Refer to Section 4 “Block diagram”.
                    6.1.1 Data bus buffer
                             The data bus buffer provides the interface between the external and internal data buses. It
                             is controlled by the operation control block to allow read and write operations to take place
                             between the controlling CPU and the DUART.
                    6.1.2 Operation control
                             The operation control logic receives operation commands from the CPU and generates
                             appropriate signals to internal sections to control device operation. It contains address
                             decoding and read and write circuits to permit communications with the microprocessor
                             via the data bus.
                    6.1.3 Interrupt control
                             A single active LOW interrupt output (INTRN) is provided which is activated upon the
                             occurrence of any of eight internal events. Associated with the interrupt system are the
                             Interrupt Mask Register (IMR) and the Interrupt Status Register (ISR). The IMR can be
                             programmed to select only certain conditions to cause INTRN to be asserted. The ISR
                             can be read by the CPU to determine all currently active interrupting conditions. Outputs
                             OP3 to OP7 can be programmed to provide discrete interrupt outputs for the transmitter,

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                  SC28L92
                                                3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
                       receivers, and counter/timer. When OP3 to OP7 are programmed as interrupts, their
                       output buffers are changed to the open-drain active LOW configuration. The OP pins may
                       be used for DMA and modem control as well (see Section 7.4).
                6.1.4 FIFO configuration
                       Each receiver and transmitter has a 16 byte FIFO. These FIFOs may be configured to
                       operate at a fill capacity of either 8 bytes or 16 bytes. This feature may be used if it is
                       desired to operate the SC28L92 in strict compliance with the SC26C92. The 8 byte or
                       16 byte mode is controlled by the MR0A[3] bit. A logic 0 value for this bit sets the 8-bit
                       mode (the default); a logic 1 sets the 16 byte mode. MR0A bit 3 sets the FIFO size for both
                       channels.
                       The FIFO fill interrupt level automatically follow the programming of the MR0A[3] bit. See
                       Table 25 and Table 26.
                6.1.5 68xxx mode
                       When the I/M pin is connected to GND (ground), the operation of the SC28L92 switches to
                       the bus interface compatible with the Motorola bus interfaces. Several of the pins change
                       their function as follows:
                          IP6 becomes IACKN input
                          RDN becomes DACKN
                          WRN becomes R/WN
                       The interrupt vector is enabled and the interrupt vector will be placed on the data bus
                       when IACKN is asserted LOW. The interrupt vector register is located at address 0xC. The
                       contents of this register are set to 0x0F on the application of RESETN.
                       The generation of DACKN uses two positive edges of the X1 clock as the DACKN delay
                       from the falling edge of CEN. If the CEN is withdrawn before two edges of the X1 clock
                       occur, the generation of DACKN is terminated. Systems not strictly requiring DACKN
                       may use the 68xxx mode with the bus timing of the 80xxx mode greatly decreasing the
                       bus cycle time.
                   6.2 Timing circuits
                6.2.1 Crystal clock
                       The timing block consists of a crystal oscillator, a baud rate generator, a programmable
                       16-bit counter/timer, and four clock selectors. The crystal oscillator operates directly from
                       a crystal connected across the X1/CLK and X2 inputs. If an external clock of the
                       appropriate frequency is available, it may be connected to X1/CLK. The clock serves as
                       the basic timing reference for the Baud Rate Generator (BRG), the counter/timer, and
                       other internal circuits. A clock signal within the limits specified in Section 10 “Dynamic
                       characteristics” must always be supplied to the DUART. If an external clock is used
                       instead of a crystal, X1 should be driven using a configuration similar to the one in
                       Figure 17. Nominal crystal rate is 3.6864 MHz. Rates up to 8 MHz may be used.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                             SC28L92
                                               3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
                6.2.2 Baud rate generator
                      The baud rate generator operates from the oscillator or external clock input at the X1 input
                      and is capable of generating 28 commonly used data communications baud rates ranging
                      from 50 kBd to 38.4 kBd. Programming bit 0 of MR0 to a logic 1 gives additional baud
                      rates of 57.6 kBd, 115.2 kBd and 230.4 kBd (500 kHz with X1 at 8.0 MHz). Note that the
                      MR0A[2:0] control this change and that the change applies to both channels. MR0B[2:0]
                      are reserved.
                      The baud rates are based on an input frequency of 3.6864 MHz. Changing the X1
                      frequency will change all baud rates by ratio of 3.6864 MHz to the new frequency. All rates
                      generated by the BRG will be in the 16× mode. The clock outputs from the BRG are at 16×
                      the actual baud rate.
                      The counter/timer can be used as a timer to produce a 16× clock for any other baud rate
                      by counting down the crystal clock or an external clock. The four clock selectors allow the
                      independent selection, for each receiver and transmitter, of any of these baud rates or
                      external timing signal. The use of the counter/timer also requires the generation of a
                      frequency 16× of the baud rate. See Section 6.2.3.
                6.2.3 Counter/timer
                      The Counter/timer is a 16-bit programmable divider that operates in one of three modes:
                      counter, timer and time-out. In the timer mode it generates a square wave. In the counter
                      mode it generates a time delay. In the time-out mode it monitors the time between
                      received characters. The C/T uses the numbers loaded into the Counter/Timer Lower
                      Register (CTLR) and the Counter/Timer Upper Register (CTUR) as its divisor.
                      The counter/timer clock source and mode of operation (counter or timer) is selected by the
                      Auxiliary Control Register bits 6 to 4 (ACR[6:4]). The output of the counter/timer may be
                      used for a baud rate and/or may be output to the OP pins for some external function that
                      may be totally unrelated to data transmission. The counter/timer also sets the
                      counter/timer ready bit in the Interrupt Status Register (ISR) when its output transitions
                      from logic 1 to logic 0. A register read address (see Table 4) is reserved to issue a start
                      counter/timer command and a second register read address is reserved to issue a stop
                      command. The value of D[7:0] is ignored. The START command always loads the
                      contents of CTUR, CTLR to the counting registers. The STOP command always resets
                      the ISR[3] bit in the interrupt status register.
                6.2.4 Timer mode
                      In the timer mode a symmetrical square wave is generated whose half period is equal in
                      time to division of the selected counter/timer clock frequency by the 16-bit number loaded
                      in the CTLR CTUR. Thus, the frequency of the counter/timer output will be equal to the
                      counter/timer clock frequency divided by twice the value of the CTUR CTLR. While in the
                      timer mode the ISR bit 3 (ISR[3]) will be set each time the counter/timer transitions from
                      logic 1 to logic 0 (HIGH-to-LOW). This continues regardless of issuance of the stop
                      counter command. ISR[3] is reset by the stop counter command.
                      Note: Reading of the CTU and CTL registers in the timer mode is not meaningful. When
                      the C/T is used to generate a baud rate and the C/T is selected through the CSR then the
                      receivers and/or transmitter will be operating in the 16× mode. Calculation for the
                      number n to program the counter/timer upper and lower registers is shown in Equation 1.
                      The value of the divisor n is

                                                                         3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
                             counter/timer input clock
                      n = --------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                (1)
                            2 × 16 × ( desired baud rate )
                      Often this division will result in a non-integer number; 26.3 for example. One may only
                      program integer numbers to a digital divider. Therefore 26 (0x1A) would be chosen. If 26.7
                      were the result of the division, then 27 (0x1B) would be chosen. This gives a baud rate
                      error of 0.3/26.3 or 0.3/26.7 that yields a percentage error of 1.14 % or 1.12 %
                      respectively, well within the ability of the asynchronous mode of operation. Higher input
                      frequency to the counter reduces the error effect of the fractional division.
                6.2.5 Counter mode
                      In the counter mode the counter/timer counts the value of the CTLR CTUR down to zero
                      and then sets the ISR[3] bit and sets the counter/timer output from 1 to 0. It then rolls over
                      to 65,365 and continues counting with no further observable effect. Reading the C/T in the
                      counter mode outputs the present state of the C/T. If the C/T is not stopped, a read of the
                      C/T may result in changing data on the data bus.
                6.2.6 Time-out mode
                      The time-out mode uses the received data stream to control the counter. The time-out
                      mode forces the C/T into the timer mode. Each time a received character is transferred
                      from the shift register to the Rx FIFO, the counter is restarted. If a new character is not
                      received before the counter reaches zero count, the counter ready bit is set, and an
                      interrupt can be generated. This mode can be used to indicate when data has been left in
                      the Rx FIFO for more than the programmed time limit. If the receiver has been
                      programmed to interrupt the CPU when the receive FIFO is full, and the message ends
                      before the FIFO is full, the CPU will not be interrupted for the remaining characters in the
                      Rx FIFO.
                      By programming the C/T such that it would time-out in just over one character time, the
                      above situation could be avoided. The processor would be interrupted any time the data
                      stream had stopped for more than one character time. Note: This is very similar to the
                      watchdog time of MR0. The difference is in the programmability of the delay time and that
                      the watchdog timer is restarted by either a receiver load to the Rx FIFO or a system read
                      from it.
                      This mode is enabled by writing the appropriate command to the command register.
                      Writing 0xA to CRA or CRB will invoke the time-out mode for that channel. Writing 0xC to
                      CRA or CRB will disable the time-out mode. Only one receiver should use this mode at a
                      time. However, if both are on, the time-out occurs after both receivers have been inactive
                      for the time-out period. The start of the C/T will be on the logic OR of the two receivers.
                      The time-out mode disables the regular start counter or stop counter commands and puts
                      the C/T into counter mode under the control of the received data stream. Each time a
                      received character is transferred from the shift register to the Rx FIFO, the C/T is stopped
                      after one C/T clock, reloaded with the value in CTUR and CTLR and then restarted on the
                      next C/T clock. If the C/T is allowed to end the count before a new character has been
                      received, the counter ready bit, ISR[3], will be set. If IMR[3] is set, this will generate an
                      interrupt. Since receiving a character restarts the C/T, the receipt of a character after the
                      C/T has timed out will clear the counter ready bit, ISR[3], and the interrupt. Invoking the
                      Set Time-out Mode On command, CRx = 0xA, will also clear the counter ready bit and
                      stop the counter until the next character is received. The counter/timer is controlled with
                      six commands: Start/Stop C/T, Read/Write Counter/Timer lower register and Read/Write

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 SC28L92
                                                3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
                      Counter/Timer upper register. These commands have slight differences depending on the
                      mode of operation. Please see the detail of the commands in Section 7.3.3 “Command
                      registers”.
                6.2.7 Time-out mode caution
                      When operating in the special time-out mode, it is possible to generate what appears to be
                      a false interrupt, i.e., an interrupt without a cause. This may result when a time-out
                      interrupt occurs and then, before the interrupt is serviced, another character is received,
                      i.e., the data stream has started again. (The interrupt latency is longer than the pause in
                      the data stream.) In this case, when a new character has been received, the counter/timer
                      will be restarted by the receiver, thereby withdrawing its interrupt. If, at this time, the
                      interrupt service begins for the previously seen interrupt, a read of the ISR will show the
                      Counter Ready bit not set. If nothing else is interrupting, this read of the ISR will return a
                      0x00 character. This action may present the appearance of a spurious interrupt.
                6.2.8 Communications channels A and B
                      Each communications channel of the SC28L92 comprises a full-duplex asynchronous
                      receiver/transmitter (UART). The operating frequency for each receiver and transmitter
                      can be selected independently from the baud rate generator, the counter/timer, or from an
                      external input. The transmitter accepts parallel data from the CPU, converts it to a serial
                      bit stream, inserts the appropriate start, stop, and optional parity bits and outputs a
                      composite serial stream of data on the TxD output pin. The receiver accepts serial data on
                      the RxD pin, converts this serial input to parallel format, checks for start bit, stop bit, parity
                      bit (if any), or break condition and sends an assembled character to the CPU via the
                      receive FIFO. Three status bits (break received, framing and parity errors) are also
                      FIFOed with each data character.
                6.2.9 Input port
                      The inputs to this unlatched 7-bit (6-bit for 68xxx mode) port can be read by the CPU by
                      performing a read operation at address 0xD. A HIGH input results in a logic 1 while a LOW
                      input results in a logic 0. D7 will always read as a logic 1. The pins of this port can also
                      serve as auxiliary inputs to certain portions of the DUART logic, modem and DMA.
                      Four change-of-state detectors are provided which are associated with inputs IP3, IP2,
                      IP1 and IP0. A HIGH-to-LOW or LOW-to-HIGH transition of these inputs, lasting longer
                      than 25 µs to 50 µs, will set the corresponding bit in the input port change register. The
                      bits are cleared when the register is read by the CPU. Any change of state can also be
                      programmed to generate an interrupt to the CPU.
                      The input port change of state detection circuitry uses a 38.4 kHz sampling clock derived
                      from one of the baud rate generator taps. This results in a sampling period of slightly more
                      than 25 µs (this assumes that the clock input is 3.6864 MHz). The detection circuitry, in
                      order to guarantee that a true change in level has occurred, requires two successive
                      samples at the new logic level be observed. As a consequence, the minimum duration of
                      the signal change is 25 µs if the transition occurs coincident with the first sample pulse.
                      The 50 µs time refers to the situation in which the change of state is just missed and the
                      first change of state is not detected until 25 µs later.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 SC28L92
                                                 3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
               6.2.10 Output port
                       The output ports are controlled from six places: the OPCR, OPR, MR, Command, SOPR
                       and ROPR registers. The OPCR register controls the source of the data for the output
                       ports OP2 through OP7. The data source for output ports OP0 and OP1 is controlled by
                       the MR and CR registers. When the OPR is the source of the data for the output ports, the
                       data at the ports is inverted from that in the OPR register. The content of the OPR register
                       is controlled by the set output port bits command and the reset output bits command.
                       These commands are at 0xE and 0xF, respectively. When these commands are used,
                       action takes place only at the bit locations where ones exist. For example, a one in bit
                       location 5 of the data word used with the set output port bits command will result in OPR5
                       being set to one. The OP5 would then be set to zero (VSS). Similarly, a one in bit position 5
                       of the data word associated with the reset output ports bits command would set OPR5 to
                       zero and, hence, the pin OP5 to a one (VDD).
                       These pins along with the IP pins and their change-of-state detectors are often used for
                       modem and DMA control.
                   6.3 Operation
                6.3.1 Transmitter
                       The SC28L92 is conditioned to transmit data when the transmitter is enabled through the
                       command register. The SC28L92 indicates to the CPU that it is ready to accept a
                       character by setting the TxRDY bit in the status register. This condition can be
                       programmed to generate an interrupt request at OP6 or OP7 and INTRN. When the
                       transmitter is initially enabled the TxRDY and TxEMPT bits will be set in the status
                       register. When a character is loaded to the transmit FIFO the TxEMPT bit will be reset.
                       The TxEMPT will not set until: 1) the transmit FIFO is empty and the transmit shift register
                       has finished transmitting the stop bit of the last character written to the transmit FIFO, or
                       2) the transmitter is disabled and then re-enabled. The TxRDY bit is set whenever the
                       transmitter is enabled and the Tx FIFO is not full. Data is transferred from the holding
                       register to transmit shift register when it is idle or has completed transmission of the
                       previous character. Characters cannot be loaded into the Tx FIFO while the transmitter is
                       disabled.
                       The transmitter converts the parallel data from the CPU to a serial bit stream on the TxD
                       output pin. It automatically sends a start bit followed by the programmed number of data
                       bits, an optional parity bit, and the programmed number of stop bits. The least significant
                       bit is sent first. Following the transmission of the stop bits, if a new character is not
                       available in the Tx FIFO, the TxD output remains HIGH and the TxEMT bit in the Status
                       Register (SR) will be set to 1. Transmission resumes and the TxEMT bit is cleared when
                       the CPU loads a new character into the Tx FIFO.
                       If the transmitter is disabled it continues operating until the character currently being
                       transmitted and any characters in the Tx FIFO, including parity and stop bits, have been
                       transmitted. New data cannot be loaded to the Tx FIFO when the transmitter is disabled.
                       When the transmitter is reset it stops sending data immediately.
                       The transmitter can be forced to send a break (a continuous LOW condition) by issuing a
                       START BREAK command via the CR register. The break is terminated by a STOP BREAK
                       command or a transmitter reset.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 SC28L92

                      If CTS option is enabled (MR2[4] = 1), the CTS input at IP0 or IP1 must be LOW in order
                      for the character to be transmitted. The transmitter will check the state of the CTS input at
                      the beginning of each character transmitted. If it is found to be HIGH, the transmitter will
                      delay the transmission of any following characters until the CTS has returned to the LOW
                      state. CTS going HIGH during the serialization of a character will not affect that character.
                      The transmitter can also control the RTSN outputs, OP0 or OP1 via MR2[5]. When this
                      mode of operation is set, the meaning of the OP0 or OP1 signals will usually be end of
                      message. See description of bit MR2[5] in Table 30 “MR2A - Mode Register 2 channel A
                      (address 0x0) bit description” for more detail. This feature may be used to automatically
                      turn around a transceiver in simplex systems.
                6.3.2 Receiver
                      The SC28L92 is conditioned to receive data when enabled through the command register.
                      The receiver looks for a HIGH-to-LOW (mark-to-space) transition of the start bit on the
                      RxD input pin. If a transition is detected, the state of the RxD pin is sampled each 16×
                      clock for 7 clocks to 1⁄2 clocks (16× clock mode) or at the next rising edge of the bit time
                      clock (1× clock mode). If RxD is sampled HIGH, the start bit is invalid and the search for a
                      valid start bit begins again. If RxD is still LOW, a valid start bit is assumed and the receiver
                      continues to sample the input at one bit time intervals at the theoretical center of the bit,
                      until the proper number of data bits and parity bit (if any) have been assembled, and one
                      stop bit has been detected. The least significant bit is received first. The data is then
                      transferred to the receive FIFO and the RxRDY bit in the SR is set to a 1. This condition
                      can be programmed to generate an interrupt at OP4 or OP5 and INTRN. If the character
                      length is less than 8 bits, the most significant unused bits in the Rx FIFO are set to zero.
                      After the stop bit is detected, the receiver will immediately look for the next start bit.
                      However, if a non-zero character was received without a stop bit (framing error) and RxD
                      remains LOW for one half of the bit period after the stop bit was sampled, then the
                      receiver operates as if a new start bit transition had been detected at that point (one-half
                      bit time after the stop bit was sampled).
                      The parity error, framing error and overrun error (if any) are strobed into the SR from the
                      next byte to be read from the Rx FIFO. If a break condition is detected (RxD is LOW for
                      the entire character including the stop bit), a character consisting of all zeros will be
                      loaded into the Rx FIFO and the received break bit in the SR is set to 1. The RxD input
                      must return to HIGH for two (2) clock edges of the X1 crystal clock for the receiver to
                      recognize the end of the break condition and begin the search for a start bit.
                      This will usually require a HIGH time of one X1 clock period or 3 X1 edges since the
                      clock of the controller is not synchronous to the X1 clock.
                6.3.3 Transmitter reset and disable
                      Note the difference between transmitter disable and reset. A transmitter reset stops
                      transmitter action immediately, clears the transmitter FIFO and returns the idle state. A
                      transmitter disable withdraws the transmitter interrupts but allows the transmitter to
                      continue operation until all bytes in its FIFO and shift register have been transmitted
                      including the final stop bits. It then returns to its idle state.

                6.3.4 Receiver FIFO
                      The Rx FIFO consists of a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) stack with a capacity of 8 or 16
                      characters. Data is loaded from the receive shift register into the topmost empty position
                      of the FIFO. The RxRDY bit in the status register is set whenever one or more characters
                      are available to be read, and a FFULL status bit is set if all 8 or 16 stack positions are filled
                      with data. Either of these bits can be selected to cause an interrupt. A read of the Rx FIFO
                      outputs the data at the top of the FIFO. After the read cycle, the data FIFO and its
                      associated status bits (see Section 6.3.5) are popped thus emptying a FIFO position for
                      new data.
                      A disabled receiver with data in its FIFO may generate an interrupt (see Section 6.3.5). Its
                      status bits remain active and its watchdog, if enabled, will continue to operate.

                      In addition to the data word, three status bits (parity error, framing error and received
                      break) are also appended to each data character in the FIFO. The overrun error, MR1[5],
                      is not FIFOed.
                      Status can be provided in two ways, as programmed by the error mode control bit in the
                      mode register. In the character mode, status is provided on a character-by-character
                      basis; the status applies only to the character at the top of the FIFO. In the block mode,
                      the status provided in the SR for these three bits is the logic OR of the status for all
                      characters coming to the top of the FIFO since the last reset error from the command
                      register was issued. In either mode reading the SR does not affect the FIFO. The FIFO is
                      popped only when the Rx FIFO is read. Therefore the status register should be read prior
                      to reading the FIFO.
                      If the FIFO is full when a new character is received, that character is held in the receive
                      shift register until a FIFO position is available. If an additional character is received while
                      this state exits, the contents of the FIFO are not affected; the character previously in the
                      shift register is lost and the overrun error status bit (SR[4]) will be set upon receipt of the
                      start bit of the new (overrunning) character.
                      The receiver can control the deactivation of RTS. If programmed to operate in this mode,
                      the RTSN output will be negated when a valid start bit was received and the FIFO is full.
                      When a FIFO position becomes available, the RTSN output will be reasserted (set LOW)
                      automatically. This feature can be used to prevent an overrun, in the receiver, by
                      connecting the RTSN output to the CTSN input of the transmitting device.
                      If the receiver is disabled, the FIFO characters can be read. However, no additional
                      characters can be received until the receiver is enabled again. If the receiver is reset, the
                      FIFO and all of the receiver status, and the corresponding output ports and interrupt are
                      reset. No additional characters can be received until the receiver is enabled again.
                6.3.6 Receiver reset and disable
                      Receiver disable stops the receiver immediately. Data being assembled in the receiver
                      shift register is lost. Data and status in the FIFO is preserved and may be read. A
                      re-enable of the receiver after a disable will cause the receiver to begin assembling
                      characters at the next start bit detected.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                               SC28L92

                      A receiver reset will discard the present shift register date, reset the receiver ready bit
                      (RxRDY), clear the status of the byte at the top of the FIFO and realign the FIFO
                      read/write pointers.
                6.3.7 Watchdog
                      A watchdog timer is associated with each receiver. Its interrupt is enabled by MR0[7]. The
                      purpose of this timer is to alert the control processor that characters are in the Rx FIFO
                      which have not been read. This situation may occur at the end of a transmission when the
                      last few characters received are not sufficient to cause an interrupt.
                      This counter times out after 64 bit times. It is reset each time a character is transferred
                      from the receiver shift register to the Rx FIFO or a read of the Rx FIFO is executed.
                6.3.8 Receiver time-out mode
                      In addition to the watchdog timer described in Section 6.3.7, the counter/timer may be
                      used for a similar function. Its programmability, of course, allows much greater precision of
                      time-out intervals.
                      The time-out mode uses the received data stream to control the counter. Each time a
                      received character is transferred from the shift register to the Rx FIFO, the counter is
                      restarted. If a new character is not received before the counter reaches zero count, the
                      counter ready bit is set, and an interrupt can be generated. This mode can be used to
                      indicate when data has been left in the Rx FIFO for more than the programmed time limit.
                      Otherwise, if the receiver has been programmed to interrupt the CPU when the receive
                      FIFO is full, and the message ends before the FIFO is full, the CPU may not know there is
                      data left in the FIFO. The CTU and CTL value would be programmed for just over one
                      character time, so that the CPU would be interrupted as soon as it has stopped receiving
                      continuous data. This mode can also be used to indicate when the serial line has been
                      marking for longer than the programmed time limit. In this case, the CPU has read all of
                      the characters from the FIFO, but the last character received has started the count. If
                      there is no new data during the programmed time interval, the counter ready bit will get
                      set, and an interrupt can be generated.
                      The time-out mode is enabled by writing the appropriate command to the command
                      register. Writing 0xA to CRA or CRB will invoke the time-out mode for that channel.
                      Writing 0xC to CRA or CRB will disable the time-out mode. The time-out mode should
                      only be used by one channel at once, since it uses the C/T. If, however, the time-out mode
                      is enabled from both receivers, the time-out will occur only when both receivers have
                      stopped receiving data for the time-out period. CTU and CTL must be loaded with a value
                      greater than the normal receive character period. The time-out mode disables the regular
                      start counter or stop counter commands and puts the C/T into counter mode under the
                      control of the received data stream. Each time a received character is transferred from the
                      shift register to the Rx FIFO, the C/T is stopped after one C/T clock, reloaded with the
                      value in CTU and CTL and then restarted on the next C/T clock. If the C/T is allowed to
                      end the count before a new character has been received, the counter ready bit, ISR[3], will
                      be set. If IMR[3] is set, this will generate an interrupt. Receiving a character after the C/T
                      has timed out will clear the counter ready bit, ISR[3], and the interrupt. Invoking the set
                      time-out mode on command, CRx = 0xA, will also clear the counter ready bit and stop the
                      counter until the next character is received.

                6.3.9 Time-out mode caution
                       When operating in the special time-out mode, it is possible to generate what appears to be
                       a false interrupt, i.e., an interrupt without a cause. This may result when a time-out
                       interrupt occurs and then, before the interrupt is serviced, another character is received,
                       i.e., the data stream has started again. (The interrupt latency is longer than the pause in
                       the data stream.) In this case, when a new character has been receiver, the counter/timer
                       will be restarted by the receiver, thereby withdrawing its interrupt. If, at this time, the
                       interrupt service begins for the previously seen interrupt, a read of the ISR will show the
                       counter ready bit not set. If nothing else is interrupting, this read of the ISR will return a
                       0x00 character.
               6.3.10 Multi-drop mode (9-bit or wake-up)
                       The DUART is equipped with a wake-up mode for multi-drop applications. This mode is
                       selected by programming bits MR1A[4:3] or MR1B[4:3] to 11 for channels A and B,
                       respectively. In this mode of operation, a master station transmits an address character
                       followed by data characters for the addressed slave station. The slave stations, with
                       receivers that are normally disabled, examine the received data stream and wake-up the
                       CPU (by setting RxRDY) only upon receipt of an address character. The CPU compares
                       the received address to its station address and enables the receiver if it wishes to receive
                       the subsequent data characters. Upon receipt of another address character, the CPU may
                       disable the receiver to initiate the process again.
                       A transmitted character consists of a start bit, the programmed number of data bits, and
                       Address/Data (A/D) bit, and the programmed number of stop bits. The polarity of the
                       transmitted A/D bit is selected by the CPU by programming bit MR1A[2]/MR1B[2].
                       MR1A[2]/MR1B[2] = 0 transmits a zero in the A/D bit position, which identifies the
                       corresponding data bits as data while MR1A[2]/MR1B[2] = 1 transmits a one in the A/D bit
                       position, which identifies the corresponding data bits as an address. The CPU should
                       program the mode register prior to loading the corresponding data bits into the Tx FIFO.
                       In this mode, the receiver continuously looks at the received data stream, whether it is
                       enabled or disabled. If disabled, it sets the RxRDY status bit and loads the character into
                       the Rx FIFO if the received A/D bit is a one (address tag), but discards the received
                       character if the received A/D bit is a zero (data tag). If enabled, all received characters are
                       transferred to the CPU via the Rx FIFO. In either case, the data bits are loaded into the
                       data FIFO while the A/D bit is loaded into the status FIFO position normally used for parity
                       error (SRA[5] or SRB[5]). Framing error, overrun error, and break detect operate normally
                       whether or not the receive is enabled.
7. Programming
                   7.1 Register overview
                       The operation of the DUART is programmed by writing control words into the appropriate
                       registers. Operational feedback is provided via status registers which can be read by the
                       CPU. The addressing of the registers is described in Table 4.
                       The contents of certain control registers are initialized to zero on RESET. Care should be
                       exercised if the contents of a register are changed during operation, since certain
                       changes may cause operational problems.

                                                       3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
                            For example, changing the number of bits per character while the transmitter is active may
                            cause the transmission of an incorrect character. In general, the contents of the MR, the
                            CSR, and the OPCR should only be changed while the receiver(s) and transmitter(s) are
                            not enabled, and certain changes to the ACR should only be made while the C/T is
                            stopped.
                            Each channel has three mode registers (MR0, MR1 and MR2) which control the basic
                            configuration of the channel. Access to these registers is controlled by independent MR
                            address pointers. These pointers are set to 0x0 or 0x1 by MR control commands in the
                            command register Miscellaneous Commands. Each time the MR registers are accessed
                            the MR pointer increments, stopping at MR2. It remains pointing to MR2 until set to 0x0 or
                            0x1 via the miscellaneous commands of the command register. The pointer is set to 0x1
                            on reset for compatibility with previous Philips Semiconductors UART software.
                            Mode, command, clock select, and status registers are duplicated for each channel to
                            provide total independent operation and control. Refer to Section 7.2 for register bit
                            overview. The reserved registers at addresses 0x2 and 0xA should never be read during
                            normal operation since they are reserved for internal diagnostics.

                                                         When enabled, the watchdog timer will generate a receiver interrupt if
                                                         the receiver FIFO has not been accessed within 64 bit times of the
                                                         receiver 1× clock. The watchdog timer is used to alert the control
                                                         processor that data is in the Rx FIFO that has not been read. This
                                                         situation will occur when the byte count of the last part of a message
                                                         is not large enough to generate an interrupt.
                                                         The watchdog timer presents itself as a receiver interrupt with the
                                                         RxRDY bit set in SR and ISR.
                           6         RxINT[2]            Bit 2 of receiver FIFO interrupt level. This bit along with bit 6 of MR1
                                                         sets the fill level of the FIFO that generates the receiver interrupt.
                                                         Note that this control is split between MR0 and MR1. This is for
                                                         backward compatibility to the SC26C92 and SCC2681.
                                                         For the receiver these bits control the number of FIFO positions filled
                                                         when the receiver will attempt to interrupt. After the reset the receiver
                                                         FIFO is empty. The default setting of these bits cause the receiver to
                                                         attempt to interrupt when it has one or more bytes in it; see Table 25.
                           5 and 4   TxINT[1:0]          Transmitter interrupt fill level. For the transmitter these bits control the
                                                         number of FIFO positions empty when the receiver will attempt to
                                                         interrupt; see Table 26. After the reset the transmit FIFO has 8 bytes
                                                         empty. It will then attempt to interrupt as soon as the transmitter is
                                                         enabled. The default setting (TxINT[1:0] = 00) condition the
                                                         transmitter to attempt to interrupt only when it is completely empty. As
                                                         soon as one byte is loaded, it is no longer empty and hence will
                                                         withdraw its interrupt request.

                                                              This output is normally asserted by setting OPR[0] and negated by

                                                              will occur and the 10th or 17th or 17th byte will be lost. However, the

                                                mode immediately. An exception to this is switching out of auto echo or
                                                remote loopback modes: if the deselection occurs just after the receiver
                                                has sampled the stop bit (indicated in auto echo by assertion of RxRDY),
                                                and the transmitter is enabled, the transmitter will remain in auto echo
                                                mode until the entire stop has been retransmitted.

                                        negated by resetting OPR[0]. MR2A[5] = 1 caused OPR[0] to be reset

                                        This feature can be used to automatically terminate the transmission of a

                                          1. Program auto-reset mode: MR2A[5] = 1
                                          2. Enable transmitter

                                          6. The last character will be transmitted and OPR[0] will be reset one bit
                                               time after the last stop bit, causing RTSAN to be negated
                   4         -          Channel A transmitter Clear To Send (CTS) control.
                                            0 = Input CTSAN(IP0) has no effect on the transmitter
                                            1 = CTS control enabled
                                        If this bit is a 1, the transmitter checks the state of CTSAN (IP0) each time
                                        it is ready to send a character. If IP0 is asserted (LOW), the character is
                                        transmitted. If it is negated (HIGH), the TxDA output remains in the
                                        marking state and the transmission is delayed until CTSAN goes LOW.
                                        Changes in CTSAN while a character is being transmitted do not affect the
                                        transmission of that character.

                                        appended to the transmitted character. Stop bit lengths of 9⁄16 to 1 and
                                        1 − 9⁄16 to 2 bits, in increments of 1⁄16 bit, can be programmed for character
                                        lengths of 6, 7, and 8 bits. For a character lengths of 5 bits, 1 − 1⁄16 to 2
                                        stop bits can be programmed in increments of 1⁄16 bit. In all cases, the
                                        receiver only checks for a mark condition at the center of the stop bit
                                        position (one half-bit time after the last data bit, or after the parity bit if
                                        enabled is sampled). Refer to Table 32 for the values.

                       reading or writing MR0B, the pointer will point to MR1B.
                       The bit definitions for this register are identical to MR0A, except the FIFO size bit and that
                       all control actions apply to the channel B receiver, transmitter, the corresponding inputs
                       and outputs. MR0B[2:0] are reserved.

                       pointer is set to MR1 by RESET or by a set pointer command applied via CRB. After
                       reading or writing MR1B, the pointer will point to MR2B.
                       The bit definitions for this register are identical to MR1A, except that all control actions
                       apply to the channel B receiver and transmitter and the corresponding inputs and outputs.

                       MR2B (address 0x8) is accessed when the channel B MR pointer points to MR2, which
                       occurs after any access to MR1B. Accesses to MR2B do not change the pointer.
                       The bit definitions for mode register are identical to the bit definitions for MR2A, except
                       that all control actions apply to the channel B receiver and transmitter and the

               7.3.3.1 Command Register channel A (CRA)
                       CRA is a register used to supply commands to channel A. Multiple commands can be
                       specified in a single write to CRA as long as the commands are non-conflicting, e.g., the
                       enable transmitter and reset transmitter commands cannot be specified in a single
                       command word.

                       7 to 4   -           Miscellaneous commands. Execution of the commands in the upper four bits
                                            of this register must be separated by 3 X1 clock edges. Other reads or writes
                                            (including writes to the lower four bits) may be inserted to achieve this
                                            separation. A description of miscellaneous commands is given in Table 40.
                       3        -           Disable channel A transmitter. This command terminates transmitter operation
                                            and reset the TxDRY and TxEMT status bits. However, if a character is being
                                            transmitted or if a character is in the Tx FIFO when the transmitter is disabled,
                                            the transmission of the character(s) is completed before assuming the inactive
                                            state.
                       2        -           Enable channel A transmitter. Enables operation of the channel A transmitter.
                                            The TxRDY and TxEMT status bits will be asserted if the transmitter is idle.
                       1        -           Disable channel A receiver. This command terminates operation of the
                                            receiver immediately-a character being received will be lost. The command
                                            has no effect on the receiver status bits or any other control registers. If the
                                            special multi-drop mode is programmed, the receiver operates even if it is
                                            disabled. See Section 6.3.10.
                       0        -           Enable channel A receiver. Enables operation of the channel A receiver. If not
                                            in the special wake-up mode, this also forces the receiver into the search for
                                            start-bit state.

                       0001           Reset MR pointer. Causes the channel A MR pointer to point to MR1.
                       0010           Reset receiver. Resets the channel A receiver as if a hardware reset had been
                                      applied. The receiver is disabled and the FIFO is flushed.
                       0011           Reset transmitter. Resets the channel A transmitter as if a hardware reset had
                                      been applied.
                       0100           Reset error status. Clears the channel A received break, parity error, and overrun
                                      error bits in the status register (SRA[7:4]). Used in character mode to clear OE
                                      status (although RB, PE and FE bits will also be cleared) and in block mode to clear
                                      all error status after a block of data has been received.
                       0101           Reset channel A break change interrupt. Causes the channel A break detect
                                      change bit in the interrupt status register (ISR[2]) to be cleared to zero.

                       Command         Description
                       0110            Start break. Forces the TxDA output LOW (spacing). If the transmitter is empty the
                                       start of the break condition will be delayed up to two bit times. If the transmitter is
                                       active the break begins when transmission of the character is completed. If a
                                       character is in the Tx FIFO, the start of the break will be delayed until that
                                       character, or any other loaded subsequently are transmitted. The transmitter must
                                       be enabled for this command to be accepted.
                       0111            Stop break. The TxDA line will go HIGH (marking) within two bit times. TxDA will
                                       remain HIGH for one bit time before the next character, if any, is transmitted.
                       1000            Assert RTSN. Causes the RTSN output to be asserted (LOW).
                       1001            Negate RTSN. Causes the RTSN output to be negated (HIGH).
                       1010            Set time-out mode on. The receiver in this channel will restart the C/T as each
                                       receive character is transferred from the shift register to the Rx FIFO. The C/T is
                                       placed in the counter mode, the start counter or stop counter commands are
                                       disabled, the counter is stopped, and the counter ready bit, ISR[3], is reset. (see
                                       also watchdog timer description in the receiver Section 6.3.7.)
                       1011            Set MR pointer to 0x0.
                       1100            Disable time-out mode. This command returns control of the C/T to the regular start
                                       counter or stop counter commands. It does not stop the counter, or clear any
                                       pending interrupts. After disabling the time-out mode, a stop counter command
                                       should be issued to force a reset of the ISR[3] bit.
                       1101            Not used.
                       1110            Power-down mode on. In this mode, the DUART oscillator is stopped and all
                                       functions requiring this clock are suspended. The execution of commands other
                                       than disable Power-down mode (1111) requires a X1/CLK. While in the
                                       Power-down mode, do not issue any commands to the CR except the disable
                                       Power-down mode command. The contents of all registers will be saved while in
                                       this mode. It is recommended that the transmitter and receiver be disabled prior to
                                       placing the DUART into Power-down mode. This command is in CRA only.
                       1111            Disable Power-down mode. This command restarts the oscillator. After invoking this
                                       command, wait for the oscillator to start up before writing further commands to the
                                       CR. This command is in CRA only. For maximum power reduction input pins should
                                       be at VSS or VDD.
               7.3.3.2 Command Register channel B (CRB)
                       CRB is a register used to supply commands to channel B. Multiple commands can be
                       specified in a single write to CRB as long as the commands are non-conflicting, e.g., the
                       enable transmitter and reset transmitter commands cannot be specified in a single
                       command word.
                       The bit definitions for this register are identical to the bit definitions for CRA, with the
                       exception of miscellaneous commands 0xE and 0xF which are used for Power-down
                       mode. These two commands are not used in CRB. All other control actions that apply to
                       CRA also apply to CRB.

                            status provides these bits [7:5] from the top of the FIFO together with bits [4:0]. These bits are cleared by a
                            reset error status command. In character mode they are discarded when the corresponding data character
                            is read from the FIFO. In block error mode, the error-reset command (command 0x4 or receiver reset) must
                            used to clear block error conditions.

                                              received without a stop bit. Only a single FIFO position is occupied when a
                                              break is received: further entries to the FIFO are inhibited until the RxDA line
                                              returns to the marking state for at least one-half a bit time two successive
                                              edges of the internal or external 1× clock. This will usually require a HIGH
                                              time of one X1 clock period or 3 X1 edges since the clock of the controller
                                              is not synchronous to the X1 clock.
                                              When this bit is set, the channel A change in break bit in the ISR (ISR[2]) is set.
                                              ISR[2] is also set when the end of the break condition, as defined above, is
                                              detected.
                                              The break detect circuitry can detect breaks that originate in the middle of a
                                              received character. However, if a break begins in the middle of a character, it
                                              must persist until at least the end of the next character time in order for it to be
                                              detected.
                                              This bit is reset by command 0x4 (0100) written to the command register or by
                                              receiver reset.

                                              This bit, when set, indicates that a stop bit was not detected (not a logic 1)
                                              when the corresponding data character in the FIFO was received. The stop bit
                                              check is made in the middle of the first stop bit position.

                                              This bit is set when the with parity or force parity mode is programmed and the
                                              corresponding character in the FIFO was received with incorrect parity.
                                              In the special multi-drop mode the parity error bit stores the receive A/D
                                              (Address/Data) bit.

                                   This bit, when set, indicates that one or more characters in the received data
                                   stream have been lost. It is set upon receipt of a new character when the FIFO
                                   is full and a character is already in the receive shift register waiting for an empty
                                   FIFO position. When this occurs, the character in the receive shift register (and
                                   its break detect, parity error and framing error status, if any) is lost.
                                   This bit is cleared by a reset error status command.

                                   This bit will be set when the transmitter under runs, i.e., both the TxEMT and
                                   TxRDY bits are set. This bit and TxRDY are set when the transmitter is first
                                   enabled and at any time it is re-enabled after either (a) reset, or (b) the
                                   transmitter has assumed the disabled state. It is always set after transmission
                                   of the last stop bit of a character if no character is in the Tx Holding Register
                                   (TxFIFOA) awaiting transmission.
                                   It is reset when the Tx Holding Register (TxFIFOA) is loaded by the CPU, a
                                   pending transmitter disable is executed, the transmitter is reset, or the
                                   transmitter is disabled while in the under run condition.

                                   This bit, when set, indicates that the transmit FIFO is not full and ready to be
                                   loaded with another character. This bit is cleared when the transmit FIFO is
                                   loaded by the CPU and there are (after this load) no more empty locations in
                                   the FIFO. It is set when a character is transferred to the transmit shift register.
                                   TxRDYA is reset when the transmitter is disabled and is set when the
                                   transmitter is first enabled. Characters loaded to the Tx FIFO while this bit is
                                   logic 0 will be lost. This bit has different meaning from ISR[0].

                                       0 = no
                                       1 = yes
                                   This bit is set when a character is transferred from the receive shift register to
                                   the receive FIFO and the transfer causes the FIFO to become full, i.e., all eight
                                   (or 16) FIFO positions are occupied. It is reset when the CPU reads the receive
                                   FIFO. If a character is waiting in the receive shift register because the FIFO is
                                   full, FFULLA will not be reset when the CPU reads the receive FIFO. This bit
                                   has different meaning from ISR1 when MR1[6] is programmed to a logic 1

                                       1 = yes
                                   This bit indicates that a character has been received and is waiting in the FIFO
                                   to be read by the CPU. It is set when the character is transferred from the
                                   receive shift register to the FIFO and reset when the CPU reads the receive
                                   FIFO, only if (after this read) there are no more characters in the FIFO - the Rx
                                   FIFO becomes empty.

                       [1]  These status bits are appended to the corresponding data character in the receive FIFO. A read of the
                            status provides these bits [7:5] from the top of the FIFO together with bits [4:0]. These bits are cleared by a
                            reset error status command. In character mode they are discarded when the corresponding data character
                            is read from the FIFO. In block error mode, the error-reset command (command 0x4 or receiver reset) must
                            used to clear block error conditions.
                       The bit definitions for this register are identical to the bit definitions for SRA, except that all
                       status applies to the channel B receiver and transmitter and the corresponding inputs and
                       outputs.
                7.3.5 Output Configuration Control Register (OPCR)
                       This register controls the signal presented by the OP[7:2] pins. The signal presented by
                       the OP[1:0] pins is controlled by the Rx, Tx, and the command register. The default
                       condition of the OP pins is to drive the complement of the data in the OPR[7:0] register.
                       When OP[7:2] pins drive DMA or interrupt type signals, they switch to open-drain
                       configuration. Otherwise, they drive strong logic 0 or logic 1 levels.

                                             1 = change
                                           These bits are set when a change of state, as defined in Section 6.2.9 “Input
                                           port”, occurs at the respective input pins. They are cleared when the IPCR is
                                           read by the CPU. A read of the IPCR also clears ISR[7], the input change bit in
                                           the interrupt status register. The setting of these bits can be programmed to
                                           generate an interrupt to the CPU.
                       3 to 0    -         IP3, IP2, IP1 and IP0 state.

                                             1 = HIGH
                                           These bits provide the current state of the respective inputs. The information is
                                           unlatched and reflects the state of the input pins at the time the IPCR is read.
               7.3.11 Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
                      This register provides the status of all potential interrupt sources. The contents of this
                      register are masked by the Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). If a bit in the ISR is a logic 1
                      and the corresponding bit in the IMR is also a logic 1, the INTRN output will be asserted
                      (LOW). If the corresponding bit in the IMR is a zero, the state of the bit in the ISR has no
                      effect on the INTRN output. Note that the IMR does not mask the reading of the ISR. The
                      true status will be provided regardless of the contents of the IMR. The contents of this
                      register are initialized to 0x0 when the DUART is reset.

               7.3.12 Interrupt Mask Register (IMR)
                      The programming of this register selects which bits in the ISR causes an interrupt output.
                      If a bit in the ISR is a logic 1 and the corresponding bit in the IMR is also a logic 1 the
                      INTRN output will be asserted. If the corresponding bit in the IMR is a zero, the state of

                      (GP; 80xxx mode)
                      This register stores the Interrupt Vector. It is initialized to 0x0F on hardware reset and is
                      usually changed from this value during initialization of the SC28L92. The contents of this
                      register will be placed on the data bus when IACKN is asserted LOW or a read of address
                      0xC is performed.
                      When not operating in the 68xxx mode, this register may be used as a general purpose
                      one byte storage register. A convenient use could be to store a shadow of the contents of
                      another SC28L92 register (IMR, for example).

                       7:0          -                                The lower eight (8) bits for the 16-bit counter/timer preset register
                      The CTPU and CTPL hold the eight MSBs and eight LSBs, respectively, of the value to be
                      used by the counter/timer in either the counter or timer modes of operation. The minimum
                      value which may be loaded into the CTPU/CTPL registers is 0x0002. Note that these
                      registers are write only and cannot be read by the CPU.
                      In the timer mode, the C/T generates a square wave whose period is twice the value (in
                      C/T clock periods) of the CTPU and CTPL. The waveform so generated is often used for a
                      data clock. The formula for calculating the divisor n to load to the CTPU and CTPL for a
                      particular 1× data clock is shown in Equation 2.
                           counter/timer clock frequency
                      n = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  (2)
                              2 × 16 × ( desired baud rate )
                      Often this division will result in a non-integer number; 26.3, for example. One can only
                      program integer numbers in a digital divider. Therefore, 26 would be chosen. This gives a
                      baud rate error of 0.3/26.3 which is 1.14 %; well within the ability asynchronous mode of
                      operation.
                      The C/T will not be running until it receives an initial start counter command (read at
                      address A3 to A0 = 1110). After this, while in timer mode, the C/T will run continuously.
                      Receipt of a start counter command (read with A3 to A0 = 1110) causes the counter to
                      terminate the current timing cycle and to begin a new cycle using the values in CTPU and
                      CTPL. If the value in CTPU and CTPL is changed, the current half-period will not be
                      affected, but subsequent half periods will be affected.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                SC28L92
                                                3.3 V/5.0 V Dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
                       The counter ready status bit (ISR[3]) is set once each cycle of the square wave. The bit is
                       reset by a stop counter command (read with A3 to A0 = 1111). The command however,
                       does not stop the C/T. The generated square wave is output on OP3 if it is programmed to
                       be the C/T output. In the counter mode, the value C/T loaded into CTPU and CTPL by the
                       CPU is counted down to 0. Counting begins upon receipt of a start counter command.
                       Upon reaching terminal count 0x0000, the counter ready interrupt bit (ISR[3]) is set. The
                       counter continues counting past the terminal count until stopped by the CPU. If OP3 is
                       programmed to be the output of the C/T, the output remains HIGH until terminal count is
                       reached, at which time it goes LOW. The output returns to the HIGH state and ISR[3] is
                       cleared when the counter is stopped by a stop counter command. The CPU may change
                       the values of CTPU and CTPL at any time, but the new count becomes effective only on
                       the next start counter commands. If new values have not been loaded, the previous count
                       values are preserved and used for the next count cycle.
                       In the counter mode, the current value of the upper and lower 8 bits of the counter (CTU,
                       CTL) may be read by the CPU. It is recommended that the counter be stopped when
                       reading to prevent potential problems which may occur if a carry from the lower 8 bits to
                       the upper 8 bits occurs between the times that both halves of the counter are read.
                       However, note that a subsequent start counter command will cause the counter to begin a
                       new count cycle using the values in CTPU and CTPL.
                       When the C/T clock divided by 16 is selected, the maximum divisor becomes 1,048,575.
                   7.4 Output port notes
                       The output ports are controlled from four places: the OPCR register, the OPR register, the
                       MR registers and the command register (except the SCC2681 and SCC68681). The
                       OPCR register controls the source of the data for the output ports OP2 to OP7. The data
                       source for output ports OP0 and OP1 is controlled by the MR and CR registers. When the
                       OPR is the source of the data for the output ports, the data at the ports is inverted from
                       that in the OPR register.
                       The content of the OPR register is controlled by the Set Output Port bits command and
                       the Reset Output Port bits command. These commands are at 0xE and 0xF, respectively.
                       When these commands are used, action takes place only at the bit locations where ones
                       exist. For example, a logic 1 in bit location 5 of the data word used with the Set Output
                       Port bits command will result in OPR5 being set to one. The OP5 would then be set to
                       logic 0 (VSS). Similarly, a logic 1 in bit position 5 of the data word associated with the
                       Reset Output Ports bits command would set OPR5 to logic 0 and, hence, the pin OP5 to a
                       logic 1 (VDD).
                   7.5 The CTS, RTS, CTS enable Tx signals
                       Clear To Send (CTS) is usually meant to be a signal to the transmitter meaning that it may
                       transmit data to the receiver. The CTS input is on pin IP0 for TxA and on IP1 for TxB. The
                       CTS signal is active LOW; thus, it is called CTSAN for TxA and CTSBN for TxB. RTS is
                       usually meant to be a signal from the receiver indicating that the receiver is ready to
                       receive data. It is also active LOW and is, thus, called RTSAN for RxA and RTSBN for
                       RxB. RTSAN is on pin OP0 and RTSBN is on OP1. A receiver’s RTS output will usually be
                       connected to the CTS input of the associated transmitter. Therefore, one could say that
                       RTS and CTS are different ends of the same wire.

                   MR2[4] is the bit that allows the transmitter to be controlled by the CTS pin (IP0 or IP1).
                   When this bit is set to one AND the CTS input is driven HIGH, the transmitter will stop
                   sending data at the end of the present character being serialized. It is usually the RTS
                   output of the receiver that will be connected to the transmitter’s CTS input. The receiver
                   will set RTS HIGH when the receiver FIFO is full AND the start bit of the 9th or 17th
                   character is sensed. Transmission then stops with 9 or 17 valid characters in the receiver.
                   When MR2[4] is set to one, CTSN must be at zero for the transmitter to operate. If MR2[4]
                   is set to zero, the IP pin will have no effect on the operation of the transmitter. MR1[7] is
                   the bit that allows the receiver to control OP0. When OP0 (or OP1) is controlled by the
                   receiver, the meaning of that pin will be.

                   [1]   For operation at elevated temperatures, the device must be derated based on 150 °C maximum junction
                         temperature.
                   [2]   Parameters are valid over specified temperature range.
                   [3]   This product includes circuitry specifically designed for the protection of its internal devices from damaging
                         effects of excessive static charge. Nonetheless, it is suggested that conventional precautions be taken to
                         avoid applying any voltages larger than the rated maxima.

[1]   The following conditions apply:
      a) Parameters are valid over specified temperature and voltage range.
      b) All voltage measurements are referenced to ground. For testing, all inputs swing between 0.4 V and 3.0 V with a transition time of
          5 ns maximum. For X1/CLK this swing is between 0.4 V and 0.8VCC. All time measurements are referenced at input voltages of 0.8 V
          and 2.0 V, and output voltages of 0.8 V and 2.0 V, as appropriate.
      c) Typical values are at 25 °C, typical supply voltages, and typical processing parameters.
[2]   Test conditions for outputs: CL = 125 pF, except open-drain outputs. Test conditions for open-drain outputs: CL = 125 pF,
      constant current source = 2.6 mA.
[3]   Input port pins have active pull-up transistors that will source a typical 2 µA from VCC when the input pins are at VSS. Input port pins at
      VCC source 0.0 µA.
[4]   All outputs are disconnected. Inputs are switching between CMOS levels of VCC − 0.2 V and VSS + 0.2 V.

[1]   The following conditions apply:
      a) Parameters are valid over specified temperature and voltage range.
      b) All voltage measurements are referenced to ground. For testing, all inputs swing between 0.4 V and 3.0 V with a transition time of
          5 ns maximum. For X1/CLK this swing is between 0.4 V and 0.8VCC. All time measurements are referenced at input voltages of 0.8 V
          and 2.0 V, and output voltages of 0.8 V and 2.0 V, as appropriate.
      c) Typical values are at 25 °C, typical supply voltages, and typical processing parameters.
[2]   Test conditions for outputs: CL = 125 pF, except interrupt outputs. Test conditions for interrupt outputs: CL = 125 pF,
      constant current source = 2.6 mA.
[3]   Input port pins have active pull-up transistors that will source a typical 2 µA from VCC when they are at VSS. Input port pins at VCC source
      0.0 µA.
[4]   All outputs are disconnected. Inputs are switching between CMOS levels of VCC − 0.2 V and VSS + 0.2 V.

[1]   The following conditions apply:
      a) Parameters are valid over specified temperature and voltage range.
      b) All voltage measurements are referenced to ground. For testing, all inputs swing between 0.4 V and 3.0 V with a transition time of
          5 ns maximum. For X1/CLK this swing is between 0.4 V and 0.8VCC. All time measurements are referenced at input voltages of 0.8 V
          and 2.0 V, and output voltages of 0.8 V and 2.0 V, as appropriate.
      c) Test conditions for outputs: CL = 125 pF, except open-drain outputs. Test conditions for open-drain outputs: CL = 125 pF,
          constant current source = 2.6 mA.
      d) Typical values are the average values at +25 °C and 5 V.
[2]   Timing is illustrated and referenced to the WRN and RDN Inputs. Also, CEN may be the strobing input. CEN and RDN (also CEN and
      WRN) are ORed internally. The signal asserted last initiates the cycle and the signal negated first terminates the cycle.
[3]   Guaranteed by characterization of sample units.
[4]   If CEN is used as the strobing input, the parameter defines the minimum HIGH times between one CEN and the next. The RDN signal
      must be negated for tRWD to guarantee that any status register changes are valid.
[5]   Minimum frequencies are not tested but are guaranteed by design.
[6]   Clocks for 1× mode should maintain a 60/40 duty cycle or better.

[7]   Minimum DACKN time is ((tDCR or tDCW) tCSC + 2 X1 edges + rise time over 5 ns). Two X1 edges is 273 ns at 3.6864 MHz. For faster bus
      cycles, the 80xxx bus timing may be used while in the 68xxx mode. It is not necessary to wait for DACKN to insure the proper operation
      of the SC26C92. In all cases the data will be written to the SC28L92 on the falling edge of DACKN or the rise of CEN. The fall of CEN
      initializes the bus cycle. The rise of CEN ends the bus cycle. DACKN LOW or CEN HIGH completes the write cycle.

[1]   The following conditions apply:
      a) Parameters are valid over specified temperature and voltage range.
      b) All voltage measurements are referenced to ground. For testing, all inputs swing between 0.4 V and 3.0 V with a transition time of
          5 ns maximum. For X1/CLK this swing is between 0.4 V and 0.8VCC. All time measurements are referenced at input voltages of 0.8 V
          and 2.0 V, and output voltages of 0.8 V and 2.0 V, as appropriate.
      c) Test conditions for outputs: CL = 125 pF, except open-drain outputs. Test conditions for open-drain outputs: CL = 125 pF,
          constant current source = 2.6 mA.
      d) Typical values are the average values at +25 °C and 3.3 V.
[2]   Timing is illustrated and referenced to the WRN and RDN Inputs. Also, CEN may be the strobing input. CEN and RDN (also CEN and
      WRN) are ORed internally. The signal asserted last initiates the cycle and the signal negated first terminates the cycle.
[3]   Guaranteed by characterization of sample units.
[4]   If CEN is used as the strobing input, the parameter defines the minimum HIGH times between one CEN and the next. The RDN signal
      must be negated for tRWD to guarantee that any status register changes are valid.
[5]   Minimum frequencies are not tested but are guaranteed by design.
[6]   Clocks for 1× mode should maintain a 60/40 duty cycle or better.

[7]   Minimum DACKN time is ((tDCR or tDCW) tCSC + 2 X1 edges + rise time over 5 ns). Two X1 edges is 273 ns at 3.6864 MHz. For faster bus
      cycles, the 80xxx bus timing may be used while in the 68xxx mode. It is not necessary to wait for DACKN to insure the proper operation
      of the SC26C92. In all cases the data will be written to the SC28L92 on the falling edge of DACKN or the rise of CEN. The fall of CEN
      initializes the bus cycle. The rise of CEN ends the bus cycle. DACKN LOW or CEN HIGH completes the write cycle.

                           The test for open-drain outputs is intended to guarantee switching of the output transistor.
                           Measurement of this response is referenced from the midpoint of the switching signal, VM, to a
                           point 0.2 V above VOL. This point represents noise margin that assures true switching has
                           occurred. Beyond this level, the effects of external circuitry and test environment are
                           pronounced and can greatly affect the resultant measurement.

14. Soldering
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                14.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                14.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus PbSn soldering
                14.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                14.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 27) than a PbSn process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 69 and 70

                                                    < 350               350 to 2000          > 2000
                      < 1.6                         260                 260                  260
                      1.6 to 2.5                    260                 250                  245
                      > 2.5                         250                 245                  245
                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 27.
