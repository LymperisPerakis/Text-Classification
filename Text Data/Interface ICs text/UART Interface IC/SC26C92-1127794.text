The SC26C92 is a pin and function replacement for the SCC2692                  selectable from:
and SCN2681 with added features and deeper FIFOs. Its                          ‚Äì 27 fixed rates: 50 to 230.4k baud
configuration on power up is that of the 2692. Its differences from

The Philips Semiconductors SC26C92 Dual Universal
Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (DUART) is a single-chip
                                                                             ‚Ä¢ False start bit detection

The operating mode and data format of each channel can be
programmed independently. Additionally, each receiver and                      ‚Äì Local loopback

Each receiver and transmitter is buffered by eight character FIFOs
to minimize the potential of receiver overrun, transmitter underrun            ‚Äì Individual bit set/reset capability
and to reduce interrupt overhead in interrupt driven systems. In               ‚Äì Outputs can be programmed to be status/interrupt signals
addition, a flow control capability is provided via RTS/CTS signaling          ‚Äì FIFO states for DMA and modem interface
to disable a remote transmitter when the receiver buffer is full.
                                                                             ‚Ä¢ Versatile interrupt system
Also provided on the SC26C92 are a multipurpose 7-bit input port               ‚Äì Single interrupt output with eight maskable interrupting
and a multipurpose 8-bit output port. These can be used as general               conditions

PIN DESCRIPTION
               PKG      PIN
 SYMBOL                                                                NAME AND FUNCTION
              40,44    TYPE
  D0-D7         X       I/O Data Bus: Bidirectional 3-State data bus used to transfer commands, data and status between the DUART
                            and the CPU. D0 is the least significant bit.
  CEN           X         I Chip Enable: Active-Low input signal. When Low, data transfers between the CPU and the DUART are
                            enabled on D0-D7 as controlled by the WRN, RDN and A0-A3 inputs. When High, places the D0-D7 lines
                            in the 3-State condition.
  WRN           X         I Write Strobe: When Low and CEN is also Low, the contents of the data bus is loaded into the addressed
                            register. The transfer occurs on the rising edge of the signal.
  RDN           X         I Read Strobe: When Low and CEN is also Low, causes the contents of the addressed register to be
                            presented on the data bus. The read cycle begins on the falling edge of RDN.
  A0-A3         X         I Address Inputs: Select the DUART internal registers and ports for read/write operations.
  RESET         X         I Reset: A High level clears internal registers (SRA, SRB, IMR, ISR, OPR, OPCR), puts OP0-OP7 in the
                            High state, stops the counter/timer, and puts Channels A and B in the inactive state, with the TxDA and
                            TxDB outputs in the mark (High) state. Sets MR pointer to MR1 and resets MR0.
  INTRN         X        O  Interrupt Request: Active-Low, open-drain, output which signals the CPU that one or more of the eight
                            maskable interrupting conditions are true. Requires a pullup resistor.
  X1/CLK        X         I Crystal 1: Crystal connection or an external clock input. A crystal of a clock the appropriate frequency
                            (nominally 3.6864 MHz) must be supplied at all times. For crystal connections see Figure 7, Clock Timing.
  X2            X         I Crystal 2: Crystal connection. See Figure 7. If a crystal is not used this pin must be left open or not driving
                            more than one TTL equivalent load.
  RxDA          X         I Channel A Receiver Serial Data Input: The least significant bit is received first. ‚ÄúMark‚Äù is High, ‚Äúspace‚Äù is Low.
  RxDB          X         I Channel B Receiver Serial Data Input: The least significant bit is received first. ‚ÄúMark‚Äù is High, ‚Äúspace‚Äù is Low.
  TxDA          X        O  Channel A Transmitter Serial Data Output: The least significant bit is transmitted first. This output is held
                            in the ‚Äúmark‚Äù condition when the transmitter is disabled, idle or when operating in local loopback mode.
                            ‚ÄúMark‚Äù is High, ‚Äúspace‚Äù is Low.
  TxDB          X        O  Channel B Transmitter Serial Data Output: The least significant bit is transmitted first. This output is
                            held in the ‚Äòmark‚Äô condition when the transmitter is disabled, idle, or when operating in local loopback mode.
                            ‚ÄòMark‚Äô is High, ‚Äòspace‚Äô is Low.
  OP0           X        O  Output 0: General purpose output or Channel A request to send (RTSAN, active-Low). Can be
                            deactivated automatically on receive or transmit.
  OP1           X        O  Output 1: General purpose output or Channel B request to send (RTSBN, active-Low). Can be

NOTES:
1. Stresses above those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings may cause permanent damage to the device. This is a stress rating only and
     functional operation of the device at these or any other condition above those indicated in the operation section of this specification is not
     implied.
2. For operating at elevated temperatures, the device must be derated based on +150¬∞C maximum junction temperature.
3. This product includes circuitry specifically designed for the protection of its internal devices from damaging effects of excessive static
     charge. Nonetheless, it is suggested that conventional precautions be taken to avoid applying any voltages larger than the rated maxima.
4. Parameters are valid over specified temperature range.

1. Parameters are valid over specified temperature range.
2. All voltage measurements are referenced to ground (GND). For testing, all inputs swing between 0.4V and 3.0V with a transition time of 5ns

    output voltages of 0.8V and 2.0V, as appropriate.
3. Typical values are at +25¬∞C, typical supply voltages, and typical processing parameters.
4. Test conditions for outputs: CL = 150pF, except interrupt outputs. Test conditions for interrupt outputs: CL = 50pF, RL = 2.7K‚Ñ¶ to VCC.
5. Timing is illustrated and referenced to the WRN and RDN inputs. Also, CEN may be the ‚Äòstrobing‚Äô input. CEN and RDN (also CEN and
    WRN) are ORed internally. The signal asserted last initiates the cycle and the signal negated first terminates the cycle.
6. If CEN is used as the ‚Äòstrobing‚Äô input, the parameter defines the minimum High times between one CEN and the next. The RDN signal must
    be negated for tRWD to guarantee that any status register changes are valid.
7. Minimum frequencies are not tested but are guaranteed by design. Crystal frequencies 2 to 4 MHz.
8. Clocks for 1X mode should be symmetrical.

 NOTE: *These status bits are appended to the corresponding data character in the receive FIFO. A read of the status provides these bits
 (7:5) from the top of the FIFO together with bits (4:0). These bits are cleared by a ‚Äúreset error status‚Äù command. In character mode they are
 discarded when the corresponding data character is read from the FIFO. In block error mode, block error conditions must be cleared by using
 the error reset command (command 4x) or a receiver reset.
