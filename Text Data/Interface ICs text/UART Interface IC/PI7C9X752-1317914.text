                                          comes read strobe (active low). The falling edge instigates an internal read cycle
                                          and retrieves the data byte from an internal register pointed by the address lines
IOR# (NC)             19                I [A2:A0], puts the data byte on the data bus to allow the host processor to read it on
                                          the rising edge.
                                          When 16/68# pin is LOW, the Motorola bus interface is selected and this input is
                                          not used.
                                          When 16/68# pin is HIGH, it selects Intel bus interface and this input becomes
                                          write strobe (active low). The falling edge instigates the internal write cycle and the

                                          When 16/68# pin is LOW, the Motorola bus interface is selected and this input
                                          becomes read (HIGH) and write (LOW) signal.
                                          When 16/68# pin is HIGH, this input is chip select A (active low) to enable channel

                                          Motorola bus interface.
                                          When 16/68# pin is HIGH, this input is chip select B (active low) to enable channel

CSB#(A3)              11                I When 16/68# pin is LOW, this input becomes address line A3 which is used for
                                          channel selection in the Motorola bus interface. Input logic 0 selects channel A
                                          and logic 1 selects channel B.
                                          When 16/68# pin is HIGH for Intel bus interface, this output becomes channel
                                          A interrupt output. The output state is defined by the user through the software
                                          setting of MCR[3]. INTA is set to the active mode and OP2A# output LOW when
                                          MCR[3] is set to a logic 1. INTA is set to the three state mode and OP2A# to HIGH

Functional Description
The PI7C9X752 integrates the functions of 4 enhanced 16550 UARTs. Each UART channel has its own 16550 UART compatible con-
figuration register set for individual channel control, status, and data transfer. Additionally, each UART channel has 64-byte of trans-
mit and receive FIFOs, automatic RTS/CTS hardware flow control with hysteresis control, automatic Xon/Xoff and special character
software flow control, programmable transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels, FIFO level counters, infrared encoder and decoder
(IrDA ver. 1.0 and 1.1), programmable baud rate generator with a prescaler of divide by 1 or 4, and data rate up to 16Mbps with 4X
sampling clock. The PI7C9X752 is a 1.62-3.6V device with 5 volt tolerant inputs (except XTAL1).
The PI7C9X752 comes with packages: 48-pin QFP which both Intel and Motorola interfere.
1. Trigger levels
The PI7C9X752 provides independent selectable and programmable trigger levels for both Receiver and transmitter DMA and inter-
rupt generation. After reset, both transmitter and receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of
one character. The selectable trigger levels are controlled via Register TLR(if TLR is non-zero) or (if TLR is zero) via FIFO Control
Register(FCR) and Feature Control Register(FCTR). Refer to Table 1.

2. Hardware flow control
Hardware flow control is comprised of Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS (see Figure 1). Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS can be enabled/disabled
independently by programming EFR[7:6].
With Auto-CTS, CTS must be active before the UART can transmit data.
Auto-RTS only activates the RTS output when there is enough room in the FIFO to receive data and de-activates the RTS output when
the RX FIFO is sufficiently full. The halt and resume trigger levels is controlled by FCR and FCTR bits.
If both Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS are enabled, when RTS is connected to CTS, data transmission does not occur unless the receiver
FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if the
transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

2.1 Auto RTS Hardware Flow Control Operation
Figure 2 shows RTS# functional timing. The RTS# output pin is used to request remote unit to suspend/resume data transmission.
The flow control features are individually selected to fit specific application requirement:
•Enable auto RTS flow control using EFR bit-6.
•The auto RTS function must be started by asserting the RTS# output pin (MCR bit-1 to a logic 1) after it is enabled. With the Auto
RTS function enabled, the RTS# output pin will be de-asserted (HIGH) when the FIFO reaches the halt level. The halting level is
setting by TCR[3:0](if non-zero) or is the next trigger level for Trigger Tables A-C (See Table 1), or is the RX trigger level plus the
hysteresis level for Trigger Table D.
The RTS# output pin will be asserted (LOW) again after the FIFO is unloaded to programmed resume level. The resume level is setting
by TCR[7:4](if non-zero), or is the next trigger level below the programmed trigger level for Trigger Table A-C, or is the RX trigger
level minus the hysteresis level if Table D is selected. However, even under these conditions, the 754 will continue to accept data until
the receive FIFO is full if the remote UART transmitter continues to send data.
•If used, enable RTS interrupt through IER bit-6 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the RTS# pin makes
a transition: ISR bit-5 will be set to 1.

2.2 Auto CTS Flow Control
TThe CTS pin is monitored to suspend/restart local transmitter. The flow control features are individually selected to fit specific ap-
plication requirement:
•Enable auto CTS flow control using EFR bit-7. With the Auto CTS function enabled, the UART will suspend transmission as soon
as the stop bit of the character in the Transmit Shift Register has been shifted out. Transmission is resumed after the CTS# input is
re-asserted (LOW), indicating more data may be sent.
•If used, enable CTS interrupt through IER bit-7 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the CTS# pin makes a
transition: ISR bit-5 will be set to a logic 1, and UART will suspend TX transmissions as soon as the stop bit of the character in process
is shifted out. Transmission is resumed after the CTS# input returns LOW, indicating more data may be sent.

Software flow control is enabled through the Enhanced Features Register and the Modem Control Register. Different combinations
of software flow control can be enabled by setting different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 1 shows software flow control options.

There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
• Xon Any function (MCR[5]): Receiving any character will resume operation after recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that
an Xon1 character is recognized as an Xon Any character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be written to the RX FIFO.

• Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the special character sets the Xoff interrupt (ISR[4])
but does not halt transmission. The Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the Interrupt Status Register (ISR). The special character is
transferred to the RX FIFO.
3.1 Receive flow control
When software flow control operation is enabled, UART will compare incoming data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in
certain cases, Xoff1 and Xoff2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xoff characters are received, transmission is halted
after completing transmission of the current character. Xoff detection also sets ISR[4] (if enabled via IER[5]) and causes IRCE#to go
LOW.
To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially).
When the correct Xon characters are received, ISR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.
3.2 Transmit flow control
Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted after the receive FIFO crosses the programmed halting level in TCR[3:0](if non-zero) or pro-
grammed receiver trigger level (for all trigger tables A-D). Xon1/Xon2 character is transmitted as soon as receive FIFO is below the
programmed resuming level in TCR[7:4](if non-zero) or less than one trigger level below the programmed receiver trigger level (for
Trigger Tables A, B, and C) or when receive FIFO is less than the trigger level minus the hysteresis value (for Trigger Table D). This
hysteresis value is the same as the Auto RTS Hysteresis value in Table 3.

5. Interrupts
The UART has interrupt generation and prioritization (seven prioritized levels of interrupts) capability. The interrupt enable registers
(IER and IOIntEna) enable each of the seven types of interrupts and the INT signal in response to an interrupt generation. When an
interrupt is generated, the ISR indicates that an interrupt is pending and provides the type of interrupt through ISR[5:0]. Table 4 sum-
marizes the interrupt control functions.

It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, Line Status Register bit 7 (LSR[7]) generates the
interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining
in the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always represent the error status for the received character at the top of the RX FIFO. Reading the RX FIFO
updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the new character at the top of the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all
zeros.
For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by an Xon flow character detec-
tion. If a special character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the ISR.

5.1 Interrupt Generation
ÎÎLSR is by any of the LSR bits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7.
ÎÎRXRDY is by RX trigger level.
ÎÎRXRDY Time-out is by a 4-char delay timer.
ÎÎTXRDY is by TX trigger level or TX FIFO empty (or transmitter empty in auto RS-485 control).
ÎÎMSR is by any of the MSR bits 0, 1, 2 and 3.
ÎÎReceive Xoff/Special character is by detection of a Xoff or Special character.
ÎÎCTS# is when its transmitter toggles the input pin (from LOW to HIGH) during auto CTS flow control.
ÎÎRTS# is when its receiver toggles the output pin (from LOW to HIGH) during auto RTS flow control.
5.2 Interrupt Clearing
ÎÎLSR interrupt is cleared by reading all characters with errors out of the RX FIFO if it is Frame/Parity/Break Error, and is cleared
    by reading LSR if it is Overrun Error.
ÎÎRXRDY interrupt is cleared by reading data until FIFO falls below the trigger level.
ÎÎRXRDY Time-out interrupt is cleared by reading RHR.
ÎÎTXRDY interrupt is cleared by a read to the ISR register or writing to THR.
ÎÎMSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the MSR register.
ÎÎXoff interrupt is cleared when Xon character(s) is received or reading ISR.
ÎÎSpecial character interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR
ÎÎRTS# and CTS# flow control interrupts are cleared by a read to the MSR register
5.3 Interrupt mode operation
In Interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is 1) the host is informed of the status of the receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal,
IRQ# Therefore, it is not necessary to continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be serviced.
Figure 5 shows Interrupt mode operation.

5.4 Polled mode operation
In Polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR).
This mode is an alternative to the FIFO Interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 6 shows FIFO Polled mode operation.

6 Sleep mode
Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the UART. It is enabled when EFR[4], the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set.
Sleep mode is entered when:
• The serial data input line, RX, is idle (see Section 8 “Break and time-out conditions”).
• The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
• There are no interrupts pending except THR.
• Modem inputs are not toggling
Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the RX FIFO.
In Sleep mode, the clock to the UART is stopped. Since most registers are clocked using these clocks, the power consumption is greatly
reduced. The UART will wake up when any change is detected on the RX line, when there is any change in the state of the
modem input pins, or if data is written to the TX FIFO.
Remark: Writing to the divisor latches DLL and DLH to set the baud clock must not be done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advis-
able to disable Sleep mode using IER[4] before writing to DLL or DLH.
7. DMA Signaling
There are two modes of DMA operation, DMA mode 0 or 1, selected by FCR[3]. In DMA mode 0 or FIFO disable(FCR[0]=0), DMA
occurs in single character transfers. In DMA mode 1,multicharacter DMA transfers are managed to relieve the processor for longer
periods of time.
Single DMA Transfers(DMA mode 0/FIFO disable):
Transmitter: When empty, the TXRDY# signal becomes active. TXRDY# will go inactive after one character has been loaded into it.
Receiver: RXRDY# is active when there is at least one character in the FIFO. It becomes inactive when the receiver is empty.

8. Break and time-out condition
When the UART receives a number of characters and these data are not enough to set off the receive interrupt (because they do not
reach the receive trigger level), the UART will generate a time-out interrupt instead, 4 character times after the last character is re-
ceived. The time-out counter will be reset at the center of each stop bit received or each time the receive FIFO is read.
A break condition is detected when the RX pin is pulled LOW for a duration longer than the time it takes to send a complete character
plus start, stop and parity bits. A break condition can be sent by setting LCR[6], when this happens the TX pin will be pulled LOW
until LSR[6] is cleared by the software.
9. Programmable baud rate generator
The UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that takes any clock input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1
and (216 - 1). An additional divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as shown in Figure 7. The formula
for the baud rate is:
                                                      XTAL1 crystal input frequency
                                                    (                                      )
                                                                  prescaler

where:
prescaler = 1, when MCR[7] is set to logic 0 after reset (divide-by-1 clock selected)
prescaler = 4, when MCR[7] is set to logic 1 after reset (divide-by-4 clock selected).
Divisor = {DLH, DLL}
Sample rate = 4 if DLD[5] = 1, or = 8 if DLD[4] = 1, or = 16-SCR+CPR if DLD[5:4] = 2'b0.
Remark: The default value of prescaler after reset is divide-by-1.
DLL and DLH must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLH are the least significant and most significant byte
of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLH are both zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit and receive clock rates.
Table 7 to 10 show the baud rate and divisor correlation for crystal with frequency 1.8432 MHz, 3.072 MHz, 14.74926 MHz, and
24MHz respectively.

10. RS-485 features
10.1 Auto RS-485 RTS control
Normally the RTS pin is controlled by MCR bit 1, or if hardware flow control is enabled, the logic state of the RTS pin is controlled
by the hardware flow control circuitry. DLD register bit 6 will take the precedence over the other two modes; once this bit is set, the
transmitter will control the state of the RTS pin. The transmitter automatically de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 1) once the host writes
data to the transmit FIFO, and asserts RTS pin (logic 0) once the last bit of the data has been transmitted.
To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function.
10.2 RS-485 RTS output inversion
RS485 register bit 5 reverses the polarity of the RTS pin if the UART is in auto RS-485 RTS mode. When the transmitter has data to be
sent it asserts the RTS pin (logic 0), and when the last bit of the data has been sent out the transmitter de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 1).
10.3 Auto RS-485
RS485 register bit 0 is used to enable the RS-485 mode (multidrop or 9-bit mode). In this mode of operation, a ‘master’ station trans-
mits an address character followed by data characters for the addressed ‘slave’ stations. The slave stations examine the received data
and interrupt the controller if the received character is an address character (parity bit = 1).
To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function.
10.3.1 Normal multidrop mode
The 9-bit mode in RS485 register bit 0 is enabled, but not Special Character Detect (EFR bit 5). The receiver is set to Force Parity 0
(LCR[5:3] = 111) in order to detect address bytes.
With the receiver initially disabled, it ignores all the data bytes (parity bit = 0) until an address byte is received (parity bit = 1). This
address byte will cause the UART to set the parity error. The UART will generate a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to ‘1’ at
this time), and at the same time puts this address byte in the RX FIFO. After the controller examines the byte it must make a decision
whether or not to enable the receiver; it should enable the receiver if the address byte addresses its ID address, and must not enable the
receiver if the address byte does not address its ID address.
If the controller enables the receiver, the receiver will receive the subsequent data until being disabled by the controller after the
controller has received a complete message from the ‘master’ station. If the controller does not disable the receiver after receiving a
message from the ‘master’ station, the receiver will generate a parity error upon receiving another address byte. The controller then
determines if the address byte addresses its ID address, if it is not, the controller then can disable the receiver. If the address byte ad-
dresses the ‘slave’ ID address, the controller take no further action; the receiver will receive the subsequent data.

10.3.2 Auto address detection
If Special Character Detect is enabled (EFR[5] is set and XOFF2 contains the address byte) the receiver will try to detect an address
byte that matches the programmed character in XOFF2. If the received byte is a data byte or an address byte that does not match the
programmed character in XOFF2, the receiver will discard these data. Upon receiving an address byte that matches the XOFF2 char-
acter, the receiver will be automatically enabled if not already enabled, and the address character is pushed into the RX FIFO along
with the parity bit (in place of the parity error bit). The receiver also generates a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to 1 at this
time). The receiver will then receive the subsequent data from the ‘master’ station until being disabled by the controller after having
received a message from the ‘master’ station.
If another address byte is received and this address byte does not match XOFF2 character, the receiver will be automatically disabled
and the address byte is ignored. If the address byte matches XOFF2 character, the receiver will put this byte in the RX FIFO along with
the parity bit in the parity error bit (LSR[2]).
11. Host interface
The host interface is 8 data bits wide with 8 address lines and control signals to execute data bus read and write transactions.
The PI7C9X752 data interface supports the Intel compatible types of CPUs and it is compatible to the industry standard 16C550
UART. No clock (oscillator nor external clock) is required for a data bus transaction. Each bus cycle is asynchronous using CS# IOR#
and IOW# or CS#, R/W#, All two UART channels share the same data bus for host operations. Please refer to pin description and host
interface read/write timing(Fig 10 and Fig 11).
11.1 UART Channel Selection
During Intel Bus Mode (16/68# pin is connected to VCC), a logic 0 on chip select pins, CSA# or CSB# allows the user to select UART
channel A or B to configure, send transmit data and/or unload receive data to/from the UART. Selecting all two UARTs can be useful
during power up initialization to write to the same internal registers, but do not attempt to read from all two uarts simultaneously.
Individual channel select functions are shown in Table 11.

During Motorola Bus Mode (16/68# pin is connected to GND), the package interface pins are configured for connection with Mo-
torola, and other popular microprocessor bus types. In this mode the V654 decodes two additional addresses, A3 and A4, to select one
of the two UART ports. The A3 and A4 address decode function is used only when in the Motorola Bus Mode. See Table 12.

12. Infrared Mode
The UART includes the infrared encoder and decoder compatible to the IrDA (Infrared Data Association) version 1.0 and 1.1.
The IrDA 1.0 standard that stipulates the infrared encoder sends out a 3/16 of a bit wide HIGH-pulse for each “0” bit in the transmit
data stream with a data rate up to 115.2 Kbps. For the IrDA 1.1 standard, the infrared encoder sends out a 1/4 of a bit time wide HIGH-
pulse for each "0" bit in the transmit data stream with a data rate up to 1.152 Mbps. This signal encoding reduces the on-time of the
infrared LED, hence reduces the power consumption. See Figure 9 below.
The infrared encoder and decoder are enabled by setting DLD register bit-7 to a ‘1’. With this bit enabled, the infrared encoder and
decoder is compatible to the IrDA 1.0 standard. For the infrared encoder and decoder to be compatible to the IrDA 1.1 standard, ASR
bit-4 will also need to be set to a ’1’. When the infrared feature is enabled, the transmit data output, TX, idles LOW. Likewise, the
RX input also idles LOW, see Figure 9.
The wireless infrared decoder receives the input pulse from the infrared sensing diode on the RX pin. Each time it senses a light
pulse, it returns a logic 1 to the data bit stream.
