1. General description
                          The SC16C2550B is a two channel Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter
                          (UART) used for serial data communications. Its principal function is to convert parallel
                          data into serial data and vice versa. The UART can handle serial data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
                          The SC16C2550B is pin compatible with the ST16C2550. It will power-up to be
                          functionally equivalent to the 16C2450. The SC16C2550B provides enhanced UART
                          functions with 16-byte FIFOs, modem control interface, DMA mode data transfer. The
                          DMA mode data transfer is controlled by the FIFO trigger levels and the TXRDYn and
                          RXRDYn signals. On-board status registers provide the user with error indications and
                          operational status. System interrupts and modem control features may be tailored by
                          software to meet specific user requirements. An internal loopback capability allows
                          on-board diagnostics. Independent programmable baud rate generators are provided to
                          select transmit and receive baud rates.
                          The SC16C2550B operates at 5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V and the industrial temperature range,
                          and is available in plastic PLCC44, LQFP48, DIP40 and HVQFN32 packages.

6. Functional description
                       The SC16C2550B provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization,
                       parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and
                       receiver sections. These functions are necessary for converting the serial data stream into
                       parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization for the serial data
                       stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to form a data
                       character (character orientated protocol). Data integrity is insured by attaching a parity bit
                       to the data character. The parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit
                       errors. The electronic circuitry to provide all these functions is fairly complex, especially
                       when manufactured on a single integrated silicon chip. The SC16C2550B represents such
                       an integration with greatly enhanced features. The SC16C2550B is fabricated with an
                       advanced CMOS process.
                       The SC16C2550B is an upward solution that provides a dual UART capability with
                       16 bytes of transmit and receive FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C2450. The
                       SC16C2550B is designed to work with high speed modems and shared network
                       environments that require fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in
                       the SC16C2550B by the transmit and receive FIFOs. This allows the external processor to
                       handle more networking tasks within a given time. For example, the ST16C2450 without a
                       receive FIFO, will require unloading of the RHR in 93 microseconds (this example uses a
                       character length of 11 bits, including start/stop bits at 115.2 kbit/s). This means the
                       external CPU will have to service the receive FIFO less than every 100 microseconds.
                       However, with the 16-byte FIFO in the SC16C2550B, the data buffer will not require
                       unloading/loading for 1.53 ms. This increases the service interval, giving the external CPU
                       additional time for other applications and reducing the overall UART interrupt servicing
                       time. In addition, the four selectable receive FIFO trigger interrupt levels are uniquely
                       provided for maximum data throughput performance especially when operating in a
                       multi-channel environment. The FIFO memory greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement
                       of the external controlling CPU, increases performance and reduces power consumption.
                       The SC16C2550B is capable of operation up to 5 Mbit/s with a 80 MHz clock. With a
                       crystal or external clock input of 7.3728 MHz, the user can select data rates up to
                       460.8 kbit/s.
                       The rich feature set of the SC16C2550B is available through internal registers. Selectable
                       receive FIFO trigger levels, selectable TX and RX baud rates and modem interface
                       controls are all standard features. Following a power-on reset or an external reset, the
                       SC16C2550B is software compatible with the previous generation, ST16C2450.
                   6.1 UART A-B functions
                       The UART provides the user with the capability to bidirectionally transfer information
                       between an external CPU, the SC16C2550B package and an external serial device. A
                       logic 0 on chip select pins CSA and/or CSB allows the user to configure, send data,
                       and/or receive data via UART channels A through B. Individual channel select functions
                       are shown in Table 4.

                   6.2 Internal registers
                       The SC16C2550B provides two sets of internal registers (A and B) consisting of
                       12 registers each for monitoring and controlling the functions of each channel of the
                       UART. These registers are shown in Table 5. The UART registers function as data holding
                       registers (THR/RHR), interrupt status and control registers (IER/ISR), a FIFO Control
                       Register (FCR), line status and control registers (LCR/LSR), modem status and control
                       registers (MCR/MSR), programmable data rate (clock) control registers (DLL/DLM) and a
                       user-accessible Scratchpad Register (SPR).

                                             5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                   6.3 FIFO operation
                       The 16-byte transmit and receive data FIFOs are enabled by the FIFO Control Register
                       (FCR) bit 0. The user can set the receive trigger level via FCR bits 7:6, but not the transmit
                       trigger level. The receiver FIFO section includes a time-out function to ensure data is
                       delivered to the external CPU. An interrupt is generated whenever the Receive Holding
                       Register (RHR) has not been read following the loading of a character or the receive
                       trigger level has not been reached.

                   6.4 Hardware/software and time-out interrupts
                       The interrupts are enabled by IER[3:0]. Care must be taken when handling these
                       interrupts. Following a reset, if Interrupt Enable Register (IER) bit 1 = 1, the SC16C2550B
                       will issue a Transmit Holding Register interrupt. This interrupt must be serviced prior to
                       continuing operations. The ISR register provides the current singular highest priority
                       interrupt only. A condition can exist where a higher priority interrupt may mask the lower
                       priority interrupt(s). Only after servicing the higher pending interrupt will the lower priority
                       interrupt(s) be reflected in the status register. Servicing the interrupt without investigating
                       further interrupt conditions can result in data errors.
                       When two interrupt conditions have the same priority, it is important to service these
                       interrupts correctly. Receive Data Ready and Receive Time Out have the same interrupt
                       priority (when enabled by IER[0]). The receiver issues an interrupt after the number of
                       characters have reached the programmed trigger level. In this case, the SC16C2550B
                       FIFO may hold more characters than the programmed trigger level. Following the removal
                       of a data byte, the user should re-check LSR[0] for additional characters. A Receive Time
                       Out will not occur if the receive FIFO is empty. The time-out counter is reset at the center
                       of each stop bit received or each time the Receive Holding Register (RHR) is read. The
                       actual time-out value is 4 character time, including data information length, start bit, parity
                       bit and the size of stop bit, that is, 1×, 1.5× or 2× bit times.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                        SC16C2550B
                                             5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                   6.5 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C2550B supports high speed modem technologies that have increased input
                       data rates by employing data compression schemes. For example, a 33.6 kbit/s modem
                       that employs data compression may require a 115.2 kbit/s input data rate. A 128.0 kbit/s
                       ISDN modem that supports data compression may need an input data rate of 460.8 kbit/s.
                       The SC16C2550B can support a standard data rate of 921.6 kbit/s.
                       A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver, allowing
                       independent TX/RX channel control. The programmable baud rate generator is capable of
                       operating with a frequency of up to 80 MHz. To obtain maximum data rate, it is necessary
                       to use full rail swing on the clock input. The SC16C2550B can be configured for internal or
                       external clock operation. For internal clock oscillator operation, an industry standard
                       microprocessor crystal is connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins.
                       Alternatively, an external clock can be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the internal
                       baud rate generator for standard or custom rates (see Table 7).
                       The generator divides the input 16× clock by any divisor from 1 to (216 − 1). The
                       SC16C2550B divides the basic external clock by 16. The basic 16× clock provides table
                       rates to support standard and custom applications using the same system design. The
                       rate table is configured via the DLL and DLM internal register functions. Customized baud
                       rates can be achieved by selecting the proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB
                       sections of baud rate generator.
                       Programming the baud rate generator registers DLM (MSB) and DLL (LSB) provides a
                       user capability for selecting the desired final baud rate. The example in Table 7 shows the
                       selectable baud rate table available when using a 1.8432 MHz external clock input.

                   6.6 DMA operation
                       The SC16C2550B FIFO trigger level provides additional flexibility to the user for block
                       mode operation. LSR[6:5] provide an indication when the transmitter is empty or has an
                       empty location(s). The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive FIFOs in the
                       DMA mode (FCR[3]). When the transmit and receive FIFOs are enabled and the DMA
                       mode is de-activated (DMA Mode 0), the SC16C2550B activates the interrupt output pin
                       (INTn) for each data transmit or receive operation. When DMA mode is activated (DMA
                       Mode 1), the user takes the advantage of block mode operation by loading or unloading
                       the FIFO in a block sequence determined by the receive trigger level and the transmit
                       FIFO. In this mode, the SC16C2550B sets the TXRDYn (or RXRDYn) output pin when
                       characters in the transmit FIFO is below 16 or the characters in the receive FIFOs are
                       above the receive trigger level.
                   6.7 Loopback mode
                       The internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. In the Loopback mode, the
                       normal modem interface pins are disconnected and reconfigured for loopback internally
                       (see Figure 7). MCR[3:0] register bits are used for controlling loopback diagnostic testing.
                       In the Loopback mode, the transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX) are
                       disconnected from their associated interface pins and instead are connected together
                       internally. The CTS, DSR, CD and RI are disconnected from their normal modem control
                       input pins and instead are connected internally to RTS, DTR, MCR[3] (OP2) and MCR[2]
                       (OP1). Loopback test data is entered into the transmit holding register via the user data
                       bus interface, D0 through D7. The transmit UART serializes the data and passes the serial
                       data to the receive UART via the internal loopback connection. The receive UART

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                  SC16C2550B

                           converts the serial data back into parallel data that is then made available at the user data
                           interface D0 through D7. The user optionally compares the received data to the initial
                           transmitted data for verifying error-free operation of the UART TX/RX circuits.
                           In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The modem
                           control interrupts are also operational.

                      7.1 Transmit Holding Register (THR) and Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                             The serial transmitter section consists of an 8-bit Transmit Hold Register (THR) and
                             Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The status of the THR is provided in the Line Status
                             Register (LSR). Writing to the THR transfers the contents of the data bus (D7 through D0)
                             to the TSR and UART via the THR, providing that the THR is empty. The THR empty flag
                             in the LSR register will be set to a logic 1 when the transmitter is empty or when data is
                             transferred to the TSR. Note that a write operation can be performed when the THR
                             empty flag is set (logic 0 = at least one byte in FIFO/THR, logic 1 = FIFO/THR empty).
                             The serial receive section also contains an 8-bit Receive Holding Register (RHR) and a
                             Receive Serial Shift Register (RSR). Receive data is removed from the SC16C2550B and
                             receive FIFO by reading the RHR register. The receive section provides a mechanism to

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                  SC16C2550B
                                                5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                       prevent false starts. On the falling edge of a start or false start bit, an internal receiver
                       counter starts counting clocks at the 16× clock rate. After 71⁄2 clocks, the start bit time
                       should be shifted to the center of the start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled and if it
                       is still a logic 0 it is validated. Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver
                       from assembling a false character. Receiver status codes will be posted in the LSR.
                   7.2 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                       The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receiver ready, transmitter
                       empty, line status and modem status registers. These interrupts would normally be seen
                       on the INTA, INTB output pins.

                                                 be issued whenever the THR is empty and is associated with LSR[5]. In the

                                             5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                7.2.1 IER versus Transmit/Receive FIFO interrupt mode operation
                       When the receive FIFO (FCR[0] = logic 1) and receive interrupts (IER[0] = logic 1) are
                       enabled, the receive interrupts and register status will reflect the following:
                         • The receive RXRDY interrupt (Level 2 ISR interrupt) is issued to the external CPU
                            when the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level. It will be cleared
                            when the receive FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
                         • Receive FIFO status will also be reflected in the user accessible ISR register when
                            the receive FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register receive status bit and
                            the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                         • The receive data ready bit (LSR[0]) is set as soon as a character is transferred from
                            the shift register (RSR) to the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
                         • When the Transmit FIFO and interrupts are enabled, an interrupt is generated when
                            the transmit FIFO is empty due to the unloading of the data by the TSR and UART for
                            transmission via the transmission media. The interrupt is cleared either by reading the
                            ISR register or by loading the THR with new data characters.
                7.2.2 IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO polled mode operation
                       When FCR[0] = logic 1, resetting IER[3:0] enables the SC16C2550B in the FIFO polled
                       mode of operation. In this mode, interrupts are not generated and the user must poll the
                       LSR register for TX and/or RX data status. Since the receiver and transmitter have
                       separate bits in the LSR either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting
                       respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
                         •  LSR[0] will be a logic 1 as long as there is one byte in the receive FIFO.
                         •  LSR[4:1] will provide the type of receive errors or a receive break, if encountered.
                         •  LSR[5] will indicate when the transmit FIFO is empty.
                         •  LSR[6] will indicate when both the transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are empty.
                         •  LSR[7] will show if any FIFO data errors occurred.
                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the receive FIFO trigger
                       levels and select the DMA mode.
                7.3.1 DMA mode
               7.3.1.1 Mode 0 (FCR bit 3 = 0)
                       Set and enable the interrupt for each single transmit or receive operation and is similar to
                       the 16C450 mode. Transmit Ready (TXRDYn) on PLCC44 and LQFP48 packages will go
                       to a logic 0 whenever the FIFO (THR, if FIFO is not enabled) is empty. Receive Ready
                       (RXRDYn) on PLCC44 and LQFP48 packages will go to a logic 0 whenever the Receive
                       Holding Register (RHR) is loaded with a character.
               7.3.1.2 Mode 1 (FCR bit 3 = 1)
                       Set and enable the interrupt in a block mode operation. The transmit interrupt is set when
                       the transmit FIFO is empty. TXRDYn on PLCC44 and LQFP48 packages remains a logic 0
                       as long as one empty FIFO location is available. The receive interrupt is set when the
                       receive FIFO fills to the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO continues to fill

                   7.4 Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
                       The SC16C2550B provides four levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external
                       software interaction. The Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with four
                       interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR will provide the user with the
                       highest pending interrupt level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowledged until
                       the pending interrupt is serviced. A lower level interrupt may be seen after servicing the
                       higher level interrupt and re-reading the interrupt status bits. Table 12 “Interrupt source”
                       shows the data values (bits 3:0) for the four prioritized interrupt levels and the interrupt
                       sources associated with each of these interrupt levels.

                   7.5 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       The Line Control Register is used to specify the asynchronous data communication
                       format. The word length, the number of stop bits and the parity are selected by writing the
                       appropriate bits in this register.

                        6        LCR[6]         Set break. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition
                                                to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This
                                                condition exists until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.

                   7.7 Line Status Register (LSR)
                       This register provides the status of data transfers between the SC16C2550B and
                       the CPU.
                       Table 19.  Line Status Register bits description
                        Bit  Symbol     Description
                        7    LSR[7]     FIFO data error.
                                           logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = at least one parity error, framing error or break indication is in the
                                           current FIFO data. This bit is cleared when there are no remaining error flags
                                           associated with the remaining data in the FIFO.
                        6    LSR[6]     THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator. This bit is set to a
                                        logic 1 whenever the Transmit Holding Register and the Transmit Shift Register
                                        are both empty. It is reset to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a
                                        data character. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set to ‘1’ whenever the Transmit
                                        FIFO and Transmit Shift Register are both empty.
                        5    LSR[5]     THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit
                                        indicates that the UART is ready to accept a new character for transmission. In
                                        addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to CPU when the THR
                                        interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
                                        transferred from the transmit holding register into the transmitter shift register.
                                        The bit is reset to a logic 0 concurrently with the loading of the transmitter
                                        holding register by the CPU. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when the transmit
                                        FIFO is empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the transmit FIFO.
                        4    LSR[4]     Break interrupt.
                                           logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = the receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one
                                           character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded
                                           into the FIFO.
                        3    LSR[3]     Framing error.
                                           logic 0 = no framing error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). In
                                           the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the top of the
                                           FIFO.
                        2    LSR[2]     Parity error.
                                           logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition
                                           logic 1 = parity error. The receive character does not have correct parity
                                           information and is suspect. In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the
                                           character at the top of the FIFO.
                        1    LSR[1]     Overrun error.
                                           logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = overrun error. A data overrun error occurred in the Receive Shift
                                           Register. This happens when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In
                                           this case, the previous data in the shift register is overwritten. Note that under
                                           this condition, the data byte in the Receive Shift Register is not transferred into
                                           the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.

                   7.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This register provides the current state of the control interface signals from the modem or
                       other peripheral device to which the SC16C2550B is connected. Four bits of this register
                       are used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a
                       control input from the modem changes state. These bits are set to a logic 0 whenever the
                       CPU reads this register.

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 22) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 26 and 27

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 22.

13. Soldering of through-hole mount packages
                13.1 Introduction to soldering through-hole mount packages
                     This text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.
                     Wave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages
                     on a printed-circuit board.
                13.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave
                     Driven by legislation and environmental forces the worldwide use of lead-free solder
                     pastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from
                     3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 °C or 265 °C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb
                     or Pb-free respectively.
                     The total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.
                     The device may be mounted up to the seating plane, but the temperature of the plastic
                     body must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (Tstg(max)). If the
                     printed-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately
                     after soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.
                13.3 Manual soldering
                     Apply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the
                     seating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If the temperature of the soldering iron bit is
                     less than 300 °C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is
                     between 300 °C and 400 °C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.
