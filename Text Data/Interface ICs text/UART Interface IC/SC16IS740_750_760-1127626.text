1. General description
              The SC16IS740/750/760 is a slave I2C-bus/SPI interface to a single-channel high
              performance UART. It offers data rates up to 5 Mbit/s and guarantees low operating and
              sleeping current. The SC16IS750 and SC16IS760 also provide the application with 8
              additional programmable I/O pins. The device comes in very small HVQFN24, TSSOP24
              (SC16IS750/760) and TSSOP16 (SC16IS740) packages, which makes it ideally suitable
              for handheld, battery operated applications. This family of products enables seamless
              protocol conversion from I2C-bus or SPI to and RS-232/RS-485 and are fully bidirectional.
              The SC16IS760 differs from the SC16IS750 in that it supports SPI clock speeds up to
              15 Mbit/s instead of the 4 Mbit/s supported by the SC16IS750, and in that it supports
              IrDA SIR up to 1.152 Mbit/s. In all other aspects, the SC16IS760 is functionally and
              electrically the same as the SC16IS750. The SC16IS740 is functionally and electrically
              identical to the SC16IS750, with the exception of the programmable I/O pins which are
              only present on the SC16IS750.
              The SC16IS740/750/760’s internal register set is backward-compatible with the widely
              used and widely popular 16C450. This allows the software to be easily written or ported
              from another platform.
              The SC16IS740/750/760 also provides additional advanced features such as auto
              hardware and software flow control, automatic RS-485 support, and software reset. This
              allows the software to reset the UART at any moment, independent of the hardware reset
              signal.

[4]   HVQFN24 package die supply ground is connected to both VSS pins and exposed center pad. VSS pins must be connected to supply
      ground for proper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board level performance, the exposed pad needs to be
      soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad on the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias
      need to be incorporated in the PCB in the thermal pad region.
7. Functional description
                             The UART will perform serial-to-I2C conversion on data characters received from
                             peripheral devices or modems, and I2C-to-serial conversion on data characters
                             transmitted by the host. The complete status the SC16IS740/750/760 UART can be read
                             at any time during functional operation by the host.
                             The SC16IS740/750/760 can be placed in an alternate mode (FIFO mode) relieving the
                             host of excessive software overhead by buffering received/transmitted characters. Both
                             the receiver and transmitter FIFOs can store up to 64 characters (including three
                             additional bits of error status per character for the receiver FIFO) and have selectable or
                             programmable trigger levels.
                             The SC16IS740/750/760 has selectable hardware flow control and software flow control.
                             Hardware flow control significantly reduces software overhead and increases system
                             efficiency by automatically controlling serial data flow using the RTS output and CTS input
                             signals. Software flow control automatically controls data flow by using programmable
                             Xon/Xoff characters.
                             The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that can divide the timing
                             reference clock input by a divisor between 1 and (216 – 1).
                      7.1 Trigger levels
                             The SC16IS740/750/760 provides independently selectable and programmable trigger
                             levels for both receiver and transmitter interrupt generation. After reset, both transmitter
                             and receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of
                             one character. The selectable trigger levels are available via the FCR. The programmable
                             trigger levels are available via the TLR. If TLR bits are cleared then selectable trigger level
                             in FCR is used. If TLR bits are not cleared then programmable trigger level in TLR is used.
                      7.2 Hardware flow control
                             Hardware flow control is comprised of auto CTS and auto RTS (see Figure 8). Auto CTS
                             and auto RTS can be enabled/disabled independently by programming EFR[7:6].
                             With auto CTS, CTS must be active before the UART can transmit data.
                             Auto RTS only activates the RTS output when there is enough room in the FIFO to receive
                             data and de-activates the RTS output when the RX FIFO is sufficiently full. The halt and
                             resume trigger levels in the TCR determine the levels at which RTS is
                             activated/deactivated. If TCR bits are cleared then selectable trigger levels in FCR are
                             used in place of TCR.
                             If both auto CTS and auto RTS are enabled, when RTS is connected to CTS, data
                             transmission does not occur unless the receiver FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun
                             errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if
                             the transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

                             Figure 9 shows RTS functional timing. The receiver FIFO trigger levels used in auto RTS
                             are stored in the TCR or FCR. RTS is active if the RX FIFO level is below the halt trigger
                             level in TCR[3:0]. When the receiver FIFO halt trigger level is reached, RTS is deasserted.
                             The sending device (for example, another UART) may send an additional character after
                             the trigger level is reached (assuming the sending UART has another character to send)
                             because it may not recognize the deassertion of RTS until it has begun sending the
                             additional character. RTS is automatically reasserted once the receiver FIFO reaches the
                             resume trigger level programmed via TCR[7:4]. This reassertion allows the sending
                             device to resume transmission.

                                                               Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                     7.2.2 Auto CTS
                                 Figure 10 shows CTS functional timing. The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before
                                 sending the next data byte. When CTS is active, the transmitter sends the next byte. To
                                 stop the transmitter from sending the following byte, CTS must be deasserted before the
                                 middle of the last stop bit that is currently being sent. The auto CTS function reduces
                                 interrupts to the host system. When flow control is enabled, CTS level changes do not
                                 trigger host interrupts because the device automatically controls its own transmitter.
                                 Without auto CTS, the transmitter sends any data present in the transmit FIFO and a
                                 receiver overrun error may result.

         (1) When CTS is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
         (2) When CTS goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current character, the transmitter finishes sending the current
               character, but it does not send the next character.
         (3) When CTS goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

                        7.3 Software flow control
                                 Software flow control is enabled through the enhanced feature register and the Modem
                                 Control Register. Different combinations of software flow control can be enabled by setting
                                 different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 3 shows software flow control options.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                             SC16IS740/750/760
                                                     Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                        There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
                          • Xon Any function (MCR[5]): Receiving any character will resume operation after
                              recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that an Xon1 character is recognized as
                              an Xon Any character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be written to the RX
                              FIFO.
                          • Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the
                              special character sets the Xoff interrupt (IIR[4]) but does not halt transmission. The
                              Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR. The special character is transferred to the
                              RX FIFO.
                  7.3.1 RX
                        When software flow control operation is enabled, the SC16IS740/750/760 will compare
                        incoming data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in certain cases, Xoff1 and Xoff2
                        must be received sequentially). When the correct Xoff characters are received,
                        transmission is halted after completing transmission of the current character. Xoff
                        detection also sets IIR[4] (if enabled via IER[5]) and causes IRQ to go LOW.
                        To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases
                        Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xon characters are
                        received, IIR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.
                  7.3.2 TX
                        Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO has passed the HALT trigger level
                        programmed in TCR[3:0] or the selectable trigger level in FCR[7:6]
                        Xon1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO reaches the RESUME trigger level
                        programmed in TCR[7:4] or RX FIFO falls below the lower selectable trigger level in
                        FCR[7:6].
                        The transmission of Xoff/Xon(s) follows the exact same protocol as transmission of an
                        ordinary character from the FIFO. This means that even if the word length is set to be 5, 6,
                        or 7 bits, then the 5, 6, or 7 least significant bits of XOFF1/XOFF2 or XON1/XON2 will be
                        transmitted. (Note that the transmission of 5, 6, or 7 bits of a character is seldom done, but
                        this functionality is included to maintain compatibility with earlier designs.)
                        It is assumed that software flow control and hardware flow control will never be enabled
                        simultaneously. Figure 11 shows an example of software flow control.

                  7.4.2 Power-on sequence
                        After power is applied, the device is reset by the internal POR. The host must wait at least
                        3 s before initializing a communication with the device.
                        An external reset pulse (see Figure 26) can also be used to reset the device after power is
                        applied.
                        Once the device is reset properly, the host processor can start to communicate with the
                        device. Internal registers can be accessed (read and write), however, at this time the
                        UART transmitter and receiver cannot be used until there is a stable clock at XTAL1 pin.
                        Normally, if an external clock such as a system clock or an external oscillator is used to
                        supply a clock to XTAL1 pin, the clock should be stable at this time. But if a crystal is used,
                        the host processor must wait until the crystal is generating a stable clock before accessing
                        the UART transmitter or receiver.
                        The crystal’s start-up time depends on the crystal being used, VCC ramp-up time and the
                        loading capacitor values. The start-up time can be as long as a few milliseconds.

                   7.5 Interrupts
                       The SC16IS740/750/760 has interrupt generation and prioritization (seven prioritized
                       levels of interrupts) capability. The interrupt enable registers (IER and IOIntEna) enable
                       each of the seven types of interrupts and the IRQ signal in response to an interrupt
                       generation. When an interrupt is generated, the IIR indicates that an interrupt is pending
                       and provides the type of interrupt through IIR[5:0]. Table 6 summarizes the interrupt
                       control functions.

                       [1]   Available only on SC16IS750/SC16IS760.
                       It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, LSR[7]
                       generates the interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO,
                       and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always
                       represent the error status for the received character at the top of the RX FIFO. Reading
                       the RX FIFO updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the new character at the top of
                       the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all zeros.
                       For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt
                       is cleared by an Xon flow character detection. If a special character detection caused the
                       interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR.

                  7.5.1 Interrupt mode operation
                        In Interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is 1) the host is informed of the status of the
                        receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal, IRQ. Therefore, it is not necessary to
                        continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be
                        serviced. Figure 13 shows Interrupt mode operation.
                                                                                                                         IIR

                        In Polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be
                        checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR). This mode is an alternative to the FIFO
                        Interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
                        automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 14 shows FIFO
                        Polled mode operation.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                           SC16IS740/750/760
                                                   Single UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                   7.6 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the SC16IS740/750/760 UART. It is enabled when
                       EFR[4], the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set. Sleep mode is entered
                       when:
                         • The serial data input line, RX, is idle (see Section 7.7 “Break and time-out
                            conditions”).
                         • The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
                         • There are no interrupts pending except THR.
                       Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the RX FIFO.
                       In Sleep mode, the clock to the UART is stopped. Since most registers are clocked using
                       these clocks, the power consumption is greatly reduced. The UART will wake up when
                       any change is detected on the RX line, when there is any change in the state of the
                       modem input pins, or if data is written to the TX FIFO.
                       Wake-up by serial data on RX input pin is supported in UART mode but not in IrDA mode
                       in Rev. C and Rev. D of the device. Refer to application note AN10964, “How to wake up
                       SC16IS/740/750/760 in IrDA mode” for a software procedure to wake up the device by
                       receiving data in the IrDA mode.
                       Wake-up by serial data on RX input pin is supported in both UART mode and IrDA mode
                       in Rev. E of the device.
                       The device will not wake up by GPIO pin transition, but GPIO pin input state can be read,
                       and GPIO interrupt is working normally during Sleep mode.
                       Remark: Writing to the divisor latches, DLL and DLH, to set the baud clock, must not be
                       done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advisable to disable Sleep mode using IER[4]
                       before writing to DLL or DLH.
                   7.7 Break and time-out conditions
                       When the UART receives a number of characters and these data are not enough to set off
                       the receive interrupt (because they do not reach the receive trigger level), the UART will
                       generate a time-out interrupt instead, 4 character times after the last character is
                       received. The time-out counter will be reset at the center of each stop bit received or each
                       time the receive FIFO is read.
                       A break condition is detected when the RX pin is pulled LOW for a duration longer than
                       the time it takes to send a complete character plus Start, Stop and Parity bits. A break
                       condition can be sent by setting LCR[6]. When this happens the TX pin will be pulled LOW
                       until LSR[6] is cleared by the software.

                   7.8 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16IS740/750/760 UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that takes
                       any clock input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1 and (216 – 1). An
                       additional divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as
                       shown in Figure 15. The output frequency of the baud rate generator is 16  the baud
                       rate. The formula for the divisor is given in Equation 1:
                                     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        divisor = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      (1)

                       where:
                          prescaler = 1, when MCR[7] is set to ‘0’ after reset (divide-by-1 clock selected)
                          prescaler = 4, when MCR[7] is set to ‘1’ after reset (divide-by-4 clock selected).
                       Remark: The default value of prescaler after reset is divide-by-1.
                       Figure 15 shows the internal prescaler and baud rate generator circuitry.

                       DLL and DLH must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLH are the
                       least significant and most significant byte of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLH are both
                       zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
                       Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit
                       and receive clock rates.
                       Table 7 and Table 8 show the baud rate and divisor correlation for crystal with frequency
                       1.8432 MHz and 3.072 MHz, respectively. The crystal’s frequency tolerance should be
                       selected as such to keep the baud rate error to be below 1 % for reliable operation with
                       other UARTs. Crystals with 100 ppm is generally recommended.
                       Figure 16 shows the crystal clock circuit reference.

                   8.1 Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                       The receiver section consists of the Receiver Holding Register (RHR) and the Receiver
                       Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The RSR receives serial data
                       from the RX pin. The data is converted to parallel data and moved to the RHR. The
                       receiver section is controlled by the Line Control Register. If the FIFO is disabled, location
                       zero of the FIFO is used to store the characters.
                   8.2 Transmit Holding Register (THR)
                       The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR) and the Transmit
                       Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The THR receives data and
                       shifts it into the TSR, where it is converted to serial data and moved out on the TX pin. If
                       the FIFO is disabled, the FIFO is still used to store the byte. Characters are lost if overflow
                       occurs.
                   8.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This is a write-only register that is used for enabling the FIFOs, clearing the FIFOs, setting
                       transmitter and receiver trigger levels. Table 11 shows FIFO Control Register bit settings.

                        5:4    FCR[5] (MSB), TX trigger. Sets the trigger level for the TX FIFO.

                                                     FCR[5:4] can only be modified and enabled when EFR[4] is set. This is
                                                     because the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.

                       [1]  FIFO reset requires at least two XTAL1 clocks, therefore, they cannot be reset without the presence of the
                            XTAL1 clock.
                   8.4 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       This register controls the data communication format. The word length, number of stop
                       bits, and parity type are selected by writing the appropriate bits to the LCR. Table 12
                       shows the Line Control Register bit settings.
                       Table 12.    Line Control Register bits description

                        6          LCR[6]                 Break control bit. When enabled, the break control bit causes a break
                                                          condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state).

                        5          LCR[5]                 Set parity. LCR[5] selects the forced parity format (if LCR[3] = 1).

                       When the LSR is read, LSR[4:2] reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the
                       top of the RX FIFO (next character to be read). Therefore, errors in a character are
                       identified by reading the LSR and then reading the RHR.
                       LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when
                       there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO.

                   8.7 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This 8-bit register provides information about the current state of the control lines from the
                       modem, data set, or peripheral device to the host. It also indicates when a control input
                       from the modem changes state. Table 18 shows Modem Status Register bit settings.

                                                     through IOControl register bit 1, the state of CD pin can be read from this
                                                     bit. This bit is the complement of the CD input. Reading IOState bit 6 does
                                                     not reflect the true state of CD pin.

                                                     IOControl register bit 1, the state of RI pin can be read from this bit. This bit
                                                     is the complement of the RI input. Reading IOState bit 6 does not reflect the
                                                     true state of RI pin.

                                                     through IOControl register bit 1, the state of DSR pin can be read from this
                                                     bit. This bit is the complement of the DSR input. Reading IOState bit 4 does
                                                     not reflect the true state of DSR pin.
                        4        MSR[4]              CTS (active HIGH, logical 1). This bit is the complement of the CTS input.

                        2        MSR[2]              RI[1]. Indicates that RI input has changed state from LOW to HIGH.
                                                     Cleared on a read.
                        1        MSR[1]              DSR[1]. Indicates that DSR input has changed state. Cleared on a read.
                        0        MSR[0]              CTS. Indicates that CTS input has changed state. Cleared on a read.

                       Remark: The primary inputs RI, CD, CTS, DSR are all active LOW.
                   8.8 Scratch Pad Register (SPR)
                       This 8-bit register is used as a temporary data storage register. User’s program can
                       write to or read from this register without any effect on the operation of the device.

                  8.11 Enhanced Features Register (EFR)
                       This 8-bit register enables or disables the enhanced features of the UART. Table 22
                       shows the enhanced feature register bit settings.

                                                      logic 1 = RTS flow control is enabled. The RTS pin goes HIGH when the

                                                      with Xoff2 data. If a match occurs, the received data is transferred to FIFO
                                                      and IIR[4] is set to a logical 1 to indicate a special character has been

                        3:0     EFR[3:0]          Combinations of software flow control can be selected by programming
                                                  these bits. See Table 3 “Software flow control options (EFR[3:0])”.
                  8.12 Division registers (DLL, DLH)
                       These are two 8-bit registers which store the 16-bit divisor for generation of the baud clock
                       in the baud rate generator. DLH stores the most significant part of the divisor. DLL stores
                       the least significant part of the divisor.
                       Remark: DLL and DLH can only be written to before Sleep mode is enabled, that is,
                       before IER[4] is set.

                  8.13 Transmission Control Register (TCR)
                       This 8-bit register is used to store the RX FIFO threshold levels to stop/start transmission
                       during hardware/software flow control. Table 23 shows Transmission Control Register bit
                       settings.
                       Table 23.    Transmission Control Register bits description
                        Bit         Symbol                   Description

                        3:0         TCR[3:0]                 RX FIFO trigger level to halt transmission
                       TCR trigger levels are available from 0 to 60 characters with a granularity of four.
                       Remark: TCR can only be written to when EFR[4] = 1 and MCR[2] = 1. The programmer
                       must program the TCR such that TCR[3:0] > TCR[7:4]. There is no built-in hardware
                       check to make sure this condition is met. Also, the TCR must be programmed with this
                       condition before auto RTS or software flow control is enabled to avoid spurious operation
                       of the device.
                  8.14 Trigger Level Register (TLR)
                       This 8-bit register is used to store the transmit and received FIFO trigger levels used for
                       interrupt generation. Trigger levels from 4 to 60 can be programmed with a granularity
                       of 4. Table 24 shows trigger level register bit settings.
                       Table 24.    Trigger Level Register bits description
                        Bit         Symbol                   Description
                        7:4         TLR[7:4]                 RX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of characters available.
                        3:0         TLR[3:0]                 TX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of spaces available.
                       Remark: TLR can only be written to when EFR[4] = 1 and MCR[2] = 1. If TLR[3:0] or
                       TLR[7:4] are logical 0, the selectable trigger levels via the FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       are used for the transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels. Trigger levels from 4 characters
                       to 60 characters are available with a granularity of four. The TLR should be programmed
                       for N4, where N is the desired trigger level.
                       When the trigger level setting in TLR is zero, the SC16IS740/750/760 uses the trigger
                       level setting defined in FCR. If TLR has non-zero trigger level value, the trigger level
                       defined in FCR is discarded. This applies to both transmit FIFO and receive FIFO trigger
                       level setting.
                       When TLR is used for RX trigger level control, FCR[7:6] should be left at the default state,
                       that is, ‘00’.
                  8.15 Transmitter FIFO Level register (TXLVL)
                       This register is a read-only register, it reports the number of spaces available in the
                       transmit FIFO.

                       This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760. This register is used to
                       program the I/O pins direction. Bit 0 to bit 7 controls GPIO0 to GPIO7.

                       Remark: If there is a pending input (GPIO) interrupt and IODir is written, this pending
                       interrupt will be cleared, that is, the interrupt signal will be negated.
                  8.18 Programmable I/O pins State Register (IOState)
                       This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760. When ‘read’, this
                       register returns the actual state of all I/O pins. When ‘write’, each register bit will be
                       transferred to the corresponding IO pin programmed as output.

                  8.19 I/O Interrupt Enable Register (IOIntEna)
                       This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760. This register enables
                       the interrupt due to a change in the I/O configured as inputs. If GPIO[7:4] are programmed
                       as modem pins, their interrupt generation must be enabled via IER register bit 3. In this
                       case bit 7 to bit 4 of IOIntEna will have no effect on GPIO[7:4].

                                                                goes back to its initial logic state before the input register is read,
                                                                then the interrupt is cleared.

                       Remark: As I/O pins, the direction, state, and interrupt of GPIO4 to GPIO7 are controlled
                       by the following registers: IODir, IOState, IOIntEna, and IOControl. The state of CD, RI,
                       DSR pins will not be reflected in MSR[7:5] or MSR[3:1], and any change of state on these
                       three pins will not trigger a modem status interrupt (even if enabled via IER[3]), and the
                       state of the DTR pin cannot be controlled by MCR[0].
                       As modem CD, RI, DSR pins, the status at the input of these three pins can be read from
                       MSR[7:5] and MSR[3:1], and the state of DTR pin can be controlled by MCR[0]. Also, if
                       modem status interrupt bit is enabled, IER[3], a change of state of RI, CD, DSR pins will
                       trigger a modem interrupt. Bit[7:4] of the IODir, IOState, and IOIntEna registers will not
                       have any effect on these three pins.

9. RS-485 features
                   9.1 Auto RS-485 RTS control
                       Normally the RTS pin is controlled by MCR bit 1, or if hardware flow control is enabled, the
                       logic state of the RTS pin is controlled by the hardware flow control circuitry. EFCR
                       register bit 4 will take the precedence over the other two modes; once this bit is set, the
                       transmitter will control the state of the RTS pin. The transmitter automatically asserts the
                       RTS pin (logic 0) once the host writes data to the transmit FIFO, and deasserts RTS pin
                       (logic 1) once the last bit of the data has been transmitted.
                       To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow
                       control function.

                    9.2 RS-485 RTS output inversion
                        EFCR bit 5 reverses the polarity of the RTS pin if the UART is in auto RS-485 RTS mode.
                        When the transmitter has data to be sent it will deasserts the RTS pin (logic 1), and when
                        the last bit of the data has been sent out the transmitter asserts the RTS pin (logic 0).
                    9.3 Auto RS-485
                        EFCR bit 0 is used to enable the RS-485 mode (multidrop or 9-bit mode). In this mode of
                        operation, a ‘master’ station transmits an address character followed by data characters
                        for the addressed ‘slave’ stations. The slave stations examine the received data and
                        interrupt the controller if the received character is an address character (parity bit = 1).
                        To use the auto RS-485 mode the software would have to disable the hardware and
                        software flow control functions.
                  9.3.1 Normal multidrop mode
                        The 9-bit Mode in EFCR (bit 0) is enabled, but not Special Character Detect (EFR bit 5).
                        The receiver is set to Force Parity 0 (LCR[5:3] = 111) in order to detect address bytes.
                        With the receiver initially disabled, it ignores all the data bytes (parity bit = 0) until an
                        address byte is received (parity bit = 1). This address byte will cause the UART to set the
                        parity error. The UART will generate a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to ‘1’ at
                        this time), and at the same time puts this address byte in the RX FIFO. After the controller
                        examines the byte it must make a decision whether or not to enable the receiver; it should
                        enable the receiver if the address byte addresses its ID address, and must not enable the
                        receiver if the address byte does not address its ID address.
                        If the controller enables the receiver, the receiver will receive the subsequent data until
                        being disabled by the controller after the controller has received a complete message
                        from the ‘master’ station. If the controller does not disable the receiver after receiving a
                        message from the ‘master’ station, the receiver will generate a parity error upon receiving
                        another address byte. The controller then determines if the address byte addresses its ID
                        address, if it is not, the controller then can disable the receiver. If the address byte
                        addresses the ‘slave’ ID address, the controller take no further action, the receiver will
                        receive the subsequent data.
                  9.3.2 Auto address detection
                        If Special Character Detect is enabled (EFR[5] is set and the XOFF2 register contains the
                        address byte) the receiver will try to detect an address byte that matches the programmed
                        character in the XOFF2 register. If the received byte is a data byte or an address byte that
                        does not match the programmed character in the XOFF2 register, the receiver will discard
                        these data. Upon receiving an address byte that matches the Xoff2 character, the receiver
                        will be automatically enabled if not already enabled, and the address character is pushed
                        into the RX FIFO along with the parity bit (in place of the parity error bit). The receiver also
                        generates a line status interrupt (IER[2] must be set to ‘1’ at this time). The receiver will
                        then receive the subsequent data from the ‘master’ station until being disabled by the
                        controller after having received a message from the ‘master’ station.
                        If another address byte is received and this address byte does not match Xoff2 character,
                        the receiver will be automatically disabled and the address byte is ignored. If the address
                        byte matches Xoff2 character, the receiver will put this byte in the RX FIFO along with the
                        parity bit in the parity error bit (LSR bit 2).

10. I2C-bus operation
                       The two lines of the I2C-bus are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both
                       lines are connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor, and remain HIGH when the
                       bus is not busy. Each device is recognized by a unique address whether it is a
                       microcomputer, LCD driver, memory or keyboard interface and can operate as either a
                       transmitter or receiver, depending on the function of the device. A device generating a
                       message or data is a transmitter, and a device receiving the message or data is a
                       receiver. Obviously, a passive function like an LCD driver could only be a receiver, while a
                       microcontroller or a memory can both transmit and receive data.
                  10.1 Data transfers
                       One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse (see Figure 17). The data on the SDA
                       line must remain stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse in order to be valid.
                       Changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals. A HIGH-to-LOW
                       transition of the data line (SDA) while the clock signal (SCL) is HIGH indicates a START
                       condition, and a LOW-to-HIGH transition of the SDA while SCL is HIGH defines a STOP
                       condition (see Figure 18). The bus is considered to be busy after the START condition
                       and free again at a certain time interval after the STOP condition. The START and STOP
                       conditions are always generated by the master.

                         Fig 18. START and STOP conditions
                       The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP condition from
                       transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte, which must be eight bits long, is
                       transferred serially with the most significant bit first, and is followed by an acknowledge bit
                       (see Figure 19). The clock pulse related to the acknowledge bit is generated by the
                       master. The device that acknowledges has to pull down the SDA line during the
                       acknowledge clock pulse, while the transmitting device releases this pulse (see
                       Figure 20).

  Fig 20. Acknowledge on the I2C-bus
                                  A slave receiver must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte, and a
                                  master must generate one after the reception of each byte clocked out of the slave
                                  transmitter.
                                  There are two exceptions to the ‘acknowledge after every byte’ rule. The first occurs when
                                  a master is a receiver: it must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not signalling an
                                  acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. The acknowledge
                                  related clock, generated by the master should still take place, but the SDA line will not be
                                  pulled down. In order to indicate that this is an active and intentional lack of
                                  acknowledgement, we shall term this special condition as a ‘negative acknowledge’.
                                  The second exception is that a slave will send a negative acknowledge when it can no
                                  longer accept additional data bytes. This occurs after an attempted transfer that cannot be
                                  accepted.
                       10.2 Addressing and transfer formats
                                  Each device on the bus has its own unique address. Before any data is transmitted on the
                                  bus, the master transmits on the bus the address of the slave to be accessed for this
                                  transaction. A well-behaved slave with a matching address, if it exists on the network,
                                  should of course acknowledge the master's addressing. The addressing is done by the
                                  first byte transmitted by the master after the START condition.

                            When an address is sent, each device in the system compares the first seven bits after
                            the START with its own address. If there is a match, the device will consider itself
                            addressed by the master, and will send an acknowledge. The device could also determine
                            if in this transaction it is assigned the role of a slave receiver or slave transmitter,
                            depending on the R/W bit.
                            Each node of the I2C-bus network has a unique seven-bit address. The address of a
                            microcontroller is of course fully programmable, while peripheral devices usually have
                            fixed and programmable address portions.
                            When the master is communicating with one device only, data transfers follow the format
                            of Figure 21, where the R/W bit could indicate either direction. After completing the
                            transfer and issuing a STOP condition, if a master would like to address some other
                            device on the network, it could start another transaction by issuing a new START.
                            Another way for a master to communicate with several different devices would be by using
                            a ‘repeated START’. After the last byte of the transaction was transferred, including its
                            acknowledge (or negative acknowledge), the master issues another START, followed by
                            address byte and data — without effecting a STOP. The master may communicate with a
                            number of different devices, combining ‘reads’ and ‘writes’. After the last transfer takes
                            place, the master issues a STOP and releases the bus. Possible data formats are
                            demonstrated in Figure 22. Note that the repeated START allows for both change of a
                            slave and a change of direction, without releasing the bus. We shall see later on that the
                            change of direction feature can come in handy even when dealing with a single device.
                            In a single master system, the repeated START mechanism may be more efficient than
                            terminating each transfer with a STOP and starting again. In a multimaster environment,
                            the determination of which format is more efficient could be more complicated, as when a
                            master is using repeated STARTs it occupies the bus for a long time and thus preventing
                            other devices from initiating transfers.

                  10.3 Addressing
                       Before any data is transmitted or received, the master must send the address of the
                       receiver via the SDA line. The first byte after the START condition carries the address of
                       the slave device and the read/write bit. Table 32 shows how the SC16IS740/750/760’s
                       address can be selected by using A1 and A0 pins. For example, if these 2 pins are
                       connected to VDD, then the SC16IS740/750/760’s address is set to 0x90, and the master
                       communicates with it through this address.

                  10.4 Use of subaddresses
                        When a master communicates with the SC16IS740/750/760 it must send a subaddress in
                       the byte following the slave address byte. This subaddress is the internal address of the
                       word the master wants to access for a single byte transfer, or the beginning of a sequence
                       of locations for a multi-byte transfer. A subaddress is an 8-bit byte. Unlike the device
                       address, it does not contain a direction (R/W) bit, and like any byte transferred on the bus
                       it must be followed by an acknowledge.
                       Table 33 shows the breakdown of the subaddress (register address) byte. Bit 0 is not
                       used, bits [2:1] are both set to zeroes, bits [6:3] are used to select one of the device’s
                       internal registers, and bit 7 is not used.
                       A register write cycle is shown in Figure 23. The START is followed by a slave address
                       byte with the direction bit set to ‘write’, a subaddress byte, a number of data bytes, and a
                       STOP signal. The subaddress indicates which register the master wants to access, and
                       the data bytes which follow will be written one after the other to the subaddress location.

  Fig 23. Master writes to slave
                               The register read cycle (see Figure 24) commences in a similar manner, with the master
                               sending a slave address with the direction bit set to ‘write’ with a following subaddress.
                               Then, in order to reverse the direction of the transfer, the master issues a repeated
                               START followed again by the device address, but this time with the direction bit set to
                               ‘read’. The data bytes starting at the internal subaddress will be clocked out of the device,
                               each followed by a master-generated acknowledge. The last byte of the read cycle will be
                               followed by a negative acknowledge, signalling the end of transfer. The cycle is

16. Handling information
                       All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                       normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                       described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
17. Soldering of SMD packages
                       This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                       of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                       soldering description”.
                  17.1 Introduction to soldering
                       Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                       Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                       the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                       ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                       Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                       suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                       densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                  17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                       Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                       a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                         • Through-hole components
                         • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                       Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                       packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                       leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                       due to an increased probability of bridging.
                       The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                       component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                       packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                       Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                         •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                         •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                         •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                         •  Package placement
                         •  Inspection and repair
                         •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                            transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                            exposed to the wave

                  17.4 Reflow soldering
                       Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                         • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                            higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 45) than a SnPb process, thus
                            reducing the process window
                         • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                            window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                         • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                            heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                            temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                            characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                            packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                            depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                            Table 41 and 42
