Functional Description
The UART will perform serial-to-I2C-bus conversion on data characters received from peripheral devices or modems, and I2C-bus-
to-serial conversion on data characters transmitted by the host. The complete status of the UART can be read at any time during
functional operation by the host.
The UART can be placed in an alternate mode (FIFO mode) relieving the host of excessive software overhead by buffering received/
transmitted characters. Both the receiver and transmitter FIFOs can store up to 64 characters (including three additional bits of error
status per character for the receiver FIFO) and have selectable or programmable trigger levels.
The UART has selectable hardware flow control and software flow control. Hardware flow control significantly reduces software
overhead and increases system efficiency by automatically controlling serial data flow using the RTS output and CTS input signals.
Software flow control automatically controls data flow by using programmable Xon/Xoff characters.
The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that can divide the timing reference clock input by a divisor between 1 and
(216 - 1).
1. Trigger levels
The UART provides independently selectable and programmable trigger levels for both receiver and transmitter interrupt generation.
After reset, both transmitter and receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of one character.
The selectable trigger levels are available via the FIFO Control Register (FCR). The programmable trigger levels are available via the
Trigger Level Register (TLR). If TLR bits are cleared, then selectable trigger level in FCR is used. If TLR bits are not cleared, then
programmable trigger level in TLR is used.
2. Hardware flow control
Hardware flow control is comprised of Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS (see Figure 1). Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS can be enabled/disabled
independently by programming EFR[7:6].
With Auto-CTS, CTS must be active before the UART can transmit data.
Auto-RTS only activates the RTS output when there is enough room in the FIFO to receive data and de-activates the RTS output when
the RX FIFO is sufficiently full. The halt and resume trigger levels in the Transmission Control Register (TCR) determine the levels at
which RTS is activated/deactivated. If TCR bits are cleared, then selectable trigger levels in FCR are used in place of TCR.
If both Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS are enabled, when RTS is connected to CTS, data transmission does not occur unless the receiver
FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if the
transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

2.1 Auto-RTS
Figure 2 shows RTS functional timing. The receiver FIFO trigger levels used in Auto-RTS are stored in the TCR. RTS is active if the
RX FIFO level is below the halt trigger level in TCR[3:0]. When the receiver FIFO halt trigger level is reached, RTS is de-asserted.
The sending device (for example, another UART) may send an additional character after the trigger level is reached (assuming the
sending UART has another character to send) because it may not recognize the de-assertion of RTS until it has begun sending the ad-
ditional character. RTS is automatically reasserted once the receiver FIFO reaches the resume trigger level programmed via TCR[7:4].
This re-assertion allows the sending device to resume transmission.

2.2 Auto-CTS
Figure 3 shows CTS functional timing. The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before sending the next data character. When CTS is ac-
tive, the transmitter sends the next character. To stop the transmitter from sending the following character, CTS must be de-asserted
before the middle of the last stop bit that is currently being sent. The Auto-CTS function reduces interrupts to the host system. When
flow control is enabled, CTS level changes do not trigger host interrupts because the device automatically controls its own transmitter.
Without Auto-CTS, the transmitter sends any data present in the transmit FIFO and a receiver overrun error may result.

3 Software flow control
Software flow control is enabled through the Enhanced Features Register and the Modem Control Register. Different combinations
of software flow control can be enabled by setting different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 1 shows software flow control options.

There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
• Xon Any function (MCR[5]): Receiving any character will resume operation after recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that
an Xon1 character is recognized as an Xon Any character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be written to the RX FIFO.
• Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the special character sets the Xoff interrupt (IIR[4]) but
does not halt transmission. The Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the Interrupt Identification Register (IIR). The special character
is transferred to the RX FIFO.
3.1 Receive flow control
When software flow control operation is enabled, UART will compare incoming data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in
certain cases, Xoff1 and Xoff2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xoff characters are received, transmission is halted af-
ter completing transmission of the current character. Xoff detection also sets IIR[4] (if enabled via IER[5]) and causes IRQ to go LOW.
To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially).
When the correct Xon characters are received, IIR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.

3.2 Transmit flow control
Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO has passed the halt trigger level programmed in TCR[3:0], or the selectable
trigger level in FCR[7:6].
Xon1/Xon2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO reaches the resume trigger level programmed in TCR[7:4], or falls below the
lower selectable trigger level in FCR[7:6].
The transmission of Xoff/Xon(s) follows the exact same protocol as transmission of an ordinary character from the FIFO. This means
that even if the word length is set to be 5, 6, or 7 bits, then the 5, 6, or 7 least significant bits of Xoff1/Xoff2, Xon1/Xon2 will be trans-
mitted. (Note that the transmission of 5, 6, or 7 bits of a character is seldom done, but this functionality is included to maintain
compatibility with earlier designs.)
It is assumed that software flow control and hardware flow control will never be enabled simultaneously. Figure 4 shows an example
of software flow control.

5 Interrupts
The UART has interrupt generation and prioritization (seven prioritized levels of interrupts) capability. The interrupt enable registers
(IER and IOIntEna) enable each of the seven types of interrupts and the IRQ signal in response to an interrupt generation. When an

It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, Line Status Register bit 7 (LSR[7]) generates the
interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining
in the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always represent the error status for the received character at the top of the RX FIFO. Reading the RX FIFO
updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the new character at the top of the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all
zeros.
For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by an Xon flow character detec-
tion. If a special character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR.

5.1 Interrupt mode operation
In Interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is 1) the host is informed of the status of the receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal,
IRQ. Therefore, it is not necessary to continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be serviced.
Figure 5 shows Interrupt mode operation.

5.2 Polled mode operation
In Polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR).
This mode is an alternative to the FIFO Interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 6 shows FIFO Polled mode operation.

6 Sleep mode
Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the UART. It is enabled when EFR[4], the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set.
Sleep mode is entered when:
• The serial data input line, RX, is idle (see Section 7 “Break and time-out conditions”).
• The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
• There are no interrupts pending except THR.
Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the RX FIFO.
In Sleep mode, the clock to the UART is stopped. Since most registers are clocked using these clocks, the power consumption is greatly
reduced. The UART will wake up when any change is detected on the RX line, when there is any change in the state of the
modem input pins, or if data is written to the TX FIFO.
Remark: Writing to the divisor latches DLL and DLH to set the baud clock must not be done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advis-
able to disable Sleep mode using IER[4] before writing to DLL or DLH.
7 Break and time-out conditions
When the UART receives a number of characters and these data are not enough to set off the receive interrupt (because they do not
reach the receive trigger level), the UART will generate a time-out interrupt instead, 4 character times after the last character is re-
ceived. The time-out counter will be reset at the center of each stop bit received or each time the receive FIFO is read.
A break condition is detected when the RX pin is pulled LOW for a duration longer than the time it takes to send a complete character
plus start, stop and parity bits. A break condition can be sent by setting LCR[6], when this happens the TX pin will be pulled LOW
until LSR[6] is cleared by the software.
8 Programmable baud rate generator
The UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that takes any clock input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1
and (216 - 1). An additional divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as shown in Figure 7. The formula
for the baud rate is:
                                                            XTAL1 crystal input frequency
                                                          (                                    )
                                                                        prescaler
                                           Baud rate =
                                                                 divisor x sample rate
where:
prescaler = 1, when MCR[7] is set to logic 0 after reset (divide-by-1 clock selected)
prescaler = 4, when MCR[7] is set to logic 1 after reset (divide-by-4 clock selected).
Divisor = {DLH, DLL}
Sample rate = 16 - SCR + CPRN
Remark: The default value of prescaler after reset is divide-by-1.

DLL and DLH must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLH are the least significant and most significant byte
of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLH are both zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit and receive clock rates.

9. RS-485 features
9.1 Auto RS-485 RTS control
Normally the RTS pin is controlled by MCR bit 1, or if hardware flow control is enabled, the logic state of the RTS pin is controlled
by the hardware flow control circuitry. EFCR register bit 4 will take the precedence over the other two modes; once this bit is set, the
transmitter will control the state of the RTS pin. The transmitter automatically asserts the RTS pin (logic 0) once the host writes data
to the transmit FIFO, and de-asserts RTS pin (logic 1) once the last bit of the data has been transmitted.
To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function.
9.2 RS-485 RTS output inversion
EFCR bit 5 reverses the polarity of the RTS pin if the UART is in auto RS-485 RTS mode. When the transmitter has data to be sent it
de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 1), and when the last bit of the data has been sent out the transmitter asserts the RTS pin (logic 0).
9.3 Auto RS-485
EFCR bit 0 is used to enable the RS-485 mode (multidrop or 9-bit mode). In this mode of operation, a ‘master’ station transmits an
address character followed by data characters for the addressed ‘slave’ stations. The slave stations examine the received data and inter-
rupt the controller if the received character is an address character (parity bit = 1).
To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function.
9.3.1 Normal multidrop mode
The 9-bit mode in EFCR (bit 0) is enabled, but not Special Character Detect (EFR bit 5). The receiver is set to Force Parity 0 (LCR[5:3]
= 111) in order to detect address bytes.
With the receiver initially disabled, it ignores all the data bytes (parity bit = 0) until an address byte is received (parity bit = 1). This
address byte will cause the UART to set the parity error. The UART will generate a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to ‘1’ at
this time), and at the same time puts this address byte in the RX FIFO. After the controller examines the byte it must make a decision
whether or not to enable the receiver; it should enable the receiver if the address byte addresses its ID address, and must not enable the
receiver if the address byte does not address its ID address.
If the controller enables the receiver, the receiver will receive the subsequent data until being disabled by the controller after the
controller has received a complete message from the ‘master’ station. If the controller does not disable the receiver after receiving a
message from the ‘master’ station, the receiver will generate a parity error upon receiving another address byte. The controller then
determines if the address byte addresses its ID address, if it is not, the controller then can disable the receiver. If the address byte ad-
dresses the ‘slave’ ID address, the controller take no further action; the receiver will receive the subsequent data.
9.3.2 Auto address detection
If Special Character Detect is enabled (EFR[5] is set and XOFF2 contains the address byte) the receiver will try to detect an address
byte that matches the programmed character in XOFF2. If the received byte is a data byte or an address byte that does not match the
programmed character in XOFF2, the receiver will discard these data. Upon receiving an address byte that matches the XOFF2 char-
acter, the receiver will be automatically enabled if not already enabled, and the address character is pushed into the RX FIFO along
with the parity bit (in place of the parity error bit). The receiver also generates a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to 1 at this
time). The receiver will then receive the subsequent data from the ‘master’ station until being disabled by the controller after having
received a message from the ‘master’ station.
If another address byte is received and this address byte does not match XOFF2 character, the receiver will be automatically disabled
and the address byte is ignored. If the address byte matches XOFF2 character, the receiver will put this byte in the RX FIFO along with
the parity bit in the parity error bit (LSR[2]).

10. I2C-bus Interface
The I2C-bus interface is compliant with the Standard-mode and Fast-mode I2C-bus specifications. The I2C-bus interface consists of
two lines: serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). In the Standard-mode, the serial clock and serial data can go up to 100 kbps and
in the Fast-mode, the serial clock and serial data can go up to 400 kbps. The first byte sent by an I2C-bus master contains a start bit
(SDA transition from HIGH to LOW when SCL is HIGH), 7-bit slave address and whether it is a read or write transaction. The next
byte is the sub-address that contains the address of the register to access. The UART responds to each write with an acknowledge
(SDA driven LOW by UART for one clock cycle when SCL is HIGH). If the TX FIFO is full, the UART will respond with a negative
acknowledge (SDA driven HIGH by UART for one clock cycle when SCL is HIGH) when the CPU tries to write to the TX FIFO.
The last byte sent by an I2C-bus master is a stop bit (SDA transition from LOW to HIGH when SCL is HIGH). See Figures 8 - 10 below.
For complete details, see the I2C-bus specifications.

10.1 I2C-bus Addressing
There could be many devices on the I2C-bus. To distinguish itself from the other devices on the I2C-bus, there are eight possible slave
addresses that can be selected for the UART using the A1 and A0 address lines. Table 9 below shows the different addresses that can
be selected. Note that there are two different ways to select each I2C address.

An I2C sub-address is sent by the I2C master following the slave address. The sub-address contains the UART register address being
accessed. A read or write transaction is determined by bit-0 of the slave address (HIGH = Read, LOW = Write). Table 10 below lists
the functions of the bits in the I2C sub-address.

                        other values are reserved
0                       Reserved
After the last read or write transaction, the I2C-bus master will set the SCL signal back to its idle state (HIGH).

11. SPI Bus Interface
The SPI interface consists of four lines: serial clock (SCL), chip select (CS#), slave output (SO) and slave input (SI). The serial clock,
slave output and slave input can be as fast as 33 MHz at 3.3V. To access the device in the SPI mode, the CS# signal for the UART is
asserted by the SPI master, then the SPI master starts toggling the SCL signal with the appropriate transaction information. The first
bit sent by the SPI master includes whether it is a read or write transaction and the UART register being accessed. See Table 11 below.

The UART includes the infrared encoder and decoder compatible to the IrDA (Infrared Data Association) version 1.0 and 1.1.
The IrDA 1.0 standard that stipulates the infrared encoder sends out a 3/16 of a bit wide HIGH-pulse for each “0” bit in the transmit
data stream with a data rate up to 115.2 Kbps. For the IrDA 1.1 standard, the infrared encoder sends out a 1/4 of a bit time wide HIGH-
pulse for each "0" bit in the transmit data stream with a data rate up to 1.152 Mbps. This signal encoding reduces the on-time of the
infrared LED, hence reduces the power consumption. See Figure 16 below.
The infrared encoder and decoder are enabled by setting MCR register bit-6 to a ‘1’. With this bit enabled, the infrared encoder and
decoder is compatible to the IrDA 1.0 standard. For the infrared encoder and decoder to be compatible to the IrDA 1.1 standard, EFCR
bit-7 will also need to be set to a ’1’. When the infrared feature is enabled, the transmit data output, TX, idles LOW. Likewise, the RX
input also idles LOW, see Figure 16.
The wireless infrared decoder receives the input pulse from the infrared sensing diode on the RX pin. Each time it senses a light
pulse, it returns a logic 1 to the data bit stream.
The UART can be in the infrared mode upon power-up if the ENIR# pin is LOW. After power-up, the infrared mode can be controlled
via MCR bit-6.
