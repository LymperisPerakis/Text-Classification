DESCRIPTION                                                                ‚Ä¢ Baud rate for the receiver and transmitter selectable from:
The 28C94 quad universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter                   ‚Äì 23 fixed rates: 50 to 230.4K baud; Non-standard rates to
(QUART) combines four enhanced Philips Semiconductors                          1.0 M baud
industry-standard UARTs with an innovative interrupt scheme that
                                                                             ‚Äì User-defined rates from the programmable counter/timer
can vastly minimize host processor overhead. It is implemented
                                                                               associated with each of two blocks
using Philips Semiconductors‚Äô high-speed CMOS process that
combines small die size and cost with low power consumption.                 ‚Äì External 1x or 16x clock
The operating speed of each receiver and transmitter can be                ‚Ä¢ Parity, framing, and overrun error detection
selected independently at one of eighteen fixed baud rates, a 16X          ‚Ä¢ False start bit detection
clock derived from a programmable counter/timer, or an external 1X
or 16X clock. The baud rate generator and counter/timer can                ‚Ä¢ Line break detection and generation
operate directly from a crystal or from external clock inputs. The
ability to independently program the operating speed of the receiver
                                                                           ‚Ä¢ Programmable channel mode
and transmitter make the QUART particularly attractive for                   ‚Äì Normal (full-duplex), automatic echo, local loop back, remote
dual-speed channel applications such as clustered terminal                     loopback
systems.                                                                   ‚Ä¢ Programmable interrupt priorities
Each receiver is buffered with eight character FIFOs (first-in-first-out   ‚Ä¢ Identification of highest priority interrupt
memories) and one shift register to minimize the potential for
receiver overrun and to reduce interrupt overhead in interrupt driven      ‚Ä¢ Global interrupt register set provides data from interrupting
systems. In addition, a handshaking capability is provided to disable        channel
a remote UART transmitter when the receiver buffer is full. (RTS           ‚Ä¢ Vectored interrupts with programmable vector format
control)
                                                                           ‚Ä¢ IACKN and programmable DTACKN signals
The 28C94 provides a power-down mode in which the oscillator is
stopped and the register contents are stored. This results in reduced      ‚Ä¢ Built-in baud rate generator with choice of 18 rates
power consumption on the order of several magnitudes. The                  ‚Ä¢ Four I/O pins per UART for modem controls, clocks, etc.
QUART is fully TTL compatible and operates from a single +5V
power supply.                                                              ‚Ä¢ Power down mode

PIN DESCRIPTION
    MNEMONIC        TYPE                                                        NAME AND FUNCTION
 CEN                    I      Chip Select: Active low input that, in conjunction with RDN or WRN, indicates that the host MPU is trying to
                               access a QUART register. CEN must be inactive when IACKN is asserted.
 A5:0                   I      Address Lines: These inputs select a 28C94 register to be read or written by the host MPU.
 D7:0                 I/O      8-bit Bidirectional Data Bus: Used by the host MPU to read and write 28C94 registers.
 RDN                    I      Read Strobe: Active low input. When this line is asserted simultaneously with CEN, the 28C94 places the
                               contents of the register selected by A5:0 on the D7:0 lines.
 WRN                    I      Write Strobe: Active low input. When this line is asserted simultaneously with CEN, the 28C94 writes the data
                               on D7:0 into the register selected by A5:0.
 DACKN                 O       Data ACKnowledge: Active low, open-drain output to the host MPU, which is asserted subsequent to a read or
                               write operation. For a read operation, assertion of DACKN indicates that register data is valid on D7:0. For a
                               write operation, it indicates that the data on D7:0 has been captured into the indicated register. This signal
                               corresponds to READYN on 80x86 processors and DTACKN on 680x0 processors.
 IRQN                  O       Interrupt Request: This active low open-drain output to the host MPU indicating that one or more of the
                               enabled UART interrupt sources has reached an interrupt value which exceeds that pre-programmed by host
                               software. The IRQN can be used directly as a 680x0 processor input; it must be inverted for use as an 80x86
                               interrupt input. This signal requires an external pull-up resistor.
 IACKN                  I      Interrupt ACKnowledge: Active low input indicates host MPU is acknowledging an interrupt requested. The
                               28C94 responds by placing an interrupt vector or interrupt vector modified on D7-D0 and asserting DACKN. This
                               signal updates the CIR register in the interrupt logic. CEN must be high during this cycle.
 TDa-d                 O       Transmit Data: Serial outputs from the four UARTs.
 RDa-d                  I      Receive Data: Serial inputs to the four UARTs/
 I/O0a-d              I/O      Input/Output 0: A multi-use input or output signal for each UART. These pins can be used as general purpose
                               inputs, Clear to Send inputs, 1X or 16X Transmit Clock outputs or general purpose outputs. Change-of-state
                               detection is provided for these pins. I/O pins have approximately 1.5 Mohm pull‚Äìup device.
 I/O1a-d              I/O      Input/Output 1: A multi-use input or output signal for each UART. These pins can be used as general purpose
                               or 1X or 16X transmit clock inputs, or general purpose 1X or 16X receive clock outputs. Change-of-state
                               detection is provided for these pins. In addition, I/O1a and I/O1c can be used as Counter/Timer inputs and I/O1b
                               and I/O1d can be used as Counter/Timer outputs. I/O pins have approximately 1.5 Mohm pull‚Äìup device.
 I/O2a-d              I/O      Input/Output 2: A multi-use input or output signal for each UART. These pins can be used as general purpose
                               inputs, 1X or 16X receive clock inputs, general purpose outputs, RTS output or 1X or 16X receive clock outputs.
                               I/O pins have approximately 1.5 Mohm pull‚Äìup device.
 I/O3a-d              I/O      Input/Output 3: A multi-use input or output signal for each UART. These pins can be used as general purpose
                               inputs, 1X or 16X transmit clock inputs, general purpose outputs, or 1X or 16X transmit clock outputs. I/O pins
                               have approximately 1.5 Mohm pull‚Äìup device.
 RESET                  I      Master Reset: Active high reset for the 28C94 logic. Must be asserted at power-up, may be asserted at other
                               times that the system is to be reset and restarted. OSC set to divide by 1, MR pointer set to 1, DACKN enabled,
                               I/O pins to input. Registers reset: MR0, OPR, CIR. IRQN, DTACKN, IVR Interrupt Vector, Power Down, Test
                               registers, FIFO pointers, Baud rate generator, Error Status, Watch Dog Timers, Change of State detectors,
                               counter/timer to timer, Transmitter and Receiver controllers and all interrupt bits. If reset pin is not used, then
                               first chip access should be to celar ‚Äòpower-down‚Äô mode.
 X1/CLK                 I      Crystal 1 or Communication Clock: This pin is normally connected to one side of a 3.6864MHz or a
                               7.3728MHz crystal, or can be connected to an external clock up to 8MHz.
 X2                    O       Crystal 2: If a crystal is used, this pin should be connected to its other terminal. If an external clock is applied to
                               X1, this pin should be left unconnected.

This register controls the configuration of the I/O ports. It defines them as inputs or outputs and controls what sources will drive them in the
case of outputs or which functions they will drive when used as an input. Each pin has four functions and hence two bits to control it. Each
UART has one eight bit register to control its four I/O ports.

                                 One bit for each pin. When I/O pins are configured as ‚ÄúGeneral Purpose Outputs‚Äù
                                      the pins will be driven to the complement value of its associated OPR bit.

                                 One bit for each pin. When I/O pins are configured as ‚ÄúGeneral Purpose Outputs‚Äù
                                      the pins will be driven to the complement value of its associated OPR bit.
This register contains the data for the I/O ports when they are used as ‚ÄôGeneral Purpose Outputs‚Äô . The bits of the register are controlled by
writing to the hex addresses at 0C and 1C. Ones written to the OPR drive the pins to 0; zeros drive the pins to 1. (The pins drive the value of
the complement data written to the OPR)

This register reads the state of the ‚ÄôI/O Ports‚Äô. The state of the I/O ports is read regardless of being programmed as inputs or outputs.
The IPR can be thought of a just another 8 bit parallel port to the system data bus. The lower four bits of this register are replicated in the lower
four bits of the IPCR register.

The input part of the I/O pins is always active. The programming of the IOPCR bits to 00 merely turns off the out drivers and places
the pin at high impedance.
A read of the IPR register returns the value of the IPR bits as shown above. IPR(5) is at bit position 5 of the data bus. Note that the IPR bit
positions do not follow the 0, 1, 2, 3 order of the I/O ports. During a read of the IPR the I/O ports are not latched. Therefore, it is possible to see
changing data during the read. Port pins that have clocks on them may not yield valid data during the read.
Since the input circuits of the I/O ports are always active it is possible to direct the port signal back into the port. For example: I/O1 will output
the RTS signal. Setting the Counter/Timer (C/T) to be clocked by the I/O1 port will result in the counter counting the number of times RTS goes
active. The change of state detectors on I/O0 and I/O1 will, when programmed, always be sensitive to the signal on the port regardless of the
source of that port‚Äôs signal.

1. Normal configurations place RTSN output on I/O1 and place Tx external clock input on I/O3. For the 48 pin Dual In-Line package, I/O3 is
    not available. The following options allow flexible I/O programming with the 48 pin package:
                           When IOPCR(7:6), the I/O3 control, ‚â† 00, then I/O1 becomes available to the transmitter as an external clock.
                           When IOPCR(5:4), the I/O2 control, = 01, then I/O2 may be the RTSN signal if MR1(7) = 1 and OPR(4) = 1.
2. I/O1 becomes RTSN when IOPCR(3:2) = 01 and MR1(7) = 1 and OPR(1) = 1. (OPR(3) for channel B)
3. Recommended method for setting RTS/CTS flow control is to set IPCR [5:4] to 01 and to set I/OPCR[1:0] to 00. This makes I/O[2} RTSN
    and I/O[1] CTSN. Caution: When RTS/CTS is active writing to the OPR register could conflict with the receiver control of OPR [6] and
    OPR [4].

NOTES:
1. All voltage measurements are referenced to ground (GND). For testing, all inputs swing between 0.4 V and 2.4 V with a transition time of
    20 ns maximum. For X1/CLK this swing is between 0.4 V and 4.4 V. All time measurements are referenced at input voltages of VIL and VIH,
    as appropriate.
2. Typical values are at +25 ¬∞C, typical supply voltages, and typical processing parameters.
3. Test condition for interrupt and I/O outputs: CL = 50 pF, RL = 2.7 k‚Ñ¶ to VCC. Test conditions for rest of outputs: CL = 150 pF.
4. Timing is illustrated and referenced to the WRN and RDN inputs. The device may also be operated with CEN as the ‚Äòstrobing‚Äô input. CEN
    and RDN (also CEN and WRN) are ANDed internally. As a consequence, the signal asserted last initiates the cycle and the signal negated
    first terminates the cycle.
5. The minimum value is not tested, but is guaranteed by design. For tCLK minimum test rate is 2.0 MHz.

NOTES:
1. Parameters are valid over specified temperature range. See ordering information table for applicable temperature range and operating
   supply range.
2. Timing is illustrated and referenced to the WRN and RDN inputs. The device may also be operated with CEN as a ‚Äòstrobing‚Äô input. CEN and
   RDN (also CEN and WRN) are ANDed internally. As a consequence the signal asserted last initiates the cycle; the signal negated first
   terminates the cycle. Address is latched at leading edge of a read or write cycle.
3. The RDN signal must be negated for this time to guarantee that internal registers update before the next read.

NOTES:
1. The minimum time indicates that read data will remain valid until the bus master drives CEN and/or RDN to High.
2. The fact that this parameter is negative means that the Dnn line may actually become valid after CEN and WRN are both Low.
3. In a Write operation, the bus master must hold the write data valid either until drives CEN and/or WRN to High, or until the QUART drives
   DACKN to Low, whichever comes first.
4. Test condition for interrupt and I/O outputs: CL = 50 pF, forced current for VOL = 4.0 mA; forced current for VOH = 400 ¬µA, RL = 2.7 k‚Ñ¶ to
   VCC. Test condition for rest of outputs: CL = 150 pF
5. Consecutive write operations to the upper four bits of the Command Register (CR) require at least three X1/CLK edges; four X1/CLK edges
   in the ‚ÄòX1/CLK divide by 2 edges‚Äô according to register 2Eh or 2Fh setting.
6. Address is latched at leading edge of a read or write cycle.
