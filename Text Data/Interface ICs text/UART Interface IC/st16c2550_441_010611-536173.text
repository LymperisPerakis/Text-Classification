 1.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The ST16C2550 (C2550) integrates the functions of two 16C550 Universal Asynchrounous Receiver and
Transmitter (UART). Each UART is independently controlled having its own set of device configuration
registers. The C2550 provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization, parallel-to-serial and serial-
to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and receiver sections. These functions are necessary for
converting the serial data stream into parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization
for the serial data stream is accomplished by adding start and stops bits to the transmit data to form a data
character (character orientated protocol). Data integrity is ensured by attaching a parity bit to the data
character. The parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit errors. The electronic circuitry to
provide all these functions is fairly complex especially when manufactured on a single integrated silicon chip.
The C2550 represents such an integration with greatly enhanced features. The C2550 is fabricated with an
advanced CMOS process.
The C2550 is an upward solution that provides a dual UART capability with 16 bytes of transmit and receive
FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C2450. The C2550 is designed to work with high speed modems and
shared network environments, that require fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in the
C2550 by the transmit and receive FIFO’s. This allows the external processor to handle more networking tasks
within a given time. For example, the ST16C2450 without a receive FIFO, will require unloading of the RHR in
93 microseconds (This example uses a character length of 11 bits, including start/stop bits at 115.2 Kbps). This
means the external CPU will have to service the receive FIFO less than every 100 microseconds. However
with the 16 byte FIFO in the C2550, the data buffer will not require unloading/loading for 1.53 ms. This
increases the service interval giving the external CPU additional time for other applications and reducing the
overall UART interrupt servicing time. In addition, the 4 selectable receive FIFO trigger interrupt levels is
uniquely provided for maximum data throughput performance especially when operating in a multi-channel
environment. The FIFO memory greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of the external controlling CPU,
increases performance, and reduces power consumption.
The C2550 is capable of operation up to 4 Mbps with a 64 MHz external clock. With a crystal or external clock
input of 14.7456 MHz the user can select data rates up to 921.6 Kbps.
The rich feature set of the C2550 is available through internal registers. Selectable receive FIFO trigger levels,
selectable TX and RX baud rates, and modem interface controls are all standard features. Following a power
on reset or an external reset, the C2550 is software compatible with the previous generation, ST16C2450.

  2.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
  2.1    CPU Interface
The CPU interface is 8 data bits wide with 3 address lines and control signals to execute data bus read and
write transactions. The C2550 data interface supports the Intel compatible types of CPUs and it is compatible
to the industry standard 16C550 UART. No clock (oscillator nor external clock) is required to operate a data
bus transaction. Each bus cycle is asynchronous using CS#, IOR# and IOW# signals. Both UART channels
share the same data bus for host operations. The data bus interconnections are shown in Figure 3.

  2.2    Device Reset
The RESET input resets the internal registers and the serial interface outputs in both channels to their default
state (see Table 11). An active high pulse of at least 40 ns duration will be required to activate the reset
function in the device.
  2.3    Channel A and B Selection
The UART provides the user with the capability to bi-directionally transfer information between an external
CPU and an external serial communication device. A logic 0 on chip select pins, CSA# or CSB#, allows the
user to select UART channel A or B to configure, send transmit data and/or unload receive data to/from the
UART. Selecting both UARTs can be useful during power up initialization to write to the same internal registers,
but do not attempt to read from both uarts simultaneously. Individual channel select functions are shown in
Table 1.

REV. 4.4.1                                                                2.97V TO 5.5V DUART WITH 16-BYTE FIFO
 2.4       Channel A and B Internal Registers
Each UART channel in the C2550 has a standard register set for controlling, monitoring and data loading and
unloading. The configuration register set is compatible to those already available in the standard single
16C550. These registers function as data holding registers (THR/RHR), interrupt status and control registers
(ISR/IER), a FIFO control register (FCR), receive line status and control registers (LSR/LCR), modem status
and control registers (MSR/MCR), programmable data rate (clock) divisor registers (DLL/DLM), and a user
accessible scratch pad register (SPR).
 2.5       DMA Mode
The device does not support direct memory access. The DMA Mode (a legacy term) in this document does not
mean “direct memory access” but refers to data block transfer operation. The DMA mode affects the state of
the RXRDY# A/B and TXRDY# A/B output pins. The transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels provide additional
flexibility to the user for block mode operation. The LSR bits 5-6 provide an indication when the transmitter is
empty or has an empty location(s) for more data. The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive
FIFO in the DMA mode (FCR bit-3=1). When the transmit and receive FIFO are enabled and the DMA mode is
disabled (FCR bit-3 = 0), the C2550 is placed in single-character mode for data transmit or receive operation.
When DMA mode is enabled (FCR bit-3 = 1), the user takes advantage of block mode operation by loading or
unloading the FIFO in a block sequence determined by the programmed trigger level. The following table show
their behavior. Also see Figures 17 through 22.
                         TABLE 2: TXRDY# AND RXRDY# OUTPUTS IN FIFO AND DMA MODE

   TXRDY# A/B       0 = THR empty.        0 = FIFO empty.                   0 = FIFO has at least 1 empty location.
                    1 = byte in THR.      1 = at least 1 byte in FIFO.      1 = FIFO is full.
 2.6       INTA and INTB Outputs
The INTA and INTB interrupt output changes according to the operating mode and enhanced features setup.
Tables 3and 4summarize the operating behavior for the transmitter and receiver. Also see Figures 17
through 22.

 2.7     Crystal Oscillator or External Clock Input
The C2550 includes an on-chip oscillator (XTAL1 and XTAL2) to produce a clock for both UART sections in the
device. The CPU data bus does not require this clock for bus operation. The crystal oscillator provides a
system clock to the Baud Rate Generators (BRG) section found in each of the UART. XTAL1 is the input to the
oscillator or external clock buffer input with XTAL2 pin being the output. See “Programmable Baud Rate
Generator” on page 10.

The on-chip oscillator is designed to use an industry standard microprocessor crystal (parallel resonant,
fundamental frequency with 10-22 pF capacitance load, ESR of 20-120 ohms and 100ppm frequency
tolerance) connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 4), with an external 500kΩ to
1 MΩ resistor across it. Alternatively, an external clock can be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the internal
baud rate generator for standard or custom rates. Typical oscillator connections are shown in Figure 4. For
further reading on oscillator circuit please see application note DAN108 on EXAR’s web site.
 2.8     Programmable Baud Rate Generator
A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver, allowing independent TX/RX channel
control. The programmable Baud Rate Generator is capable of operating with a crystal frequency of up to 24
MHz. However, with an external clock input on XTAL1 pin and a 2K ohms pull-up resistor on XTAL2 pin (as
shown in Figure 5) it can extend its operation up to 64 MHz (4Mbps serial data rate) at room temperature and
5.0V.

The C2550 divides the basic external clock by 16. The basic 16X clock provides table rates to support standard
and custom applications using the same system design. The Baud Rate Generator divides the input 16X clock
by any divisor from 1 to 216 -1. The rate table is configured via the DLL and DLM internal register functions.
Customized Baud Rates can be achieved by selecting the proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB sections
of baud rate generator.
Table 5 shows the standard data rates available with a 14.7456 MHz crystal or external clock at 16X sampling
rate. When using a non-standard frequency crystal or external clock, the divisor value can be calculated for
DLL/DLM with the following equation.
                           divisor (decimal) = (XTAL1 clock frequency) / (serial data rate x 16)

 2.9     Transmitter
The transmitter section comprises of an 8-bit Transmit Shift Register (TSR) and 16 bytes of FIFO which
includes a byte-wide Transmit Holding Register (THR). TSR shifts out every data bit with the 16X internal
clock. A bit time is 16 clock periods. The transmitter sends the start-bit followed by the number of data bits,
inserts the proper parity-bit if enabled, and adds the stop-bit(s). The status of the FIFO and TSR are reported in
the Line Status Register (LSR bit-5 and bit-6).
  2.9.1     Transmit Holding Register (THR) - Write Only
The transmit holding register is an 8-bit register providing a data interface to the host processor. The host
writes transmit data byte to the THR to be converted into a serial data stream including start-bit, data bits,
parity-bit and stop-bit(s). The least-significant-bit (Bit-0) becomes first data bit to go out. The THR is the input
register to the transmit FIFO of 16 bytes when FIFO operation is enabled by FCR bit-0. Every time a write
operation is made to the THR, the FIFO data pointer is automatically bumped to the next sequential data
location.
  2.9.2     Transmitter Operation in non-FIFO Mode
The host loads transmit data to THR one character at a time. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set when the
data byte is transferred to TSR. THR flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when it is enabled
by IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR becomes completely empty.

  2.9.3     Transmitter Operation in FIFO Mode
The host may fill the transmit FIFO with up to 16 bytes of transmit data. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set
whenever the FIFO is empty. The THR empty flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when the
FIFO becomes empty. The transmit empty interrupt is enabled by IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set
when TSR/FIFO becomes empty.

 2.10    Receiver
The receiver section contains an 8-bit Receive Shift Register (RSR) and 16 bytes of FIFO which includes a
byte-wide Receive Holding Register (RHR). The RSR uses the 16X clock for timing. It verifies and validates
every bit on the incoming character in the middle of each data bit. On the falling edge of a start or false start bit,
an internal receiver counter starts counting at the 16X clock rate. After 8 clocks the start bit period should be at
the center of the start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated. Evaluating
the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false character. The rest of the data bits
and stop bits are sampled and validated in this same manner to prevent false framing. If there were any
error(s), they are reported in the LSR register bits 2-4. Upon unloading the receive data byte from RHR, the
receive FIFO pointer is bumped and the error tags are immediately updated to reflect the status of the data
byte in RHR register. RHR can generate a receive data ready interrupt upon receiving a character or delay until
it reaches the FIFO trigger level. Furthermore, data delivery to the host is guaranteed by a receive data ready
time-out interrupt when data is not received for 4 word lengths as defined by LCR[1:0] plus 12 bits time. This is
equivalent to 3.7-4.6 character times. The RHR interrupt is enabled by IER bit-0.

 2.10.1   Receive Holding Register (RHR) - Read-Only
The Receive Holding Register is an 8-bit register that holds a receive data byte from the Receive Shift
Register. It provides the receive data interface to the host processor. The RHR register is part of the receive
FIFO of 16 bytes by 11-bits wide, the 3 extra bits are for the 3 error tags to be reported in LSR register. When
the FIFO is enabled by FCR bit-0, the RHR contains the first data character received by the FIFO. After the
RHR is read, the next character byte is loaded into the RHR and the errors associated with the current data
byte are immediately updated in the LSR bits 2-4.

2.11     Internal Loopback
The C2550 UART provides an internal loopback capability for system diagnostic purposes. The internal
loopback mode is enabled by setting MCR register bit-4 to logic 1. All regular UART functions operate normally.
Figure 11 shows how the modem port signals are re-configured. Transmit data from the transmit shift register
output is internally routed to the receive shift register input allowing the system to receive the same data that it
was sending. The TX pin is held at logic 1 or mark condition while RTS# and DTR# are de-asserted, and
CTS#, DSR# CD# and RI# inputs are ignored. Caution: the RX input must be held to a logic 1 during loopback
test else upon exiting the loopback test the UART may detect and report a false “break” signal.

  4.3.1     IER versus Receive FIFO Interrupt Mode Operation
When the receive FIFO (FCR BIT-0 = 1) and receive interrupts (IER BIT-0 = 1) are enabled, the RHR interrupts
(see ISR bits 2 and 3) status will reflect the following:
A. The receive data available interrupts are issued to the host when the FIFO has reached the programmed
     trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
B. FIFO level will be reflected in the ISR register when the FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register
     status bit and the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
C. The receive data ready bit (LSR BIT-0) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift register to
     the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
  4.3.2     IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO Polled Mode Operation
When FCR BIT-0 equals a logic 1 for FIFO enable; resetting IER bits 0-3 enables the ST16C2550 in the FIFO
polled mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR either or both can
be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
A. LSR BIT-0 indicates there is data in RHR or RX FIFO.
B. LSR BIT-1 indicates an overrun error has occurred and that data in the FIFO may not be valid.
C. LSR BIT 2-4 provides the type of receive data errors encountered for the data byte in RHR, if any.
D. LSR BIT-5 indicates Transmit FIFO is empty.
E. LSR BIT-6 indicates when both the transmit FIFO and TSR are empty.
F. LSR BIT-7 indicates a data error in at least one character in the RX FIFO.
IER[0]: RHR Interrupt Enable
The receive data ready interrupt will be issued when RHR has a data character in the non-FIFO mode or when
the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level in the FIFO mode.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receive data ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver data ready interrupt.
IER[1]: THR Interrupt Enable
This bit enables the Transmit Ready interrupt which is issued whenever the Transmit FIFO becomes empty. If
the Transmit FIFO is empty when this bit is enabled, an interrupt will be generated.
• Logic 0 = Disable Transmit Ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Transmit Ready interrupt.
IER[2]: Receive Line Status Interrupt Enable
If any of the LSR register bits 1, 2, 3 or 4 is a logic 1, it will generate an interrupt to inform the host controller
about the error status of the current data byte in FIFO. LSR bit-1 generates an interrupt immediately when the
character has been received. LSR bits 2-4 generate an interrupt when the character with errors is read out of
the FIFO.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receiver line status interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver line status interrupt.
IER[3]: Modem Status Interrupt Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable the modem status register interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the modem status register interrupt.

  4.4    Interrupt Status Register (ISR) - Read-Only
The UART provides multiple levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external software interaction. The
Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with four interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the
ISR will give the user the current highest pending interrupt level to be serviced, others are queued up to be
serviced next. No other interrupts are acknowledged until the pending interrupt is serviced. The Interrupt
Source Table, Table 8, shows the data values (bits 0-3) for the interrupt priority levels and the interrupt sources
associated with each of these interrupt levels.
  4.4.1      Interrupt Generation:
• LSR is by any of the LSR bits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
• RXRDY is by RX trigger level.

LCR[3]: TX and RX Parity Select
Parity or no parity can be selected via this bit. The parity bit is a simple way used in communications for data
integrity check. See Table 10 for parity selection summary below.
• Logic 0 = No parity.
• Logic 1 = A parity bit is generated during the transmission while the receiver checks for parity error of the
   data character received.
LCR[4]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled with LCR bit-3 set to a logic 1, LCR BIT-4 selects the even or odd parity format.
• Logic 0 = ODD Parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format (default).
• Logic 1 = EVEN Parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format.

LCR[6]: Transmit Break Enable
When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a
“space’, logic 0, state). This condition remains, until disabled by setting LCR bit-6 to a logic 0.
• Logic 0 = No TX break condition (default).
• Logic 1 = Forces the transmitter output (TX) to a “space”, logic 0, for alerting the remote receiver of a line
   break condition.
LCR[7]: Baud Rate Divisors (DLL/DLM) Enable
• Logic 0 = Data registers are selected (default).

 4.7     Modem Control Register (MCR) or General Purpose Outputs Control - Read/Write
The MCR register is used for controlling the serial/modem interface signals or general purpose inputs/outputs.
MCR[0]: DTR# Output
The DTR# pin is a modem control output. If the modem interface is not used, this output may be used as a
general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force DTR# output to a logic 1 (default).
• Logic 1 = Force DTR# output to a logic 0.
MCR[1]: RTS# Output
The RTS# pin is a modem control output. If the modem interface is not used, this output may be used as a
general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force RTS# output to a logic 1 (default).
• Logic 1 = Force RTS# output to a logic 0.
MCR[2]: Reserved

MCR[3]: OP2# Output / INT Output Enable
This bit enables and disables the operation of INT, interrupt output. If INT output is not used, OP2# can be
used as a general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = INT (A-B) outputs disabled (three state mode) and OP2# output set to a logic 1 (default).
• Logic 1 = INT (A-B) outputs enabled (active mode) and OP2# output set to a logic 0.
MCR[4]: Internal Loopback Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable loopback mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable local loopback mode, see loopback section and Figure 11.
MCR[7:5]: Reserved
 4.8      Line Status Register (LSR) - Read Only
This register provides the status of data transfers between the UART and the host.
LSR[0]: Receive Data Ready Indicator
• Logic 0 = No data in receive holding register or FIFO (default).
• Logic 1 = Data has been received and is saved in the receive holding register or FIFO.
LSR[1]: Receiver Overrun Flag
• Logic 0 = No overrun error (default).
• Logic 1 = Overrun error. A data overrun error condition occurred in the receive shift register. This happens
  when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In this case the previous data in the receive shift register
  is overwritten. Note that under this condition the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into
  the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error. An interrupt will be generated
  immediately if LSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-2).
LSR[2]: Receive Data Parity Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No parity error (default).
• Logic 1 = Parity error. The receive character in RHR does not have correct parity information and is suspect.
  This error is associated with the character available for reading in RHR. If the LSR interrupt is enabled (IER
  bit-2), an interrupt will be generated when the character is in the RHR.
LSR[3]: Receive Data Framing Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No framing error (default).
• Logic 1 = Framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). This error is associated with
  the character available for reading in RHR. If the LSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-2), an interrupt will be
  generated when the character is in the RHR.
LSR[4]: Receive Break Flag
• Logic 0 = No break condition (default).
• Logic 1 = The receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for at least one character frame time). In the
  FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded into the FIFO. The break indication remains until the RX
  input returns to the idle condition, “mark” or logic 1. If the LSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-2), an interrupt will
  be generated when the character is in the RHR.
LSR[5]: Transmit Holding Register Empty Flag
This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit indicates that the transmitter is ready to
accept a new character for transmission. In addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to the host
when the THR interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when the last data byte is transferred from
the transmit holding register to the transmit shift register. The bit is reset to logic 0 concurrently with the data
loading to the transmit holding register by the host. In the FIFO mode this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is
empty, it is cleared when the transmit FIFO contains at least 1 byte.
LSR[6]: THR and TSR Empty Flag
                                                           23

This bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmitter goes idle. It is set to logic 0 whenever either the THR or
TSR contains a data character. In the FIFO mode this bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmit FIFO and
transmit shift register are both empty.
LSR[7]: Receive FIFO Data Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No FIFO error (default).
• Logic 1 = A global indicator for the sum of all error bits in the RX FIFO. At least one parity error, framing error
   or break indication is in the FIFO data. This bit clears when there is no more error(s) in the FIFO.
 4.9      Modem Status Register (MSR) - Read Only
This register provides the current state of the modem interface signals, or other peripheral device that the
UART is connected. Lower four bits of this register are used to indicate the changed information. These bits
are set to a logic 1 whenever a signal from the modem changes state. These bits may be used as general
purpose inputs/outputs when they are not used with modem signals.
MSR[0]: Delta CTS# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CTS# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The CTS# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
   will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[1]: Delta DSR# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on DSR# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The DSR# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
   will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[2]: Delta RI# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on RI# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The RI# input has changed from a logic 0 to a logic 1, ending of the ringing signal. A modem status
   interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[3]: Delta CD# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CD# input (default).
• Logic 1 = Indicates that the CD# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem
   status interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[4]: CTS Input Status
Normally MSR bit-4 bit is the compliment of the CTS# input. However in the loopback mode, this bit is
equivalent to the RTS# bit in the MCR register. The CTS# input may be used as a general purpose input when
the modem interface is not used.
MSR[5]: DSR Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the DSR# input. In the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the DTR#
bit in the MCR register. The DSR# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is
not used.
MSR[6]: RI Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the RI# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-2 in the
MCR register. The RI# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.

MSR[7]: CD Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the CD# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-3 in the
MCR register. The CD# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
 4.10    Scratch Pad Register (SPR) - Read/Write
This is a 8-bit general purpose register for the user to store temporary data. The content of this register is
preserved during sleep mode but becomes 0xFF (default) after a reset or a power off-on cycle.
 4.11    Baud Rate Generator Registers (DLL and DLM) - Read/Write
The Baud Rate Generator (BRG) is a 16-bit counter that generates the data rate for the transmitter. The rate is
programmed through registers DLL and DLM which are only accessible when LCR bit-7 is set to ‘1’. See

         Date           Revision                                           Description
 February 2002        4.0           Changed to standard style format. Text descriptions were clarified and simplified (eg.
                                    DMA operation, FIFO mode vs. Non-FIFO mode operations etc). Clarified timing dia-
                                    grams. Renamed Rclk (Receive Clock) to Bclk (Baud Clock) and timing symbols.
                                    Added TAH, TCS and OSC.
 April 2002           4.1           Changed A0-A7 in Figures 15 and 16 to A0-A2. Clarified MCR bit-3 description.
 September 2003 4.2                 Changed to single column format. Added Device Status to Ordering Information.
                                    Devices with top markings of "A2 YYWW" and newer have 5V tolerant inputs. Devices
                                    with top markings of "CC YYWW" and older do not have 5V tolerant inputs.
 April 2004           4.2.1         Corrected unit of clock pulse duration (CLK) in AC Electrical Characteristics table from
                                    ’MHz’ to ’ns’.
 August 2004          4.3.1         Updated the AC Timing values for CS, IOR, IOW and TDY parameters.
 October 2004         4.4.0         The AC and DC Electrical Characteristics tables apply to devices with top mark date
                                    code of "A2 YYWW" and newer.
 January 2011         4.4.1         Corrected the "Voltage at any pin" to "GND-0.3V to +5.5V" in the "Absolute maximum
                                    ratings" table on the page 26.
