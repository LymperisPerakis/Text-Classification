     IOR#        19      I When 16/68# pin is HIGH, the Intel bus interface is selected and this input becomes
    (VCC)                  read strobe (active low). The falling edge instigates an internal read cycle and
                           retrieves the data byte from an internal register pointed by the address lines [A2:A0],
                           puts the data byte on the data bus to allow the host processor to read it on the rising
                           edge.
                           When 16/68# pin is LOW, the Motorola bus interface is selected and this input is not
                           used and should be connected to VCC.
    IOW#         15      I When 16/68# pin is HIGH, it selects Intel bus interface and this input becomes write
   (R/W#)                  strobe (active low). The falling edge instigates the internal write cycle and the rising
                           edge transfers the data byte on the data bus to an internal register pointed by the
                           address lines.
                           When 16/68# pin is LOW, the Motorola bus interface is selected and this input
                           becomes read (HIGH) and write (LOW) signal.

    CSB#         11      I When 16/68# pin is HIGH, this input is chip select B (active low) to enable channel B
      (A3)                 in the device.
                           When 16/68# pin is LOW, this input becomes address line A3 which is used for chan-
                           nel selection in the Motorola bus interface. Input logic 0 selects channel A and logic 1
                           selects channel B.
     INTA        30     O  When 16/68# pin is HIGH for Intel bus interface, this output becomes channel A inter-
   (IRQ#)                  rupt output. The output state is defined by the user through the software setting of
                           MCR[3]. INTA is set to the active mode and OP2A# output to a logic 0 when MCR[3]
                           is set to a logic 1. INTA is set to the three state mode and OP2A# to a logic 1 when
                           MCR[3] is set to a logic 0. See MCR[3].
                           When 16/68# pin is LOW for Motorola bus interface, this output becomes device
                           interrupt output (active low, open drain). An external pull-up resistor is required for
                           proper operation.

 1.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The XR16L2751 (2751) integrates the functions of 2 enhanced 16C550 Universal Asynchronous Receiver and
Transmitter (UART). Its features set is compatible to the XR16L2750 and XR16C2850 devices but offers Intel
or Motorola data bus interface and PowerSave to isolate the data bus interface during Sleep mode. Hence, the
2751 adds 4 more inputs: 16/68#, PwrSave, HDCNTl# and CLKSEL pins. Each UART is independently
controlled having its own set of device configuration registers. The configuration registers set is 16550 UART
compatible for control, status and data transfer. Additionally, each UART channel has 64-bytes of transmit and
receive FIFOs, automatic RTS/CTS hardware flow control with hysteresis control, automatic Xon/Xoff and
special character software flow control, programmable transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels, FIFO level
counters, infrared encoder and decoder (IrDA ver 1.0), programmable baud rate generator with a prescaler of
divide by 1 or 4. The XR16L2751 can operate from 2.25V to 5.5V with 5 volt tolerant inputs. The 2751 is
fabricated with an advanced CMOS process.
Enhanced Features
The 2751 DUART provides a solution that supports 64 bytes of transmit and receive FIFO memory, instead of
16 bytes in the ST16C2550, or one byte in the ST16C2450. The 2751 is designed to work with low supply
voltage and high performance data communication systems, that require fast data processing time. Increased
performance is realized in the 2751 by the larger transmit and receive FIFOs, FIFO trigger level control, FIFO
level counters and automatic flow control mechanism. This allows the external processor to handle more
networking tasks within a given time. For example, the ST16C2550 with a 16 byte FIFO, unloads 16 bytes of
receive data in 1.53 ms (This example uses a character length of 11 bits, including start/stop bits at 115.2
Kbps). This means the external CPU will have to service the receive FIFO at 1.53 ms intervals. However with
the 64 byte FIFO in the 2751, the data buffer will not require unloading/loading for 6.1 ms. This increases the
service interval giving the external CPU additional time for other applications and reducing the overall UART
interrupt servicing time. In addition, the programmable FIFO level trigger interrupt and automatic hardware/
software flow control is uniquely provided for maximum data throughput performance especially when
operating in a multi-channel system. The combination of the above greatly reduces the CPU’s bandwidth
requirement, increases performance, and reduces power consumption.
The 2751 supports a half-duplex output direction control signaling pin, RTS# A/B, to enable and disable the
external RS-485 transceiver operation. It automatically switches the logic state of the output pin to the receive
state after the last stop-bit of the last character has been shifted out of the transmitter. After receiving, the logic
state of the output pin switches back to the transmit state when a data byte is loaded in the transmitter. The

auto RS-485 direction control pin is not activated after reset. To activate the direction control function, user has
to set FCTR[3] = 1. This pin is normally high for receive state, low for transmit state.
Data Bus Interface, Intel or Motorola Type
The 2751 provides a single host interface for the 2 UARTs and supports Intel or Motorola microprocessor
(CPU) data bus interface. The Intel bus compatible interface allows direct interconnect to Intel compatible type
of CPUs using IOR#, IOW# and CSA# or CSB# inputs for data bus operation. The Motorola bus compatible
interface instead uses the R/W#, CS# and A3 signals for data bus transactions. Few data bus interface signals
change their functions depending on user’s selection, see pin description for details. The Intel and Motorola
bus interface selection is made through the pin, 16/68#, pin 24.
Data Rate
Each channel in the 2751 is capable of operation up to 3.125 Mbps at 5V, 2 Mbps at 3.3V and 1 Mbps at 2.5V
supply with 16X internal sampling clock rate, and 6.25 Mbps at 5V, 4 Mbps at 3.3V and 2 Mbps at 2.5V with 8X
sampling clock rate. The device can operate with an external 24 MHz crystal on pins XTAL1 and XTAL2, or
external clock source of up to 50 MHz on XTAL1 pin. With a typical crystal of 14.7456 MHz and through a
software option, the user can set the prescaler bit for data rates of up to 1.84 Mbps.
Internal Enhanced Register Sets
Each UART has a set of enhanced registers providing control and monitoring functions for interrupt enable/
disable and status, FIFO enable/disable, programmable TX and RX FIFO trigger level, TX and RX FIFO level
counters, automatic hardware/software flow control enable/disable with selectable hysteresis, automatic RS-
485 half-duplex direction control output enable/disable, programmable baud rates, infrared encoder/decoder
enable/disable, modem interface controls and status, and sleep mode are all standard features. Following a
power on reset or an external reset (and operating in 16 or Intel Mode), the registers defaults to the reset
condition and its is compatible with previous generation of UARTs, 16C450, 16C550, 16C650A and 16C850.

 2.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
 2.1     CPU Interface
The CPU interface is 8 data bits wide with 3 address lines and control signals to execute data bus read and
write transactions. The 2751 data interface supports the Intel compatible types of CPUs and it is compatible to
the industry standard 16C550 UART. No clock (oscillator nor external clock) is required to operate a data bus
transaction. Each bus cycle is asynchronous using CSA/B#, IOR# and IOW# or CS#, R/W# and A3 inputs.
Both UART channels share the same data bus for host operations. A typical data bus interconnection for Intel
and Motorola mode is shown in Figure 3.

REV. 1.2.3                                   2.25V TO 5.5V DUART WITH 64-BYTE FIFO AND POWERSAVE
 2.2     5-Volt Tolerant Inputs
The 2751 can accept up to 5V inputs when operating at 3.3V or 2.5V. But note that if the 2751 is operating at
2.5V, its VOH may not be high enough to meet the requirements of the VIH of a CPU or a serial transceiver that
is operating at 5V. Caution: XTAL1 is not 5 volt tolerant.
 2.3     Device Hardware Reset
The RESET or RESET# input resets the internal registers and the serial interface outputs in both channels to
their default state (see Table 17). An active pulse of longer than 40 ns duration will be required to activate the
reset function in the device.
 2.4     Device Identification and Revision
The XR16L2751 provides a Device Identification code and a Device Revision code to distinguish the part from
other devices and revisions. To read the identification code from the part, it is required to set the baud rate
generator registers DLL and DLM both to 0x00. Now reading the content of the DLM will provide 0x0A for the
XR16L2751 and reading the content of DLL will provide the revision of the part; for example, a reading of 0x01
means revision A.
 2.5     Channel A and B Selection
The UART provides the user with the capability to bi-directionally transfer information between an external
CPU and an external serial communication device. During Intel Bus Mode (16/68# pin connected to VCC), a
logic 0 on chip select pins, CSA# or CSB#, allows the user to select UART channel A or B to configure, send
transmit data and/or unload receive data to/from the UART. Selecting both UARTs can be useful during power
up initialization to write to the same internal registers, but do not attempt to read from both UARTs
simultaneously. Individual channel select functions are shown in Table 1.

During Motorola Bus Mode (16/68# pin connected to GND), the package interface pins are configured for
connection with Motorola, and other popular microprocessor bus types. In this mode the 2751 decodes an
additional address, A3, to select one of the UART ports. The A3 address decode function is used only when in
the Motorola Bus Mode. See Table 2.

 2.6     Channel A and B Internal Registers
Each UART channel in the 2751 has a set of enhanced registers for control, monitoring and data loading and
unloading. The configuration register set is compatible to those already available in the standard single
16C550 and dual ST16C2550. These registers function as data holding registers (THR/RHR), interrupt status
and control registers (ISR/IER), a FIFO control register (FCR), receive line status and control registers, (LSR/
LCR), modem status and control registers (MSR/MCR), programmable data rate (clock) divisor registers (DLL/
DLM), and an user accessible Scratchpad register (SPR).

Beyond the general 16C2550 features and capabilities, the 2751 offers enhanced feature registers (EFR, Xon/
Xoff 1, Xon/Xoff 2, FCTR, TRG, EMSR, FC) that provide automatic RTS and CTS hardware flow control, Xon/
Xoff software flow control, automatic RS-485 half-duplex direction output enable/disable, FIFO trigger level
control and FIFO level counters. All the register functions are discussed in full detail later in “Section 3.0,
UART INTERNAL REGISTERS” on page 22.
 2.7       DMA Mode
The device does not support direct memory access. The DMA Mode (a legacy term) in this document doesn’t
mean “direct memory access” but refers to data block transfer operation. The DMA mode affects the state of
the RXRDY# A/B and TXRDY# A/B output pins. The transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels provide additional
flexibility to the user for block mode operation. The LSR bits 5-6 provide an indication when the transmitter is
empty or has an empty location(s) for more data. The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive
FIFO in the DMA mode (FCR bit-3 = 1). When the transmit and receive FIFO are enabled and the DMA mode
is disabled (FCR bit-3 = 0), the 2751 is placed in single-character mode for data transmit or receive operation.
When DMA mode is enabled (FCR bit-3 = 1), the user takes advantage of block mode operation by loading or
unloading the FIFO in a block sequence determined by the programmed trigger level. In this mode, the 2751
sets the TXRDY# pin when the transmit FIFO becomes full, and sets the RXRDY# pin when the receive FIFO
becomes empty. The following table shows their behavior. Also see Figures 20 through 25.
                         TABLE 3: TXRDY# AND RXRDY# OUTPUTS IN FIFO AND DMA MODE

 2.9     Crystal Oscillator or External Clock Input
The 2751 includes an on-chip oscillator (XTAL1 and XTAL2) to produce a clock for both UART sections in the
device. The CPU data bus does not require this clock for bus operation. The crystal oscillator provides a
system clock to the Baud Rate Generators (BRG) section found in each of the UART. XTAL1 is the input to the
oscillator or external clock buffer input with XTAL2 pin being the output. Please note that the input XTAL1 is not
5V tolerant and so the maximum voltage at the pin should be VCC. For programming details, see
“Programmable Baud Rate Generator.”

The on-chip oscillator is designed to use an industry standard microprocessor crystal (parallel resonant,
fundamental frequency with 10-22 pF capacitance load, ESR of 20-120 ohms and 100ppm frequency
tolerance) connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 5). The programmable Baud
Rate Generator is capable of operating with a crystal oscillator frequency of up to 24 MHz. However, with an
external clock input on XTAL1 pin and a 2K ohms pull-up resistor on XTAL2 pin (as shown in Figure 5) it can
extend its operation up to 50 MHz (6.25 Mbps serial data rate) at 5V with an 8X sampling rate.

 2.10      Programmable Baud Rate Generator
Each UART has its own Baud Rate Generator (BRG) with a prescaler. The prescaler is controlled by CLKSEL
hardware pin or a software bit in the MCR register. The MCR register bit-7 sets the prescaler to divide the input
crystal or external clock by 1 or 4 and can override the CLKSEL pin following reset. The clock output of the
prescaler goes to the BRG. The BRG further divides this clock by a programmable divisor between 1 and (216 -
1) to obtain a 16X sampling rate clock of the serial data rate. The sampling rate clock is used by the transmitter
for data bit shifting and receiver for data sampling. The BRG divisor defaults to the maximum baud rate (DLL =
0x01 and DLM = 0x00) upon power up.

Programming the Baud Rate Generator Registers DLM and DLL provides the capability of selecting the
operating data rate. Table 6 shows the standard data rates available with a 14.7456 MHz crystal or external
clock at 16X sampling rate clock rate. A 16X sampling clock is typically used. However, user can select the 8X

 2.11    Transmitter
The transmitter section comprises of an 8-bit Transmit Shift Register (TSR) and 64 bytes of FIFO which
includes a byte-wide Transmit Holding Register (THR). TSR shifts out every data bit with the 16X/8X internal
clock. A bit time is 16 (8) clock periods (see EMSR bit-7). The transmitter sends the start-bit followed by the
number of data bits, inserts the proper parity-bit if enabled, and adds the stop-bit(s). The status of the FIFO and
TSR are reported in the Line Status Register (LSR bit-5 and bit-6).
  2.11.1    Transmit Holding Register (THR) - Write Only
The transmit holding register is an 8-bit register providing a data interface to the host processor. The host
writes transmit data byte to the THR to be converted into a serial data stream including start-bit, data bits,
parity-bit and stop-bit(s). The least-significant-bit (Bit-0) becomes first data bit to go out. The THR is the input
register to the transmit FIFO of 64 bytes when FIFO operation is enabled by FCR bit-0. Every time a write
operation is made to the THR, the FIFO data pointer is automatically bumped to the next sequential data
location.
  2.11.2    Transmitter Operation in non-FIFO Mode
The host loads transmit data to THR one character at a time. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set when the
data byte is transferred to TSR. THR flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when it is enabled
by IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR becomes completely empty.

  2.11.3    Transmitter Operation in FIFO Mode
The host may fill the transmit FIFO with up to 64 bytes of transmit data. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set
whenever the FIFO is empty. The THR empty flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when the
amount of data in the FIFO falls below its programmed trigger level. The transmit empty interrupt is enabled by
IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR/FIFO becomes empty.

 2.12     RECEIVER
The receiver section contains an 8-bit Receive Shift Register (RSR) and 64 bytes of FIFO which includes a
byte-wide Receive Holding Register (RHR). The RSR uses the 16X/8X clock (EMSR bit-7) for timing. It verifies
and validates every bit on the incoming character in the middle of each data bit. On the falling edge of a start or
false start bit, an internal receiver counter starts counting at the 16X/8X clock rate. After 8 clocks (or 4 if 8X) the
start bit period should be at the center of the start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled and if it is still a logic
0 it is validated. Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false character.
The rest of the data bits and stop bits are sampled and validated in this same manner to prevent false framing.
If there were any error(s), they are reported in the LSR register bits 2-4. Upon unloading the receive data byte
from RHR, the receive FIFO pointer is bumped and the error tags are immediately updated to reflect the status
of the data byte in RHR register. RHR can generate a receive data ready interrupt upon receiving a character
or delay until it reaches the FIFO trigger level. Furthermore, data delivery to the host is guaranteed by a
receive data ready time-out interrupt when data is not received for 4 word lengths as defined by LCR[1:0] plus
12 bits time. This is equivalent to 3.7-4.6 character times. The RHR interrupt is enabled by IER bit-0.
  2.12.1     Receive Holding Register (RHR) - Read-Only
The Receive Holding Register is an 8-bit register that holds a receive data byte from the Receive Shift
Register. It provides the receive data interface to the host processor. The RHR register is part of the receive
FIFO of 64 bytes by 11-bits wide, the 3 extra bits are for the 3 error tags to be reported in LSR register. When
the FIFO is enabled by FCR bit-0, the RHR contains the first data character received by the FIFO. After the
RHR is read, the next character byte is loaded into the RHR and the errors associated with the current data
byte are immediately updated in the LSR bits 2-4.

output is used to request remote unit to suspend/resume data transmission. The auto RTS flow control
features is enabled to fit specific application requirement (see Figure 11):
• Enable auto RTS flow control using EFR bit-6.
• The auto RTS function must be started by asserting RTS# output pin (MCR bit-1 to logic 1 after it is enabled).
If using the Auto RTS interrupt:
• Enable RTS interrupt through IER bit-6 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the
   RTS# pin makes a transition from low to high: ISR bit-5 will be set to logic 1.
 2.14     Auto RTS Hysteresis
The 2751 has a new feature that provides flow control trigger hysteresis while maintaining compatibility with
the XR16C850, ST16C650A and ST16C550 family of UARTs. With the Auto RTS function enabled, an interrupt
is generated when the receive FIFO reaches the programmed RX trigger level. The RTS# pin will not be forced
HIGH (RTS off) until the receive FIFO reaches the upper limit of the hysteresis level. The RTS# pin will return
LOW after the RX FIFO is unloaded to the lower limit of the hysteresis level. Under the above described
conditions, the 2751 will continue to accept data until the receive FIFO gets full. The Auto RTS function is
initiated when the RTS# output pin is asserted LOW (RTS On). Table 14 shows the complete details for the
Auto RTS# Hysteresis levels. Please note that this table is for programmable trigger levels only (Table D). The
hysteresis values for Tables A-C are the next higher and next lower trigger levels in the corresponding table.
 2.15     Auto CTS Flow Control
Automatic CTS flow control is used to prevent data overrun to the remote receiver FIFO. The CTS# input is
monitored to suspend/restart the local transmitter. The auto CTS flow control feature is selected to fit specific
application requirement (see Figure 11):
• Enable auto CTS flow control using EFR bit-7.
If using the Auto CTS interrupt:
• Enable CTS interrupt through IER bit-7 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the
   CTS# pin is de-asserted (HIGH): ISR bit-5 will be set to 1, and UART will suspend transmission as soon as
   the stop bit of the character in process is shifted out. Transmission is resumed after the CTS# input is re-
   asserted (LOW), indicating more data may be sent.

  The local UART (UARTA) starts data transfer by asserting RTSA# (1). RTSA# is normally connected to CTSB# (2) of
  remote UART (UARTB). CTSB# allows its transmitter to send data (3). TXB data arrives and fills UARTA receive FIFO
  (4). When RXA data fills up to its receive FIFO trigger level, UARTA activates its RXA data ready interrupt (5) and con-
  tinues to receive and put data into its FIFO. If interrupt service latency is long and data is not being unloaded, UARTA
  monitors its receive data fill level to match the upper threshold of RTS delay and de-assert RTSA# (6). CTSB# follows
  (7) and request UARTB transmitter to suspend data transfer. UARTB stops or finishes sending the data bits in its trans-
  mit shift register (8). When receive FIFO data in UARTA is unloaded to match the lower threshold of RTS delay (9),
  UARTA re-asserts RTSA# (10), CTSB# recognizes the change (11) and restarts its transmitter and data flow again until
  next receive FIFO trigger (12). This same event applies to the reverse direction when UARTA sends data to UARTB
  with RTSB# and CTSA# controlling the data flow.

 2.16     Auto Xon/Xoff (Software) Flow Control
When software flow control is enabled (See Table 16), the 2751 compares one or two sequential receive data
characters with the programmed Xon or Xoff-1,2 character value(s). If receive character(s) (RX) match the
programmed values, the 2751 will halt transmission (TX) as soon as the current character has completed
transmission. When a match occurs, the Xoff (if enabled via IER bit-5) flag will be set and the interrupt output
pin will be activated. Following a suspension due to a match of the Xoff character, the 2751 will monitor the
receive data stream for a match to the Xon-1,2 character. If a match is found, the 2751 will resume operation
and clear the flags (ISR bit-4).
Reset initially sets the contents of the Xon/Xoff 8-bit flow control registers to a logic 0. Following reset the user
can write any Xon/Xoff value desired for software flow control. Different conditions can be set to detect Xon/
Xoff characters (See Table 16) and suspend/resume transmissions. When double 8-bit Xon/Xoff characters
are selected, the 2751 compares two consecutive receive characters with two software flow control 8-bit
values (Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2) and controls TX transmissions accordingly. Under the above described flow
control mechanisms, flow control characters are not placed (stacked) in the user accessible RX data buffer or
FIFO.
In the event that the receive buffer is overfilling and flow control needs to be executed, the 2751 automatically
sends an Xoff message (when enabled) via the serial TX output to the remote modem. The 2751 sends the
Xoff-1,2 characters two-character-times (= time taken to send two characters at the programmed baud rate)
after the receive FIFO crosses the programmed trigger level (for all trigger tables A-D). To clear this condition,
the 2751 will transmit the programmed Xon-1,2 characters as soon as receive FIFO is less than one trigger
level below the programmed trigger level (for Trigger Tables A, B, and C) or when receive FIFO is less than the
trigger level minus the hysteresis value (for Trigger Table D). This hysteresis value is the same as the Auto
RTS Hysteresis value in Table 14. Table 7 below explains this when Trigger Table-B (See Table 11) is
selected.

* After the trigger level is reached, an xoff character is sent after a short span of time (= time required to send 2
 characters); for example, after 2.083ms has elapsed for 9600 baud and 8-bit word length, no parity and 1 stop bit
setting.
 2.17     Special Character Detect
A special character detect feature is provided to detect an 8-bit character when bit-5 is set in the Enhanced
Feature Register (EFR). When this character (Xoff2) is detected, it will be placed in the FIFO along with normal
incoming RX data.
The 2751 compares each incoming receive character with Xoff-2 data. If a match exists, the received data will
be transferred to FIFO and ISR bit-4 will be set to indicate detection of special character. Although the Internal
Register Table shows Xon, Xoff Registers with eight bits of character information, the actual number of bits is
dependent on the programmed word length. Line Control Register (LCR) bits 0-1 defines the number of
character bits, i.e., either 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits, or 8 bits. The word length selected by LCR bits 0-1 also
determines the number of bits that will be used for the special character comparison. Bit-0 in the Xon, Xoff
Registers corresponds with the LSB bit for the receive character.

2.18         Auto RS485 Half-duplex Control
The auto RS485 half-duplex direction control changes the behavior of the transmitter when enabled by FCTR
bit-3. By default, it de-asserts RTS# (HIGH) output following the last stop bit of the last character that has been
transmitted. This helps in turning around the transceiver to receive the remote station’s response. When the
host is ready to transmit next polling data packet again, it only has to load data bytes to the transmit FIFO. The
transmitter automatically re-asserts RTS# (LOW) output prior to sending the data. The RS485 half-duplex
direction control output can be inverted by enabling EMSR bit-3.
2.19         Infrared Mode
The 2751 UART includes the infrared encoder and decoder compatible to the IrDA (Infrared Data Association)
version 1.0. The IrDA 1.0 standard that stipulates the infrared encoder sends out a 3/16 of a bit wide HIGH-
pulse for each “0” bit in the transmit data stream. This signal encoding reduces the on-time of the infrared LED,
hence reduces the power consumption. See Figure 12 below.
The infrared encoder and decoder are enabled by setting MCR register bit-6 to a ‘1’. When the infrared feature
is enabled, the transmit data output, TX, idles at logic zero level. Likewise, the RX input assumes an idle level
of logic zero from a reset and power up, see Figure 12.
Typically, the wireless infrared decoder receives the input pulse from the infrared sensing diode on the RX pin.
Each time it senses a light pulse, it returns a logic 1 to the data bit stream. However, this is not true with some
infrared modules on the market which indicate a logic 0 by a light pulse. So the 2751 has a provision to invert
the input polarity to accommodate this. In this case user can enable FCTR bit-2 to invert the input signal.

 2.20      Sleep Mode with Wake-Up Indicator and PowerSave Feature
The 2751 supports low voltage system designs, hence, a sleep mode with auto wake-up and PowerSave
feature is included to reduce power consumption when the device is not actively used.
  2.20.1    Sleep Mode
All of these conditions must be satisfied for the 2751 to enter sleep mode:
      ■ no interrupts pending for both channels of the 2751 (ISR bit-0 = 1)
      ■ sleep mode of both channels are enabled (IER bit-4 = 1)
      ■ modem inputs are not toggling (MSR bits 0-3 = 0)
      ■ RX input pins are idling HIGH
The 2751 stops its crystal oscillator to conserve power in the sleep mode. User can check the XTAL2 pin for
no clock output as an indication that the device has entered the sleep mode.
The 2751 resumes normal operation by any of the following when PowerSave mode is disabled (pin 12 at
ground):
      ■ a receive data start bit transition (HIGH to LOW)
      ■ a data byte is loaded to the transmitter, THR or FIFO
      ■ a change of logic state on any of the modem or general purpose serial inputs: CTS#, DSR#, CD#, RI#
If the sleep mode is enabled and the 2751 is awakened by one of the conditions described above, an interrupt
is issued by the 2751 to signal to the CPU that it is awake. The lower nibble of the interrupt source register
(ISR) will read a value of 0x1 for this interrupt and reading the ISR clears this interrupt. Since the same value
(0x1) is also used to indicate no pending interrupt, users should exercise caution while using the sleep mode.
The 2751 will return to the sleep mode automatically after all interrupting conditions have been serviced and
cleared. If the 2751 is awakened by the modem inputs, a read to the MSR is required to reset the modem
inputs. In any case, the sleep mode will not be entered while an interrupt is pending from channel A or B. The
2751 will stay in the sleep mode of operation until it is disabled by setting IER bit-4 to a logic 0.
A word of caution: owing to the starting up delay of the crystal oscillator after waking up from sleep mode, the
first few receive characters may be lost. The number of characters lost during the restart also depends on your
operating data rate. More characters are lost when operating at higher data rate. Also, it is important to keep
RX A/B inputs idling HIGH or “marking” condition during sleep mode to avoid receiving a “break” condition
upon the restart. This may occur when the external interface transceivers (RS-232, RS-485 or another type)
are also put to sleep mode and cannot maintain the “marking” condition. To avoid this, the designer can use a
47k-100k ohm pull-up resistor on the RXA and RXB pins.
  2.20.2    PowerSave Feature
If the address lines, data bus lines, IOW#, IOR#, CSA#, CSB#, and modem input lines remain steady when the
2751 is in sleep mode, the maximum current will be in the microamp range as specified in the DC Electrical
Characteristics on page 40. If the input lines are floating or are toggling while the 2751 is in sleep mode, the
current can be up to 100 times more. If not using the PowerSave feature, then an external buffer would be
required to keep the address and data bus lines from toggling or floating to achieve the low current. But if the
PowerSave feature is enabled (pin 12 connected to VCC), this will eliminate the need for an external buffer by
internally isolating the address, data and control signals (see Figure 1 on page 1) from other bus activities that
could cause wasteful power drain. The 2751 enters PowerSave mode when pin 12 is connected to VCC and
the 2751 is in sleep mode (see Sleep Mode section above).
Since PowerSave mode isolates the address, data and control signals, the device will wake-up by:
      ■ a receive data start bit transition (HIGH to LOW)
      ■ a change of logic state on any of the modem or general purpose serial inputs: CTS#, DSR#, CD#, RI#
The 2751 will return to the PowerSave mode automatically after a read to the MSR (to reset the modem inputs)
and all interrupting conditions have been serviced and cleared. The 2751 will stay in the PowerSave mode of
operation until it is disabled by setting IER bit-4 to a logic 0 and/or the PowerSave pin is connected to GND.

2.21         Internal Loopback
The 2751 UART provides an internal loopback capability for system diagnostic purposes. The internal
loopback mode is enabled by setting MCR register bit-4 to logic 1. All regular UART functions operate normally.
Figure 13 shows how the modem port signals are re-configured. Transmit data from the transmit shift register
output is internally routed to the receive shift register input allowing the system to receive the same data that it
was sending. The TX, RTS# and DTR# pins are held HIGH or mark condition while the CTS#, DSR# CD# and
RI# inputs are ignored. Caution: the RX input pins must be held to a logic 1 during loopback test else upon
exiting the loopback test the UART may detect and report a false “break” signal. Also, Auto RTS/CTS hardware
flow control is not supported during internal loopback.

SEE”TRANSMITTER” ON PAGE 13.
 4.3      Interrupt Enable Register (IER) - Read/Write
The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receive data ready, transmit empty, line status
and modem status registers. These interrupts are reported in the Interrupt Status Register (ISR).
 4.3.1       IER versus Receive FIFO Interrupt Mode Operation
When the receive FIFO (FCR BIT-0 = 1) and receive interrupts (IER BIT-0 = 1) are enabled, the RHR interrupts
(see ISR bits 2 and 3) status will reflect the following:
A. The receive data available interrupts are issued to the host when the FIFO has reached the programmed
     trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.

B. FIFO level will be reflected in the ISR register when the FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register
     status bit and the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
C. The receive data ready bit (LSR BIT-0) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift register to
     the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
  4.3.2     IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO Polled Mode Operation
When FCR BIT-0 equals a logic 1 for FIFO enable; resetting IER bits 0-3 enables the XR16L2751 in the FIFO
polled mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR either or both can
be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
A. LSR BIT-0 indicates there is data in RHR or RX FIFO.
B. LSR BIT-1 indicates an overrun error has occurred and that data in the FIFO may not be valid.
C. LSR BIT 2-4 provides the type of receive data errors encountered for the data byte in RHR, if any.
D. LSR BIT-5 indicates THR is empty.
E. LSR BIT-6 indicates when both the transmit FIFO and TSR are empty.
F. LSR BIT-7 indicates a data error in at least one character in the RX FIFO.
IER[0]: RHR Interrupt Enable
The receive data ready interrupt will be issued when RHR has a data character in the non-FIFO mode or when
the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level in the FIFO mode.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receive data ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver data ready interrupt.
IER[1]: THR Interrupt Enable
This bit enables the Transmit Ready interrupt which is issued whenever the THR becomes empty in the non-
FIFO mode or when data in the FIFO falls below the programmed trigger level in the FIFO mode. If the THR is
empty when this bit is enabled, an interrupt will be generated.
• Logic 0 = Disable Transmit Ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Transmit Ready interrupt.
IER[2]: Receive Line Status Interrupt Enable
If any of the LSR register bits 1, 2, 3 or 4 is a logic 1, it will generate an interrupt to inform the host controller
about the error status of the current data byte in FIFO. LSR bit-1 generates an interrupt immediately when the
character has been received. LSR bits 2-4 generate an interrupt when the character with errors is read out of
the FIFO (default). Instead, LSR bits 2-4 can be programmed to generate an interrupt immediately, by setting
EMSR bit-6 to a logic 1.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receiver line status interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver line status interrupt.
IER[3]: Modem Status Interrupt Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable the modem status register interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the modem status register interrupt.
IER[4]: Sleep Mode Enable (requires EFR bit-4 = 1)
• Logic 0 = Disable Sleep Mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Sleep Mode. See Sleep Mode section for further details.
IER[5]: Xoff Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the software flow control, receive Xoff interrupt. (default)
• Logic 1 = Enable the software flow control, receive Xoff interrupt. See Software Flow Control section for
   details.

IER[6]: RTS# Output Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the RTS# interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the RTS# interrupt. The UART issues an interrupt when the RTS# pin makes a transition
  from low to high.
IER[7]: CTS# Input Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the CTS# interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the CTS# interrupt. The UART issues an interrupt when CTS# pin makes a transition from
  low to high.
 4.4     Interrupt Status Register (ISR) - Read-Only
The UART provides multiple levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external software interaction. The
Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with six interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the
ISR will give the user the current highest pending interrupt level to be serviced, others are queued up to be
serviced next. No other interrupts are acknowledged until the pending interrupt is serviced. The Interrupt
Source Table, Table 10, shows the data values (bit 0-5) for the interrupt priority levels and the interrupt sources
associated with each of these interrupt levels.
 4.4.1      Interrupt Generation:
• LSR is by any of the LSR bits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
• RXRDY is by RX trigger level.
• RXRDY Time-out is by a 4-char plus 12 bits delay timer.
• TXRDY is by TX trigger level or TX FIFO empty (or transmitter empty in auto RS-485 control).
• MSR is by any of the MSR bits 0, 1, 2 and 3.
• Receive Xoff/Special character is by detection of a Xoff or Special character.
• CTS# is when its transmitter toggles the input pin (from LOW to HIGH) during auto CTS flow control.
• RTS# is when its receiver toggles the output pin (from LOW to HIGH) during auto RTS flow control.
• Wake-up Indicator is when the UART comes out of sleep mode.
 4.4.2      Interrupt Clearing:
• LSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the LSR register.
• RXRDY interrupt is cleared by reading data until FIFO falls below the trigger level.
• RXRDY Time-out interrupt is cleared by reading RHR.
• TXRDY interrupt is cleared by a read to the ISR register or writing to THR.
• MSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the MSR register.
• Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR or when Xon character(s) is received.
• Special character interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR or after the next character is received.
• RTS# and CTS# flow control interrupts are cleared by a read to the MSR register.
• Wake-up Indicator is cleared by a read to the ISR register.

ISR[0]: Interrupt Status
• Logic 0 = An interrupt is pending and the ISR contents may be used as a pointer to the appropriate interrupt
   service routine.
• Logic 1 = No interrupt pending (default condition) or the device has come out of sleep mode.
ISR[3:1]: Interrupt Status
These bits indicate the source for a pending interrupt at interrupt priority levels (See Interrupt Source
Table 10).
ISR[5:4]: Interrupt Status
These bits are enabled when EFR bit-4 is set to a logic 1. ISR bit-4 indicates that the receiver detected a data
match of the Xoff character(s). Note that once set to a logic 1, the ISR bit-4 will stay a logic 1 until a Xon
character is received. ISR bit-5 indicates that CTS# or RTS# has changed state.
ISR[7:6]: FIFO Enable Status
These bits are set to a logic 0 when the FIFOs are disabled. They are set to a logic 1 when the FIFOs are
enabled.
  4.5     FIFO Control Register (FCR) - Write-Only
This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the transmit/receive FIFO trigger levels, and
select the DMA mode. The DMA, and FIFO modes are defined as follows:
FCR[0]: TX and RX FIFO Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable the transmit and receive FIFO (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the transmit and receive FIFOs. This bit must be set to logic 1 when other FCR bits are
   written or they will not be programmed.
FCR[1]: RX FIFO Reset
This bit is only active when FCR bit-0 is a ‘1’.
• Logic 0 = No receive FIFO reset (default)
• Logic 1 = Reset the receive FIFO pointers and FIFO level counter logic (the receive shift register is not
   cleared or altered). This bit will return to a logic 0 after resetting the FIFO.
FCR[2]: TX FIFO Reset
This bit is only active when FCR bit-0 is a ‘1’.
Logic 0 = No transmit FIFO reset (default).

Controls the behavior of the TXRDY# and RXRDY# pins. See DMA operation section for details.
• Logic 0 = Normal Operation (default).
• Logic 1 = DMA Mode.
FCR[5:4]: Transmit FIFO Trigger Select
(logic 0 = default, TX trigger level = one)
These 2 bits set the trigger level for the transmit FIFO. The UART will issue a transmit interrupt when the
number of characters in the FIFO falls below the selected trigger level, or when it gets empty in case that the
FIFO did not get filled over the trigger level on last re-load. Table 11 below shows the selections. EFR bit-4
must be set to ‘1’ before these bits can be accessed.Note that the receiver and the transmitter cannot use
different trigger tables. Whichever selection is made last applies to both the RX and TX side.
FCR[7:6]: Receive FIFO Trigger Select
(logic 0 = default, RX trigger level =1)
The FCTR Bits 5-4 are associated with these 2 bits. These 2 bits are used to set the trigger level for the receive
FIFO. The UART will issue a receive interrupt when the number of the characters in the FIFO crosses the
trigger level. Table 11 shows the complete selections. Note that the receiver and the transmitter cannot use
different trigger tables. Whichever selection is made last applies to both the RX and TX side.

LCR[3]: TX and RX Parity Select
Parity or no parity can be selected via this bit. The parity bit is a simple way used in communications for data
integrity check. See Table 12 for parity selection summary below.
• Logic 0 = No parity.
• Logic 1 = A parity bit is generated during the transmission while the receiver checks for parity error of the
   data character received.
LCR[4]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled with LCR bit-3 set to a logic 1, LCR BIT-4 selects the even or odd parity format.
• Logic 0 = ODD Parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format (default).
• Logic 1 = EVEN Parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format.
LCR[5]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled, LCR BIT-5 selects the forced parity format.
• LCR BIT-5 = logic 0, parity is not forced (default).
• LCR BIT-5 = logic 1 and LCR BIT-4 = logic 0, parity bit is forced to a logical 1 for the transmit and receive
   data.
• LCR BIT-5 = logic 1 and LCR BIT-4 = logic 1, parity bit is forced to a logical 0 for the transmit and receive
   data.

LCR[6]: Transmit Break Enable
When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a
“space", LOW state). This condition remains, until disabled by setting LCR bit-6 to a logic 0.
• Logic 0 = No TX break condition. (default)
• Logic 1 = Forces the transmitter output (TX) to a “space”, LOW, for alerting the remote receiver of a line
  break condition.
LCR[7]: Baud Rate Divisors Enable
Baud rate generator divisor (DLL/DLM) enable.
• Logic 0 = Data registers are selected. (default)
• Logic 1 = Divisor latch registers are selected.
 4.7     Modem Control Register (MCR) or General Purpose Outputs Control - Read/Write
The MCR register is used for controlling the serial/modem interface signals or general purpose inputs/outputs.
MCR[0]: DTR# Output
The DTR# pin is a modem control output. If the modem interface is not used, this output may be used as a
general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force DTR# output HIGH (default).
• Logic 1 = Force DTR# output LOW.
MCR[1]: RTS# Output
The RTS# pin is a modem control output and may be used for automatic hardware flow control by enabled by
EFR bit-6 or auto RS-485 half-duplex direction control output enabled by FCTR bit-3. If the modem interface is
not used, this output may be used as a general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force RTS# output HIGH (default).
• Logic 1 = Force RTS# output LOW.
MCR[2]: Reserved
OP1# is not available as an output pin on the 2751. But it is available for use during Internal Loopback Mode.
In the Loopback Mode, this bit is used to write the state of the modem RI# interface signal.
MCR[3]: OP2# Output / INT Output Enable
This bit enables and disables the operation of INT/IRQ#, interrupt output. If INT/IRQ# output is not used, OP2#
can be used as a general purpose output. Also, if 16/68# pin selects Motorola bus interface mode, this bit must
be set to logic 0.
• Logic 0 = INT (A-B) outputs disabled (three state mode) and OP2# output set HIGH (default).
• Logic 1 = INT (A-B) outputs enabled (active mode) and OP2# output set LOW.
MCR[4]: Internal Loopback Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable loopback mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable local loopback mode, see loopback section and Figure 13.
MCR[5]: Xon-Any Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable Xon-Any function (for 16C550 compatibility, default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Xon-Any function. In this mode, any RX character received will resume transmit operation.
  The RX character will be loaded into the RX FIFO, unless the RX character is an Xon or Xoff character and
  the 2751 is programmed to use the Xon/Xoff flow control.

MCR[6]: Infrared Encoder/Decoder Enable
• Logic 0 = Enable the standard modem receive and transmit input/output interface. (Default)
• Logic 1 = Enable infrared IrDA receive and transmit inputs/outputs. The TX/RX output/input are routed to the
  infrared encoder/decoder. The data input and output levels conform to the IrDA infrared interface
  requirement. While in this mode, the infrared TX output will be a logic 0 during idle data conditions.
MCR[7]: BRG Clock Prescaler Select
The 2751 has a hardware pin (pin 25) to select this function upon power up or reset. After the power up or
reset, this register bit will have control and can alter the logic state.
• Logic 0 = Divide by one. The input clock from the crystal or external clock is fed directly to the Programmable
  Baud Rate Generator without further modification, i.e., divide by one (default).
• Logic 1 = Divide by four. The prescaler divides the input clock from the crystal or external clock by four and
  feeds it to the Programmable Baud Rate Generator, hence, data rates become one forth.
 4.8      Line Status Register (LSR) - Read Only
This register provides the status of data transfers between the UART and the host.
LSR[0]: Receive Data Ready Indicator
• Logic 0 = No data in receive holding register or FIFO (default).
• Logic 1 = Data has been received and is saved in the receive holding register or FIFO.
LSR[1]: Receiver Overrun Flag
• Logic 0 = No overrun error. (default)
• Logic 1 = Overrun error. A data overrun error condition occurred in the receive shift register. This happens
  when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In this case the previous data in the receive shift register
  is overwritten. Note that under this condition the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into
  the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.
LSR[2]: Receive Data Parity Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No parity error (default).
• Logic 1 = Parity error. The receive character in RHR does not have correct parity information and is suspect.
  This error is associated with the character available for reading in RHR.
LSR[3]: Receive Data Framing Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No framing error (default).
• Logic 1 = Framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). This error is associated with
  the character available for reading in RHR.
LSR[4]: Receive Break Flag
• Logic 0 = No break condition (default).
• Logic 1 = The receiver received a break signal (RX was LOW for at least one character frame time). In the
  FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded into the FIFO.
LSR[5]: Transmit Holding Register Empty Flag
This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when the last data byte
is transferred from the transmit holding register to the transmit shift register. The bit is reset to logic 0
concurrently with the data loading to the transmit holding register by the host. In the FIFO mode this bit is set
when the transmit FIFO is empty, it is cleared when the transmit FIFO contains at least 1 byte.

LSR[6]: THR and TSR Empty Flag
This bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmitter goes idle. It is set to logic 0 whenever either the THR or
TSR contains a data character. In the FIFO mode this bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmit FIFO and
transmit shift register are both empty.
LSR[7]: Receive FIFO Data Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No FIFO error (default).
• Logic 1 = A global indicator for the sum of all error bits in the RX FIFO. At least one parity error, framing error
   or break indication is in the FIFO data. This bit clears when there is no more error(s) in any of the bytes in the
   RX FIFO.
 4.9      Modem Status Register (MSR) - Read Only
This register provides the current state of the modem interface input signals. Lower four bits of this register are
used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a signal from the modem
changes state. These bits may be used for general purpose inputs when they are not used with modem
signals.
MSR[0]: Delta CTS# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CTS# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The CTS# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
   will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[1]: Delta DSR# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on DSR# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The DSR# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
   will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[2]: Delta RI# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on RI# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The RI# input has changed from LOW to HIGH, ending of the ringing signal. A modem status
   interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[3]: Delta CD# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CD# input (default).
• Logic 1 = Indicates that the CD# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem
   status interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[4]: CTS Input Status
CTS# pin may function as automatic hardware flow control signal input if it is enabled and selected by Auto
CTS (EFR bit-7). Auto CTS flow control allows starting and stopping of local data transmissions based on the
modem CTS# signal. A HIGH on the CTS# pin will stop UART transmitter as soon as the current character has
finished transmission, and a LOW will resume data transmission. Normally MSR bit-4 bit is the complement of
the CTS# input. However in the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the RTS# bit in the MCR register. The
CTS# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
MSR[5]: DSR Input Status
Normally this bit is the complement of the DSR# input. In the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the DTR#
bit in the MCR register. The DSR# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is
not used.
MSR[6]: RI Input Status
Normally this bit is the complement of the RI# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-2 in the
MCR register. The RI# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.

MSR[7]: CD Input Status
Normally this bit is the complement of the CD# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-3 in the
MCR register. The CD# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
 4.10   Scratchpad Register (SPR) - Read/Write
This is a 8-bit general purpose register for the user to store temporary data. The content of this register is
preserved during sleep mode but becomes 0xFF (default) after a reset or a power off-on cycle.
 4.11   Enhanced Mode Select Register (EMSR)
This register replaces SPR (during a Write) and is accessible only when FCTR[6] = 1.
EMSR[1:0]: Receive/Transmit FIFO Count (Write-Only)
When Scratchpad Swap (FCTR[6]) is asserted, EMSR bits 1-0 controls what mode the FIFO Level Counter is
operating in.

During Alternate RX/TX FIFO Counter Mode, the first value read after EMSR bits 1-0 have been asserted will
always be the RX FIFO Counter. The second value read will correspond with the TX FIFO Counter. The next
value will be the RX FIFO Counter again, then the TX FIFO Counter and so on and so forth.

EMSR[6]: LSR Interrupt Mode
• Logic 0 = LSR Interrupt Delayed (for 16C2550 compatibility, default). LSR bits 2, 3, and 4 will generate an
  interrupt when the character with the error is in the RHR.
• Logic 1 = LSR Interrupt Immediate. LSR bits 2, 3, and 4 will generate an interrupt as soon as the character is
  received into the FIFO.
EMSR[7]: 16X Sampling Rate Mode
Logic 0 = 8X Sampling Rate.
Logic 1 = 16X Sampling Rate (for 16C2550 compatibility, default).
 4.12    FIFO Level Register (FLVL) - Read-Only
The FIFO Level Register replaces the Scratchpad Register (during a Read) when FCTR[6] = 1. Note that this is
not identical to the FIFO Data Count Register which can be accessed when LCR = 0xBF.
FLVL[7:0]: FIFO Level Register
This register provides the FIFO counter level for the RX FIFO or the TX FIFO or both depending on EMSR[1:0].
See Table 13 for details.
 4.13    Baud Rate Generator Registers (DLL and DLM) - Read/Write
The concatenation of the contents of DLM and DLL gives the 16-bit divisor value which is used to calculate the
baud rate:
• Baud Rate = (Clock Frequency / 16) / Divisor
See MCR bit-7 and the baud rate table also.
 4.14    Device Identification Register (DVID) - Read Only
This register contains the device ID (0x0A for XR16L2751). Prior to reading this register, DLL and DLM should
be set to 0x00.

 4.15    Device Revision Register (DREV) - Read Only
This register contains the device revision information. For example, 0x01 means revision A. Prior to reading
this register, DLL and DLM should be set to 0x00.
 4.16    Trigger Level (TRG) - Write-Only
User Programmable Transmit/Receive Trigger Level Register.
TRG[7:0]: Trigger Level Register
These bits are used to program desired trigger levels when trigger Table-D is selected. FCTR bit-7 selects
between programming the RX Trigger Level (a logic 0) and the TX Trigger Level (a logic 1).
 4.17    FIFO Data Count Register (FC) - Read-Only
This register is accessible when LCR = 0xBF. Note that this register is not identical to the FIFO Level Count
Register which is located in the general register set when FCTR bit-6 = 1 (Scratchpad Register Swap). It is
suggested to read the FIFO Level Count Register at the Scratchpad Register location when FCTR bit-6 = 1.
See Table 13.
FC[7:0]: RX/TX FIFO Level Count
Receive/Transmit FIFO Level Count. Number of characters in Receiver FIFO (FCTR[7] = 0) or Transmitter
FIFO (FCTR[7] = 1) can be read via this register.
 4.18     Feature Control Register (FCTR) - Read/Write
This register controls the XR16L2751 new functions.
FCTR[1:0]: RTS Hysteresis
User selectable RTS# hysteresis levels for hardware flow control application. After reset, these bits are set to
“0”. See Table 14 for more details.
FCTR[2]: IrDa RX Inversion
• Logic 0 = Select RX input as encoded IrDa data (Idle state will be LOW).
• Logic 1 = Select RX input as inverted encoded IrDa data (Idle state will be HIGH).
FCTR[3]: Auto RS-485 Direction Control
The 2751 has hardware pin 37 to enable this auto RS-485 direction control function from power up, however,
pin 37 must be tied to VCC for this bit to gain control else auto RS-485 is always active.
• Logic 0 = Standard ST16C550 mode. Transmitter generates an interrupt when transmit holding register
  becomes empty and transmit shift register is shifting data out.
• Logic 1 = Enable Auto RS485 Direction Control function. The direction control signal, RTS# pin, changes its
  output logic state from LOW to HIGH one bit time after the last stop bit of the last character is shifted out.
  Also, the Transmit interrupt generation is delayed until the transmitter shift register becomes empty. The
  RTS# output pin will automatically return to a LOW when a data byte is loaded into the TX FIFO. However,
  RTS# behavior can be inverted by setting EMSR[3] = 1.

 4.19      Enhanced Feature Register (EFR)
Enhanced features are enabled or disabled using this register. Bit 0-3 provide single or dual consecutive
character software flow control selection (see Table 16). When the Xon1 and Xon2 and Xoff1 and Xoff2 modes
are selected, the double 8-bit words are concatenated into two sequential characters. Caution: note that
whenever changing the TX or RX flow control bits, always reset all bits back to logic 0 (disable) before
programming a new setting.
EFR[3:0]: Software Flow Control Select
Single character and dual sequential characters software flow control is supported. Combinations of software
flow control can be selected by programming these bits.

EFR[4]: Enhanced Function Bits Enable
Enhanced function control bit. This bit enables IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, FCR bits 4-5, and MCR bits 5-7 to be
modified. After modifying any enhanced bits, EFR bit-4 can be set to a logic 0 to latch the new values. This
feature prevents legacy software from altering or overwriting the enhanced functions once set. Normally, it is
recommended to leave it enabled, logic 1.
• Logic 0 = modification disable/latch enhanced features. IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, FCR bits 4-5, and MCR
  bits 5-7 are saved to retain the user settings. After a reset, the IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, FCR bits 4-5, and
  MCR bits 5-7 are set to a logic 0 to be compatible with ST16C550 mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enables the above-mentioned register bits to be modified by the user.
EFR[5]: Special Character Detect Enable
• Logic 0 = Special Character Detect Disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Special Character Detect Enabled. The UART compares each incoming receive character with
  data in Xoff-2 register. If a match exists, the receive data will be transferred to FIFO and ISR bit-4 will be set
  to indicate detection of the special character. Bit-0 corresponds with the LSB bit of the receive character. If
  flow control is set for comparing Xon1, Xoff1 (EFR [1:0]= ‘10’) then flow control and special character work
  normally. However, if flow control is set for comparing Xon2, Xoff2 (EFR[1:0]= ‘01’) then flow control works
  normally, but Xoff2 will not go to the FIFO, and will generate an Xoff interrupt and a special character
  interrupt, if enabled via IER bit-5.
EFR[6]: Auto RTS Flow Control Enable
RTS# output may be used for hardware flow control by setting EFR bit-6 to logic 1. When Auto RTS is
selected, an interrupt will be generated when the receive FIFO is filled to the programmed trigger level and
RTS de-asserts HIGH at the next upper trigger level. RTS# will return LOW when FIFO data falls below the
next lower trigger level. The RTS# output must be asserted (LOW) before the auto RTS can take effect. RTS#
pin will function as a general purpose output when hardware flow control is disabled.
• Logic 0 = Automatic RTS flow control is disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Automatic RTS flow control.
EFR[7]: Auto CTS Flow Control Enable
Automatic CTS Flow Control.
• Logic 0 = Automatic CTS flow control is disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Automatic CTS flow control. Data transmission stops when CTS# input de-asserts HIGH.
  Data transmission resumes when CTS# returns LOW.
 4.20     Software Flow Control Registers (XOFF1, XOFF2, XON1, XON2) - Read/Write
These registers are used as the programmable software flow control characters xoff1, xoff2, xon1, and xon2.

  IPWRSV     Powersave Current
Test 1: The following inputs must remain steady at VCC or GND state to minimize sleep current: A0-A2, D0-D7,
IOR#, IOW# (R/W#), CSA# (CS#), CSB# (A3) and all modem inputs. Also, RXA and RXB inputs must idle at
logic 1 state while asleep. Floating inputs may result in sleep currents in the mA range.

For PowerSave, the UART internally isolates all of these inputs (except the modem inputs) therefore
eliminating any unnecessary external buffers to keep the inputs steady. SEE”POWERSAVE FEATURE” ON
