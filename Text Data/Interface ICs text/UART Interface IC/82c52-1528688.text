 *Pb-free PDIPs can be used for through hole wave solder processing only. They are not intended for use in Reflow solder processing applications.
 NOTE: Pb-free plus anneal products employ special Pb-free material sets; molding compounds/die attach materials and 100% matte tin plate
 termination finish, which are RoHS compliant and compatible with both SnPb and Pb-free soldering operations. Pb-free products are MSL
 classified at Pb-free peak reflow temperatures that meet or exceed the Pb-free requirements of IPC/JEDEC J STD-020.

82C52
Pin Description
             PIN        ACTIVE
  SYMBOL     NO.   TYPE LEVEL                                               DESCRIPTION
     RD        1      I  Low   READ: The RD input causes the 82C52 to output data to the data bus (D0-D7). The data output
                               depends upon the state of the address inputs (A0-A1). CS0 enables the RD input.
     WR        2      I  Low   WRITE: The WR input causes data from the data bus (D0-D7) to be input to the 82C52. Addressing
                               and chip select action is the same as for read operations.
   D0-D7     3-10   I/O  High  DATA BITS 0-7: The Data Bus provides eight, three-state input/output lines for the transfer of data,
                               control and status information between the 82C52 and the CPU. For character formats of less than 8
                               bits, the corresponding D7, D6 and D5 are considered “don't cares” for data WRITE operations and
                               are 0 for data READ operations. These lines are normally in a high impedance state except during
                               read operations. D0 is the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and is the first serial data bit to be received or
                               transmitted.
   A0, A1   11, 12    I  High  ADDRESS INPUTS: The address lines select the various internal registers during CPU bus
                               operations.
   IX, OX   13, 14  I/O        CRYSTAL/CLOCK: Crystal connections for the internal Baud Rate Generator. IX can also be used
                               as an external clock input in which case OX should be left open.
    SDO       15     O   High  SERIAL DATA OUTPUT: Serial data output from the 82C52 transmitter circuitry. A Mark (1) is a logic
                               one (high) and Space (0) is logic zero (low). SD0 is held in the Mark condition when CTS is false,
                               when RST is true, when the Transmitter Register is empty, or when in the Loop Mode.
    GND       16         Low   GROUND: Power supply ground connection.
     CTS      17      I  Low   CLEAR TO SEND: The logical state of the CTS line is reflected in the CTS bit of the Modem Status
                               Register. Any change of state in CTS causes INTR to be set true when INTEN and MIEN are true. A
                               false level on CTS will inhibit transmission of data on the SD0 output and will hold SD0 in the Mark
                               (high) state. If CTS goes false during transmission, the current character being transmitted will be
                               completed. CTS does not affect Loop Mode operation.
    DSR       18      I  Low   DATA SET READY: The logical state of the DSR line is reflected in the Modem Status Register. Any
                               change of state of DSR will cause INTR to be set if INTEN and MIEN are true. The state of this signal
                               does not affect any other circuitry within the 82C52.
     DTR      19     O   Low   DATA TERMINAL READY: The DTR signal can be set (low) by writing a logic 1 to the appropriate bit
                               in the Modem Control Register (MCR). This signal is cleared (high) by writing a logic 0 in the DTR bit
                               in the MCR or whenever a reset (RST = high) is applied to the 82C52.
     RTS      20     O   Low   REQUEST TO SEND: The RTS signal can be set (low) by writing a logic 1 to the appropriate bit in
                               the MCR. This signal is cleared (high) by writing a logic 0 to the RTS bit in the MCR or whenever a
                               reset (RST = high) is applied to the 82C52.
     CO       21     O         CLOCK OUT: This output is user programmable to provide either a buffered IX output or a buffered
                               Baud Rate Generator (16X) clock output. The buffered IX (Crystal or external clock source) output is
                               provided when the Baud Rate Select Register (BRSR) bit 7 is set to a zero. Writing a logic one to
                               BRSR bit 7 causes the CO output to provide a buffered version of the internal Baud Rate Generator
                               clock which operates at sixteen times the programmed baud rate. On reset D7 (CO select) is reset to
                               0.
   TBRE       22     O   High  TRANSMITTER BUFFER REGISTER EMPTY: The TBRE output is set (high) whenever the
                               Transmitter Buffer Register (TBR) has transferred its data to the Transmit Register. Application of a
                               reset (RST) to the 82C52 will also set the TBRE output. TBRE is cleared (low) whenever data is
                               written to the TBR.
     RST      23      I  High  RESET: The RST input forces the 82C52 into an “Idle” mode in which all serial data activities are
                               suspended. The Modem Control Register (MCR) along with its associated outputs are cleared. The
                               UART Status Register (USR) is cleared except for the TBRE and TC bits, which are set. The 82C52
                               remains in an “Idle” state until programmed to resume serial data activities. The RST input is a
                               Schmitt triggered input.
    INTR      24     O   High  INTERRUPT REQUEST: The INTR output is enabled by the INTEN bit in the Modem Control
                               Register (MCR). The MIEN bit selectively enables modem status changes to provide an input to the
                               INTR logic. Figure 9 in Design Information shows the overall relationship of these interrupt control
                               signals.

    SDI      25    I      High  SERIAL DATA INPUT: Serial data input to the 82C52 receiver circuits. A Mark (1) is high, and a
                                Space (0) is low. Data inputs on SDI are disabled when operating in the loop mode or when RST is
                                true.
    DR       26   O       High  DATA READY: A true level indicates that a character has been received, transferred to the RBR, and
                                is ready for transfer to the CPU. DR is reset on a data READ of the Receiver Buffer Register (RBR)
                                or when RST is true.
    VCC      27           High  VCC: +5V positive power supply pin. A 0.1F decoupling capacitor from VCC (Pin 27) to GND (Pin
                                16) is recommended.
    CS0      28    I      Low   CHIP SELECT: The chip select input acts as an enable signal for the RD and WR input signals.

NOTES:
 1. Prescaler rate of divide by 1, Divisor Select rate of “external” (divide by 1). The Baud Rate Clock (CO-BRG) operates at 16 times the user
      programmed bit rate. For example, at 1200 baud: TCY = 1/(16 x 1200) = 52.1s.
 2. A.      With TR (Transmitter Register) initially empty, TDTX occurs from the 5th falling edge of CO(BRG) after WR goes high.
      B. With TR initially full, TDTX occurs from the trailing edge of the 16th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit provided WR went high by the trailing edge
            of the 12th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit.
      C. With CTS high (disable transmit) and TBR full, TDTX occurs from the 5th falling edge of CO(BRG) after CTS goes low.
 3. TBRE bit D6 in USR is updated each time TBRE changes state.
 4. A.      With TR initially empty, TCLTH(TBRE) occurs from the 4th falling edge of CO(BRG) after WR goes high.
      B. With TR initially full, TCLTH(TBRE) occurs from the trailing edge of the 15th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit provided WR went high by the
            trailing edge of the 12th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit.
      C. With CTS high (disable transmit) and TBR full, TCLTH(TBRE) occurs from the 4th falling edge of CO(BRG) after CTS goes low.
 5. A.      INT on TC: INTEN enabled; USR bit D5(TC) is updated at this time regardless of interrupt configuration.
            - INT on TC occurs from the trailing edge of the 11th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit if TBR empty at that time.
      B. INTR on receive flags OE, FE, PE, and RBRK: INTEN enabled; Respective USR bits updated at this time regardless of interrupt configura-
            tion.
            - INT on OE, FE, PE, RBRK occurs from the trailing edge of the 11th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit. To avoid OE, RD(RBR) must go low by
                the trailing edge of the 8th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit.
      C. INTR on MS: INTEN and MIEN enabled; USR bit D4(MS) is updated at this time regardless of INTEN/MIEN.
            - INTR on MS occurs whenever CTS or DSR input changes state.
 6. TCTHX is time before end of last Stop bit by which CTS must be inactive (high) to prevent transmission of the character waiting in TBR.
 7. DR bit D7 in USR is updated each time DR changes state. TDRH always from trailing edge of 11th CO(BRG) in last Stop bit.

NOTES:
 1. TBRE bit D6 in USR is updated each time TBRE changes state.
 2. A.  With TR initially empty, TCLTH(TBRE) occurs from the 4th falling edge of CO(BRG) after WR goes high.
     B. With TR initially full, TCLTH(TBRE) occurs from the trailing edge of the 15th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit provided WR went high by the
        trailing edge of the 12th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit.
 3. A.  With TR (Transmitter Register) initially empty, TDTX occurs from the 5th falling edge of CO(BRG) after WR goes high.
     B. With TR initially full, TDTX occurs from the trailing edge of the 16th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit provided WR went high by the trailing edge
        of the 12th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit.
 4. TCTHX is time before end of last Stop bit by which CTS must be inactive (high) to prevent transmission of the character waiting in TBR.
 5. With CTS high (disable transmit) and TBR full, TCLTH(TBRE) occurs from the 4th falling edge of CO(BRG) after CTS goes low.
 6. With CTS high (disable transmit) and TBR full, TDTX occurs from the 5th falling edge of CO(BRG) after CTS goes low.

NOTES:
 1. DR bit D7 in USR is updated each time DR changes state. TDRH always from trailing edge of 11th CO(BRG) in last Stop bit.
 2. INTR on receive flags OE, FE, PE, and RBRK: INTEN enabled; Respective USR bits updated at this time regardless of interrupt configuration.
     - INT on OE, FE, PE, RBRK occurs from the trailing edge of the 11th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit. To avoid OE, RD(RBR) must go low by the
       trailing edge of the 8th CO(BRG) in the last Stop bit.
 3. INTR on MS: INTEN and MIEN enabled; USR bit D4(MS) is updated at this time regardless of INTEN/MIEN.
     - INTR on MS occurs whenever CTS or DSR input changes state.
