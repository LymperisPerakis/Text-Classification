1. General description
                          The SC16C754B is a quad Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) with
                          64-byte FIFOs, automatic hardware/software flow control, and data rates up to 5 Mbit/s
                          (3.3 V and 5 V). The SC16C754B offers enhanced features. It has a Transmission Control
                          Register (TCR) that stores receiver FIFO threshold levels to start/stop transmission during
                          hardware and software flow control. With the FIFO Ready (FIFO Rdy) register, the
                          software gets the status of TXRDY/RXRDY for all four ports in one access. On-chip status
                          registers provide the user with error indications, operational status, and modem interface
                          control. System interrupts may be tailored to meet user requirements. An internal
                          loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics.
                          The UART transmits data, sent to it over the peripheral 8-bit bus, on the TX signal and
                          receives characters on the RX signal. Characters can be programmed to be 5, 6, 7, or
                          8 bits. The UART has a 64-byte receive FIFO and transmit FIFO and can be programmed
                          to interrupt at different trigger levels. The UART generates its own desired baud rate
                          based upon a programmable divisor and its input clock. It can transmit even, odd, or no
                          parity and 1, 1.5, or 2 stop bits. The receiver can detect break, idle, or framing errors,
                          FIFO overflow, and parity errors. The transmitter can detect FIFO underflow. The UART
                          also contains a software interface for modem control operations, and has software flow
                          control and hardware flow control capabilities.
                          The SC16C754B is available in plastic LQFP64, LQFP80 and PLCC68 packages.

6. Functional description
                         The SC16C754B UART is pin-compatible with the SC16C554 and SC16C654 UARTs. It
                         provides more enhanced features. All additional features are provided through a special
                         enhanced feature register.
                         The UART will perform serial-to-parallel conversion on data characters received from
                         peripheral devices or modems, and parallel-to-parallel conversion on data characters
                         transmitted by the processor. The complete status of each channel of the SC16C754B
                         UART can be read at any time during functional operation by the processor.
                         The SC16C754B can be placed in an alternate mode (FIFO mode) relieving the processor
                         of excessive software overhead by buffering received/transmitted characters. Both the
                         receiver and transmitter FIFOs can store up to 64 bytes (including three additional bits of
                         error status per byte for the receiver FIFO) and have selectable or programmable trigger
                         levels. Primary outputs RXRDY and TXRDY allow signalling of DMA transfers.
                         The SC16C754B has selectable hardware flow control and software flow control.
                         Hardware flow control significantly reduces software overhead and increases system
                         efficiency by automatically controlling serial data flow using the RTS output and CTS input
                         signals. Software flow control automatically controls data flow by using programmable
                         Xon/Xoff characters.
                         The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that can divide the timing
                         reference clock input by a divisor between 1 and (216 − 1).
                   6.1 Trigger levels
                         The SC16C754B provides independent selectable and programmable trigger levels for
                         both receiver and transmitter DMA and interrupt generation. After reset, both transmitter
                         and receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of
                         one byte. The selectable trigger levels are available via the FIFO Control Register (FCR).
                         The programmable trigger levels are available via the Trigger Level Register (TLR).

                                             5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 64-byte FIFOs
                   6.2 Hardware flow control
                        Hardware flow control is comprised of auto-CTS and auto-RTS. Auto-CTS and auto-RTS
                        can be enabled/disabled independently by programming EFR[7:6].
                        With auto-CTS, CTS must be active before the UART can transmit data.
                        Auto-RTS only activates the RTS output when there is enough room in the FIFO to receive
                        data and de-activates the RTS output when the RX FIFO is sufficiently full. The halt and
                        resume trigger levels in the TCR determine the levels at which RTS is
                        activated/deactivated.
                        If both auto-CTS and auto-RTS are enabled, when RTS is connected to CTS, data
                        transmission does not occur unless the receiver FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun
                        errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if
                        the transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

                  6.2.1 Auto-RTS
                            Auto-RTS data flow control originates in the receiver block (see Figure 1 “Block diagram of
                            SC16C754B”). Figure 6 shows RTS functional timing. The receiver FIFO trigger levels
                            used in auto-RTS are stored in the TCR. RTS is active if the RX FIFO level is below the
                            halt trigger level in TCR[3:0]. When the receiver FIFO halt trigger level is reached, RTS is
                            de-asserted. The sending device (for example, another UART) may send an additional
                            byte after the trigger level is reached (assuming the sending UART has another byte to
                            send) because it may not recognize the de-assertion of RTS until it has begun sending the
                            additional byte. RTS is automatically reasserted once the receiver FIFO reaches the
                            resume trigger level programmed via TCR[7:4]. This re-assertion allows the sending
                            device to resume transmission.

            The two blocks in dashed lines cover the case where an additional byte is sent, as described in Section 6.2.1.

                  6.2.2 Auto-CTS
                            The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before sending the next data byte. When CTS is
                            active, the transmitter sends the next byte. To stop the transmitter from sending the
                            following byte, CTS must be de-asserted before the middle of the last stop bit that is
                            currently being sent. The auto-CTS function reduces interrupts to the host system. When
                            flow control is enabled, CTS level changes do not trigger host interrupts because the
                            device automatically controls its own transmitter. Without auto-CTS, the transmitter sends
                            any data present in the transmit FIFO and a receiver overrun error may result.

                                         When CTS is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
                                         When CTS goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current byte, the transmitter
                                         finishes sending the current byte, but it does not send the next byte.
                                         When CTS goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

                   6.3 Software flow control
                       Software flow control is enabled through the enhanced feature register and the modem
                       control register. Different combinations of software flow control can be enabled by setting
                       different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 3 shows software flow control options.

                       Remark: When using software flow control, the Xon/Xoff characters cannot be used for
                       data characters.
                       There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
                         • ‘Xon Any’ function (MCR[5]): Operation will resume after receiving any character
                            after recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that an Xon1 character is
                            recognized as an ‘Xon Any’ character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be
                            written to the RX FIFO.
                         • Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the
                            special character sets the Xoff interrupt (IIR[4]) but does not halt transmission. The
                            Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR. The special character is transferred to the
                            RX FIFO.
                6.3.1 RX
                       When software flow control operation is enabled, the SC16C754B will compare incoming
                       data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in certain cases, Xoff1 and Xoff2 must be
                       received sequentially). When the correct Xoff character is received, transmission is halted
                       after completing transmission of the current character. Xoff detection also sets IIR[4] (if
                       enabled via IER[5]) and causes INT to go HIGH.
                       To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases
                       Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xon characters are
                       received, IIR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                          SC16C754B
                                             5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 64-byte FIFOs
                6.3.2 TX
                       Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO has passed the halt trigger level
                       programmed in TCR[3:0].
                       Xon1/Xon2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO reaches the resume trigger level
                       programmed in TCR[7:4].
                       The transmission of Xoff/Xon(s) follows the exact same protocol as transmission of an
                       ordinary byte from the FIFO. This means that even if the word length is set to be 5, 6, or 7
                       characters, then the 5, 6, or 7 least significant bits of Xoff1/Xoff2 and Xon1/Xon2 will be
                       transmitted. (Note that the transmission of 5, 6, or 7 bits of a character is seldom done, but
                       this functionality is included to maintain compatibility with earlier designs.)
                       It is assumed that software flow control and hardware flow control will never be enabled
                       simultaneously. Figure 8 shows an example of software flow control.

               6.3.3.1 Assumptions
                       UART1 is transmitting a large text file to UART2. Both UARTs are using software flow
                       control with single character Xoff (0Fh) and Xon (0Dh) tokens. Both have Xoff threshold
                       (TCR[3:0] = F) set to 60, and Xon threshold (TCR[7:4] = 8) set to 32. Both have the
                       interrupt receive threshold (TLR[7:4] = D) set to 52.

                       UART1 begins transmission and sends 52 characters, at which point UART2 will generate
                       an interrupt to its processor to service the RX FIFO, but assumes the interrupt latency is
                       fairly long. UART1 will continue sending characters until a total of 60 characters have
                       been sent. At this time, UART2 will transmit a 0Fh to UART1, informing UART1 to halt
                       transmission. UART1 will likely send the 61st character while UART2 is sending the Xoff
                       character. Now UART2 is serviced and the processor reads enough data out of the RX
                       FIFO that the level drops to 32. UART2 will now send a 0Dh to UART1, informing UART1
                       to resume transmission.

                        The SC16C754B has interrupt generation and prioritization (six prioritized levels of
                        interrupts) capability. The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) enables each of the six types of
                        interrupts and the INT signal in response to an interrupt generation. The IER can also
                        disable the interrupt system by clearing bits 7:5 and 3:0. When an interrupt is generated,
                        the IIR indicates that an interrupt is pending and provides the type of interrupt through
                        IIR[5:0]. Table 6 summarizes the interrupt control functions.

                        It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, LSR[7]
                        generates the interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO,
                        and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always
                        represent the error status for the received character at the top of the RX FIFO. Reading
                        the RX FIFO updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the new character at the top of
                        the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all zeros.
                        For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt
                        is cleared by an Xon flow character detection. If a special character detection caused the
                        interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR.

                6.5.1 Interrupt mode operation
                      In interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is ‘1’) the processor is informed of the status of the
                      receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal, INT. Therefore, it is not necessary to
                      continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be
                      serviced. Figure 9 shows interrupt mode operation.
                                                                                        IIR

                6.5.2 Polled mode operation
                      In polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be
                      checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR). This mode is an alternative to the FIFO
                      interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
                      automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 10 shows FIFO polled
                      mode operation.

                   6.6 DMA operation
                       There are two modes of DMA operation, DMA mode 0 or DMA mode 1, selected by
                       FCR[3].
                       In DMA mode 0 or FIFO disable (FCR[0] = 0) DMA occurs in single character transfers. In
                       DMA mode 1, multi-character (or block) DMA transfers are managed to relieve the
                       processor for longer periods of time.
                6.6.1 Single DMA transfers (DMA mode 0/FIFO disable)
                       Figure 11 shows TXRDY and RXRDY in DMA mode 0/FIFO disable.

                       When empty, the TXRDY signal becomes active. TXRDY will go inactive after one
                       character has been loaded into it.
               6.6.1.2 Receiver
                       RXRDY is active when there is at least one character in the FIFO. It becomes inactive
                       when the receiver is empty.

               6.6.2.1 Transmitter
                       TXRDY is active when there is a trigger level number of spaces available. It becomes
                       inactive when the FIFO is full.
               6.6.2.2 Receiver
                       RXRDY becomes active when the trigger level has been reached, or when a time-out
                       interrupt occurs. It will go inactive when the FIFO is empty or an error in the RX FIFO is
                       flagged by LSR[7].
                   6.7 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the SC16C754B UART. It is enabled when EFR[4],
                       the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set. Sleep mode is entered when:
                         • The serial data input line, RX, is idle (see Section 6.8 “Break and time-out
                            conditions”).
                         • The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
                         • There are no interrupts pending except THR and time-out interrupts.
                       Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the RX FIFO.
                       In Sleep mode, the UART clock and baud rate clock are stopped. Since most registers are
                       clocked using these clocks, the power consumption is greatly reduced. The UART will
                       wake up when any change is detected on the RX line, when there is any change in the
                       state of the modem input pins, or if data is written to the TX FIFO.
                       Remark: Writing to the divisor latches, DLL and DLM, to set the baud clock, must not be
                       done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advisable to disable Sleep mode using IER[4]

                                                        5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 64-byte FIFOs
                   6.8 Break and time-out conditions
                       An RX idle condition is detected when the receiver line, RX, has been HIGH for
                       4 character time. The receiver line is sampled midway through each bit.
                       When a break condition occurs, the TX line is pulled LOW. A break condition is activated
                       by setting LCR[6].
                   6.9 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C754B UART contains a programmable baud generator that takes any clock
                       input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1 and (216 − 1). An additional
                       divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as shown in
                       Figure 13. The output frequency of the baud rate generator is 16 × the baud rate. The
                       formula for the divisor is given in Equation 1:
                                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   prescaler
                       divisor = ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      (1)
                                               ( desired baud rate × 16 )
                       Where:
                          prescaler = 1, when MCR[7] is set to 0 after reset (divide-by-1 clock selected)
                          prescaler = 4, when MCR[7] is set to 1 after reset (divide-by-4 clock selected).
                       Remark: The default value of prescaler after reset is divide-by-1.
                       Figure 13 shows the internal prescaler and baud rate generator circuitry.

                       DLL and DLM must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLM are the
                       least significant and most significant byte of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLM are
                       both zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
                       Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit
                       and receive clock rates.
                       Table 7 and Table 8 show the baud rate and divisor correlation for crystal with frequency
                       1.8432 MHz and 3.072 MHz, respectively.
                       Figure 14 shows the crystal clock circuit reference.

                                            5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V quad UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.) with 64-byte FIFOs
                       Remark: Refer to the notes under Table 9 for more register access information.
                   7.1 Receiver Holding Register (RHR)
                       The receiver section consists of the Receiver Holding Register (RHR) and the Receiver
                       Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The RSR receives serial data
                       from the RX terminal. The data is converted to parallel data and moved to the RHR. The
                       receiver section is controlled by the Line Control Register (LCR). If the FIFO is disabled,
                       location zero of the FIFO is used to store the characters.
                       Remark: In this case, characters are overwritten if overflow occurs.
                       If overflow occurs, characters are lost. The RHR also stores the error status bits
                       associated with each character.
                   7.2 Transmit Holding Register (THR)
                       The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR) and the Transmit
                       Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The THR receives data and
                       shifts it into the TSR, where it is converted to serial data and moved out on the TX
                       terminal. If the FIFO is disabled, the FIFO is still used to store the byte. Characters are
                       lost if overflow occurs.

                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This is a write-only register that is used for enabling the FIFOs, clearing the FIFOs, setting
                       transmitter and receiver trigger levels, and selecting the type of DMA signalling. Table 11
                       shows FIFO control register bit settings.

                                                 because the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.

                   7.4 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       This register controls the data communication format. The word length, number of stop
                       bits, and parity type are selected by writing the appropriate bits to the LCR. Table 12
                       shows the line control register bit settings.
                       Table 12.  Line control register bits description

                       6        LCR[6]       Break control bit. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break
                                             condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This
                                             condition exists until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.

                                                communication terminal to a line break condition
                       5        LCR[5]       Set parity. LCR[5] selects the forced parity format (if LCR[3] = 1).

                                                the transmit and receive data
                                                LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 1: parity bit is forced to a logic 0 for

                                                logic 1 = even parity is generated (if LCR[3] = 1)
                       3        LCR[3]       Parity enable.
                                                logic 0 = no parity (normal default condition)
                                                logic 1 = a parity bit is generated during transmission and the receiver
                                                checks for received parity
                       2        LCR[2]       Number of stop bits. Specifies the number of stop bits.
                                                0 = 1 stop bit (word length = 5, 6, 7, 8)
                                                1 = 1.5 stop bits (word length = 5)
                                                1 = 2 stop bits (word length = 6, 7, 8)
                       1:0      LCR[1:0]     Word length bits 1, 0. These two bits specify the word length to be
                                             transmitted or received.

                   7.5 Line Status Register (LSR)
                       Table 13 shows the line status register bit settings.
                       Table 13.   Line status register bits description
                        Bit    Symbol       Description
                        7      LSR[7]       FIFO data error.
                                              logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = at least one parity error, framing error, or break indication is in the
                                              receiver FIFO. This bit is cleared when no more errors are present in the
                                              FIFO.
                        6      LSR[6]       THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator.
                                              logic 0 = transmitter hold and shift registers are not empty
                                              logic 1 = transmitter hold and shift registers are empty
                        5      LSR[5]       THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator.
                                              logic 0 = Transmit Hold Register is not empty
                                              logic 1 = Transmit Hold Register is empty. The processor can now load up
                                              to 64 bytes of data into the THR if the TX FIFO is enabled.
                        4      LSR[4]       Break interrupt.
                                              logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = a break condition occurred and associated byte is 00, that is,
                                              RX was LOW for one character time frame
                        3      LSR[3]       Framing error.
                                              logic 0 = no framing error in data being read from RX FIFO (normal default
                                              condition)
                                              logic 1 = framing error occurred in data being read from RX FIFO, that is,
                                              received data did not have a valid stop bit
                        2      LSR[2]       Parity error.
                                              logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = parity error in data being read from RX FIFO
                        1      LSR[1]       Overrun error.
                                              logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = overrun error has occurred
                        0      LSR[0]       Data in receiver.
                                              logic 0 = no data in receive FIFO (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = at least one character in the RX FIFO
                       When the LSR is read, LSR[4:2] reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the
                       top of the RX FIFO (next character to be read). The LSR[4:2] registers do not physically
                       exist, as the data read from the RX FIFO is output directly onto the output data bus,
                       DI[4:2], when the LSR is read. Therefore, errors in a character are identified by reading
                       the LSR and then reading the RHR.
                       LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when
                       there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO.
                       Reading the LSR does not cause an increment of the RX FIFO read pointer. The RX FIFO
                       read pointer is incremented by reading the RHR.

                   7.7 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This 8-bit register provides information about the current state of the control lines from the
                       modem, data set, or peripheral device to the processor. It also indicates when a control
                       input from the modem changes state. Table 15 shows modem status register bit settings
                       per channel.

                        2       MSR[2]         ∆RI. Indicates that RI input (or MCR[2] in loopback mode) has changed state
                                               from LOW to HIGH. Cleared on a read.
                        1       MSR[1]         ∆DSR. Indicates that DSR input (or MCR[0] in loopback mode) has changed

                                            receiver FIFO HALT trigger level TCR[3:0] is reached, and goes LOW when
                                            the receiver FIFO RESUME transmission trigger level TCR[7:4] is reached.

                                            Xoff2 data. If a match occurs, the received data is transferred to FIFO and
                                            IIR[4] is set to a logic 1 to indicate a special character has been detected.

                                            can be modified, that is, this bit is therefore a write enable.
                      3:0    EFR[3:0]    Combinations of software flow control can be selected by programming these
                                         bits. See Table 3 “Software flow control options (EFR[3:0])”.
                7.11 Divisor latches (DLL, DLM)
                     These are two 8-bit registers which store the 16-bit divisor for generation of the baud clock
                     in the baud rate generator. DLM stores the most significant part of the divisor. DLL stores
                     the least significant part of the divisor.
                     Note that DLL and DLM can only be written to before Sleep mode is enabled, that is,
                     before IER[4] is set.

                7.12 Transmission Control Register (TCR)
                     This 8-bit register is used to store the RX FIFO threshold levels to stop/start transmission
                     during hardware/software flow control. Table 20 shows transmission control register bit
                     settings.
                     Table 20.   Transmission control register bits description
                     Bit    Symbol       Description
                     7:4    TCR[7:4]     RX FIFO trigger level to resume transmission [(0 to 60) bytes].
                     3:0    TCR[3:0]     RX FIFO trigger level to halt transmission [(0 to 60) bytes].
                     TCR trigger levels are available from 0 to 60 bytes with a granularity of four.
                     Remark: TCR can only be written to when EFR[4] = 1 and MCR[6] = 1. The programmer
                     must program the TCR such that TCR[3:0] > TCR[7:4]. There is no built-in hardware
                     check to make sure this condition is met. Also, the TCR must be programmed with this
                     condition before auto-RTS or software flow control is enabled to avoid spurious operation
                     of the device.
                7.13 Trigger Level Register (TLR)
                     This 8-bit register is used to store the transmit and received FIFO trigger levels used for
                     DMA and interrupt generation. Trigger levels from 4 to 60 can be programmed with a
                     granularity of 4. Table 21 shows trigger level register bit settings.
                     Table 21.   Trigger level register bits description
                     Bit    Symbol       Description
                     7:4    TLR[7:4]     RX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of characters available.
                     3:0    TLR[3:0]     TX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of spaces available.
                     Remark: TLR can only be written to when EFR[4] = 1 and MCR[6] = 1. If TLR[3:0] or
                     TLR[7:4] are logic 0, the selectable trigger levels via the FIFO Control Register (FCR) are
                     used for the transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels. Trigger levels from 4 to 60 bytes are
                     available with a granularity of four. The TLR should be programmed for N⁄4, where N is the
                     desired trigger level.
                7.14 FIFO Ready register (FIFO Rdy)
                     The FIFO Rdy register provides real-time status of the transmit and receive FIFOs of both
                     channels.

                                               RX FIFO
                                               1 = the RX FIFO has more than a RX trigger level number of characters
                                               available for reading or a time-out condition has occurred
                     3:0     FIFO Rdy[3:0]     0 = there are less than a TX trigger level number of spaces available in

                   The FIFO ready register is a read-only register that can be accessed when any of the four
                   UARTs is selected CSA to CSD = 0, MCR[2] (FIFO Rdy Enable) is a logic 1, and loopback
                   is disabled. The address is 111.
8. Programmer’s guide
                   The base set of registers that is used during high-speed data transfer have a
                   straightforward access method. The extended function registers require special access
                   bits to be decoded along with the address lines. The following guide will help with
                   programming these registers. Note that the descriptions below are for individual register
                   access. Some streamlining through interleaving can be obtained when programming all
                   the registers.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 28) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 27 and 28
