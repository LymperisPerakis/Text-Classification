CMOS Asynchronous                                                Features
The 82C50A Asynchronous Communication Element                    • Single Chip UART/BRG
(ACE) is a high performance programmable Universal
                                                                 • DC to 625K Baud (DC to 10MHz Clock)
Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) and Baud
Rate Generator (BRG) on a single chip. Using Intersil’s          • Crystal or External Clock Input
advanced Scaled SAJI IV CMOS Process, the ACE will               • On Chip Baud Rate Generator 1 to 65535 Divisor
support data rates from DC to 625K baud (0-10MHz clock).           Generates 16X Clock
The ACE’s receiver circuitry converts start, data, stop, and     • Prioritized Interrupt Mode
parity bits into a parallel data word. The transmitter circuitry
                                                                 • Fully TTL/CMOS Compatible
converts a parallel data word into serial form and appends
the start, parity, and stop bits. The word length is             • Microprocessor Bus Oriented Interface
programmable to 5, 6, 7, or 8 data bits. Stop bit selection      • 80C86/80C88 Compatible
provides a choice of 1,1.5, or 2 stop bits.
                                                                 • Scaled SAJI IV CMOS Process
The Baud Rate Generator divides the clock by a divisor
programmable from 1 to 216-1 to provide standard RS-             • Low Power - 1mA/MHz Typical
232C baud rates when using any one of three industry             • Modem Interface
standard baud rate crystals (1.8432MHz, 2.4576MHz, or
                                                                 • Line Break Generation and Detection
3.072MHz). A programmable buffered clock output
(BAUDOUT) provides either a buffered oscillator or 16X (16       • Loopback and Echo Modes
times the data rate) baud rate clock for general purpose         • Doubled Buffered Transmitter and Receiver
system use.
                                                                 • Single 5V Supply
To meet the system requirements of a CPU interfacing to
an asynchronous channel, the modem control signals RTS,          • Pb-Free Plus Anneal Available (RoHS Compliant)
CTS, DSR, DTR, RI, DCD are provided. Inputs and outputs
have been designed with full TTL/CMOS compatibility in
order to facilitate mixed TTL/NMOS/CMOS system design.

82C50A
Pin Description
               PIN         ACTIVE
  SYMBOL     NUMBER   TYPE LEVEL                                         DESCRIPTION
 DISTR,         22       I   H    DATA IN STROBE, DATA IN STROBE: DISTR, DISTR are read inputs which cause the
 DISTR          21       I   L    82C50A to output data to the data bus (D0-D7). The data output depends upon the
                                  register selected by the address inputs A0, A1, A2. The chip select inputs CS0, CS1,
                                  CS2 enable the DISTR, DISTR inputs.
                                  Only an active DISTR or DISTR, not both, is used to receive data from the 82C50A
                                  during a read operation. If DISTR is used as the read input, DlSTR should be tied high.
                                  If DISTR is used as the active read input, DISTR should be tied low.
 DOSTR,         19       I   H    DATA OUT STROBE, DATA OUT STROBE: DOSTR, DOSTR are write inputs which
 DOSTR          18       I   L    cause data from the data bus (D0-D7) to be input to the 82C50A. The data input depends
                                  upon the register selected by the address inputs A0, A1, A2. The chip select inputs CS0,
                                  CS1, CS2 enable the DOSTR, DOSTR inputs.
                                  Only an active DOSTR or DOSTR, not both, is used to transmit data to the 82C50A
                                  during a write operation. If DOSTR is used as the write input, DOSTR should be tied
                                  high. If DOSTR is used as the write input, DOSTR should be tied low.
 D0-D7         1-8     I/O        DATA BITS 0-7: The Data Bus provides eight, three-state input/output lines for the
                                  transfer of data, control and status information between the 82C50A and the CPU. For
                                  character formats of less than 8 bits, D7, D6 and D5 are “don’t cares” for data write
                                  operations and 0 for data read operations. These lines are normally in a high impedance
                                  state except during read operations. D0 is the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and is the first
                                  serial data bit to be received or transmitted.
 A0, A1,      28, 27,    I   H    REGISTER SELECT: The address lines select the internal registers during CPU bus
 A2             26       I        operations. See Table 1.
 XTAL1,         16       I        CRYSTAL/CLOCK: Crystal connections for the internal Baud Rate Generator. XTAL1
 XTAL2          17      O         can also be used as an external clock input, in which case XTAL2 should be left open.
 SOUT           11      O         SERIAL DATA OUTPUT: Serial data output from the 82C50A transmitter circuitry. A
                                  Mark (1) is a logic one (high) and Space (0) is a logic zero (low). SOUT is held in the
                                  Mark condition when the transmitter is disabled, MR is true, the Transmitter Register is
                                  empty, or when in the Loop Mode. SOUT is not affected by the CTS input.
 GND            20           L    GROUND: Power supply ground connection (VSS).
 CTS            36       I   L    CLEAR TO SEND: The logical state of the CTS pin is reflected in the CTS bit of the
                                  (MSR) Modem Status Register (CTS is bit 4 of the MSR, written MSR (4)). A change of
                                  state in the CTS pin since the previous reading of the MSR causes the setting of DCTS
                                  (MSR(O)) of the Modem Status Register. When CTS pin is ACTIVE (low), the modem is
                                  indicating that data on SOUT can be transmitted on the communications link. If CTS pin
                                  goes INACTIVE (high), the 82C50A should not be allowed to transmit data out of SOUT.
                                  CTS pin does not affect Loop Mode operation.
 DSR            37       I   L    DATA SET READY: The logical state of the DSR pin is reflected in MSR(5) of the
                                  Modem Status Register. DDSR (MSR(1)) indicates whether the DSR pin has changed
                                  state since the previous reading of the MSR. When the DSR pin is ACTIVE (low), the
                                  modem is indicating that it is ready to exchange data with the 82C50A, while the DSR
                                  Pin INACTIVE (high) indicates that the modem is not ready for data exchange. The
                                  ACTIVE condition indicates only the condition of the local Data Communications
                                  Equipment (DCE), and does not imply that a data circuit as been established with remote
                                  equipment.
 DTR            33      O    L    DATA TERMINAL READY: The DTR pin can be set (low) by writing a logic 1 to MCR(0),
                                  Modem Control Register bit 0. This signal is cleared (high) by writing a logic 0 to the DTR
                                  bit (MCR(0)) or whenever a MR ACTIVE (high) is applied to the 82C50A. When ACTIVE
                                  (low), DTR pin indicates to the DCE that the 82C50A is ready to receive data. In some
                                  instances, DTR pin is used as a power on indicator. The INACTIVE (high) state causes
                                  the DCE to disconnect the modem from the telecommunications circuit.
 RTS            32      O    L    REQUEST TO SEND: The RTS signal is an output used to enable the modem. The RTS
                                  pin is set low by writing a logic 1 to MCR (1) bit 1 of the Modem Control Register. The
                                  RTS pin is reset high by Master Reset. When ACTIVE, the RTS pin indicates to the DCE
                                  that the 82C50A has data ready to transmit. In half duplex operations, RTS is used to
                                  control the direction of the line.
 BAUDOUT        15      O         BAUDOUT: This output is a 16X clock out used for the transmitter section (16X = 16
                                  times the data rate). The BAUDOUT clock rate is equal to the reference oscillator
                                  frequency divided by the specified divisor in the Baud Rate Generator Divisor Latches
                                  DLL and DLM. BAUDOUT may be used by the Receiver section by tying this output to
                                  RCLK.

82C50A
Pin Description      (Continued)
               PIN               ACTIVE
  SYMBOL     NUMBER        TYPE  LEVEL                                        DESCRIPTION
 OUT1           34          O       L   OUTPUT 1: This is a general purpose output that can be programmed ACTIVE (low) by
                                        settingVCR(2) (OUT1) of the Modem Control Register to a high level. The OUT1 pin is
                                        set high by Master Reset. The OUT1 pin is INACTIVE (high) during loop mode operation.
 OUT2           31          O       L   OUTPUT 2: This is a general purpose output that can be programmed ACTIVE (low) by
                                        setting MCR(3) (OUT1) of the Modem Control Register to a high level. The OUT2 pin is
                                        set high by Master Reset. The OUT2 signal is INACTIVE (high) during loop mode
                                        operation.
 RI             39           1      L   RING INDICATOR: When low, RI indicates that a telephone ringing signal has been
                                        received by the modem or data set. The RI signal is a modem control input whose
                                        condition is tested by reading MSR(6) (RI). The Modem Status Register output TERI
                                        (MSR(2)) indicates whether the RI input has changed from a Low to High since the
                                        previous reading of the MSR. If the interrupt is enabled (IER (3) = 1) and RI changes from
                                        a Low to High, an interrupt is generated. The ACTIVE (low) state of RI indicates that the
                                        DCE is receiving a ringing signal. RI will appear ACTIVE for approximately the same
                                        length of time as the ACTIVE segment of the ringing cycle. The INACTIVE state of RI will
                                        occur during the INACTIVE segments not detected by the DCE. This circuit is not
                                        disabled by the INACTIVE condition of DTR.
 DCD            38           I      L   DATA CARRIER DETECT: When ACTIVE (low), DCD indicates that the data carrier has
                                        been detected by the modem or data set. DCD is a modem input whose condition can
                                        be tested by the CPU by reading MSR(7) (DCD) of the Modem Status Register. MSR(3)
                                        (DDCD) of the Modem Status Register indicates whether the DCD input has changed
                                        since the previous reading of the MSR. DOD has no effect on the receiver. If the DCD
                                        changes state with the modem status interrupt enabled, an interrupt is generated.
                                        When DCD is ACTIVE (low), the received line signal from the remote terminal is within
                                        the limits specified by the DCE manufacturer. The INACTIVE (high) signal indicates that
                                        the signal is not within the specified limits, or is not present.
 MR             35           1     H    MASTER RESET: The MR input forces the 82C50A into an idle mode in which all serial
                                        data activities are suspended. The Modem Control Register (MCR) along with its
                                        associated outputs are cleared. The Line Status Register (LSR) is cleared except for the
                                        THRE and TEMT bits, which are set. The 82C50A remains in an idle state until
                                        programmed to resume serial data activities. The MR input is a Schmitt trigger input. See
                                        the DC Electrical Characteristics for Schmitt trigger logic input voltage levels. See Table
                                        7 for a summary of Master Reset’s effect on 82C50A operation.
 lNTRPT         30          O      H    INTERRUPT REQUEST: The lNTRPT output goes ACTIVE (high) when one of the
                                        following interrupts has an ACTIVE (high) condition and is enabled by the Interrupt
                                        Enable Register: Receiver Error flag, Received Data Available, Transmitter Holding
                                        Register Empty, and Modem Status. The lNTRPT is reset low upon appropriate service
                                        or a MR operation. See Figure 1. Interrupt Control Structure.
 SIN            10           I     H    SERIAL DATA INPUT: The SIN input is the serial data input from the communication line
                                        or modem to the 82C50A receiver circuits. A mark (1) is high, and a space (0) is low. Data
                                        inputs on SIN are disabled when operating in the loop mode.
 VCC            40                 H    VCC: +5V positive power supply pin. A 0.1A decoupling capacitor from VCC (pin 40)
                                        to GND (pin 20) is recommended.
 CS0, CS1,    12,13,         I    H, H, CHIP SELECT: The Chip Select inputs act as enable signals for the write (DOSTR,

The 82C50A crystal oscillator circuitry is designed to operate                                  PIN 17
with a fundamental mode, parallel resonant crystal. Table 8                 CL      RS
shows the required crystal parameters and crystal circuit                                                 82C50A
configuration, respectively.
When using an external clock source, the XTAL1 input is              FIGURE 2. TYPICAL CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR CIRCUIT
driven and the XTAL2 output is left open. Power
consumption when using an external clock is typically 50%
of that required when using a crystal. This is due to the
sinusoidal nature of the drive circuitry when using a crystal.
