 1.0 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The XR16L2551 (L2551) provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization, parallel-to-serial and
serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and receiver sections. These functions are
necessary for converting the serial data stream into parallel data that is required with digital data systems.
Synchronization for the serial data stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to
form a data character (character orientated protocol). Data integrity is ensured by attaching a parity bit to the
data character. The parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit errors. The electronic circuitry
to provide all these functions is fairly complex especially when manufactured on a single integrated silicon
chip. The L2551 represents such an integration with greatly enhanced features. The L2551 is fabricated with
an advanced CMOS process.
Transmit and Receive FIFOs (16 Bytes each)
The L2551 is an upward solution that provides a dual UART capability with 16 bytes of transmit and receive
FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C2450. The L2551 is designed to work with high speed modems and
shared network environments, that require fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in the
L2551 by the transmit and receive FIFO’s. This allows the external processor to handle more networking tasks
within a given time. For example, the ST16C2450 without a receive FIFO, will require unloading of the RHR in
93 microseconds (This example uses a character length of 11 bits, including start/stop bits at 115.2 Kbps). This
means the external CPU will have to service the receive FIFO less than every 100 microseconds. However
with the 16 byte FIFO in the L2551, the data buffer will not require unloading/loading for 1.53 ms. This
increases the service interval giving the external CPU additional time for other applications and reducing the
overall UART interrupt servicing time. In addition, the 4 selectable receive FIFO trigger interrupt levels is
uniquely provided for maximum data throughput performance especially when operating in a multi-channel
environment. The FIFO memory greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of the external controlling CPU,
increases performance, and reduces power consumption.
Data Bus Interface, Intel or Motorola Type
The L2551 provides a single host interface for the 2 UARTs and supports Intel or Motorola microprocessor
(CPU) data bus interface. The Intel bus compatible interface allows direct interconnect to Intel compatible type
of CPUs using IOR#, IOW# and CSA# or CSB# inputs for data bus operation. The Motorola bus compatible
interface instead uses the R/W#, CS# and A3 signals for data bus transactions. Few data bus interface signals
change their functions depending on user’s selection, see pin description for details. The Intel and Motorola
bus interface selection is made through the 16/68# pin (pin 24 for 48-TQFP package and pin 17 for 32-QFN
package).
Enhanced Features
The XR16L2551 integrates the functions of 2 enhanced 16C550 Universal Asynchronous Receiver and
Transmitter (UART). Its features set is compatible to the XR16L2550 device but offers Intel or Motorola data
bus interface and PowerSave to isolate the data bus interface during Sleep mode. Each UART is
independently controlled having its own set of device configuration registers. The configuration registers set is
16550 UART compatible for control, status and data transfer. Additionally, each UART channel has automatic
RTS/CTS hardware flow control, automatic Xon/Xoff and special character software flow control, infrared
encoder and decoder (IrDA ver 1.0), programmable baud rate generator with a prescaler of divide by 1 or 4,
and data rate up to 3.125 Mbps at 5V with a 50 MHz external clock.
The rich feature set of the L2551 is available through internal registers. Selectable receive FIFO trigger levels,
selectable TX and RX baud rates, and modem interface controls are all standard features. Following a power
on reset or an external reset (and operating in 16 or Intel Mode), the L2551 is functionally and software
compatible with the previous generation ST16C2450 and ST16C2550.

 2.0 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS
 2.1     CPU Interface
The CPU interface is 8 data bits wide with 3 address lines and control signals to execute data bus read and
write transactions. The L2551 data interface supports the Intel compatible types of CPUs and it is compatible to
the industry standard 16C550 UART. No clock (oscillator nor external clock) is required to operate a data bus
transaction. Each bus cycle is asynchronous using CSA/B#, IOR# and IOW# or CS#, R/W# and A3 inputs.
Both UART channels share the same data bus for host operations. A typical data bus interconnection for Intel
and Motorola mode is shown in Figure 3.

 2.2     5-Volt Tolerant Inputs
The L2551 can accept up to 5V inputs even when operating at 3.3V or 2.5V. But note that if the L2551 is
operating at 2.5V, its VOH may not be high enough to meet the requirements of the VIH of a CPU or a serial
transceiver that is operating at 5V.

 2.3       Device Reset
The RESET or RESET# input resets the internal registers and the serial interface outputs in both channels to
their default state (see Table 14). An active high pulse of at least 40 ns duration will be required to activate the
reset function in the device.
 2.4       Device Identification and Revision
The L2551 provides a Device Identification code and a Device Revision code to distinguish the part from other
devices and revisions. To read the identification code from the part, it is required to set the baud rate generator
registers DLL and DLM both to 0x00. Now reading the content of the DLM will provide 0x02 to indicate L2551
and reading the content of DLL will provide the revision of the part; for example, a reading of 0x01 means
revision A.
 2.5       Channel A and B Selection
The UART provides the user with the capability to bi-directionally transfer information between an external
CPU and an external serial communication device. A logic 0 on chip select pins, CSA# or CSB#, allows the
user to select UART channel A or B to configure, send transmit data and/or unload receive data to/from the
UART. Selecting both UARTs can be useful during power up initialization to write to the same internal registers,
but do not attempt to read from both uarts simultaneously. Individual channel select functions are shown in
Table 1.

During Motorola Bus Mode (16/68# pin connected to GND), the package interface pins are configured for
connection with Motorola, and other popular microprocessor bus types. In this mode the L2551 decodes an
additional address, A3, to select one of the UART ports. The A3 address decode function is used only when in
the Motorola Bus Mode. See Table 2.

Each UART channel in the L2551 has a standard register set for controlling, monitoring and data loading and
unloading. The configuration register set is compatible to those already available in the standard single
16C550. These registers function as data holding registers (THR/RHR), interrupt status and control registers
(ISR/IER), a FIFO control register (FCR), receive line status and control registers (LSR/LCR), modem status
and control registers (MSR/MCR), programmable data rate (clock) divisor registers (DLL/DLM), and a user
accessible scratch pad register (SPR).
 2.6       DMA Mode
The device does not support direct memory access. The DMA Mode (a legacy term) in this document doesn’t
mean “direct memory access” but refers to data block transfer operation. The DMA mode affects the state of
the RXRDY# A/B and TXRDY# A/B output pins. The transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels provide additional
flexibility to the user for block mode operation. The LSR bits 5-6 provide an indication when the transmitter is

empty or has an empty location(s) for more data. The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive
FIFO in the DMA mode (FCR bit-3=1). When the transmit and receive FIFO are enabled and the DMA mode is
disabled (FCR bit-3 = 0), the L2551 is placed in single-character mode for data transmit or receive operation.
When DMA mode is enabled (FCR bit-3 = 1), the user takes advantage of block mode operation by loading or

 2.8     Crystal Oscillator or External Clock Input
The L2551 includes an on-chip oscillator (XTAL1 and XTAL2) to produce a clock for both UART sections in the
device. The CPU data bus does not require this clock for bus operation. The crystal oscillator provides a
system clock to the Baud Rate Generators (BRG) section found in each of the UART. XTAL1 is the input to the
oscillator or external clock buffer input with XTAL2 pin being the output. Please note that the input XTAL1 is not
5V tolerant and so the maximum at the pin should be VCC. For programming details, see “Programmable
Baud Rate Generator.”

The on-chip oscillator is designed to use an industry standard microprocessor crystal (parallel resonant,
fundamental frequency with 10-22 pF capacitance load, ESR of 20-120 ohms and 100 ppm frequency
tolerance) connected externally between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins (see Figure 4), with an external 500 kΩ
to 1 MΩ resistor across it. Alternatively, an external clock can be connected to the XTAL1 pin to clock the
internal baud rate generator for standard or custom rates. Typical oscillator connections are shown in Figure 4.
For further reading on oscillator circuit please see application note DAN108 on EXAR’s web site.
 2.9     Programmable Baud Rate Generator
A single baud rate generator is provided for the transmitter and receiver, allowing independent TX/RX channel
control. The programmable Baud Rate Generator is capable of operating with a crystal frequency of up to 24
MHz. However, with an external clock input on XTAL1 pin and a 2K ohms pull-up resistor on XTAL2 pin (as
shown in Figure 5) it can extend its operation up to 50 MHz (3.125Mbps serial data rate) at room temperature
and 5.0V.

The L2551 divides the basic external clock by 16. The basic 16X clock provides table rates to support standard
and custom applications using the same system design. The Baud Rate Generator divides the input 16X clock
by any divisor from 1 to 216 -1. The rate table is configured via the DLL and DLM internal register functions.
Customized Baud Rates can be achieved by selecting the proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB sections
of baud rate generator.
Table 6 shows the standard data rates available with a 14.7456 MHz crystal or external clock at 16X sampling
rate. When using a non-standard frequency crystal or external clock, the divisor value can be calculated for
DLL/DLM with the following equation.
                        divisor (decimal) = (XTAL1 clock frequency) / (serial data rate x 16)

 2.10    Transmitter
The transmitter section comprises of an 8-bit Transmit Shift Register (TSR) and 16 bytes of FIFO which
includes a byte-wide Transmit Holding Register (THR). TSR shifts out every data bit with the 16X internal
clock. A bit time is 16 clock periods. The transmitter sends the start-bit followed by the number of data bits,
inserts the proper parity-bit if enabled, and adds the stop-bit(s). The status of the FIFO and TSR are reported in
the Line Status Register (LSR bit-5 and bit-6).
  2.10.1    Transmit Holding Register (THR) - Write Only
The transmit holding register is an 8-bit register providing a data interface to the host processor. The host
writes transmit data byte to the THR to be converted into a serial data stream including start-bit, data bits,
parity-bit and stop-bit(s). The least-significant-bit (Bit-0) becomes first data bit to go out. The THR is the input
register to the transmit FIFO of 16 bytes when FIFO operation is enabled by FCR bit-0. Every time a write
operation is made to the THR, the FIFO data pointer is automatically bumped to the next sequential data
location.
  2.10.2    Transmitter Operation in non-FIFO Mode
The host loads transmit data to THR one character at a time. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set when the
data byte is transferred to TSR. THR flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when it is enabled
by IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when TSR becomes completely empty.

The host may fill the transmit FIFO with up to 16 bytes of transmit data. The THR empty flag (LSR bit-5) is set
whenever the FIFO is empty. The THR empty flag can generate a transmit empty interrupt (ISR bit-1) when the
transmit empty interrupt is enabled by IER bit-1. The TSR flag (LSR bit-6) is set when the FIFO and the TSR
become empty.

 2.11    Receiver
The receiver section contains an 8-bit Receive Shift Register (RSR) and 16 bytes of FIFO which includes a
byte-wide Receive Holding Register (RHR). The RSR uses the 16X for timing. It verifies and validates every bit
on the incoming character in the middle of each data bit. On the falling edge of a start or false start bit, an
internal receiver counter starts counting at the 16X. After 8 clocks the start bit period should be at the center of
the start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled and if it is still a logic 0 it is validated. Evaluating the start bit in
this manner prevents the receiver from assembling a false character. The rest of the data bits and stop bits are
sampled and validated in this same manner to prevent false framing. If there were any error(s), they are
reported in the LSR register bits 2-4. Upon unloading the receive data byte from RHR, the receive FIFO pointer
is bumped and the error tags are immediately updated to reflect the status of the data byte in RHR register.
RHR can generate a receive data ready interrupt upon receiving a character or delay until it reaches the FIFO
trigger level. Furthermore, data delivery to the host is guaranteed by a receive data ready time-out interrupt

when data is not received for 4 word lengths as defined by LCR[1:0] plus 12 bits time. This is equivalent to 3.7-
4.6 character times. The RHR interrupt is enabled by IER bit-0.
 2.11.1       Receive Holding Register (RHR) - Read-Only
The Receive Holding Register is an 8-bit register that holds a receive data byte from the Receive Shift
Register. It provides the receive data interface to the host processor. The RHR register is part of the receive
FIFO of 16 bytes by 11-bits wide, the 3 extra bits are for the 3 error tags to be reported in LSR register. When
the FIFO is enabled by FCR bit-0, the RHR contains the first data character received by the FIFO. After the
RHR is read, the next character byte is loaded into the RHR and the errors associated with the current data
byte are immediately updated in the LSR bits 2-4.

 2.12    Auto RTS (Hardware) Flow Control
Automatic RTS hardware flow control is used to prevent data overrun to the local receiver FIFO. The RTS#
output is used to request remote unit to suspend/resume data transmission. The auto RTS flow control
features is enabled to fit specific application requirement (see Figure 11):
- Enable auto RTS flow control using EFR bit-6.
- The auto RTS function must be started by asserting RTS# output pin (MCR bit-1 to logic 1 after it is enabled).
- Enable RTS interrupt through IER bit-6 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the
RTS# pin makes a transition from low to high: ISR bit-5 will be set to logic 1.
 2.13    Auto CTS Flow Control
Automatic CTS flow control is used to prevent data overrun to the remote receiver FIFO. The CTS# input is
monitored to suspend/restart the local transmitter. The auto CTS flow control feature is selected to fit specific
application requirement (see Figure 11):
- Enable auto CTS flow control using EFR bit-7.
- Enable CTS interrupt through IER bit-7 (after setting EFR bit-4). The UART issues an interrupt when the
CTS# pin is de-asserted (logic 1): ISR bit-5 will be set to 1, and UART will suspend transmission as soon as
the stop bit of the character in process is shifted out. Transmission is resumed after the CTS# input is re-
asserted (logic 0), indicating more data may be sent.

  The local UART (UARTA) starts data transfer by asserting RTSA# (1). RTSA# is normally connected to CTSB# (2) of
  remote UART (UARTB). CTSB# allows its transmitter to send data (3). TXB data arrives and fills UARTA receive FIFO
  (4). When RXA data fills up to its receive FIFO trigger level, UARTA activates its RXA data ready interrupt (5) and con-
  tinues to receive and put data into its FIFO. If interrupt service latency is long and data is not being unloaded, UARTA
  monitors its receive data fill level to match the upper threshold of RTS delay and de-assert RTSA# (6). CTSB# follows
  (7) and request UARTB transmitter to suspend data transfer. UARTB stops or finishes sending the data bits in its trans-
  mit shift register (8). When receive FIFO data in UARTA is unloaded to match the lower threshold of RTS delay (9),
  UARTA re-asserts RTSA# (10), CTSB# recognizes the change (11) and restarts its transmitter and data flow again until
  next receive FIFO trigger (12). This same event applies to the reverse direction when UARTA sends data to UARTB
  with RTSB# and CTSA# controlling the data flow.

characters with the programmed Xon or Xoff-1,2 character value(s). If receive character(s) (RX) match the
programmed values, the L2551 will halt transmission (TX) as soon as the current character has completed
transmission. When a match occurs, the Xoff (if enabled via IER bit-5) flag will be set and the interrupt output
pin will be activated. Following a suspension due to a match of the Xoff character, the L2551 will monitor the
receive data stream for a match to the Xon-1,2 character. If a match is found, the L2551 will resume operation
and clear the flags (ISR bit-4).
Reset initially sets the contents of the Xon/Xoff 8-bit flow control registers to a logic 0. Following reset the user
can write any Xon/Xoff value desired for software flow control. Different conditions can be set to detect Xon/
Xoff characters (See Table 13) and suspend/resume transmissions. When double 8-bit Xon/Xoff characters
are selected, the L2551 compares two consecutive receive characters with two software flow control 8-bit
values (Xon1, Xon2, Xoff1, Xoff2) and controls TX transmissions accordingly. Under the above described flow
control mechanisms, flow control characters are not placed (stacked) in the user accessible RX data buffer or
FIFO.
In the event that the receive buffer is overfilling and flow control needs to be executed, the L2551 automatically
sends an Xoff message (when enabled) via the serial TX output to the remote modem. The L2551 sends the
Xoff-1,2 characters two-character-times (= time taken to send two characters at the programmed baud rate)
after the receive FIFO crosses the programmed trigger level. To clear this condition, the L2551 will transmit the
programmed Xon-1,2 characters as soon as receive FIFO is less than one trigger level below the programmed
trigger level. See Table 7 below.

* After the trigger level is reached, an xoff character is sent after a short span of time (= time required to send 2
 characters); for example, after 2.083ms has elapsed for 9600 baud and 8-bit word length, no parity and 1 stop bit setting.
 2.15      Special Character Detect
A special character detect feature is provided to detect an 8-bit character when bit-5 is set in the Enhanced
Feature Register (EFR). When this character (Xoff2) is detected, it will be placed in the FIFO along with normal
incoming RX data.
The L2551 compares each incoming receive character with Xoff-2 data. If a match exists, the received data will
be transferred to FIFO and ISR bit-4 will be set to indicate detection of special character. Although the Internal
Register Table shows Xon, Xoff Registers with eight bits of character information, the actual number of bits is
dependent on the programmed word length. Line Control Register (LCR) bits 0-1 defines the number of
character bits, i.e., either 5 bits, 6 bits, 7 bits, or 8 bits. The word length selected by LCR bits 0-1 also
determines the number of bits that will be used for the special character comparison. Bit-0 in the Xon, Xoff
Registers corresponds with the LSB bit for the receive character.

2.16     Infrared Mode
The L2551 UART includes the infrared encoder and decoder compatible to the IrDA (Infrared Data
Association) version 1.0. The IrDA 1.0 standard that stipulates the infrared encoder sends out a 3/16 of a bit
wide HIGH-pulse for each “0” bit in the transmit data stream. This signal encoding reduces the on-time of the
infrared LED, hence reduces the power consumption. See Figure 12 below.
The infrared encoder and decoder are enabled by setting MCR register bit-6 to a ‘1’. When the infrared feature
is enabled, the transmit data output, TX, idles at logic zero level. Likewise, the RX input assumes an idle level
of logic zero from a reset and power up, see Figure 12.
Typically, the wireless infrared decoder receives the input pulse from the infrared sensing diode on the RX pin.
Each time it senses a light pulse, it returns a logic 1 to the data bit stream.

 2.17      Sleep Mode with Auto Wake-Up and PowerSave Feature
The L2551 supports low voltage system designs, hence, a sleep mode with auto wake-up and PowerSave
feature is included to reduce power consumption when the device is not actively used.
  2.17.1     Sleep Mode
All of these conditions must be satisfied for the L2551 to enter sleep mode:
      ■ no interrupts pending for both channels of the L2551 (ISR bit-0 = 1)
      ■ divisor is a non-zero value (ie. DLL = 0x1)
      ■ sleep mode of both channels are enabled (IER bit-4 = 1)
      ■ modem inputs are not toggling (MSR bits 0-3 = 0)
      ■ RX input pins are idling at a logic 1
The L2551 stops its crystal oscillator to conserve power in the sleep mode. User can check the XTAL2 pin for
no clock output as an indication that the device has entered the sleep mode.
The L2551 resumes normal operation by any of the following when PowerSave mode is disabled:
      ■ a receive data start bit transition (logic 1 to 0)
      ■ a data byte is loaded to the transmitter, THR or FIFO
      ■ a change of logic state on any of the modem or general purpose serial inputs: CTS#, DSR#, CD#, RI#
If the L2551 is awakened by any one of the above conditions, it will return to the sleep mode automatically after
all interrupting conditions have been serviced and cleared. If the L2551 is awakened by the modem inputs, a
read to the MSR is required to reset the modem inputs. In any case, the sleep mode will not be entered while
an interrupt is pending from channel A or B. The L2551 will stay in the sleep mode of operation until it is
disabled by setting IER bit-4 to a logic 0.
A word of caution: owing to the starting up delay of the crystal oscillator after waking up from sleep mode, the
first few receive characters may be lost. The number of characters lost during the restart also depends on your
operating data rate. More characters are lost when operating at higher data rate. Also, it is important to keep
RX A/B inputs idling at logic 1 or “marking” condition during sleep mode to avoid receiving a “break” condition
upon the restart. This may occur when the external interface transceivers (RS-232, RS-485 or another type)
are also put to sleep mode and cannot maintain the “marking” condition. To avoid this, the designer can use a
47k-100k ohm pull-up resistor on the RXA and RXB pins.
  2.17.2     PowerSave Feature
If the address lines, data bus lines, IOW#, IOR#, CSA#, CSB#, and modem input lines remain steady when the
L2551 is in sleep mode, the maximum current will be in the microamp range as specified in the DC Electrical
Characteristics on page 36. If the input lines are floating or are toggling while the L2551 is in sleep mode, the
current can be up to 100 times more. If not using the PowerSave feature, then an external buffer would be
required to keep the address and data bus lines from toggling or floating to achieve the low current. But if the
PowerSave feature is enabled (pin 12 of the 48-TQFP or pin 9 of the 32-QFN is connected to VCC), this will
eliminate the need for an external buffer by internally isolating the address, data and control signals (see
Figure 1 on page 1) from other bus activities that could cause wasteful power drain. The L2551 enters
PowerSave mode when the PWRSAVE pin is connected to VCC and the L2551 is in sleep mode (see Sleep
Mode section above).
Since PowerSave mode isolates the address, data and control signals, the device will wake-up by:
      ■ a receive data start bit transition (logic 1 to 0)
      ■ a change of logic state on any of the modem or general purpose serial inputs: CTS#, DSR#, CD#, RI#
The L2551 will return to the PowerSave mode automatically after a read to the MSR (to reset the modem
inputs) and all interrupting conditions have been serviced and cleared. The L2551 will stay in the PowerSave
mode of operation until it is disabled by setting IER bit-4 to a logic 0 and/or the PowerSave pin is connected to
GND.

2.18         Internal Loopback
The L2551 UART provides an internal loopback capability for system diagnostic purposes. The internal
loopback mode is enabled by setting MCR register bit-4 to logic 1. All regular UART functions operate normally.
Figure 13 shows how the modem port signals are re-configured. Transmit data from the transmit shift register
output is internally routed to the receive shift register input allowing the system to receive the same data that it
was sending. The TX pin is held at logic 1 or mark condition while RTS# and DTR# are de-asserted, and
CTS#, DSR# CD# and RI# inputs are ignored. Caution: the RX input pins must be held to a logic 1 during
loopback test else upon exiting the loopback test the UART may detect and report a false “break” signal. Also,
Auto RTS/CTS is not supported during internal loopback.

 4.0 INTERNAL REGISTER DESCRIPTIONS
 4.1      Receive Holding Register (RHR) - Read- Only
SEE ”RECEIVER” ON PAGE 14.
 4.2      Transmit Holding Register (THR) - Write-Only
SEE ”TRANSMITTER” ON PAGE 13.
 4.3      Interrupt Enable Register (IER) - Read/Write
The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receive data ready, transmit empty, line status
and modem status registers. These interrupts are reported in the Interrupt Status Register (ISR).
 4.3.1       IER versus Receive FIFO Interrupt Mode Operation
When the receive FIFO (FCR BIT-0 = 1) and receive interrupts (IER BIT-0 = 1) are enabled, the RHR interrupts
(see ISR bits 2 and 3) status will reflect the following:
A. The receive data available interrupts are issued to the host when the FIFO has reached the programmed
     trigger level. It will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
B. FIFO level will be reflected in the ISR register when the FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register
     status bit and the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
C. The receive data ready bit (LSR BIT-0) is set as soon as a character is transferred from the shift register to
     the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
 4.3.2       IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO Polled Mode Operation
When FCR BIT-0 equals a logic 1 for FIFO enable; resetting IER bits 0-3 enables the XR16L2551 in the FIFO
polled mode of operation. Since the receiver and transmitter have separate bits in the LSR either or both can
be used in the polled mode by selecting respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
A. LSR BIT-0 indicates there is data in RHR or RX FIFO.
B. LSR BIT-1 indicates an overrun error has occurred and that data in the FIFO may not be valid.
C. LSR BIT 2-4 provides the type of receive data errors encountered for the data byte in RHR, if any.
D. LSR BIT-5 indicates Transmit FIFO is empty.
E. LSR BIT-6 indicates when both the transmit FIFO and TSR are empty.
F. LSR BIT-7 indicates a data error in at least one character in the RX FIFO.

IER[0]: RHR Interrupt Enable
The receive data ready interrupt will be issued when RHR has a data character in the non-FIFO mode or when
the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level in the FIFO mode.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receive data ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver data ready interrupt.
IER[1]: THR Interrupt Enable
This bit enables the Transmit Ready interrupt which is issued whenever the Transmit FIFO becomes empty. If
the Transmit FIFO is empty when this bit is enabled, an interrupt will be generated.
• Logic 0 = Disable Transmit Ready interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Transmit Ready interrupt.
IER[2]: Receive Line Status Interrupt Enable
If any of the LSR register bits 1, 2, 3 or 4 is a logic 1, it will generate an interrupt to inform the host controller
about the error status of the current data byte in FIFO. LSR bit-1 generates an interrupt immediately when the
character has been received. LSR bits 2-4 generate an interrupt when the character with errors is read out of
the FIFO.
• Logic 0 = Disable the receiver line status interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the receiver line status interrupt.
IER[3]: Modem Status Interrupt Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable the modem status register interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the modem status register interrupt.
IER[4]: Sleep Mode Enable (requires EFR bit-4 = 1)
• Logic 0 = Disable Sleep Mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Sleep Mode. See Sleep Mode section for further details.
IER[5]: Xoff Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the software flow control, receive Xoff interrupt. (default)
• Logic 1 = Enable the software flow control, receive Xoff interrupt. See Software Flow Control section for
   details.
IER[6]: RTS# Output Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the RTS# interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the RTS# interrupt. The UART issues an interrupt when the RTS# pin makes a transition
   from low to high.
IER[7]: CTS# Input Interrupt Enable (requires EFR bit-4=1)
• Logic 0 = Disable the CTS# interrupt (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable the CTS# interrupt. The UART issues an interrupt when CTS# pin makes a transition from
   low to high.

  4.4    Interrupt Status Register (ISR) - Read-Only
The UART provides multiple levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external software interaction. The
Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with six interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the
ISR will give the user the current highest pending interrupt level to be serviced, others are queued up to be
serviced next. No other interrupts are acknowledged until the pending interrupt is serviced. The Interrupt
Source Table, Table 10, shows the data values (bit 0-5) for the interrupt priority levels and the interrupt sources
associated with each of these interrupt levels.
  4.4.1     Interrupt Generation:
• LSR is by any of the LSR bits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
• RXRDY is by RX trigger level.
• RXRDY Time-out is by a 4-char plus 12 bits delay timer.
• TXRDY is by TX FIFO empty.
• MSR is by any of the MSR bits 0, 1, 2 and 3.
• Receive Xoff/Special character is by detection of a Xoff or Special character.
• CTS# is when its transmitter toggles the input pin (from low to high) during auto CTS flow control.
• RTS# is when its receiver toggles the output pin (from low to high) during auto RTS flow control.
  4.4.2     Interrupt Clearing:
• LSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the LSR register (but flags and tags not cleared until character(s) that
   generated the interrupt(s) has been emptied or cleared from FIFO).
• RXRDY interrupt is cleared by reading data until FIFO falls below the trigger level.
• RXRDY Time-out interrupt is cleared by reading RHR.
• TXRDY interrupt is cleared by a read to the ISR register or writing to THR.
• MSR interrupt is cleared by a read to the MSR register.
• Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR or when Xon character(s) is received.
• Special character interrupt is cleared by a read to ISR or after the next character is received.
• RTS# and CTS# flow control interrupts are cleared by a read to the MSR register.

These bits indicate the source for a pending interrupt at interrupt priority levels (See Interrupt Source
Table 10).
ISR[4]: Xoff or Special Character Interrupt Status
This bit is enabled when EFR bit-4 is set to a logic 1. ISR bit-4 indicates that the receiver detected a data match
of the Xoff character(s). If this is an Xoff interrupt, it can be cleared by a read to the ISR or when an Xon
character is received. If it is a special character interrupt, it will automatically clear after the next character is
received.

This bit is enabled when EFR bit-4 is set to a logic 1. ISR bit-5 indicates that the CTS# or RTS# has changed
state from low to high.
ISR[7:6]: FIFO Enable Status
These bits are set to a logic 0 when the FIFOs are disabled. They are set to a logic 1 when the FIFOs are
enabled.
 4.5      FIFO Control Register (FCR) - Write-Only
This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the transmit/receive FIFO trigger levels, and
select the DMA mode. The DMA, and FIFO modes are defined as follows:
FCR[0]: TX and RX FIFO Enable

  cleared or altered). This bit will return to a logic 0 after resetting the FIFO.
FCR[2]: TX FIFO Reset
This bit is only active when FCR bit-0 is a ‘1’.
• Logic 0 = No transmit FIFO reset (default).

LCR[3]: TX and RX Parity Select
Parity or no parity can be selected via this bit. The parity bit is a simple way used in communications for data
integrity check. See Table 12 for parity selection summary below.
• Logic 0 = No parity.
• Logic 1 = A parity bit is generated during the transmission while the receiver checks for parity error of the
   data character received.

LCR[4]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled with LCR bit-3 set to a logic 1, LCR BIT-4 selects the even or odd parity format.
• Logic 0 = ODD Parity is generated by forcing an odd number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format (default).
• Logic 1 = EVEN Parity is generated by forcing an even number of logic 1’s in the transmitted character. The
   receiver must be programmed to check the same format.
LCR[5]: TX and RX Parity Select
If the parity bit is enabled, LCR BIT-5 selects the forced parity format.
• LCR[5] = logic 0, parity is not forced (default).
• LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 0, parity bit is forced to a logical 1 for the transmit and receive data.
• LCR[5] = logic 1 and LCR[4] = logic 1, parity bit is forced to a logical 0 for the transmit and receive data.

LCR[6]: Transmit Break Enable
When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a
“space’, logic 0, state). This condition remains, until disabled by setting LCR bit-6 to a logic 0.
• Logic 0 = No TX break condition (default).
• Logic 1 = Forces the transmitter output (TX) to a “space”, logic 0, for alerting the remote receiver of a line
   break condition.
LCR[7]: Baud Rate Divisors (DLL/DLM) Enable
• Logic 0 = Data registers are selected (default).

MCR[1]: RTS# Output
The RTS# pin is a modem control output. If the modem interface is not used, this output may be used as a
general purpose output.
• Logic 0 = Force RTS# output to a logic 1 (default).
• Logic 1 = Force RTS# output to a logic 0.
MCR[2]: Reserved
OP1# is not available as an output pin on the L2551. But it is available for use during Internal Loopback Mode.
In the Loopback Mode, this bit is used to write the state of the modem RI# interface signal.
MCR[3]: OP2# Output / INT Output Enable
This bit enables and disables the operation of INT, interrupt output. If INT output is not used, OP2# can be
used as a general purpose output. This bit does not affect the IRQ# output during Motorola mode.
• Logic 0 = INT (A-B) outputs disabled (three state mode) and OP2# output set to a logic 1 (default).
• Logic 1 = INT (A-B) outputs enabled (active mode) and OP2# output set to a logic 0.
MCR[4]: Internal Loopback Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable loopback mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable local loopback mode, see loopback section and Figure 13.
MCR[5]: Xon-Any Enable
• Logic 0 = Disable Xon-Any function (for 16C550 compatibility, default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Xon-Any function. In this mode, any RX character received will resume transmit operation.
  The RX character will be loaded into the RX FIFO , unless the RX character is an Xon or Xoff character and
  the L2551 is programmed to use the Xon/Xoff flow control.
MCR[6]: Infrared Encoder/Decoder Enable
• Logic 0 = Enable the standard modem receive and transmit input/output interface. (Default)
• Logic 1 = Enable infrared IrDA receive and transmit inputs/outputs. The TX/RX output/input are routed to the
  infrared encoder/decoder. The data input and output levels conform to the IrDA infrared interface
  requirement. While in this mode, the infrared TX output will be a logic 0 during idle data conditions.
MCR[7]: Clock Prescaler Select
• Logic 0 = Divide by one. The input clock from the crystal or external clock is fed directly to the Programmable
  Baud Rate Generator without further modification, i.e., divide by one (default).
• Logic 1 = Divide by four. The prescaler divides the input clock from the crystal or external clock by four and
  feeds it to the Programmable Baud Rate Generator, hence, data rates become one forth.
 4.8     Line Status Register (LSR) - Read Only
This register provides the status of data transfers between the UART and the host.
LSR[0]: Receive Data Ready Indicator
• Logic 0 = No data in receive holding register or FIFO (default).
• Logic 1 = Data has been received and is saved in the receive holding register or FIFO.

LSR[1]: Receiver Overrun Flag
• Logic 0 = No overrun error (default).
• Logic 1 = Overrun error. A data overrun error condition occurred in the receive shift register. This happens
   when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In this case the previous data in the receive shift register
   is overwritten. Note that under this condition the data byte in the receive shift register is not transferred into
   the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error. An interrupt will be generated
   immediately if LSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-2).
LSR[2]: Receive Data Parity Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No parity error (default).
• Logic 1 = Parity error. The receive character in RHR does not have correct parity information and is suspect.
   This error is associated with the character available for reading in RHR. If the LSR interrupt is enabled (IER
   bit-2), an interrupt will be generated when the character is in the RHR.
LSR[3]: Receive Data Framing Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No framing error (default).
• Logic 1 = Framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). This error is associated with
   the character available for reading in RHR. If the LSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-2), an interrupt will be
   generated when the character is in the RHR.
LSR[4]: Receive Break Flag
• Logic 0 = No break condition (default).
• Logic 1 = The receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for at least one character frame time). In the
   FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded into the FIFO. The break indication remains until the RX
   input returns to the idle condition, “mark” or logic 1. If the LSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-2), an interrupt will
   be generated when the character is in the RHR.
LSR[5]: Transmit Holding Register Empty Flag
This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator. This bit indicates that the transmitter is ready to
accept a new character for transmission. In addition, this bit causes the UART to issue an interrupt to the host
when the THR interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when the last data byte is transferred from
the transmit holding register to the transmit shift register. The bit is reset to logic 0 concurrently with the data
loading to the transmit holding register by the host. In the FIFO mode this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is
empty, it is cleared when the transmit FIFO contains at least 1 byte.
LSR[6]: THR and TSR Empty Flag
This bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmitter goes idle. It is set to logic 0 whenever either the THR or
TSR contains a data character. In the FIFO mode this bit is set to a logic 1 whenever the transmit FIFO and
transmit shift register are both empty.
LSR[7]: Receive FIFO Data Error Flag
• Logic 0 = No FIFO error (default).
• Logic 1 = A global indicator for the sum of all error bits in the RX FIFO. At least one parity error, framing error
   or break indication is in the FIFO data. This bit clears when there is no more error(s) in the FIFO.
 4.9       Modem Status Register (MSR) - Read Only
This register provides the current state of the modem interface signals, or other peripheral device that the
UART is connected. Lower four bits of this register are used to indicate the changed information. These bits
are set to a logic 1 whenever a signal from the modem changes state. These bits may be used as general
purpose inputs/outputs when they are not used with modem signals.

MSR[0]: Delta CTS# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CTS# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The CTS# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
  will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[1]: Delta DSR# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on DSR# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The DSR# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem status interrupt
  will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[2]: Delta RI# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on RI# input (default).
• Logic 1 = The RI# input has changed from a logic 0 to a logic 1, ending of the ringing signal. A modem status
  interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[3]: Delta CD# Input Flag
• Logic 0 = No change on CD# input (default).
• Logic 1 = Indicates that the CD# input has changed state since the last time it was monitored. A modem
  status interrupt will be generated if MSR interrupt is enabled (IER bit-3).
MSR[4]: CTS Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the CTS# input. However in the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to
the RTS# bit in the MCR register. The CTS# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem
interface is not used.
MSR[5]: DSR Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the DSR# input. In the loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to the DTR#
bit in the MCR register. The DSR# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is
not used.
MSR[6]: RI Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the RI# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-2 in the
MCR register. The RI# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
MSR[7]: CD Input Status
Normally this bit is the compliment of the CD# input. In the loopback mode this bit is equivalent to bit-3 in the
MCR register. The CD# input may be used as a general purpose input when the modem interface is not used.
 4.10     Scratch Pad Register (SPR) - Read/Write
This is a 8-bit general purpose register for the user to store temporary data. The content of this register is

this register, DLL and DLM should be set to 0x00.
 4.14     Enhanced Feature Register (EFR)
Enhanced features are enabled or disabled using this register. Bit 0-3 provide single or dual consecutive
character software flow control selection (see Table 13). When the Xon1 and Xon2 and Xoff1 and Xoff2 modes
are selected, the double 8-bit words are concatenated into two sequential characters. Caution: note that
whenever changing the TX or RX flow control bits, always reset all bits back to logic 0 (disable) before
programming a new setting.
EFR[3:0]: Software Flow Control Select
Single character and dual sequential characters software flow control is supported. Combinations of software
flow control can be selected by programming these bits.

EFR[4]: Enhanced Function Bits Enable
Enhanced function control bit. This bit enables IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, and MCR bits 5-7 to be modified.
After modifying any enhanced bits, EFR bit-4 can be set to a logic 0 to latch the new values. This feature
prevents legacy software from altering or overwriting the enhanced functions once set. Normally, it is
recommended to leave it enabled, logic 1.
• Logic 0 = modification disable/latch enhanced features. IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, and MCR bits 5-7 are
   saved to retain the user settings. After a reset, the IER bits 4-7, ISR bits 4-5, and MCR bits 5-7are set to a
   logic 0 to be compatible with ST16C550 mode (default).
• Logic 1 = Enables the above-mentioned register bits to be modified by the user.

EFR[5]: Special Character Detect Enable
• Logic 0 = Special Character Detect Disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Special Character Detect Enabled. The UART compares each incoming receive character with
  data in Xoff-2 register. If a match exists, the receive data will be transferred to FIFO and ISR bit-4 will be set
  to indicate detection of the special character. Bit-0 corresponds with the LSB bit of the receive character. If
  flow control is set for comparing Xon1, Xoff1 (EFR [1:0]= ‘10’) then flow control and special character work
  normally. However, if flow control is set for comparing Xon2, Xoff2 (EFR[1:0]= ‘01’) then flow control works
  normally, but Xoff2 will not go to the FIFO, and will generate an Xoff interrupt and a special character
  interrupt, if enabled via IER bit-5. Special character interrupts are cleared automatically after the next
  received character.
EFR[6]: Auto RTS Flow Control Enable
RTS# output may be used for hardware flow control by setting EFR bit-6 to logic 1. When Auto RTS is
selected, an interrupt will be generated when the receive FIFO is filled to the programmed trigger level and
RTS de-asserts to a logic 1 at the next upper trigger level. RTS# will return to a logic 0 when FIFO data falls
below the next lower trigger level. The RTS# output must be asserted (logic 0) before the auto RTS can take
effect. RTS# pin will function as a general purpose output when hardware flow control is disabled.
• Logic 0 = Automatic RTS flow control is disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Automatic RTS flow control.
EFR[7]: Auto CTS Flow Control Enable
Automatic CTS Flow Control.
• Logic 0 = Automatic CTS flow control is disabled (default).
• Logic 1 = Enable Automatic CTS flow control. Data transmission stops when CTS# input de-asserts to logic
  1. Data transmission resumes when CTS# returns to a logic 0.

Test 1: The following inputs must remain steady at VCC or GND state to minimize sleep current: A0-A2, D0-D7,
IOR#, IOW# (R/W#), CSA# (CS#), CSB# (A3) and all modem inputs. Also, RXA and RXB inputs must idle at
logic 1 state while asleep. Floating inputs may result in sleep currents in the mA range. For Powersave, the
UART internally isolates all of these inputs therefore not requiring them to remain steady.
