1. General description
                          The SC16C2552B is a two channel Universal Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter
                          (UART) used for serial data communications. Its principal function is to convert parallel
                          data into serial data, and vice versa. The UART can handle serial data rates up to
                          5 Mbit/s.
                          The SC16C2552B is pin compatible with the PC16552 and ST16C2552. The
                          SC16C2552B provides enhanced UART functions with 16-byte FIFOs, modem control
                          interface, DMA mode data transfer and concurrent writes to control registers of both
                          channels. The DMA mode data transfer is controlled by the FIFO trigger levels and the
                          RXRDY and TXRDY signals. On-board status registers provide the user with error
                          indications and operational status. System interrupts and modem control features may be
                          tailored by software to meet specific user requirements. An internal loopback capability
                          allows on-board diagnostics. Independent programmable baud rate generators are
                          provided to select transmit and receive baud rates.
                          The SC16C2552B operates at 5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V and the industrial temperature range,
                          and is available in a plastic PLCC44 package.

CDB            30        I        channels A through B. A logic 0 on this pin indicates that a carrier has been detected by the
                                  modem for that channel.
CHSEL          16        I        Channel select. UART channel A or B is selected by the logic state of this pin when CS is a
                                  logic 0. A logic 0 on CHSEL selects the UART channel B, while a logic 1 selects UART
                                  channel A. Bit 0 of AFR register can temporarily override CHSEL function, allowing user to

 DSRB         29       I       channels A through B. A logic 0 on this pin indicates the modem or data set is powered-on
                               and is ready for data exchange with the UART.
 DTRA         37       O       Data Terminal Ready A, B (active LOW). These outputs are associated with individual

                               powered-on and ready. This pin can be controlled via the modem control register. Writing a
                               logic 1 to MCR[0] will set the DTRn output to logic 0, enabling the modem. This pin will be a

                               receiver errors, available receiver buffer data, transmit buffer empty, or when a modem
                               status flag is detected.

                               function or output on these pins. OP2 (interrupt enable), BAUDOUT, and RXRDY are signal
                               functions that may be selected by the AFR. These signal functions are described as follows:
                                  OP2. When OP2 is selected, the MFn pin is a logic 0 when MCR[3] is set to a logic 1.
                                  A logic 1 is the default signal condition that is available following a master reset or
                                  power-up.
                                  BAUDOUT. When BAUDOUT function is selected, the 16× baud rate clock output is
                                  available at this pin.
                                  RXRDY. RXRDY is primarily intended for monitoring DMA mode 1 transfers for the receive
                                  data FIFOs. A logic 0 indicates there is receive data to read/unload, i.e., receive ready
                                  status with one or more RX characters available in the FIFO/RHR. This pin is a logic 1
                                  when the FIFO/RHR is empty or when the programmed trigger level has not been
                                  reached. This signal can also be used for single mode transfers (DMA mode 0).
 RESET        21       I       Reset (active HIGH). A logic 1 on this pin will reset the internal registers and all the outputs.
                               The UART transmitter output and the receiver input will be disabled during reset time. See
                               Section 7.11 “SC16C2552B external reset condition” for initialization details.

 RIB          31       I       channels A through B. A logic 0 on this pin indicates the modem has received a ringing
                               signal from the telephone line. A logic 1 transition on this input pin will generate an interrupt
                               if modem status interrupt is enabled.

                               transmit data. Writing a logic 1 in the modem control register MCR[1] will set this pin to a
                               logic 0, indicating that the transmitter is ready to transmit data. After a reset, this pin will be

6. Functional description
                       The SC16C2552B provides serial asynchronous receive data synchronization,
                       parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions for both the transmitter and
                       receiver sections. These functions are necessary for converting the serial data stream into
                       parallel data that is required with digital data systems. Synchronization for the serial data
                       stream is accomplished by adding start and stop bits to the transmit data to form a data
                       character. Data integrity is ensured by attaching a parity bit to the data character. The
                       parity bit is checked by the receiver for any transmission bit errors. The SC16C2552B is
                       fabricated with an advanced CMOS process.
                       The SC16C2552B is an upward solution that provides a dual UART capability with
                       16 bytes of transmit and receive FIFO memory, instead of none in the 16C450. The
                       SC16C2552B is designed to work with high speed modems and shared network
                       environments that require fast data processing time. Increased performance is realized in
                       the SC16C2552B by the transmit and receive FIFOs. This allows the external processor to
                       handle more networking tasks within a given time. In addition, the four selectable receive
                       FIFO trigger interrupt levels are uniquely provided for maximum data throughput
                       performance, especially when operating in a multi-channel environment. The FIFO
                       memory greatly reduces the bandwidth requirement of the external controlling CPU,
                       increases performance, and reduces power consumption.
                       The SC16C2552B is capable of operation up to 1.5 Mbit/s with a 24 MHz crystal. With a
                       crystal or external clock input of 7.3728 MHz, the user can select data rates up to
                       460.8 kbit/s.
                       The rich feature set of the SC16C2552B is available through internal registers. Selectable
                       receive FIFO trigger levels, selectable TX and RX baud rates, and modem interface
                       controls are all standard features.
                   6.1 UART A-B functions
                       The UART provides the user with the capability to bidirectionally transfer information
                       between an external CPU, the SC16C2552B package, and an external serial device. A
                       logic 0 on chip select pin CS and a logic 1 on CHSEL allows the user to configure, send
                       data, and/or receive data via UART channel A. A logic 0 on chip select pin CS and a
                       logic 0 on CHSEL allows the user to configure, send data, and/or receive data via UART
                       channel B. Individual channel select functions are shown in Table 3.
                       Table 3.     Serial port selection
                        Chip select     UART select
                        CS = 1          none
                        CS = 0          UART channel selected as follows:
                                           CHSEL = 1: UART channel A
                                           CHSEL = 0: UART channel B
                       During a write mode cycle, the setting of AFR[0] to a logic 1 will override the CHSEL
                       selection and allow a simultaneous write to both UART channel sections. This functional
                       capability allows the registers in both UART channels to be modified concurrently, saving
                       individual channel initialization time. Caution should be considered, however, when using
                       this capability. Any in-process serial data transfer may be disrupted by changing an active
                       channel’s mode.

                   6.2 Internal registers
                       The SC16C2552B provides two sets of internal registers (A and B) consisting of
                       13 registers each for monitoring and controlling the functions of each channel of the
                       UART. These registers are shown in Table 4. The UART registers function as data holding

                   6.3 FIFO operation
                       The 16 byte transmit and receive data FIFOs are enabled by the FIFO Control Register
                       (FCR) bit 0. The user can set the receive trigger level via FCR[7:6], but not the transmit
                       trigger level. The receiver FIFO section includes a time-out function to ensure data is
                       delivered to the external CPU. A time-out interrupt is generated whenever the Receive
                       Holding Register (RHR) has not been read following the loading of a character, or the
                       receive trigger interrupt is generated when RX FIFO level is equal to the program RX
                       trigger value.
                   6.4 Time-out interrupts
                       The interrupts are enabled by IER[3:0]. Care must be taken when handling these
                       interrupts. Following a reset, if the transmitter interrupt is enabled, the SC16C2552B will
                       issue an interrupt to indicate that the Transmit Holding Register is empty. The ISR register
                       provides the current singular highest priority interrupt only. A condition can exist where a
                       higher priority interrupt may mask the lower priority interrupt(s). Only after servicing the
                       higher pending interrupt will the lower priority interrupt(s) be reflected in the status
                       register. Servicing the interrupt without investigating further interrupt conditions can result
                       in data errors.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                      SC16C2552B
                                            5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                       When two interrupt conditions have the same priority, it is important to service these
                       interrupts correctly. Receive Data Ready and Receive Time-Out have the same interrupt
                       priority (when enabled by IER[0]). The receiver issues an interrupt after the number of
                       characters have reached the programmed trigger level. In this case, the SC16C2552B
                       FIFO may hold more characters than the programmed trigger level. Following the removal
                       of a data byte, the user should re-check LSR[0] for additional characters. A Receive
                       Time-Out will not occur if the receive FIFO is empty. The time-out counter is reset at the
                       center of each stop bit received or each time the receive holding register (RHR) is read.
                       The actual time-out value is 4 character time.
                   6.5 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C2552B supports high speed modem technologies that have increased input
                       data rates by employing data compression schemes. For example, a 33.6 kbit/s modem
                       that employs data compression may require a 115.2 kbit/s input data rate. A 128.0 kbit/s
                       ISDN modem that supports data compression may need an input data rate of 460.8 kbit/s.
                       A baud rate generator is provided for each UART channel, allowing independent TX/RX
                       channel control. The programmable Baud Rate Generator (BRG) is capable of accepting
                       an input clock up to 80 MHz, as required for supporting a 5 Mbit/s data rate. The
                       SC16C2552B can be configured for internal or external clock operation. For internal clock
                       oscillator operation, an industry standard microprocessor crystal is connected externally
                       between the XTAL1 and XTAL2 pins. Alternatively, an external clock can be connected to
                       the XTAL1 pin to clock the internal baud rate generator for standard or custom rates (see
                       Table 5).
                       The generator divides the input 16× clock by any divisor from 1 to (216 − 1). The
                       SC16C2552B divides the basic external clock by 16. The basic 16× clock provides table
                       rates to support standard and custom applications using the same system design. The
                       rate table is configured via the DLL and DLM internal register functions. Customized baud
                       rates can be achieved by selecting the proper divisor values for the MSB and LSB
                       sections of baud rate generator.
                       Programming the baud rate generator registers DLM (MSB) and DLL (LSB) provides a
                       user capability for selecting the desired final baud rate. The example in Table 5 shows the
                       selectable baud rate table available when using a 1.8432 MHz external clock input.

                   6.6 DMA operation
                       The SC16C2552B FIFO trigger level provides additional flexibility to the user for block
                       mode operation. LSR[6:5] provide an indication when the transmitter is empty or has an
                       empty location(s). The user can optionally operate the transmit and receive FIFOs in the
                       DMA mode (FCR[3]). When the transmit and receive FIFOs are enabled and the DMA
                       mode is de-activated (DMA Mode 0), the SC16C2552B activates the interrupt output pin
                       for each data transmit or receive operation. When DMA mode is activated (DMA Mode 1),
                       the user takes the advantage of block mode operation by loading or unloading the FIFO in
                       a block sequence determined by the receive trigger level and the transmit FIFO. In this
                       mode, the SC16C2552B sets the interrupt output pin when characters in the transmit
                       FIFO is below 16, or the characters in the receive FIFOs are above the receive trigger
                       level.
                   6.7 Loopback mode
                       The internal loopback capability allows on-board diagnostics. In the Loopback mode, the
                       normal modem interface pins are disconnected and reconfigured for loopback internally.
                       MCR[3:0] register bits are used for controlling loopback diagnostic testing. In the
                       Loopback mode, INT enable and MCR[2] in the MCR register (bits 3:2) control the modem
                       RI and CD inputs, respectively. MCR signals DTR (bit 0) and RTS (bit 1) are used to
                       control the modem DSR and CTS inputs, respectively. The transmitter output (TX) and the
                       receiver input (RX) are disconnected from their associated interface pins, and instead are
                       connected together internally (see Figure 4). The CTS, DSR, CD, and RI are
                       disconnected from their normal modem control inputs pins, and instead are connected
                       internally to RTS, DTR, OP2 and OP1. Loopback test data is entered into the transmit
                       holding register via the user data bus interface, D0 to D7. The transmit UART serializes
                       the data and passes the serial data to the receive UART via the internal loopback
                       connection. The receive UART converts the serial data back into parallel data that is then

                           made available at the user data interface D0 to D7. The user optionally compares the
                           received data to the initial transmitted data for verifying error-free operation of the UART
                           TX/RX circuits.
                           In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts are fully operational. The Modem
                           Control Interrupts are also operational. However, the interrupts can only be read using
                           lower four bits of the Modem Status Register (MSR[3:0]) instead of the four Modem Status
                           Register bits 7:4. The interrupts are still controlled by the IER.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                 SC16C2552B
                                                5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.1 Transmit Holding Register (THR) and Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                       The serial transmitter section consists of an 8-bit Transmit Hold Register (THR) and
                       Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The status of the THR is provided in the Line Status
                       Register (LSR). Writing to the THR transfers the contents of the data bus (D7 through D0)
                       to the TSR and UART via the THR, providing that the THR is empty. The THR empty flag
                       in the LSR[5] register will be set to a logic 1 when the transmitter is empty or when data is
                       transferred to the TSR.
                       The serial receive section also contains an 8-bit Receive Holding Register (RHR) and a
                       Receive Serial Shift Register (RSR). Receive data is removed from the SC16C2552B and
                       receive FIFO by reading the RHR register. The receive section provides a mechanism to
                       prevent false starts. On the falling edge of a start or false start bit, an internal receiver
                       counter starts counting clocks at the 16× clock rate. After 71⁄2 clocks, the start bit time
                       should be shifted to the center of the start bit. At this time the start bit is sampled, and if it
                       is still a logic 0 it is validated. Evaluating the start bit in this manner prevents the receiver
                       from assembling a false character. Receiver status codes will be posted in the LSR.
                   7.2 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                       The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) masks the interrupts from receiver ready, transmitter
                       empty, line status and modem status registers. These interrupts would normally be seen
                       on the INTA, INTB output pins.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                      SC16C2552B
                                           5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                7.2.1 IER versus Transmit/Receive FIFO interrupt mode operation
                      When the receive FIFO (FCR[0] = logic 1) and receive interrupts (IER[0] = logic 1) are
                      enabled, the receive interrupts and register status will reflect the following:
                        • The receive RXRDY interrupt (Level 2 ISR interrupt) is issued to the external CPU
                          when the receive FIFO has reached the programmed trigger level. It will be cleared
                          when the receive FIFO drops below the programmed trigger level.
                        • Receive FIFO status will also be reflected in the user accessible ISR register when
                          the receive FIFO trigger level is reached. Both the ISR register receive status bit and
                          the interrupt will be cleared when the FIFO drops below the trigger level.
                        • The receive data ready bit (LSR[0]) is set as soon as a character is transferred from
                          the shift register (RSR) to the receive FIFO. It is reset when the FIFO is empty.
                        • When the Transmit FIFO and interrupts are enabled, an interrupt is generated when
                          the transmit FIFO is empty due to the unloading of the data by the TSR and UART for
                          transmission via the transmission media. The interrupt is cleared either by reading the
                          ISR register or by loading the THR with new data characters.
                7.2.2 IER versus Receive/Transmit FIFO polled mode operation
                      When FCR[0] = logic 1, resetting IER[3:0] enables the SC16C2552B in the FIFO polled
                      mode of operation. In this mode, interrupts are not generated and the user must poll the
                      LSR register for TX and/or RX data status. Since the receiver and transmitter have
                      separate bits in the LSR either or both can be used in the polled mode by selecting
                      respective transmit or receive control bit(s).
                        • LSR[0] will be a logic 1 as long as there is one byte in the receive FIFO.
                        • LSR[4:1] will provide the type of receive errors or a receive break, if encountered.
                        • LSR[5] will indicate when the transmit FIFO is empty.
                        • LSR[6] will indicate when both the transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are empty.
                        • LSR[7] will show if any FIFO data errors occurred.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                               SC16C2552B
                                            5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This register is used to enable the FIFOs, clear the FIFOs, set the receive FIFO trigger
                       levels and select the DMA mode.
                7.3.1 DMA mode
               7.3.1.1 Mode 0 (FCR bit 3 = 0)
                       Set and enable the interrupt for each single transmit or receive operation and is similar to
                       the 16C450 mode. Transmit Ready (TXRDY) will go to a logic 0 whenever an empty
                       transmit space is available in the Transmit Holding Register (THR). Receive Ready
                       (RXRDY) at the MFn pin will go to a logic 0 whenever the Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                       is loaded with a character and AFR[2:1] is set to the RXRDY mode.
               7.3.1.2 Mode 1 (FCR bit 3 = 1)
                       Set and enable the interrupt in a block mode operation. The transmit interrupt is set when
                       the transmit FIFO has at least one empty location. TXRDY remains a logic 0 as long as
                       one empty FIFO location is available. The receive interrupt is set when the receive FIFO
                       fills to the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO continues to fill regardless of the
                       programmed level until the FIFO is full. RXRDY at the MFn pin remains a logic 0 as long
                       as the FIFO fill level is above the programmed trigger level, and AFR[2:1] is set to the
                       RXRDY mode.

                        7:6            FCR[7:6]    RCVR trigger. These bits are used to set the trigger level for the receive
                                                   FIFO interrupt.
                                                   An interrupt is generated when the number of characters in the FIFO
                                                   equals the programmed trigger level. However, the FIFO will continue to
                                                   be loaded until it is full. Refer to Table 9.

                                                   (FIFOs enabled; FCR[0] = logic 1; FCR[3] = logic 0), and when there
                                                   are no characters in the transmit FIFO or Transmit Holding Register, the
                                                   TXRDYn pin will be a logic 0. Once active, the TXRDYn pin will go to a
                                                   logic 1 after the first character is loaded into the Transmit Holding
                                                   Register.

                                                   mode, or in the FIFO mode (FCR[0] = logic 1; FCR[3] = logic 0) and
                                                   there is at least one character in the receive FIFO, the RXRDY signal at
                                                   the MFn pin will be a logic 0. Once active, the RXRDY signal at the

                                                   receiver. Note that the AFR register must be set to the RXRDY mode
                                                   prior to any possible reading of the RXRDY signal.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                              SC16C2552B
                                             5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.4 Interrupt Status Register (ISR)
                       The SC16C2552B provides four levels of prioritized interrupts to minimize external
                       software interaction. The Interrupt Status Register (ISR) provides the user with four
                       interrupt status bits. Performing a read cycle on the ISR will provide the user with the
                       highest pending interrupt level to be serviced. No other interrupts are acknowledged until
                       the pending interrupt is serviced. Whenever the interrupt status register is read, the
                       interrupt status is cleared. However, it should be noted that only the current pending
                       interrupt is cleared by the read. A lower level interrupt may be seen after re-reading the
                       interrupt status bits. Table 10 shows the data values (bits 3:0) for the four prioritized
                       interrupt levels and the interrupt sources associated with each of these interrupt levels.

                   7.5 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       The Line Control Register is used to specify the asynchronous data communication
                       format. The word length, the number of stop bits and the parity are selected by writing the
                       appropriate bits in this register.

                        6        LCR[6]         Set break. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break condition
                                                to be transmitted (the TX output is forced to a logic 0 state). This
                                                condition exists until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.

                   7.6 Modem Control Register (MCR)
                       This register controls the interface with the modem or a peripheral device.

                       4         MCR[4]       Loopback. Enable the local Loopback mode (diagnostics). In this mode the
                                              transmitter output (TX) and the receiver input (RX), CTS, DSR, CD and RI
                                              are disconnected from the SC16C2552B I/O pins. Internally the modem
                                              data and control pins are connected into a loopback data configuration
                                              (see Figure 4). In this mode, the receiver and transmitter interrupts remain
                                              fully operational. The modem control interrupts are also operational, but
                                              the interrupts’ sources are switched to the lower four bits of the Modem
                                              Control. Interrupts continue to be controlled by the IER register.

                       3         MCR[3]       OP2. Used to control the modem CD signal in the Loopback mode.
                                                 logic 0 = sets OP2 to a logic 1 (normal default condition). In the
                                                 Loopback mode, sets CD internally to a logic 1.
                                                 logic 1 = sets OP2 to a logic 0. In the Loopback mode, sets CD internally
                                                 to a logic 0.
                       2         MCR[2]       OP1. This bit is used in the Loopback mode only. In the Loopback mode,
                                              this bit is used to write the state of the modem RI interface signal.

                        6    LSR[6]     THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator. This bit is set to a
                                        logic 1 whenever the Transmit Holding Register and the Transmit Shift Register
                                        are both empty. It is reset to logic 0 whenever either the THR or TSR contains a

                                        indicates that the UART is ready to accept a new character for transmission. In

                                        interrupt enable is set. The THR bit is set to a logic 1 when a character is
                                        transferred from the Transmit Holding Register into the Transmit Shift Register.
                                        The bit is reset to a logic 0 concurrently with the loading of the Transmit Holding
                                        Register by the CPU. In the FIFO mode, this bit is set when the transmit FIFO is
                                        empty; it is cleared when at least 1 byte is written to the transmit FIFO.
                        4    LSR[4]     Break interrupt.
                                           logic 0 = no break condition (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = the receiver received a break signal (RX was a logic 0 for one
                                           character frame time). In the FIFO mode, only one break character is loaded
                                           into the FIFO.
                        3    LSR[3]     Framing error.
                                           logic 0 = no framing error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = framing error. The receive character did not have a valid stop bit(s). In
                                           the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the character at the top of the
                                           FIFO.
                        2    LSR[2]     Parity error.
                                           logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition
                                           logic 1 = parity error. The receive character does not have correct parity
                                           information and is suspect. In the FIFO mode, this error is associated with the
                                           character at the top of the FIFO.
                        1    LSR[1]     Overrun error.
                                           logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                           logic 1 = overrun error. A data overrun error occurred in the Receive Shift
                                           Register. This happens when additional data arrives while the FIFO is full. In
                                           this case, the previous data in the shift register is overwritten. Note that under
                                           this condition, the data byte in the Receive Shift Register is not transferred into
                                           the FIFO, therefore the data in the FIFO is not corrupted by the error.
                        0    LSR[0]     Receive data ready.
                                           logic 0 = no data in Receive Holding Register or FIFO (normal default
                                           condition)

                                           5 V, 3.3 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 16-byte FIFOs
                   7.8 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This register provides the current state of the control interface signals from the modem or
                       other peripheral device to which the SC16C2552B is connected. Four bits of this register
                       are used to indicate the changed information. These bits are set to a logic 1 whenever a
                       control input from the modem changes state. These bits are set to a logic 0 whenever the
                       CPU reads this register.
                       Table 18.  Modem Status Register bits description
                        Bit     Symbol      Description
                        7       MSR[7]      Carrier Detect, CD. During normal operation, this bit is the complement of the
                                            CD input. Reading this bit in the Loopback mode produces the state of
                                            MCR[3] (OP2A/OP2B).
                        6       MSR[6]      Ring Indicator, RI. During normal operation, this bit is the complement of the
                                            RI input. Reading this bit in the Loopback mode produces the state of
                                            MCR[2] (OP1A/OP2A).
                        5       MSR[5]      Data Set Ready, DSR. During normal operation, this bit is the complement of
                                            the DSR input. During the Loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to MCR[0]
                                            (DTR).
                        4       MSR[4]      Clear To Send, CTS. During normal operation, this bit is the complement of
                                            the CTS input. During the Loopback mode, this bit is equivalent to MCR[1]
                                            (RTS).
                        3       MSR[3]      ∆CD [1]
                                              logic 0 = no CD change (normal default condition)

                                              last time it was read. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.

                                              logic 0 = no RI change (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = the RI input to the SC16C2552B has changed from a logic 0 to a
                                              logic 1. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.
                        1       MSR[1]      ∆DSR [1]
                                              logic 0 = no DSR change (normal default condition)
                                              logic 1 = the DSR input to the SC16C2552B has changed state since the
                                              last time it was read. A modem Status Interrupt will be generated.

                   7.9 Scratchpad Register (SPR)
                       The SC16C2552B provides a temporary data register to store 8 bits of user information.
                7.10 Alternate Function Register (AFR)
                       This is a read/write register used to select specific modes of MF operation and to allow
                       both UART register’s sets to be written concurrently.
                       Table 19.   Alternate Function Register bit description
                       Bit      Symbol      Description
                       7:3      AFR[7:3]    Not used. All are initialized to logic 0.
                       2:1      AFR[2:1]    Selects a signal function for output on the MFA, MFB pins. These signal
                                            functions are described as: OP2 (interrupt enable), BAUDOUT, or RXRDY.
                                            Only one signal function can be selected at a time. See Table 20.
                       0        AFR[0]      When this bit is set, CPU can write concurrently to the same register in both
                                            UARTs. This function is intended to reduce the dual UART initialization time.
                                            It can be used by CPU when both channels are initialized to the same state.
                                            The external CPU can set or clear this bit by accessing either register set.
                                            When this bit is set, the Channel Select pin, CHSEL, still selects the channel
                                            to be accessed during read operation. Setting or clearing this bit has no
                                            effect on read operations. The user should ensure that LCR[7] of both
                                            channels are in the same state before executing a concurrent write to the
                                            registers at address 0, 1, or 2.
                                               logic 0 = no concurrent write (normal default condition)
                                               logic 1 = register set A and B are written concurrently with a single external
                                               CPU I/O write operation.

12. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                12.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                12.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                12.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                12.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 16) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 26 and 27

                      > 2.5                         250                 245                  245
                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 16.
