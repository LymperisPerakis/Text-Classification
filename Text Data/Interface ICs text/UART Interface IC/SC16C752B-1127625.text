                 SC16C752B
                 5 V, 2.2 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 64-byte
                 FIFOs
                 Rev. 6 — 30 November 2010                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
              The SC16C752B is a dual Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) with
              64-byte FIFOs, automatic hardware/software flow control, and data rates up to 5 Mbit/s
              (3.3 V and 5 V). The SC16C752B offers enhanced features. It has a Transmission Control
              Register (TCR) that stores receiver FIFO threshold levels to start/stop transmission during
              hardware and software flow control. With the FIFO Rdy register, the software gets the
              status of TXRDYn/RXRDYn for all four ports in one access. On-chip status registers
              provide the user with error indications, operational status, and modem interface control.
              System interrupts may be tailored to meet user requirements. An internal loopback
              capability allows on-board diagnostics.
              The UART transmits data, sent to it over the peripheral 8-bit bus, on the TXn signal and
              receives characters on the RXn signal. Characters can be programmed to be 5 bits, 6 bits,
              7 bits, or 8 bits. The UART has a 64-byte receive FIFO and transmit FIFO and can be
              programmed to interrupt at different trigger levels. The UART generates its own desired
              baud rate based upon a programmable divisor and its input clock. It can transmit even,
              odd, or no parity and 1, 1.5, or 2 stop bits. The receiver can detect break, idle, or framing
              errors, FIFO overflow, and parity errors. The transmitter can detect FIFO underflow. The
              UART also contains a software interface for modem control operations, and has software
              flow control and hardware flow control capabilities.
              The SC16C752B is available in plastic LQFP48 and HVQFN32 packages.

 CDB         16       -       i       UART channels A and B. A logic LOW on these pins indicates that a carrier has
                                      been detected by the modem for that channel. The state of these inputs is

 CSB         11       9       I       CPU and the SC16C752B for the channel(s) addressed. Individual UART
                                      sections (A, B) are addressed by providing a logic LOW on the respective CSA

 CTSB        23       16      I       channels A and B. A logic 0 (LOW) on the CTSn pins indicates the modem or
                                      data set is ready to accept transmit data from the SC16C752B. Status can be
                                      tested by reading MSR[4]. These pins only affect the transmit and receive
                                      operations when auto-CTS function is enabled via the Enhanced Feature

 DSRA        39       -       I       Data Set Ready (active LOW). These inputs are associated with individual
 DSRB        20       -       I       UART channels A and B. A logic 0 (LOW) on these pins indicates the modem or
                                      data set is powered-on and is ready for data exchange with the UART. The state
                                      of these inputs is reflected in the Modem Status Register (MSR).
 DTRA        34       -       O       Data Terminal Ready (active LOW). These outputs are associated with
 DTRB        35       -       O       individual UART channels A and B. A logic 0 (LOW) on these pins indicates that
                                      the SC16C752B is powered-on and ready. These pins can be controlled via the
                                      modem control register. Writing a logic 1 to MCR[0] will set the DTRn output to
                                      logic 0 (LOW), enabling the modem. The output of these pins will be a logic 1
                                      after writing a logic 0 to MCR[0], or after a reset.

 INTB        29       20      O       interrupts INTA and INTB. INTA and INTB are enabled when MCR[3] is set to a
                                      logic 1, interrupt sources are enabled in the Interrupt Enable Register (IER).
                                      Interrupt conditions include: receiver errors, available receiver buffer data,
                                      available transmit buffer space, or when a modem status flag is detected. INTA,
                                      INTB are in the high-impedance state after reset.

                                      will load the contents of an internal register defined by address bits A0 to A2
                                      onto the SC16C752B data bus (D0 to D7) for access by external CPU.

 OPB         9        7           O       and B. The state of these pins is defined by the user through the software
                                          settings of MCR[3]. INTA-INTB are set to active mode and OPA-OPB to a logic 0

                                          RESET is an active HIGH input.
 RIA         41       -           I       Ring Indicator (active LOW). These inputs are associated with individual

                                          received a ringing signal from the telephone line. A LOW-to-HIGH transition on
                                          these input pins generates a modem status interrupt, if enabled. The state of
                                          these inputs is reflected in the Modem Status Register (MSR).
 RTSA        33       23          O       Request to Send (active LOW). These outputs are associated with individual
 RTSB        22       15          O       UART channels, A and B. A logic 0 on the RTSn pin indicates the transmitter
                                          has data ready and waiting to send. Writing a logic 1 in the modem control
                                          register MCR[1] will set this pin to a logic 0, indicating data is available. After a

6. Functional description
                       The SC16C752B UART is pin-compatible with the SC16C2550 UART. It provides more
                       enhanced features. All additional features are provided through a special Enhanced
                       Feature Register (EFR).
                       The UART will perform serial-to-parallel conversion on data characters received from
                       peripheral devices or modems, and parallel-to-parallel conversion on data characters
                       transmitted by the processor. The complete status of each channel of the SC16C752B
                       UART can be read at any time during functional operation by the processor.
                       The SC16C752B can be placed in an alternate mode (FIFO mode) relieving the processor
                       of excessive software overhead by buffering received/transmitted characters. Both the
                       receiver and transmitter FIFOs can store up to 64 bytes (including three additional bits of
                       error status per byte for the receiver FIFO) and have selectable or programmable trigger
                       levels. Primary outputs RXRDYn and TXRDYn allow signalling of DMA transfers.
                       The SC16C752B has selectable hardware flow control and software flow control.
                       Hardware flow control significantly reduces software overhead and increases system
                       efficiency by automatically controlling serial data flow using the RTSn output and CTSn
                       input signals. Software flow control automatically controls data flow by using
                       programmable Xon/Xoff characters.
                       The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that can divide the timing
                       reference clock input by a divisor between 1 and (216 − 1).
                   6.1 Trigger levels
                       The SC16C752B provides independent selectable and programmable trigger levels for
                       both receiver and transmitter DMA and interrupt generation. After reset, both transmitter
                       and receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of
                       one byte. The selectable trigger levels are available via the FIFO Control Register (FCR).
                       The programmable trigger levels are available via the Trigger Level Register (TLR).
                   6.2 Hardware flow control
                       Hardware flow control is comprised of auto-CTS and auto-RTS. Auto-CTS and auto-RTS
                       can be enabled/disabled independently by programming EFR[7:6].
                       With auto-CTS, CTSn must be active before the UART can transmit data.
                       Auto-RTS only activates the RTSn output when there is enough room in the FIFO to
                       receive data and de-activates the RTSn output when the receive FIFO is sufficiently full.
                       The halt and resume trigger levels in the TCR determine the levels at which RTSn is
                       activated/deactivated.
                       If both auto-CTS and auto-RTS are enabled, when RTSn is connected to CTSn, data
                       transmission does not occur unless the receiver FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun
                       errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if
                       the transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

                   6.2.1 Auto-RTS
                             Auto-RTS data flow control originates in the receiver block (see Figure 1 “Block diagram”
                             on page 3). Figure 5 shows RTSn functional timing. The receiver FIFO trigger levels used
                             in auto-RTS are stored in the TCR. RTSn is active if the RX FIFO level is below the halt
                             trigger level in TCR[3:0]. When the receiver FIFO halt trigger level is reached, RTSn is
                             de-asserted. The sending device (e.g., another UART) may send an additional byte after
                             the trigger level is reached (assuming the sending UART has another byte to send)
                             because it may not recognize the de-assertion of RTSn until it has begun sending the
                             additional byte. RTSn is automatically reasserted once the receiver FIFO reaches the
                             resume trigger level programmed via TCR[7:4]. This re-assertion allows the sending
                             device to resume transmission.

                 6.2.2 Auto-CTS
                           The transmitter circuitry checks CTSn before sending the next data byte. When CTSn is
                           active, the transmitter sends the next byte. To stop the transmitter from sending the
                           following byte, CTSn must be de-asserted before the middle of the last stop bit that is
                           currently being sent. The auto-CTS function reduces interrupts to the host system. When
                           flow control is enabled, CTSn level changes do not trigger host interrupts because the
                           device automatically controls its own transmitter. Without auto-CTS, the transmitter sends
                           any data present in the transmit FIFO and a receiver overrun error may result.

          When CTSn is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
          When CTSn goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current byte, the transmitter finishes sending the current
          byte, but is does not send the next byte.
          When CTSn goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

                   6.3 Software flow control
                           Software flow control is enabled through the enhanced feature register and the modem
                           control register. Different combinations of software flow control can be enabled by setting
                           different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 3 shows software flow control options.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                  SC16C752B
                                                 5 V, 2.2 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 64-byte FIFOs
                      There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
                        • Xon Any function (MCR[5]): Operation will resume after receiving any character
                            after recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that an Xon1 character is
                            recognized as an Xon Any character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be
                            written to the receive FIFO.
                        • Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the
                            special character sets the Xoff interrupt (IIR[4]) but does not halt transmission. The
                            Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR. The special character is transferred to the
                            receive FIFO.
                6.3.1 Receive flow control
                      When software flow control operation is enabled, the SC16C752B will compare incoming
                      data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in certain cases, Xoff1 and Xoff2 must be
                      received sequentially). When the correct Xoff character are received, transmission is
                      halted after completing transmission of the current character. Xoff detection also sets
                      IIR[4] (if enabled via IER[5]) and causes INTA/INTB to go HIGH.
                      To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases
                      Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xon characters are
                      received, IIR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.
                6.3.2 Transmit flow control
                      Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the receive FIFO has passed the halt trigger
                      level programmed in TCR[3:0].
                      Xon1/Xon2 character is transmitted when the receive FIFO reaches the resume trigger
                      level programmed in TCR[7:4].
                      The transmission of Xoff/Xon(s) follows the exact same protocol as transmission of an
                      ordinary byte from the FIFO. This means that even if the word length is set to be 5, 6, or 7
                      characters, then the 5, 6, or 7 least significant bits of Xoff1/Xoff2, Xon1/Xoff2 will be
                      transmitted. (Note that the transmission of 5 bits, 6 bits, or 7 bits of a character is seldom
                      done, but this functionality is included to maintain compatibility with earlier designs.)
                      It is assumed that software flow control and hardware flow control will never be enabled
                      simultaneously. Figure 7 shows an example of software flow control.

               6.3.3.1 Assumptions
                       UART1 is transmitting a large text file to UART2. Both UARTs are using software flow
                       control with single character Xoff (0Fh) and Xon (0Dh) tokens. Both have Xoff threshold
                       (TCR[3:0] = Fh) set to 60, and Xon threshold (TCR[7:4] = 8h) set to 32. Both have the
                       interrupt receive threshold (TLR[7:4] = Dh) set to 52.
                       UART 1 begins transmission and sends 52 characters, at which point UART2 will
                       generate an interrupt to its processor to service the receive FIFO, but assume the
                       interrupt latency is fairly long. UART1 will continue sending characters until a total of 60
                       characters have been sent. At this time, UART2 will transmit a 0Fh to UART1, informing
                       UART1 to halt transmission. UART1 will likely send the 61st character while UART2 is
                       sending the Xoff character. Now UART2 is serviced and the processor reads enough data
                       out of the receive FIFO that the level drops to 32. UART2 will now send a 0Dh to UART1,
                       informing UART1 to resume transmission.

                                                   5 V, 2.2 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 64-byte FIFOs
                   6.5 Interrupts
                        The SC16C752B has interrupt generation and prioritization (six prioritized levels of
                        interrupts) capability. The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) enables each of the six types of
                        interrupts and the INTA/INTB signal in response to an interrupt generation. The IER can
                        also disable the interrupt system by clearing bit 0 to bit 3 and bit 5 to bit 7. When an
                        interrupt is generated, the IIR indicates that an interrupt is pending and provides the type
                        of interrupt through IIR[5:0]. Table 6 summarizes the interrupt control functions.

                        It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, LSR[7]
                        generates the interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO,
                        and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always
                        represent the error status for the received character at the top of the RX FIFO. Reading
                        the RX FIFO updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the new character at the top of
                        the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all zeros.
                        For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt
                        is cleared by an Xon flow character detection. If a special character detection caused the
                        interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the LSR.

                6.5.1 Interrupt mode operation
                      In interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is 1) the processor is informed of the status of the
                      receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal, INTA/INTB. Therefore, it is not necessary
                      to continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be

                      In polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be
                      checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR). This mode is an alternative to the FIFO
                      interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
                      automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 9 shows FIFO polled
                      mode operation.

                   6.6 DMA operation
                       There are two modes of DMA operation, DMA mode 0 or DMA mode 1, selected by
                       FCR[3].
                       In DMA mode 0 or FIFO disable (FCR[0] = 0) DMA occurs in single character transfers. In
                       DMA mode 1, multi-character (or block) DMA transfers are managed to relieve the
                       processor for longer periods of time.
                6.6.1 Single DMA transfers (DMA mode 0/FIFO disable)

                       When empty, the TXRDYn signal becomes active. TXRDYn will go inactive after one
                       character has been loaded into it.
               6.6.1.2 Receiver
                       RXRDYn is active when there is at least one character in the FIFO. It becomes inactive
                       when the receiver is empty.

               6.6.2.1 Transmitter
                       TXRDYn is active when there is a trigger level number of spaces available. It becomes
                       inactive when the FIFO is full.
               6.6.2.2 Receiver
                       RXRDYn becomes active when the trigger level has been reached, or when a time-out
                       interrupt occurs. It will go inactive when the FIFO is empty or an error in the receive FIFO
                       is flagged by LSR[7].
                   6.7 Sleep mode
                       Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the SC16C752B UART. It is enabled when EFR[4],
                       the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set. Sleep mode is entered when:
                         • The serial data input line, RXn, is idle (see Section 6.8 “Break and time-out
                             conditions”).
                         • The transmit FIFO and transmit shift register are empty.
                         • There are no interrupts pending except THR and time-out interrupts.
                       Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the receive FIFO.
                       In Sleep mode, the UART clock and baud rate clock are stopped. Since most registers are
                       clocked using these clocks, the power consumption is greatly reduced. The UART will
                       wake up when any change is detected on the RXn line, when there is any change in the
                       state of the modem input pins, or if data is written to the transmit FIFO.
                       Remark: Writing to the divisor latches DLL and DLM to set the baud clock must not be
                       done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advisable to disable Sleep mode using IER[4]
                       before writing to DLL or DLM.

                   6.8 Break and time-out conditions
                       An RX idle condition is detected when the receiver line, RXn, has been HIGH for
                       4 character time. The receiver line is sampled midway through each bit.
                       When a break condition occurs, the TXn line is pulled LOW. A break condition is activated
                       by setting LCR[6].
                   6.9 Programmable baud rate generator
                       The SC16C752B UART contains a programmable baud generator that takes any clock
                       input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1 and (216 − 1). An additional
                       divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as shown in
                       Figure 12. The output frequency of the baud rate generator is 16 × the baud rate. The
                       formula for the divisor is given in Equation 1:
                                    ⎛ XTAL1
                                      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------⎞

                                    ⎝                              prescaler                                             ⎠
                        divisor = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      (1)
                                               ( desired baud rate × 16 )
                       Where:

                       DLL and DLM must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLM are the
                       least significant and most significant byte of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLM are
                       both zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
                       Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit
                       and receive clock rates.
                       Table 7 and Table 8 show the baud rate and divisor correlation for crystal with frequency
                       1.8432 MHz and 3.072 MHz, respectively.
                       Figure 13 shows the crystal clock circuit reference.

                                                  5 V, 2.2 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 64-byte FIFOs
                       Remark: Refer to the notes under Table 9 for more register access information.
                   7.1 Receiver Holding Register (RHR)
                       The receiver section consists of the Receiver Holding Register (RHR) and the Receiver
                       Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The RSR receives serial data
                       from the RX terminal. The data is converted to parallel data and moved to the RHR. The
                       receiver section is controlled by the Line Control Register. If the FIFO is disabled, location
                       zero of the FIFO is used to store the characters.
                       Remark: In this case, characters are overwritten if overflow occurs.
                       If overflow occurs, characters are lost. The RHR also stores the error status bits
                       associated with each character.
                   7.2 Transmit Holding Register (THR)
                       The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR) and the Transmit
                       Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The THR receives data and
                       shifts it into the TSR, where it is converted to serial data and moved out on the TXn
                       terminal. If the FIFO is disabled, the FIFO is still used to store the byte. Characters are
                       lost if overflow occurs.

                   7.3 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                       This is a write-only register that is used for enabling the FIFOs, clearing the FIFOs, setting
                       transmitter and receiver trigger levels, and selecting the type of DMA signalling. Table 11
                       shows FIFO control register bit settings.

                        Bit    Symbol                Description
                        7:6    FCR[7] (MSB), RX trigger. Sets the trigger level for the receive FIFO.
                               FCR[6] (LSB)              00 - 8 characters
                                                         01 - 16 characters
                                                         10 - 56 characters
                                                         11 - 60 characters
                        5:4    FCR[5] (MSB), TX trigger. Sets the trigger level for the transmit FIFO.
                               FCR[4] (LSB)              00 - 8 spaces
                                                         01 - 16 spaces

                                                     FCR[5:4] can only be modified and enabled when EFR[4] is set. This is
                                                     because the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.

                                                         counter logic (the transmit shift register is not cleared or altered). This bit
                                                         will return to a logic 0 after clearing the FIFO.
                        1      FCR[1]                Reset receive FIFO.
                                                         logic 0 = no FIFO receive reset (normal default condition)

                   7.4 Line Control Register (LCR)
                       This register controls the data communication format. The word length, number of stop
                       bits, and parity type are selected by writing the appropriate bits to the LCR. Table 12
                       shows the Line Control Register bit settings.

                       6       LCR[6]            Break control bit. When enabled, the Break control bit causes a break
                                                 condition to be transmitted (the TXn output is forced to a logic 0 state). This
                                                 condition exists until disabled by setting LCR[6] to a logic 0.

                       1:0     LCR[1:0]          Word length bits 1, 0. These two bits specify the word length to be

                        7      LSR[7]         FIFO data error.
                                                  logic 0 = no error (normal default condition)

                                                  receiver FIFO. This bit is cleared when no more errors are present in the
                                                  FIFO.
                        6      LSR[6]         THR and TSR empty. This bit is the Transmit Empty indicator.
                                                  logic 0 = transmitter hold and shift registers are not empty

                        5      LSR[5]         THR empty. This bit is the Transmit Holding Register Empty indicator.

                                                  logic 1 = Transmit Holding Register is empty. The processor can now load
                                                  up to 64 bytes of data into the THR if the transmit FIFO is enabled.

                                                  RXn was LOW for one character time frame
                        3      LSR[3]         Framing error.
                                                  logic 0 = no framing error in data being read from receive FIFO (normal

                                                  logic 1 = framing error occurred in data being read from receive FIFO, i.e.,

                        2      LSR[2]         Parity error.
                                                  logic 0 = no parity error (normal default condition)
                                                  logic 1 = parity error in data being read from receive FIFO
                        1      LSR[1]         Overrun error.
                                                  logic 0 = no overrun error (normal default condition)
                                                  logic 1 = overrun error has occurred
                        0      LSR[0]         Data in receiver.
                                                  logic 0 = no data in receive FIFO (normal default condition)
                                                  logic 1 = at least one character in the receive FIFO
                       When the LSR is read, LSR[4:2] reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the
                       top of the receive FIFO (next character to be read). The LSR[4:2] registers do not
                       physically exist, as the data read from the receive FIFO is output directly onto the output
                       data bus, DI[4:2], when the LSR is read. Therefore, errors in a character are identified by
                       reading the LSR and then reading the RHR.
                       LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the receive FIFO, and is cleared only
                       when there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO.
                       Reading the LSR does not cause an increment of the receive FIFO read pointer. The
                       receive FIFO read pointer is incremented by reading the RHR.

                   7.7 Modem Status Register (MSR)
                       This 8-bit register provides information about the current state of the control lines from the
                       mode, data set, or peripheral device to the processor. It also indicates when a control
                       input from the modem changes state. Table 15 shows Modem Status Register bit settings
                       per channel.

                7.10 Enhanced Feature Register (EFR)
                       This 8-bit register enables or disables the enhanced features of the UART. Table 19
                       shows the Enhanced Feature Register bit settings.

                                            is set to a logic 1 to indicate a special character has been detected.

                                            be modified, i.e., this bit is therefore a write enable.
                       3:0  EFR[3:0] Combinations of software flow control can be selected by programming these bits.
                                       See Table 3 “Software flow control options (EFR[0:3])”.
                 7.11 Divisor latches (DLL, DLM)
                      These are two 8-bit registers which store the 16-bit divisor for generation of the baud clock
                      in the baud rate generator. DLM stores the most significant part of the divisor. DLL stores
                      the least significant part of the divisor.
                      Note that DLL and DLM can only be written to before Sleep mode is enabled, i.e., before
                      IER[4] is set.
                7.12 Transmission Control Register (TCR)
                      This 8-bit register is used to store the receive FIFO threshold levels to stop/start
                      transmission during hardware/software flow control. Table 20 shows Transmission Control
                      Register bit settings.
                      Table 20.   Transmission Control Register bits description
                       Bit    Symbol             Description
                       7:4    TCR[7:4]           receive FIFO trigger level to resume transmission (0 to 60).
                       3:0    TCR[3:0]           receive FIFO trigger level to halt transmission (0 to 60).
                      TCR trigger levels are available from 0 bytes to 60 bytes with a granularity of four.
                      Remark: TCR can only be written to when EFR[4] = logic 1 and MCR[6] = logic 1. The
                      programmer must program the TCR such that TCR[3:0] > TCR[7:4]. There is no built-in
                      hardware check to make sure this condition is met. Also, the TCR must be programmed
                      with this condition before auto-RTS or software flow control is enabled to avoid spurious
                      operation of the device.

                                               5 V, 2.2 V and 2.5 V dual UART, 5 Mbit/s (max.), with 64-byte FIFOs
                7.13 Trigger Level Register (TLR)
                     This 8-bit register is pulsed to store the transmit and received FIFO trigger levels used for
                     DMA and interrupt generation. Trigger levels from 4 to 60 can be programmed with a
                     granularity of 4. Table 21 shows trigger level register bit settings.
                     Table 21.    Trigger Level Register bits description
                      Bit     Symbol          Description
                      7:4     TLR[7:4]        receive FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of characters available
                      3:0     TLR[3:0]        transmit FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of spaces available
                     Remark: TLR can only be written to when EFR[4] = logic 1 and MCR[6] = logic 1. If
                     TLR[3:0] or TLR[7:4] are logic 0, the selectable trigger levels via the FIFO Control
                     Register (FCR) are used for the transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels. Trigger levels
                     from 4 bytes to 60 bytes are available with a granularity of four. The TLR should be
                     programmed for N⁄4, where N is the desired trigger level.
                     When the trigger level setting in TLR is zero, the SC16C752B uses the trigger level setting
                     defined in FCR. If TLR has non-zero trigger level value, the trigger level defined in FCR is
                     discarded. This applies to both transmit FIFO and receive FIFO trigger level setting.
                     When TLR is used for RX trigger level control, FCR[7:6] should be left at the default state,
                     i.e., ‘00’.
                7.14 FIFO ready register
                     The FIFO ready register provides real-time status of the transmit and receive FIFOs of
                     both channels.

                      Bit      Symbol                       Description
                      7:6      FIFO Rdy[7:6]                unused; always 0
                      5        FIFO Rdy[5]                  receive FIFO B status. Related to DMA.
                      4        FIFO Rdy[4]                  receive FIFO A status. Related to DMA.
                      3:2      FIFO Rdy[3:2]                unused; always 0
                      1        FIFO Rdy[1]                  transmit FIFO B status. Related to DMA.
                      0        FIFO Rdy[0]                  transmit FIFO A status. Related to DMA.
                     The FIFO Rdy register is a read-only register that can be accessed when any of the two
                     UARTs is selected CSA or CSB = logic 0, MCR[2] (FIFO Rdy Enable) is a logic 1, and
                     loopback is disabled. The address is 111.

8. Programmer’s guide
                   The base set of registers that is used during high-speed data transfer have a
                   straightforward access method. The extended function registers require special access
                   bits to be decoded along with the address lines. The following guide will help with
                   programming these registers. Note that the descriptions below are for individual register
                   access. Some streamlining through interleaving can be obtained when programming all
                   the registers.

13. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                13.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                13.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                13.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                13.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 25) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 27 and 28

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 25.
