XR19L400/402
1-Ch and 2-Ch Integrated UART and RS-485 Transceivers
Ideal for Low Power, Embedded Applications
T
         he XR19L400 (L400) and XR19L402 (L402) are highly
         integrated devices that combine a full-featured single
         channel (L400) or two channel (L402) Universal
Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (UART) and RS-485
transceivers. The L400 and L402 are designed to operate with a
3.0V to 5.5V power supply. The L400 and L402 are fully
compliant with RS-485 Standards.
The L400 and L402 operate in four different modes: Active, Partial
Sleep, Full Sleep and Power-Save. Each mode can be invoked via
                                                                         Major Features
hardware or software. Upon power-up, the L400 and L402 are in
the Active mode where the UART and RS-485 transceiver function          • Meets true RS-485 Standards
