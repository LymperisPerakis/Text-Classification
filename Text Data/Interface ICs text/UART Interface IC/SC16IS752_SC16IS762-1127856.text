                  Rev. 9 — 22 March 2012                                           Product data sheet
1. General description
              The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 is an I2C-bus/SPI bus interface to a dual-channel high
              performance UART offering data rates up to 5 Mbit/s, low operating and sleeping current;
              it also provides the application with 8 additional programmable I/O pins. The device
              comes in very small HVQFN32 and TSSOP28 packages, which makes it ideally suitable
              for hand-held, battery-operated applications. This chip enables seamless protocol
              conversion from I2C-bus/SPI to RS-232/RS-485 and is fully bidirectional.
              The SC16IS762 differs from the SC16IS752 in that it supports SPI clock speeds up to
              15 Mbit/s instead of the 4 Mbit/s supported by the SC16IS752, and in that it supports IrDA
              SIR up to 1.152 Mbit/s. In all other aspects, the SC16IS762 is functionally and electrically
              the same as the SC16IS752.
              The SC16IS752/SC16IS762’s internal register set is backward compatible with the widely
              used and widely popular 16C450. This allows the software to be easily written or ported
              from another platform.
              The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 also provides additional advanced features such as auto
              hardware and software flow control, automatic RS-485 support and software reset. This
              allows the software to reset the UART at any moment, independent of the hardware reset
              signal.

                                                         Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
7. Functional description
                        The UART will perform serial-to-I2C-bus conversion on data characters received from
                        peripheral devices or modems, and I2C-bus-to-serial conversion on data characters
                        transmitted by the host. The complete status of the SC16IS752/SC16IS762 UART can be
                        read at any time during functional operation by the host.
                        The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 can be placed in an alternate mode (FIFO mode) relieving
                        the host of excessive software overhead by buffering received/transmitted characters.
                        Both the receiver and transmitter FIFOs can store up to 64 characters (including three
                        additional bits of error status per character for the receiver FIFO) and have selectable or
                        programmable trigger levels.
                        The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 has selectable hardware flow control and software flow
                        control. Hardware flow control significantly reduces software overhead and increases
                        system efficiency by automatically controlling serial data flow using the RTS output and
                        CTS input signals. Software flow control automatically controls data flow by using
                        programmable Xon/Xoff characters.
                        The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that can divide the timing
                        reference clock input by a divisor between 1 and (216  1).
                    7.1 Trigger levels
                        The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 provides independently selectable and programmable trigger
                        levels for both receiver and transmitter interrupt generation. After reset, both transmitter
                        and receiver FIFOs are disabled and so, in effect, the trigger level is the default value of
                        one character. The selectable trigger levels are available via the FIFO Control Register
                        (FCR). The programmable trigger levels are available via the Trigger Level Register
                        (TLR). If TLR bits are cleared, then selectable trigger level in FCR is used. If TLR bits are
                        not cleared, then programmable trigger level in TLR is used.
                    7.2 Hardware flow control
                        Hardware flow control is comprised of Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS (see Figure 4). Auto-CTS
                        and Auto-RTS can be enabled/disabled independently by programming EFR[7:6].
                        With Auto-CTS, CTS must be active before the UART can transmit data.
                        Auto-RTS only activates the RTS output when there is enough room in the FIFO to
                        receive data and de-activates the RTS output when the RX FIFO is sufficiently full. The
                        halt and resume trigger levels in the Transmission Control Register (TCR) determine the
                        levels at which RTS is activated/deactivated. If TCR bits are cleared, then selectable
                        trigger levels in FCR are used in place of TCR.
                        If both Auto-CTS and Auto-RTS are enabled, when RTS is connected to CTS, data
                        transmission does not occur unless the receiver FIFO has empty space. Thus, overrun
                        errors are eliminated during hardware flow control. If not enabled, overrun errors occur if
                        the transmit data rate exceeds the receive FIFO servicing latency.

                             sending device (for example, another UART) may send an additional character after the
                             trigger level is reached (assuming the sending UART has another character to send)
                             because it may not recognize the de-assertion of RTS until it has begun sending the
                             additional character. RTS is automatically reasserted once the receiver FIFO reaches the
                             resume trigger level programmed via TCR[7:4]. This re-assertion allows the sending
                             device to resume transmission.

                                                                   Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                     7.2.2 Auto-CTS
                                 Figure 6 shows CTS functional timing. The transmitter circuitry checks CTS before
                                 sending the next data character. When CTS is active, the transmitter sends the next
                                 character. To stop the transmitter from sending the following character, CTS must be
                                 de-asserted before the middle of the last stop bit that is currently being sent. The
                                 Auto-CTS function reduces interrupts to the host system. When flow control is enabled,
                                 CTS level changes do not trigger host interrupts because the device automatically
                                 controls its own transmitter. Without Auto-CTS, the transmitter sends any data present in
                                 the transmit FIFO and a receiver overrun error may result.

         (1) When CTS is LOW, the transmitter keeps sending serial data out.
         (2) When CTS goes HIGH before the middle of the last stop bit of the current character, the transmitter finishes sending the current
               character, but it does not send the next character.
         (3) When CTS goes from HIGH to LOW, the transmitter begins sending data again.

                        7.3 Software flow control
                                 Software flow control is enabled through the Enhanced Features Register and the Modem
                                 Control Register. Different combinations of software flow control can be enabled by setting
                                 different combinations of EFR[3:0]. Table 3 shows software flow control options.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                             SC16IS752; SC16IS762
                                                           Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                          There are two other enhanced features relating to software flow control:
                            • Xon Any function (MCR[5]): Receiving any character will resume operation after
                                recognizing the Xoff character. It is possible that an Xon1 character is recognized as
                                an Xon Any character, which could cause an Xon2 character to be written to the
                                RX FIFO.
                            • Special character (EFR[5]): Incoming data is compared to Xoff2. Detection of the
                                special character sets the Xoff interrupt (IIR[4]) but does not halt transmission. The
                                Xoff interrupt is cleared by a read of the Interrupt Identification Register (IIR). The
                                special character is transferred to the RX FIFO.
                    7.3.1 Receive flow control
                          When software flow control operation is enabled, the SC16IS752/SC16IS762 will
                          compare incoming data with Xoff1/Xoff2 programmed characters (in certain cases, Xoff1
                          and Xoff2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xoff characters are received,
                          transmission is halted after completing transmission of the current character. Xoff
                          detection also sets IIR[4] (if enabled via IER[5]) and causes IRQ to go LOW.
                          To resume transmission, an Xon1/Xon2 character must be received (in certain cases
                          Xon1 and Xon2 must be received sequentially). When the correct Xon characters are
                          received, IIR[4] is cleared, and the Xoff interrupt disappears.
                    7.3.2 Transmit flow control
                          Xoff1/Xoff2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO has passed the halt trigger level
                          programmed in TCR[3:0], or the selectable trigger level in FCR[7:6].
                          Xon1/Xon2 character is transmitted when the RX FIFO reaches the resume trigger level
                          programmed in TCR[7:4], or falls below the lower selectable trigger level in FCR[7:6].
                          The transmission of Xoff/Xon(s) follows the exact same protocol as transmission of an
                          ordinary character from the FIFO. This means that even if the word length is set to be 5, 6,
                          or 7 bits, then the 5, 6, or 7 least significant bits of Xoff1/Xoff2, Xon1/Xon2 will be
                          transmitted. (Note that the transmission of 5, 6, or 7 bits of a character is seldom done, but
                          this functionality is included to maintain compatibility with earlier designs.)
                          It is assumed that software flow control and hardware flow control will never be enabled
                          simultaneously. Figure 7 shows an example of software flow control.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                           SC16IS752; SC16IS762
                                                         Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                    7.5 Interrupts
                        The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 has interrupt generation and prioritization (seven prioritized
                        levels of interrupts) capability. The interrupt enable registers (IER and IOIntEna) enable
                        each of the seven types of interrupts and the IRQ signal in response to an interrupt
                        generation. When an interrupt is generated, the IIR indicates that an interrupt is pending
                        and provides the type of interrupt through IIR[5:0]. Table 6 summarizes the interrupt
                        control functions.

                        It is important to note that for the framing error, parity error, and break conditions, Line
                        Status Register bit 7 (LSR[7]) generates the interrupt. LSR[7] is set when there is an error
                        anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when there are no more errors remaining in
                        the FIFO. LSR[4:2] always represent the error status for the received character at the top
                        of the RX FIFO. Reading the RX FIFO updates LSR[4:2] to the appropriate status for the
                        new character at the top of the FIFO. If the RX FIFO is empty, then LSR[4:2] are all zeros.
                        For the Xoff interrupt, if an Xoff flow character detection caused the interrupt, the interrupt
                        is cleared by an Xon flow character detection. If a special character detection caused the
                        interrupt, the interrupt is cleared by a read of the IIR.

                    7.5.1 Interrupt mode operation
                          In Interrupt mode (if any bit of IER[3:0] is 1) the host is informed of the status of the
                          receiver and transmitter by an interrupt signal, IRQ. Therefore, it is not necessary to
                          continuously poll the Line Status Register (LSR) to see if any interrupt needs to be
                          serviced. Figure 8 shows Interrupt mode operation.
                                                                                                                           IIR

                    7.5.2 Polled mode operation
                          In Polled mode (IER[3:0] = 0000) the status of the receiver and transmitter can be
                          checked by polling the Line Status Register (LSR). This mode is an alternative to the FIFO
                          Interrupt mode of operation where the status of the receiver and transmitter is
                          automatically known by means of interrupts sent to the CPU. Figure 9 shows FIFO Polled
                          mode operation.

                                                                   Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                    7.6 Sleep mode
                        Sleep mode is an enhanced feature of the SC16IS752/SC16IS762 UART. It is enabled
                        when EFR[4], the enhanced functions bit, is set and when IER[4] is set. Sleep mode is
                        entered when:
                          • The serial data input line, RX, is idle (see Section 7.7 “Break and time-out
                             conditions”).
                          • The TX FIFO and TX shift register are empty.
                          • There are no interrupts pending except THR.
                        Remark: Sleep mode will not be entered if there is data in the RX FIFO.
                        In Sleep mode, the clock to the UART is stopped. Since most registers are clocked using
                        these clocks, the power consumption is greatly reduced. The UART will wake up when
                        any change is detected on the RX line, when there is any change in the state of the
                        modem input pins, or if data is written to the TX FIFO.
                        Remark: Writing to the divisor latches DLL and DLH to set the baud clock must not be
                        done during Sleep mode. Therefore, it is advisable to disable Sleep mode using IER[4]
                        before writing to DLL or DLH.
                    7.7 Break and time-out conditions
                        When the UART receives a number of characters and these data are not enough to set off
                        the receive interrupt (because they do not reach the receive trigger level), the UART will
                        generate a time-out interrupt instead, 4 character times after the last character is
                        received. The time-out counter will be reset at the center of each stop bit received or each
                        time the receive FIFO is read.
                        A break condition is detected when the RX pin is pulled LOW for a duration longer than
                        the time it takes to send a complete character plus start, stop and parity bits. A break
                        condition can be sent by setting LCR[6], when this happens the TX pin will be pulled LOW
                        until LSR[6] is cleared by the software.
                    7.8 Programmable baud rate generator
                        The SC16IS752/SC16IS762 UART contains a programmable baud rate generator that
                        takes any clock input and divides it by a divisor in the range between 1 and (216  1). An
                        additional divide-by-4 prescaler is also available and can be selected by MCR[7], as
                        shown in Figure 10. The output frequency of the baud rate generator is 16  the baud
                        rate. The formula for the divisor is:
                                      XTAL1
                                       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                            crystal input frequency
                                                                   prescaler                                             
                         divisor = -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  (1)
                                                   desired baud rate  16
                        where:
                          prescaler = 1, when MCR[7] is set to logic 0 after reset (divide-by-1 clock selected)
                          prescaler = 4, when MCR[7] is set to logic 1 after reset (divide-by-4 clock selected).
                        Remark: The default value of prescaler after reset is divide-by-1.

                    DLL and DLH must be written to in order to program the baud rate. DLL and DLH are the
                    least significant and most significant byte of the baud rate divisor. If DLL and DLH are both
                    zero, the UART is effectively disabled, as no baud clock will be generated.
                    Remark: The programmable baud rate generator is provided to select both the transmit
                    and receive clock rates.

                                                           Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                    8.1 Receive Holding Register (RHR)
                        The receiver section consists of the Receive Holding Register (RHR) and the Receive
                        Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The RSR receives serial data
                        from the RX terminal. The data is converted to parallel data and moved to the RHR. The
                        receiver section is controlled by the Line Control Register. If the FIFO is disabled, location
                        zero of the FIFO is used to store the characters.
                    8.2 Transmit Holding Register (THR)
                        The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR) and the Transmit
                        Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The THR receives data and
                        shifts it into the TSR, where it is converted to serial data and moved out on the TX
                        terminal. If the FIFO is disabled, location zero of the FIFO is used to store the byte.
                        Characters are lost if overflow occurs.
                    8.3 Interrupt Enable Register (IER)
                        The Interrupt Enable Register (IER) enables each of the six types of interrupt, receiver
                        error, RHR interrupt, THR interrupt, Modem Status, Xoff received, or CTS/RTS change of
                        state from LOW to HIGH. The IRQ output signal is activated in response to interrupt
                        generation. Table 11 shows Interrupt Enable Register bit settings.

                        [1]  IER[7:4] can only be modified if EFR[4] is set, that is, EFR[4] is a write enable. Re-enabling IER[1] will not
                             cause a new interrupt if the THR is below the threshold.
                    8.4 FIFO Control Register (FCR)
                        This is a write-only register that is used for enabling the FIFOs, clearing the FIFOs, setting
                        transmitter and receiver trigger levels. Table 12 shows FIFO Control Register bit settings.

                                                             because the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.

                        When the LSR is read, LSR[4:2] reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the
                        top of the RX FIFO (next character to be read). Therefore, errors in a character are
                        identified by reading the LSR and then reading the RHR.
                        LSR[7] is set when there is an error anywhere in the RX FIFO, and is cleared only when
                        there are no more errors remaining in the FIFO.

                                                          Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                    8.11 Transmission Control Register (TCR)
                         This 8-bit register is used to store the RX FIFO threshold levels to stop/start transmission
                         during hardware/software flow control. Table 22 shows Transmission Control Register bit
                         settings. If TCR bits are cleared, then selectable trigger levels in FCR are used in place of
                         TCR.

                          Bit         Symbol                   Description
                          7:4         TCR[7:4]                 RX FIFO trigger level to resume
                          3:0         TCR[3:0]                 RX FIFO trigger level to halt transmission
                         TCR trigger levels are available from 0 bytes to 60 characters with a granularity of four.
                         Remark: TCR can only be written to when EFR[4] = logic 1 and MCR[2] = logic 1. The
                         programmer must program the TCR such that TCR[3:0] > TCR[7:4]. There is no built-in
                         hardware check to make sure this condition is met. Also, the TCR must be programmed
                         with this condition before Auto-RTS or software flow control is enabled to avoid spurious
                         operation of the device.
                    8.12 Trigger Level Register (TLR)
                         This 8-bit register is used to store the transmit and received FIFO trigger levels used for
                         interrupt generation. Trigger levels from 4 to 60 can be programmed with a granularity
                         of four. Table 23 shows Trigger Level Register bit settings.
                         Table 23.    Trigger Level Register bits description
                          Bit         Symbol                   Description
                          7:4         TLR[7:4]                 RX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of characters available
                          3:0         TLR[3:0]                 TX FIFO trigger levels (4 to 60), number of spaces available
                         Remark: TLR can only be written to when EFR[4] = logic 1 and MCR[2] = logic 1. If
                         TLR[3:0] or TLR[7:4] are logical 0, the selectable trigger levels via the FIFO Control
                         Register (FCR) are used for the transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels. Trigger levels
                         from 4 characters to 60 characters are available with a granularity of four. The TLR should
                         be programmed for N⁄4, where N is the desired trigger level.
                         When the trigger level setting in TLR is zero, the SC16IS752/SC16IS762 uses the trigger
                         level setting defined in FCR. If TLR has non-zero trigger level value, the trigger level
                         defined in FCR is discarded. This applies to both transmit FIFO and receive FIFO trigger
                         level setting.
                         When TLR is used for RX trigger level control, FCR[7:6] should be left at the default state
                         ‘00’.

                         This register is used to program the I/O pins direction. Bit 0 to bit 7 controls GPIO0 to

                         GPIO[7:4] or GPIO[3:0] are programmed as modem pins, their interrupt generation must
                         be enabled via IER[3]. In this case, IOIntEna will have no effect on GPIO[7:4] or
                         GPIO[3:0].

                         the following registers: IODir, IOState, IOIntEna, and IOControl. The state of CD, RI, DSR
                         pins will not be reflected in MSR[7:5] or MSR[3:1], and any change of state on these three
                         pins will not trigger a modem status interrupt (even if enabled via IER[3]), and the state of
                         the DTR pin cannot be controlled by MCR[0].
                         As modem CD, RI, DSR pins, the status at the input of these three pins can be read from
                         MSR[7:5] and MSR[3:1], and the state of the DTR pin can be controlled by MCR[0]. Also,
                         if modem status interrupt bit is enabled, IER[3], a change of state on RI, CD, DSR pins will
                         trigger a modem interrupt. The IODir, IOState, and IOIntEna registers will not have any
                         effect on these three pins.

9. RS-485 features
                     9.1 Auto RS-485 RTS control
                         Normally the RTS pin is controlled by MCR bit 1, or if hardware flow control is enabled, the
                         logic state of the RTS pin is controlled by the hardware flow control circuitry. EFCR
                         register bit 4 will take the precedence over the other two modes; once this bit is set, the
                         transmitter will control the state of the RTS pin. The transmitter automatically asserts the
                         RTS pin (logic 0) once the host writes data to the transmit FIFO, and de-asserts RTS pin
                         (logic 1) once the last bit of the data has been transmitted.
                         To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow
                         control function.
                     9.2 RS-485 RTS output inversion
                         EFCR bit 5 reverses the polarity of the RTS pin if the UART is in auto RS-485 RTS mode.
                         When the transmitter has data to be sent it de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 1), and when the
                         last bit of the data has been sent out the transmitter asserts the RTS pin (logic 0).

                                                           Dual UART with I2C-bus/SPI interface, 64-byte FIFOs, IrDA SIR
                      9.3 Auto RS-485
                          EFCR bit 0 is used to enable the RS-485 mode (multidrop or 9-bit mode). In this mode of
                          operation, a ‘master’ station transmits an address character followed by data characters
                          for the addressed ‘slave’ stations. The slave stations examine the received data and
                          interrupt the controller if the received character is an address character (parity bit = 1).
                          To use the auto RS-485 RTS mode the software would have to disable the hardware flow
                          control function.
                    9.3.1 Normal multidrop mode
                          The 9-bit mode in EFCR (bit 0) is enabled, but not Special Character Detect (EFR bit 5).
                          The receiver is set to Force Parity 0 (LCR[5:3] = 111) in order to detect address bytes.
                          With the receiver initially disabled, it ignores all the data bytes (parity bit = 0) until an
                          address byte is received (parity bit = 1). This address byte will cause the UART to set the
                          parity error. The UART will generate a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to ‘1’ at
                          this time), and at the same time puts this address byte in the RX FIFO. After the controller
                          examines the byte it must make a decision whether or not to enable the receiver; it should
                          enable the receiver if the address byte addresses its ID address, and must not enable the
                          receiver if the address byte does not address its ID address.
                          If the controller enables the receiver, the receiver will receive the subsequent data until
                          being disabled by the controller after the controller has received a complete message
                          from the ‘master’ station. If the controller does not disable the receiver after receiving a
                          message from the ‘master’ station, the receiver will generate a parity error upon receiving
                          another address byte. The controller then determines if the address byte addresses its ID
                          address, if it is not, the controller then can disable the receiver. If the address byte
                          addresses the ‘slave’ ID address, the controller take no further action; the receiver will
                          receive the subsequent data.
                    9.3.2 Auto address detection
                          If Special Character Detect is enabled (EFR[5] is set and XOFF2 contains the address
                          byte) the receiver will try to detect an address byte that matches the programmed
                          character in XOFF2. If the received byte is a data byte or an address byte that does not
                          match the programmed character in XOFF2, the receiver will discard these data. Upon
                          receiving an address byte that matches the XOFF2 character, the receiver will be
                          automatically enabled if not already enabled, and the address character is pushed into the
                          RX FIFO along with the parity bit (in place of the parity error bit). The receiver also
                          generates a line status interrupt (IER bit 2 must be set to 1 at this time). The receiver will
                          then receive the subsequent data from the ‘master’ station until being disabled by the
                          controller after having received a message from the ‘master’ station.
                          If another address byte is received and this address byte does not match XOFF2
                          character, the receiver will be automatically disabled and the address byte is ignored. If
                          the address byte matches XOFF2 character, the receiver will put this byte in the RX FIFO
                          along with the parity bit in the parity error bit (LSR[2]).

10. I2C-bus operation
                         The two lines of the I2C-bus are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both
                         lines are connected to a positive supply via a pull-up resistor, and remain HIGH when the
                         bus is not busy. Each device is recognized by a unique address whether it is a
                         microcomputer, LCD driver, memory or keyboard interface and can operate as either a
                         transmitter or receiver, depending on the function of the device. A device generating a
                         message or data is a transmitter, and a device receiving the message or data is a
                         receiver. Obviously, a passive function like an LCD driver could only be a receiver, while a
                         microcontroller or a memory can both transmit and receive data.
                    10.1 Data transfers
                         One data bit is transferred during each clock pulse (see Figure 12). The data on the SDA
                         line must remain stable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse in order to be valid.
                         Changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals. A HIGH-to-LOW
                         transition of the data line (SDA) while the clock signal (SCL) is HIGH indicates a START
                         condition, and a LOW-to-HIGH transition of the SDA while SCL is HIGH defines a STOP
                         condition (see Figure 13). The bus is considered to be busy after the START condition
                         and free again at a certain time interval after the STOP condition. The START and STOP
                         conditions are always generated by the master.

                         The number of data bytes transferred between the START and STOP condition from
                         transmitter to receiver is not limited. Each byte, which must be eight bits long, is
                         transferred serially with the most significant bit first, and is followed by an acknowledge bit
                         (see Figure 14). The clock pulse related to the acknowledge bit is generated by the
                         master. The device that acknowledges has to pull down the SDA line during the
                         acknowledge clock pulse, while the transmitting device releases this pulse (see
                         Figure 15).

  Fig 15. Acknowledge on the I2C-bus
                                  A slave receiver must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte, and a
                                  master must generate one after the reception of each byte clocked out of the slave
                                  transmitter. When designing a system, it is necessary to take into account cases when
                                  acknowledge is not received. This happens, for example, when the addressed device is
                                  busy in a real-time operation. In such a case the master, after an appropriate ‘time-out’,
                                  should abort the transfer by generating a STOP condition, allowing other transfers to take
                                  place. These ‘other transfers’ could be initiated by other masters in a multimaster system,
                                  or by this same master.
                                  There are two exceptions to the ‘acknowledge after every byte’ rule. The first occurs when
                                  a master is a receiver: it must signal an end of data to the transmitter by not signalling an
                                  acknowledge on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. The acknowledge
                                  related clock generated by the master should still take place, but the SDA line will not be
                                  pulled down. In order to indicate that this is an active and intentional lack of
                                  acknowledgement, we shall term this special condition as a ‘negative acknowledge’.
                                  The second exception is that a slave will send a negative acknowledge when it can no
                                  longer accept additional data bytes. This occurs after an attempted transfer that cannot be
                                  accepted.

                       10.2 Addressing and transfer formats
                              Each device on the bus has its own unique address. Before any data is transmitted on the
                              bus, the master transmits on the bus the address of the slave to be accessed for this
                              transaction. A well-behaved slave with a matching address, if it exists on the network,
                              should of course acknowledge the master's addressing. The addressing is done by the
                              first byte transmitted by the master after the START condition.
                              An address on the network is seven bits long, appearing as the most significant bits of the
                              address byte. The last bit is a direction (R/W) bit. A zero indicates that the master is
                              transmitting (‘write’) and a one indicates that the master requests data (‘read’). A complete
                              data transfer, comprised of an address byte indicating a ‘write’ and two data bytes is
                              shown in Figure 16.

  Fig 16. A complete data transfer
                              When an address is sent, each device in the system compares the first seven bits after
                              the START with its own address. If there is a match, the device will consider itself
                              addressed by the master, and will send an acknowledge. The device could also determine
                              if in this transaction it is assigned the role of a slave receiver or slave transmitter,
                              depending on the R/W bit.
                              Each node of the I2C-bus network has a unique seven-bit address. The address of a
                              microcontroller is of course fully programmable, while peripheral devices usually have
                              fixed and programmable address portions.
                              When the master is communicating with one device only, data transfers follow the format
                              of Figure 16, where the R/W bit could indicate either direction. After completing the
                              transfer and issuing a STOP condition, if a master would like to address some other
                              device on the network, it could start another transaction by issuing a new START.
                              Another way for a master to communicate with several different devices would be by using
                              a ‘Repeated START’. After the last byte of the transaction was transferred, including its
                              acknowledge (or negative acknowledge), the master issues another START, followed by
                              address byte and data without effecting a STOP. The master may communicate with a
                              number of different devices, combining ‘reads’ and ‘writes’. After the last transfer takes
                              place, the master issues a STOP and releases the bus. Possible data formats are
                              demonstrated in Figure 17. Note that the repeated START allows for both change of a
                              slave and a change of direction, without releasing the bus. We shall see later on that the
                              change of direction feature can come in handy even when dealing with a single device.

                             In a single master system, the ‘Repeated START’ mechanism may be more efficient than
                             terminating each transfer with a STOP and starting again. In a multimaster environment,
                             the determination of which format is more efficient could be more complicated, as when a
                             master is using repeated STARTs occupies the bus for a long time, and thus preventing
                             other devices from initiating transfers.

                    10.3 Addressing
                         Before any data is transmitted or received, the master must send the address of the
                         receiver via the SDA line. The first byte after the START condition carries the address of
                         the slave device and the read/write bit. Table 32 shows how the SC16IS752/SC16IS762’s
                         address can be selected by using A1 and A0 pins. For example, if these 2 pins are
                         connected to VDD, then the SC16IS752/SC16IS762’s address is set to 0x90, and the
                         master communicates with it through this address.

                    10.4 Use of subaddresses
                         When a master communicates with the SC16IS752/SC16IS762 it must send a
                         subaddress in the byte following the slave address byte. This subaddress is the internal
                         address of the word the master wants to access for a single byte transfer, or the beginning
                         of a sequence of locations for a multi-byte transfer. A subaddress is an 8-bit byte. Unlike
                         the device address, it does not contain a direction (R/W) bit, and like any byte transferred
                         on the bus it must be followed by an acknowledge.
                         A register write cycle is shown in Figure 18. The START is followed by a slave address
                         byte with the direction bit set to ‘write’, a subaddress byte, a number of data bytes, and a
                         STOP signal. The subaddress indicates which register the master wants to access, and
                         the data bytes which follow will be written one after the other to the subaddress location.
                         Table 33 and Table 34 show the bits’ presentation at the subaddress byte for I2C-bus and
                         SPI interfaces. Bit 0 is not used, bits 2:1 select the channel, bits 6:3 select one of the
                         UART internal registers. Bit 7 is not used with the I2C-bus interface, but it is used by the
                         SPI interface to indicate a read or a write operation.

  Fig 18. Master writes to slave
                               The register read cycle (see Figure 19) commences in a similar manner, with the master
                               sending a slave address with the direction bit set to WRITE with a following subaddress.
                               Then, in order to reverse the direction of the transfer, the master issues a Repeated
                               START followed again by the device address, but this time with the direction bit set to
                               READ. The data bytes starting at the internal subaddress will be clocked out of the device,
                               each followed by a master-generated acknowledge. The last byte of the read cycle will be
                               followed by a negative acknowledge, signalling the end of transfer. The cycle is
                               terminated by a STOP signal.

17. Soldering of SMD packages
                         This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                         of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                         soldering description”.
                    17.1 Introduction to soldering
                         Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                         Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                         the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                         ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                         Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                         suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                         densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                    17.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                         Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                         a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                           • Through-hole components
                           • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                         Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                         packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                         leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                         due to an increased probability of bridging.
                         The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                         component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                         packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                         Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                           •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                           •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                           •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                           •  Package placement
                           •  Inspection and repair
                           •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                           • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                              transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                              exposed to the wave

                    17.4 Reflow soldering
                         Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                           • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                              higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 39) than a SnPb process, thus
                              reducing the process window
                           • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                              window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                           • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                              heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                              temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                              characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the

                     18.1 Errata for Rev. E added 12 August 2011
                    18.1.1 IrDA wake-up
                           In Rev. D, the UART cannot wake up through RX pin once the UART is put to sleep by the
                           host.
                    18.1.2 Clearing of RX FIFO overflow
                           In Rev. D, once the receive FIFO overflows, the receive FIFO cannot be cleared with FIFO
                           reset command if the UART is continuously receiving data.
                    18.1.3 Interrupt priority encoder
                           When the edge of the IOR signal (an internal signal that reads IIR register) comes close to
                           the X1 clock that generates the interrupt, the value of the Interrupt Indication Register (IIR)
                           might not be correct. This issue might occur if the X1 clock is very slow and the host read
                           operation is very fast in response to the interrupt from the UART.
                    18.1.4 Time-out interrupt
                           If the host reads the receive FIFO at the at the same time as a time-out interrupt condition
                           happens, the host might read 0xCC (time-out) in the Interrupt Indication Register (IIR), but
                           bit 0 of the Line Status Register (LSR) is not set (means there is not data in the
                           receive FIFO). This is a conflict of the receive FIFO status when IIR = 0xCC (time-out), it
                           indicates that there are data in the receive FIFO, but LSR bit 0 = 0 indicates otherwise.
