1, 37, 38,    P             AVCC          Analog Supply Voltage, 4.75 V to 5.25 V. This supply voltage is applied to the internal front-end
48                                        amplifiers and to the ADC core. Decouple these supply pins to AGND.

41, 47                                    the AGND plane of a system.
6             DI            PAR/SER/      Parallel Interface Selection Input (PAR). This pin is a logic input. If this pin is tied to a logic low, the
                            BYTE SEL      parallel interface is selected. Parallel byte interface mode is selected when this pin is logic high and
                                          DB15/BYTE SEL is logic high (see Table 8).
                                          Serial Interface Selection Input (SER). If this pin is tied to a logic high, the serial interface is selected.
                                          In serial mode, the RD/SCLK pin functions as the serial clock input. The DB7/DOUTA pin and the
                                          DB8/DOUTB pin function as serial data outputs. When the serial interface is selected, tie the parallel
                                          output data bit pins (Pin 16 to Pin 22, and Pin 27 to Pin 33) to ground.
                                          Parallel Byte Interface Selection Input (BYTE SEL). In byte mode, DB15/BYTE SEL, in conjunction
                                          with PAR/SER/BYTE SEL, selects the parallel byte mode of operation (see Table 8). DB14/HBEN
                                          functions as the high byte enable (HBEN) pin. DB7 to DB0 transfer the 16-bit conversion results in
                                          two RD/SCLK operations, with DB0 as the LSB of the data transfers.
7             DI            STBY          Standby Mode Input. This pin places the AD7605-4 into one of two power-down modes: standby
                                          mode or shutdown mode. The power-down mode entered depends on the state of the RANGE pin, as
                                          shown in Table 7. When in standby mode, all circuitry, except the on-chip reference, regulators, and
                                          regulator buffers, is powered down. When in shutdown mode, all circuitry is powered down.
8             DI            RANGE         Analog Input Range Selection. RANGE is a logic input. The polarity on this pin determines the input
                                          range of the analog input channels. If this pin is tied to a logic high, the analog input range is ±10 V
                                          for all channels. If this pin is tied to a logic low, the analog input range is ±5 V for all channels. A logic
                                          change on this pin has an immediate effect on the analog input range. Changing this pin during a
                                          conversion is not recommended for fast throughput rate applications. See the Analog Input
                                          section for more information.

Pin No.  Type2 Mnemonic   Description
9        DI    CONVST A   Conversion Start Input A. CONVST A is a logic input. Use this logic input to initiate conversions on
                          the analog input channels. For simultaneous sampling of all input channels, CONVST A and CONVST
                          B can be shorted together, and a single convert start signal can be applied. Alternatively, CONVST A
                          can be used to initiate simultaneous sampling of V1 and V2. When the CONVST A pin transitions from
                          low to high, the front-end track-and-hold circuitry for the respective analog input is set to hold.
10       DI    CONVST B   Conversion Start Input B. CONVST B is a logic input. Use this logic input to initiate conversions on
                          the analog input channels. For simultaneous sampling of all input channels, CONVST A and CONVST
                          B can be shorted together, and a single convert start signal can be applied. CONVST B can be used
                          to initiate simultaneous sampling on V3 and V4. When the CONVST B pin transitions from low to
                          high, the front-end track-and-hold circuitry for the respective analog input is set to hold.
11       DI    RESET      Reset Input. When set to logic high, the rising edge of RESET resets the AD7605-4. The device
                          receives a RESET pulse after power-up. The RESET high pulse is typically 50 ns wide. If a RESET pulse is
                          applied during a conversion, the conversion is aborted. If a RESET pulse is applied during a read,
                          the contents of the output registers reset to all zeros.
12       DI    RD/SCLK    Parallel Data Read Control Input When the Parallel Interface Is Selected (RD). When both CS and RD are
                          logic low in parallel mode, the output bus is enabled.
                          Serial Clock Input When the Serial Interface Is Selected (SCLK). In serial mode, this pin acts as the
                          serial clock input for data transfers. The CS falling edge takes the DOUTA and DOUTB data output lines
                          out of three-state and clocks out the MSB of the conversion result. The rising edge of SCLK clocks
                          all subsequent data bits onto the DOUTA and DOUTB serial data outputs. For more information, see
                          the Conversion Control section.
13       DI    CS         Chip Select. This active low logic input frames the data transfer. When both CS and RD are logic low
                          in parallel mode, the DB[15:0] output bus is enabled and the conversion result is output on the
                          parallel data bus lines. In serial mode, CS frames the serial read transfer and clocks out the MSB of
                          the serial output data.
14       DO    BUSY       Busy Output. This pin transitions to a logic high after both CONVST A and CONVST B rising edges
                          and indicates that the conversion process has started. The BUSY output remains high until the
                          conversion process for all channels is complete. The falling edge of the BUSY pin signals that the
                          conversion data is being latched into the output data registers and is available to read after a
                          period of time, t4. Any data read while BUSY is high must be completed before the falling edge of
                          BUSY occurs. Rising edges on CONVST A or CONVST B have no effect while the BUSY signal is high.
15       DO    FRSTDATA   Digital Output. The FRSTDATA output signal indicates when the first channel, V1, is being read back on
                          the parallel, byte, or serial interface. When the CS input is high, the FRSTDATA output pin is in
                          three-state. The falling edge of CS takes FRSTDATA out of three-state. In parallel mode, the falling
                          edge of RD corresponding to the result of V1, then sets the FRSTDATA pin high, indicating that the
                          result from V1 is available on the output data bus. The FRSTDATA output returns to a logic low
                          following the next falling edge of RD. In serial mode, FRSTDATA goes high on the falling edge of CS
                          because this clocks out the MSB of V1 on DOUTA. FRSTDATA returns low on the 16th SCLK falling edge
                          after the CS falling edge. See the Conversion Control section for more details.

                          parallel digital input/output pins. When CS and RD are low, these pins are used to output DB6 to DB0
                          of the conversion result. When PAR/SER/BYTE SEL = 1, tie these pins to AGND. When operating in
                          parallel byte interface mode, DB7 to DB0 outputs the 16-bit conversion result in two RD operations.
                          DB7 (Pin 24) is the MSB; DB0 is the LSB.

                          and outputs serial conversion data (see the Conversion Control section for more details). When
                          operating in parallel byte mode, DB7 is the MSB of the byte.

                          outputs serial conversion data (see the Conversion Control section for more details).

               DB13       parallel digital input/output pins. When CS and RD are low, these pins are used to output DB13 to DB9
                          of the conversion result. When PAR/SER/BYTE SEL = 1, tie these pins to AGND.

                                                      operates in parallel byte interface mode. In parallel byte mode, the HBEN pin selects whether the

                                                      Parallel Byte Mode Select (BYTE SEL). When PAR/SER/BYTE SEL = 1, the BYTE SEL pin selects
                                                      between serial interface mode and parallel byte interface mode (see Table 8). When PAR/SER/BYTE

                                                      the internal reference is selected and enabled. If this pin is set to logic low, the internal reference is
                                                      disabled and an external reference voltage must be applied to the REFIN/REFOUT pin.

between the digital and analog sections. In the case of the split
plane, join the digital and analog ground planes in only one
place, preferably as close as possible to the AD7605-4.
If the AD7605-4 is in a system where multiple devices require
analog to digital ground connections, make the connection at
only one point: establish a star ground point as close as possible
to the AD7605-4. Good connections must be made to the
ground plane. Avoid sharing one connection for multiple
ground pins. Use individual vias or multiple vias to the ground
plane for each ground pin.
Avoid running digital lines under the devices because doing so
couples noise onto the die. Allow the analog ground plane to
run under the AD7605-4 to avoid noise coupling. Shield fast
switching signals like CONVST A, CONVST B, or clocks with
                                                                                                                                         13503-054

crossover of digital and analog signals. Route traces on layers in
close proximity on the board at right angles to each other to
reduce the effect of feedthrough through the board.
For the power supply lines to the AVCC and VDRIVE pins on the
AD7605-4, use as large a trace as possible to provide low
impedance paths and to reduce the effect of glitches on the
power supply lines. Where possible, use supply planes and make
good connections between the AD7605-4 supply pins and the
power tracks on the board. Use a single via or multiple vias for
each supply pin.
Good decoupling is also important to lower the supply impedance
presented to the AD7605-4 and to reduce the magnitude of the
supply spikes. Place the decoupling capacitors close to (ideally,
right up against) these pins and their corresponding ground
pins. Place the decoupling capacitors for the REFIN/REFOUT                                                                              13503-055

chip is positioned between the two devices, and the reference

U2. A solid ground plane is used.                                                                                 U2
These symmetrical layout principles can also be applied to a system
that contains more than two AD7605-4 devices. The AD7605-4
devices can be placed in a north to south direction, with the
reference voltage located midway between the devices and the
reference track running in the north to south direction, similar
to Figure 43.
