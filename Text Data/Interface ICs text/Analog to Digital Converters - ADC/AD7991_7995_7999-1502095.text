INTERNAL REGISTER STRUCTURE
CONFIGURATION REGISTER
The configuration register is an 8-bit write-only register that is used to set the operating modes of the AD7991/AD7995/AD7999. The bit
functions are outlined in Table 10. A single-byte write is necessary when writing to the configuration register. D7 is the MSB. When the
master writes to the AD7991/AD7995/AD7999, the first byte is written to the configuration register.

D7 to D4      CH3 to CH0       These four channel address bits select the analog input channel(s) to be converted. If a channel address bit
                               (Bit D7 to Bit D4) is set to 1, a channel is selected for conversion. If more than one channel bit is set to 1, the
                               AD7991/AD7995/AD7999 sequence through the selected channels, starting with the lowest channel. All
                               unused channels should be set to 0. Table 11 shows how these four channel address bits are decoded. Prior
                               to the device initiating a conversion, the channel(s) must be selected in the configuration register.
D3            REF_SEL          This bit allows the user to select the supply voltage as the reference or choose to use an external reference. If
                               this bit is 0, the supply is used as the reference, and the device acts as a 4-channel input part. If this bit is set
                               to 1, an external reference must be used and applied to the VIN3/VREF pin, and the device acts as a 3-channel
                               input part.
D2            FLTR             The value written to this bit of the control register determines whether the filtering on SDA and SCL is
                               enabled or bypassed. If this bit is set to 0, the filtering is enabled; if it set to 1, the filtering is bypassed.

     written to it. If the R/W bit is set to 0, the master writes to
