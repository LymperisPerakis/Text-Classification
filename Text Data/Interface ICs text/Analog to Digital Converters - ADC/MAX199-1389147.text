Note 1:    Accuracy specifications tested at VDD = 5.0V. Performance at power-supply tolerance limits guaranteed by Power-Supply
           Rejection test. Tested for the ±4.096V input range.
Note 2:    External reference: VREF = 4.096V, offset error nulled, ideal last code transition = FS - 3/2LSB.
Note 3:    Ground “on” channel; sine wave applied to all “off” channels.
Note 4:    Maximum full-power input frequency for 1LSB error with 10ns jitter = 3kHz.
Note 5:    Guaranteed by design. Not tested.
Note 6:    Use static loads only.
Note 7:    Tested using internal reference.
Note 8:    PSRR measured at full-scale. VDD = 4.75V to 5.25V.
Note 9:    External acquisition timing: starts at rising edge of WR with control bit ACQMOD = low; ends at rising edge of WR with
           ACQMOD = high.
Note 10:   Not subject to production testing. Provided for design guidance only.
Note 11:   All input control signals specified with tR = tF = 5ns from a voltage level of 0.8V to 2.4V.
Note 12:   tDO and tDO1 are measured with the load circuits of Figure 2 and defined as the time required for an output to cross 0.8V
           or 2.4V.
Note 13:   tTR is defined as the time required for the data lines to change by 0.5V.

                                    Clock Input. In external clock mode, drive CLK with a TTL/CMOS compatible clock. In internal clock mode,

                                    with CCLK = 100pF.

                                    When CS is low, in the internal acquisition mode, a rising edge on WR latches in configuration data and starts an
   3                 WR             acquisition plus a conversion cycle. When CS is low, in the external acquisition mode, the first rising edge on
                                    WR starts an acquisition and a second rising edge on WR ends acquisition and starts a conversion cycle.
   4                 RD             When CS is low, a falling edge on RD will enable a read operation on the data bus.
                                    Used to multiplex the 12-bit conversion result. When high, the 4 MSBs are multiplexed on the data bus;
