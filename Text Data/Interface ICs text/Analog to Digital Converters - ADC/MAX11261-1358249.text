                             voltage is missing. In SLEEP or STANDBY the value of this bit is ‘0’. The trigger level for
                             this bit is VREF < 0.35V. This error does not inhibit normal operation and is intended for
 REFDET                  14
                             status only. This flag is only valid during a conversion in progress and if the user needs to
                             verify valid reference level they should read this status bit. The value of this status bit is
                             valid within 30μs after a conversion start command and is invalid when not in conversion.
                             This bit is not valid in sequencer mode 1. Flag is set if two or more CHX_ORD bits
                             decode to the same scan sequence order and are also enabled. This bit is also set for
                             the case when a channel is enabled for scan with CHX_EN=’1’ and CHX_ORD[2:0] =
                             ‘000’ or ‘111’. The CHX_ORD[2:0] values of ‘000’ and ‘111’ are not allowed for the order
 ORDERR                  13  of an enabled channel. The allowable orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The MAX11261 remains
                             in STANDBY state until this error is removed. The channel order must be strictly sequen-
                             tial and no missing numbers are allowed. For instance, if 4 channels are enabled then
                             the order must be 1, 2, 3, 4. Any other order is flagged as ORDERR and the MAX11261
                             remains in STANDBY mode.
                             This bit is not valid in sequencer mode 1. This bit is set to ‘1’ if more than one input chan-
 GPOERR                  12  nel is mapped to the same GPO bump, and CHX_GPOEN is enabled for more than one
                             channel. The MAX11261 remains in STANDBY state until this error is removed.
                             Flag for invalid configuration states. Flag is set if CAL[1:0] programmed to ‘11’ which is
 ERROR                   11  an invalid state. Flag is set if CTRL1:SCYCLE = ‘0’ for scan modes 2, 3, and 4. This error
                             puts the MAX11261 into STANDBY mode.
                             This bit when set to ‘1’ indicates that a system gain calibration was overrange. The SCGC
 SYSGOR                  10  calibration coefficient is the maximum value of 1.9999999. This bit when set to ‘1’ indi-
                             cates that full-scale value out of the converter is likely not available.
                             This bit when set to ‘1’ indicates that the conversion result has exceeded the maximum
 DOR                      9  or minimum value of the converter and that the result has been clipped or limited to the
                             maximum value. When ‘0’ the conversion result is within the full-scale range of the inputs.
                             This bit indicates if the modulator detected an analog overrange condition from having the
 AOR                      8  input signal level greater than the reference voltage. This check for overrange includes
                             the PGA.
                             These bits indicate the conversion rate that corresponds to the result in the FIFO reg-
 RATE                    7:4 ister or the rate that was used for calibration coefficient calculation. The corresponding
                             RATE[3:0] is only valid until the FIFO register is read.
                             These bits indicate the power-down state of the chip. See Table 5 for transition times.

                             ‘11’ = RESET
                             This bit is set to ‘1’ when a signal measurement is in progress. This indicates that a
 MSAT                     1  conversion, self-calibration, or system calibration is in progress and that the modulator is
                             busy. When the modulator is not converting, this bit will be set to ‘0’.
                             For sequencer mode 1, this bit when set to ‘1’ indicates that a new conversion result is
                             available. A complete read of the FIFO Register will reset this bit to ‘0’. This bit is invalid
 RDY                      0
                             in sequencer mode 2, 3, or 4. The function of this bit is redundant and is duplicated by the
                             RDYB_INTB pin.

                                                   ‘10’ = Performs a system-level full-scale calibration.
                                                   ‘11’ = Not used, reserved state.
                                                   Selects the power-down state to be executed. The MAX11261 enters the
                                                   selected power-down state after the IMPD is written. These bits are decoded

                                                   The ‘unipolar/bipolar’ bit controls the input range. A ‘1’ selects unipolar input
 U_B                                  3
                                                   range and a ‘0’ selects bipolar input range.
                                                   The ‘format’ bit controls the digital format of the bipolar range data. A ‘0’
                                                   selects two’s complement and a ‘1’ selects offset binary format of the bipo-

                                                   4, incorrect results are obtained when ‘1’.
                                                   The ‘single-cycle’ bit selects either no-latency single conversion mode or
                                                   latent continuous conversion in sequencer mode 1. A ‘1’ selects single-cycle

                                           In sequencer mode 4, when CTRL3:SYNC is set high (the device is a master), set
 SYNCZ                        6            CTRL3:SYNCZ high to put SYNC pin in high impedance state. Set CTRL3:SYNCZ low
                                           to put SYNC pin in active-low, open-drain output state.   
 SYNC                         5            Set this bit to 1 to configure the device as a master device.
                                           The value of this bit controls which calibration value is read during a calibration register
                                           inquiry. When the user writes into one of the calibration registers the value is stored
                                           within the interface domain. Once a command to convert is received, the new calibration
                                           value is transferred to a MATH module in a separate digital domain to be used in any
                                           valid calibration sequence. The user has access to both registers, i.e. the register value
                                           that was used to produce the current conversion result in the FIFO register or the value
 CALREGSEL                    4
                                           that was just written and is meant to be used for following conversions.
                                           It is common for a user to immediately read back the value written to insure that com-
                                           munication was not flawed. To accomplish this, set the CTRL3:CALREGSEL bit to ‘1’ in
                                           order to read back the interface value of the register. Set this bit to ‘0’ to read the MATH
                                           module value, i.e. the value used to generate the result in the FIFO register.
                                           Note that when CTRL3:CALREGSEL is ‘0’ only read operations are valid.

                        two or more output controls are mapped to the same channel.
                        Used to define the order during scan when the channel is enabled. The CHX_ORD[2:0] values of ‘000’ and
                        ‘111’ are not allowed for the order of an enabled channel. The allowable orders are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 rep-
                        resenting first, second, third, and so on. The value of ‘000’ is a default value and the value of ‘111’ is greater
 CHX_ORD[2:0]
                        than the number of scannable channels. A value greater than the number of scannable channels is invalid
                        and will set an error condition at STAT:ORDERR. Setting a channels order to ‘000’ or ‘111’ and enabling it
                        will set the STAT:ORDERR flag in the STAT register.

System Offset Calibration Register (Read/Write)
The System Offset Calibration register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked
in/out MSB first. This register holds the system offset calibration value. The format is in two’s complement binary format.
An internal system calibration does not overwrite the SOC register.
The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’
reads back the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3 for bit CALREGSEL. The internal register can only
be read during conversion.
The system offset calibration value is subtracted from each conversion result—provided the NOSYSO bit in the CTRL3
register is set to 0. The system offset calibration value is subtracted from the conversion result after self-calibration but
before system gain correction. It is also applied prior to the 1x or 2x scale factor associated with bipolar and unipolar
modes. When a system offset calibration is in progress, this register is not writable by the user.

SGC (0xF)
System Gain Calibration Register(Read/Write)
The System Gain Calibration register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked
in/out MSB first. This register holds the system gain calibration value. The format is unsigned 24-bit binary. An internal
system calibration does not overwrite the SGC register.
The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’
reads back the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3 for bit CALREGSEL. The internal register can only
be read during conversion.
The system gain calibration value is used to scale the offset corrected conversion result—provided the NOSYSG bit in
the CTRL3 register is set to 0. The system gain calibration value scales the offset corrected result by up to 2x or can
correct a gain error of approximately -50%. The amount of positive gain error that can be corrected is determined by
modulator overload characteristics, which may be as much as +25%. When a system gain calibration is in progress, this
register is not writable by the user.

Self-Calibration Offset Calibration Register (Read/Write)
The self-calibration offset register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked in/
out MSB first. This register holds the self-calibration offset value. The format is always in two’s complement binary format.
An internal self- calibration does not overwrite the SCOC register.
The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’
reads back the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3 for bit CALREGSEL. The internal register can only

The self-calibration offset value is subtracted from each conversion result—provided the NOSCO bit in the CTRL3 reg-
ister is set to 0. The self-calibration offset value is subtracted from the conversion result before the self-calibration gain
correction and before the system offset and gain correction. It is also applied prior to the 2x scale factor associated with
unipolar mode. When a self-calibration is in progress, this register is not writable by the user.

SCGC (0x11)
Self-Calibration Gain Calibration Register (Read/Write)
The Self-Calibration Offset register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked in/
out MSB first. This register holds the self-calibration offset value. The format is always in two’s complement binary format.
An internal self- calibration does not overwrite the SCGC register.
The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’
reads back the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3 for bit CALREGSEL. The internal register can only
be read during conversion.
The self-calibration gain calibration value is used to scale the self-calibration offset corrected conversion result before
the system offset and gain calibration values have been applied – provided the NOSCG bit in the CTRL3 register is set
to 0. The self-calibration gain calibration value scales the self-calibration offset corrected conversion result by up to 2x or
can correct a gain error of approximately –50%. The gain will be corrected to within 2 LSB. When a self- calibration is in
progress, this register is not writable by the user.

GPO_DIR (0x12)
GPO Direct Access Register (Read/Write)
This register is used to turn on and off the GPO directly except when operating in mode 3 or mode 4. When operating
in sequencer mode 1 or 2, the activation of the GPO is immediate upon setting a bit to a ‘1’ and the deactivation of the
GPO is immediate upon setting the bit to a ‘0’. In SLEEP state, the values in this register do not control the state of the
GPO as they all are deactivated. When in STANDBY state and programmed for sequencer mode 1 or mode 2, register
writes immediately update the GPOs. Writes to this register are ignored when operating in sequencer mode 3 or mode 4.
This register is used during system offset calibration, system gain calibration and self-calibration modes.

FIFO (0x13)
FIFO Register (Read Only)
The FIFO holds the most recent conversion results (up to a maximum of 64). If more than 64 conversions are captured
and the user does not transfer the oldest FIFO entry, the oldest entry will be overwritten by the newest conversion result.
The FIFO are read-only registers. Any attempt to write data to this location will have no effect. The data read from these
registers is clocked out MSB first. The result D[23:0] is stored in a format according to the FORMAT bit in the CTRL1
register. The data format while in unipolar mode is always offset binary. In offset binary format the most negative value
is 0x000000, the midscale value is 0x800000 and the most positive value is 0xFFFFFF. In bipolar mode if the FORMAT
bit = ‘1’ then the data format is offset binary. If the FORMAT bit = ‘0’, then the data format is two’s complement. In two’s
complement the negative full-scale value is 0x800000, the midscale is 0x000000 and the positive full scale is 0x7FFFFF.
Any input exceeding the available input range is limited to the minimum or maximum data value.
