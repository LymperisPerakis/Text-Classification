Note 1: Tested at VDD = +3V, COM = GND, unipolar single-ended input mode.
Note 2: Relative accuracy is the deviation of the analog value at any code from its theoretical value after offset and gain errors have
        been removed.
Note 3: Offset nulled.
Note 4: On channel is grounded; sine wave applied to off channels.
Note 5: Conversion time is defined as the number of clock cycles times the clock period; clock has 50% duty cycle.
Note 6: Input voltage range referenced to negative input. The absolute range for the analog inputs is from GND to VDD.
Note 7: External load should not change during conversion for specified accuracy.
Note 8: When bit 5 is set low for internal acquisition, WR must not return low until after the first falling clock edge of the conversion.
