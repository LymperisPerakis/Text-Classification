current, IREF = QCONV/tCYC. The DC current draw of the                                                                     1Ω

in Normal Mode(CHAIN = 0) sharing CNV, SCK and SDO.                             low to read data out of each device between conversions.
By sharing CNV, SCK and SDO, the number of required                             When RDL/SDI is brought low, the MSB of the selected
signals to operate multiple ADCs in parallel is reduced.                        device is output onto SDO. To ensure the MSB is properly
Since SDO is shared, the RDL/SDI input of each ADC must                         output and captured, SCK must be held low at least 1ns
be used to allow only one LTC2382-16 to drive SDO at a                          before and 16ns after bringing RDL/SDI low.

BOARD LAYOUT
To obtain the best performance from the LTC2382-16                     Recommended Layout
a printed circuit board is recommended. Layout for the
                                                                       The following is an example of a recommended PCB layout.
printed circuit board (PCB) should ensure the digital and
                                                                       A single solid ground plane is used. Bypass capacitors to
analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In

particular, care should be taken not to run any digital clocks

or signals alongside analog signals or underneath the ADC.
