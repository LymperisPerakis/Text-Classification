General Description                                               Features
The MAX11212 is an ultra-low power (< 300µA max                   ●● 18-Bit Full-Scale Resolution
active current), high-resolution, serial-output ADC. This         ●● 720nVRMS Noise (MAX11212B)
device provides the highest resolution per unit power in
the industry, and is optimized for applications that require      ●● 3ppm INL
very high dynamic range with low power such as sensors            ●● No Missing Codes
on a 4mA to 20mA industrial control loop. The MAX11212            ●● Ultra-Low-Power Dissipation
provides a high-accuracy internal oscillator that requires           • Operating-Mode Current Drain < 300μA (max)
no external components.                                              • Sleep-Mode Current Drain < 0.1μA
When used with the specified data rates, the internal             ●● 2.7V to 3.6V Analog Supply Voltage Range
digital filter provides more than 80dB rejection of 50Hz
                                                                  ●● 1.7V to 3.6V Digital and I/O Supply Voltage Range
or 60Hz line noise. The MAX11212 provides a simple
2-wire serial interface in the space-saving, 10-pin µMAX®         ●● Fully Differential Signal Inputs
package. The MAX11212 operates over the -40°C to                  ●● Fully Differential Reference Inputs
