Note 1:    Tested at VDD = 5.0V; VSS = 0V; unipolar-input mode.
Note 2:    Relative accuracy is the analog value’s deviation (at any code) from its theoretical value after the full-scale range is cali-
           brated.
Note 3: MAX1202—internal reference, offset nulled; MAX1203—external reference (VREF = 4.096V), offset nulled.
Note 4: On-channel grounded; sine wave applied to all off-channels.
Note 5: Conversion time is defined as the number of clock cycles multiplied by the clock period; clock has 50% duty cycle.
Note 6: Guaranteed by design. Not production tested.
Note 7: Common-mode range for analog inputs is from VSS to VDD.
Note 8: External load should not change during the conversion for specified accuracy.
Note 9: Shutdown supply current is measured with VL at 3.3V, and with all digital inputs tied to either VL or GND;
           REFADJ = GND. Shutdown supply current is also dependent on VIH (Figure 12c).
Note 10: Logic supply current is measured with the digital outputs (DOUT and SSTRB) disabled (CS high). When the outputs are
           active (CS low), the logic supply current depends on fSCLK, and on the static and capacitive load at DOUT and SSTRB.
Note 11: Measured at VSUPPLY + 5% and VSUPPLY - 5% only.
Note 12: Measured at VL = 2.7V and VL = 3.6V.

ence can be placed at either the input (REFADJ) or the
output (REF) of the internal reference-buffer amplifier.

The REFADJ input impedance is typically 20kΩ for the
MAX1202, and higher than 100kΩ for the MAX1203,

an external reference at REF must deliver up to 350μA DC

If the reference has higher output impedance or is noisy,
bypass it close to the REF pin with a 4.7μF capacitor.                                                                                                         0.5
