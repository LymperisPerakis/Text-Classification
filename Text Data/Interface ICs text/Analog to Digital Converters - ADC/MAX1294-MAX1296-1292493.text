The MAX1294/MAX1296 low-power, 12-bit analog-to-                ♦ 12-Bit Resolution, ±0.5 LSB Linearity
digital converters (ADCs) feature a successive-approxi-

a single +5V analog supply.                                     ♦ Software-Configurable Analog Input Multiplexer
Power consumption is only 10mW at the maximum sam-                  6-Channel Single-Ended/
pling rate of 420ksps. Two software-selectable power-               3-Channel Pseudo-Differential (MAX1294)
down modes enable the MAX1294/MAX1296 to be shut                      2-Channel Single-Ended/
down between conversions; accessing the parallel                      1-Channel Pseudo-Differential (MAX1296)
interface returns them to normal operation. Powering

Both devices offer software-configurable analog inputs for      ♦ Low Current
unipolar/bipolar and single-ended/pseudo-differential               2.8mA (420ksps)
operation. In single-ended mode, the MAX1294 has six                1.0mA (100ksps)
input channels and the MAX1296 has two (three input                 400µA (10ksps)
channels and one input channel, respectively, when in               2µA (Shutdown)

The MAX1294 is offered in a 28-pin QSOP package, while              TOP VIEW
the MAX1296 is available in a 24-pin QSOP. For pin-com-
patible +3V, 12-bit versions, see the MAX1295/MAX1297.                             D9 1                  24 D10

                  Note 1: Tested at VDD = +5V, COM = GND, unipolar single-ended input mode.
                  Note 2: Relative accuracy is the deviation of the analog value at any code from its theoretical value after offset and gain errors have
                          been removed.
                  Note 3: Offset nulled.
                  Note 4: On channel is grounded; sine wave applied to off channels.
                  Note 5: Conversion time is defined as the number of clock cycles times the clock period; clock has a 50% duty cycle.
                  Note 6: Input voltage range referenced to negative input. The absolute range for the analog inputs is from GND to VDD.
                  Note 7: External load should not change during conversion for specified accuracy.
                  Note 8: When bit 5 is set low for internal acquisition, WR must not return low until after the first falling clock edge of the conversion.

                                        In single-ended mode, input signals are referred to COM. In pseudo-differential mode, the voltage
                                        difference between two channels is measured (see Tables 2, 4).

                                        In unipolar mode, an analog input signal from 0V to VREF can be converted; in bipolar mode, the
                                        signal can range from -VREF/2 to +VREF/2.
                                        Address bits A2, A1, A0 select which of the 6/2 (MAX1294/MAX1296) channels is to be converted
