signals to operate multiple ADCs in parallel is reduced.                         device is output onto SDO. To ensure the MSB is properly

BOARD LAYOUT
To obtain the best performance from the LTC2381-16                     Recommended Layout
a printed circuit board is recommended. Layout for the
                                                                       The following is an example of a recommended PCB layout.
printed circuit board (PCB) should ensure the digital and

analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In

particular, care should be taken not to run any digital clocks

or signals alongside analog signals or underneath the ADC.
