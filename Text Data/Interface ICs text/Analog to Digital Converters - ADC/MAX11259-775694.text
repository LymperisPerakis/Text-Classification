Register Map
Legend:
CNV IN PROGRESS column – behavior during conversion:
   CNV – Normal read/write activities are available.
   CS – Writes to these registers immediately abort conversion in progress and the MAX11259 enters STANDBY state.
   IG – No changes, write is ignored.
RETENTION column – behavior during SLEEP mode:
   R – The value of the register is retained.
   M – Only bits in < > are retained. Others are cleared.
   The address column shows the register address as used in the command byte definition (see Table 5).

    BIT NAME                                                                DESCRIPTION
     INRESET          This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate that the MAX11259 is in reset.
                      This bit is set to ‘1’ in sequencer modes 2 and 3 to indicate that a new conversion result is available from the
    SRDY[5:0]         channel indicated by the SRDY bit position. A complete read of the DATA register associated with the SRDY bit
                      will reset the bit to ‘0’. At the start of a scan mode these bits are reset to ‘0’.
                      This bit is set to ‘1’ if sequencer mode 2 or 3 is selected and no channels or invalid channel numbers (‘000’ or
    SCANERR           ‘111’) are enabled in the CHMAP1 or CHMAP0 register. Until SCANERR is cleared, conversion commands are
                      aborted.
                      This bit is set to ‘1’ if a proper reference voltage is detected and ‘0’ if a proper reference voltage is missing. In
                      SLEEP or STANDBY mode the value of this bit is ‘0’. The trigger level for this bit is VREF < 0.35V. This error
      REFDET
                      does not inhibit normal operation and is intended for status only. The value of this status bit is valid within 30µs
                      after a conversion start command and is invalid when not in conversion.
                      This bit is set to ‘1’ if two or more CHX_ORD bits decode to the same scan sequence order and are also
                      enabled. This bit is also set to ‘1’ in the case when a channel is enabled for scan with CHX_EN=’1’ and CHX_
                      ORD[2:0] = ‘000’ or ‘111’. The CHX_ORD[2:0] values of ‘000’ and ‘111’ are not allowed as order of an enabled
     ORDERR           channel. The allowable orders are ‘001’, ‘010’, ‘011’, ‘100’, ‘101’, ‘110’. The MAX11259 remains in STANDBY
                      state until this error is removed. The channel order must be strictly sequential and no missing numbers are
                      allowed. For instance, if 4 channels are enabled then the order must be ‘001’, ‘010’, ‘011’, ‘100’. Any other
                      order is flagged as ORDERR and the MAX11259 remains in STANDBY mode.
                      This bit is set to ‘1’ if more than one input channel is mapped to the same GPO/GPIO bump, and CHX_
     GPOERR           GPOEN is enabled for more than one channel. The MAX11259 remains in STANDBY state until this error is
                      removed.
                      This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate invalid configuration states. This bit is set if CAL[1:0] is programmed to ‘11’
      ERROR           which is an invalid state. This bit is set if CTRL1:SCYCLE = ‘0’ for scan modes 2 and 3. This error puts the
                      MAX11259 into STANDBY mode.

                     This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate that a system gain calibration results in an overrange condition of the calibration
    SYSGOR
                     coefficient. The SCGC calibration coefficient is set to the maximum value of 1.9999999.
                     This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate that the conversion result has exceeded the maximum or minimum value of the
      DOR            converter and that the result has been clipped or limited to the maximum or minimum value. When set to ‘0’
                     the conversion result is within the full-scale range of the inputs.
                     This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate that the modulator detected an analog overrange condition by having the input
       AOR
                     signal level greater than the reference voltage. This check for overrange includes the PGA gain.
                     These bits indicate the conversion rate that corresponds to the result in the DATA registers or the rate that was
    RATE[3:0]        used for calibration coefficient calculation. The corresponding RATE[3:0] is only valid until the DATA registers
                     are read. The decoding of RATE[3:0] is shown in Table 1.
                     These bits indicate the state of the MAX11259. See Table 7 for transition times.

                     This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate when a signal measurement is in progress. This indicates that a conversion,
     MSTAT           self-calibration, or system calibration is in progress and that the modulator is busy. When the modulator is not
                     converting, this bit will be set to ‘0’.
                     This bit is set to ‘1’ to indicate that a new conversion result is available in sequencer mode 1. A complete read
       RDY           of the corresponding DATA register will reset this bit to ‘0’. This bit is invalid in sequencer mode 2 or 3. The
                     function of this bit is redundant and is duplicated by the RDYB bump.

                                Selects the power-down state to be executed. The MAX11259 enters the selected power-down state
                                after a conversion command with MODE[1:0] set to ‘01’ is written. The state is decoded as below:
                                  PD1        PD0                                          DESCRIPTION

                                The ‘unipolar/bipolar’ bit controls the input range. A ‘1’ selects unipolar input range and a ‘0’ selects
             U/B
                                bipolar input range.
                                The ‘format’ bit controls the digital format of the bipolar range data. A ‘0’ selects two’s complement and
         FORMAT                 a ‘1’ selects offset binary format of the bipolar range. The data for unipolar range is always formatted
                                in offset binary format.
                                The ‘single-cycle’ bit selects either no-latency single conversion mode or continuous conversion in
                                sequencer mode 1. A ‘1’ selects single-cycle mode where a no-latency conversion is followed by a
          SCYCLE                power-down to SLEEP mode. A ‘0’ selects continuous conversion mode with a latency of 5 conversion
                                cycles for filtering. The RDYB bump goes low when valid/settled data is available. Only SCYCLE = ‘1’
                                is valid in sequencer mode 2 and 3.
                                The ‘continuous single-cycle’ bit selects between single or continuous conversions while operating
         CONTSC                 in single-cycle mode in sequencer mode 1. A ‘1’ selects continuous conversions and a ‘0’ selects a
                                single conversion.

                                External clock mode is enabled by setting this bit to ‘1’. In this mode, the internal oscillator is bypassed
          EXTCLK
                                and the GPIO0/CLK bump is configured as external clock input.
                                Setting this bit to ‘1’ enables the current source and current sink on the analog inputs to detect sensor
          CSSEN
                                opens or shorts.
                                Set this bit to ‘1’ to enable the internal LDO. Set this bit to ‘0’ when driving the CAPREG bump
          LDOEN                 externally with a 1.8V supply. When driving the CAPREG bump with external supply, the user must
                                ensure that the CAPREG bump is connected to the DVDD bump.
                                PGA low-power mode is enabled by setting this bit to ‘1’. The PGA operates with reduced power
         LPMODE                 consumption and reduced performance. The LPMODE does not affect power or performance when
                                the PGA is not enabled.
          PGAEN                 The PGA enable bit controls the operation of the PGA. A ‘1’ enables and a ‘0’ disables the PGA.
                                The ‘PGA’ bits control the PGA gain. The PGA gain is set by:

                                The value of this bit controls the GPO mode for sequencer mode 3. When set to ‘1’, the GPO and
                                the GPIO bumps are sequenced based on the channel mapbumpg in the CHMAP1 and CHMAP0
        GPO_MODE                registers. When set to ‘0’, the GPO and GPIO bumps are directly controlled by the GPO_DIR and
                                GPIO_CTRL registers, respectively, during conversion or STANDBY state. This bit has no effect in
                                sequencer modes 1 and 2.
                                This bit controls sync mode (see the Conversion Synchronization Using Sync Bump and External
       SYNC_MODE
                                Clock section). When set to ‘1’, the synchronization mode is enabled, when set to ‘0’ it is disabled.
                                This bit controls which calibration value is read during a calibration register inquiry. Set this bit to ‘1’ to

                                read back the interface value. Set this bit to ‘0’ to read back the internal register value.
                                The ‘no system gain’ bit controls the use of the system gain calibration coefficient. Set this bit to ‘1’
                                to disable the use of the system gain value when computing the final offset and gain corrected data
         NOSYSG

                                and gain corrected data value.
                                The ‘no self-calibration gain’ bit controls the use of the self-calibration gain calibration coefficient. Set
                                this bit to ‘1’ to disable the use of the self-calibration gain value when computing the final offset and
          NOSCG
                                gain corrected data value. Set this bit to ‘0’ to enable the use of the self-calibration gain value when
                                computing the final offset and gain corrected data value.
                                The ‘no self-calibration offset’ bit controls the use of the self-calibration offset calibration coefficient.
                                Set this bit to ‘1’ to disable the use of the self-calibration offset value when computing the final offset

                                This bit selects the functionality of the GPIO1/SYNC bump. Set this bit to ‘1’ to use the bump as GPIO,
        GPIO1_EN
                                or set the bit to ‘0’ to use the bump as SYNC input.
                                This bit selects the functionality of the GPIO0/CLK bump. Set this bit to ‘1’ to use the bump as GPIO,
        GPIO0_EN
                                or set the bit to ‘0’ to use the bump as external clock input.
                                The ‘direction’ bits configure the GPIO bumps either as input or output. DIR2 corresponds to GPIO2,
                                DIR1 corresponds to GPIO1, while DIR0 controls GPIO0. Set the DIR bit to ‘1’ to configure the GPIO
          DIR[2:0]              bump as output. The output value of the GPIO bump is determined by the value of the DIO bit. Set the
                                DIR bit to ‘0’ to configure the associated GPIO bump as input. The logic input value of the GPIO bump
                                can be read back from the DIO bit.
                                The ‘data input/output’ bits reflect the status of the GPIO bumps. DIO2 corresponds to GPIO2, DIO1
                                corresponds to GPIO1, while DIO0 corresponds to GPIO0. If the GPIO bump is configured as output,
          DIO[2:0]
                                the bump is driven to the logic value of DIO. If the GPIO bump is configured as input, DIO reflects the
                                logic value seen at the bump.

                              Defines the order during scan when the channel is enabled. The CHX_ORD[2:0] values of ‘000’
                              and ‘111’ are not allowed for the order of an enabled channel. The allowable orders are ‘001’, ‘010’,
                              ‘011’, ‘100’, ‘101’, ‘110’ representing first, second, third channel to be scanned, and so on. The value
                              of ‘000’ is a default value and the value of ‘111’ is greater than the number of scannable channels.
                              A value greater than the number of enabled channels is invalid and will set an error condition at
      CHX_ORD[2:0]
                              STAT:ORDERR. Setting a channels order to ‘000’ or ‘111’ and enabling it will set the STAT:ORDERR
                              flag in the STAT register. If sequencer mode 3 is selected, and more channels are enabled for
                              sequencing than available GPO/GPIO bumps, then the sequence order of the channels for which a
                              GPO/GPIO bump is enabled must be lower than for the channels which do not have a GPO/GPIO
                              bump mapped to them.
                              Set this bit to ‘1’ to enable scanning of this channel. Set this bit to ‘0’ to disable scanning of this
         CHX_EN
                              channel.
                              Used to enable activation of the GPO/GPIO bumps when this channel is selected during scan. Set this

GPO_DIR: GPO Direct Access Register (Read/Write)
                   Default = 0x00
  BIT NAME                                                                                         GPO2              GPO1         GPO0

 This register is used to turn on and off the general-purpose outputs directly after an associated bit is written except when CTRL3:GPO_
 MODE=’1’ during sequencer mode 3. When operating in sequencer mode 1 or 2, the activation of the GPOs is immediate upon setting
 a bit to ’1’, and the deactivation of the GPOs is immediate upon setting the bit to ‘0’. In SLEEP state, the values in this register do not
 control the state of the GPOs, as they all are deactivated. The register is writeable, but the values will not control the GPOs in SLEEP
 mode. In STANDBY state when CTRL3:GPO_MODE=’0’, this register accepts writes and updates the state of the GPOs immediately
 after the value of a bit changes. Writes to this register are ignored when operating in mode 3 when CTRL3:GPO_MODE=’1’. This
 register is enabled during system offset calibration, system gain calibration and self-calibration modes.

 The system offset calibration register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked in/out MSB
 first. This register holds the system offset calibration value. The format is in two’s complement binary format. A system calibration
 does not overwrite the SOC register.
 The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’ reads back
 the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3:CALREGSEL. The internal register can only be read during conversion.
 The system offset calibration value is subtracted from each conversion result—provided the NOSYSO bit in the CTRL3 register is
 set to ‘0’. The system offset calibration value is subtracted from the conversion result after self-calibration but before system gain
 correction. It is also applied prior to the 1x or 2x scale factor associated with bipolar and unipolar modes. When a system offset
 calibration is in progress, this register is not writable by the user.
SGC: System Gain Calibration Register (Read/Write)

 The system gain calibration register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked in/out MSB
 first. This register holds the system gain calibration value. The format is unsigned 24-bit binary. A system calibration does not
 overwrite the SGC register.
 The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’ reads back
 the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3:CALREGSEL. The internal register can only be read during conversion.
 The system gain calibration value is used to scale the offset corrected conversion result—provided the NOSYSG bit in the CTRL3
 register is set to ‘0’. The system gain calibration value scales the offset corrected result by up to 2x or can correct a gain error of
 approximately -50%. The amount of positive gain error that can be corrected is determined by modulator overload characteristics,
 which may be as much as +25%. When a system gain calibration is in progress, this register is not writable by the user.

 The self-calibration offset register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked in/out MSB
 first. This register holds the self-calibration offset value. The format is always in two’s complement binary format. An internal self-
 calibration does not overwrite the SCOC register.
 The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’ reads back
 the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3:CALREGSEL. The internal register can only be read during conversion.
 The self-calibration offset value is subtracted from each conversion result—provided the NOSCO bit in the CTRL3 register is set to
 ‘0’. The self-calibration offset value is subtracted from the conversion result before the self-calibration gain correction and before the
 system offset and gain correction. It is also applied prior to the 2x scale factor associated with unipolar mode. When a self-calibration
 is in progress, this register is not writable by the user.

 The self-calibration gain register is a 24-bit read/write register. The data written/read to/from this register is clocked in/out MSB first.
 This register holds the self-calibration gain value. The format is unsigned 24-bit binary. An internal self- calibration does not overwrite
 the SCGC register.
 The readback value of this register depends on CTRL3:CALREGSEL. A ‘1’ reads back the user programmed value. A ‘0’ reads back
 the results of an internal register as described in CTRL3:CALREGSEL. The internal register can only be read during conversion.
 The self-calibration gain calibration value is used to scale the self-calibration offset corrected conversion result before the system offset
 and gain calibration values have been applied – provided the NOSCG bit in the CTRL3 register is set to ‘0’. The self-calibration gain
 calibration value scales the self-calibration offset corrected conversion result by up to 2x or can correct a gain error of approximately
 –50%. The gain will be corrected to within 2 LSB. When a self- calibration is in progress, this register is not writable by the user.

 Each data register holds the conversion result for the corresponding channel. DATA0 is the data register for channel 0, DATA1 is
 for channel 1, etc.
 Each data register is a 24-bit read-only register. Any attempt to write data to this location will have no effect. The data read from
 these registers is clocked out MSB first. The result is stored in a format according to the FORMAT bit in the CTRL1 register. The data
 format while in unipolar mode is always offset binary. In offset binary format the most negative value is 0x000000, the midscale value
 is 0x800000 and the most positive value is 0xFFFFFF. In bipolar mode if the FORMAT bit = ‘1’ then the data format is offset binary. If
 the FORMAT bit = ‘0’, then the data format is two’s complement. In two’s complement the negative full-scale value is 0x800000, the
 midscale is 0x000000 and the positive full scale is 0x7FFFFF. Any input exceeding the available input range is limited to the minimum
 or maximum data value.
