The MAX1204 features an internal 4.096V reference and
a reference-buffer amplifier that simplifies gain trim. It
also has a VL pin that supplies power to the digital out-
puts. Output logic levels (3V, 3.3V, or 5V) are determined            ______________Ordering Information

 Note 1:   Tested at VDD = 5.0V; VSS = 0V; unipolar input mode.
 Note 2:   Relative accuracy is the analog value’s deviation (at any code) from its theoretical value after the full-scale range is
           calibrated.
 Note 3: Internal reference, offset nulled.
 Note 4: On-channel grounded; sine-wave applied to all off-channels.
 Note 5: Conversion time is defined as the number of clock cycles multiplied by the clock period; clock has 50% duty cycle.
 Note 6: Guaranteed by design. Not subject to production testing.
 Note 7: Common-mode range for analog inputs is from VSS to VDD.
 Note 8: External load should not change during the conversion for specified accuracy.
 Note 9: Shutdown supply current is measured with VL at 3.3V, and with all digital inputs tied to either VL or GND (Figure 12c);
           REFADJ = GND.
 Note 10: Logic supply current is measured with the digital outputs (DOUT and SSTRB) disabled (CS high). When the outputs are
           active (CS low), the logic supply current depends on fSCLK, and on the static and capacitive load at DOUT and SSTRB.
 Note 11: Measured at VSUPPLY +5% and VSUPPLY -5% only.
 Note 12: Measured at VL = 2.7V and VL = 3.6V.

                    TMS320CL3x to MAX1204 Interface
Figure 19 shows an application circuit to interface the
MAX1204 to the TMS320 in external clock mode. Figure
20 is the timing diagram for this interface circuit.
                                                                                       XF              CS
Use the following steps to initiate a conversion in the
MAX1204 and to read the results.
                                                                                     CLKX              SCLK
1) The TMS320 should be configured with CLKX (trans-
                                                                          TMS320LC3x
   mit clock) as an active-high output clock and CLKR
                                                                                     CLKR                   MAX1204
   (TMS320 receive clock) as an active-high input clock.
   The TMS320’s CLKX and CLKR are tied together with
                                                                                       DX              DIN
   the MAX1204’s SCLK input.
2) The MAX1204’s CS is driven low by the TMS320’s                                      DR              DOUT
   XF_ I/O port to enable data to be clocked into the
   MAX1204’s DIN.                                                                     FSR              SSTRB
3) Write an 8-bit word (1XXXXX11) to the MAX1204 to
   initiate a conversion and place the device into exter-
   nal clock mode. Refer to Table 2 to select the proper
   XXXXX bit values for your specific application.
4) The MAX1204’s SSTRB output is monitored via the
                                                                   Figure 19. MAX1204 to TMS320 Serial Interface
   TMS320’s FSR input. A falling edge on the SSTRB
   output indicates that the conversion is in progress
   and data is ready to be received from the MAX1204.
5) The TMS320 reads in one data bit on each of the
   next 16 rising edges of SCLK. These data bits repre-
   sent the 10-bit conversion result followed by two
   sub-bits and four trailing bits, which should be
   ignored.
6) Pull CS high to disable the MAX1204 until the next
   conversion is initiated.
