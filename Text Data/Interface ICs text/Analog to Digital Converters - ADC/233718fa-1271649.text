BOARD LAYOUT
To obtain the best performance from the LTC2337-18                     Recommended Layout
a printed circuit board is recommended. Layout for the
                                                                       The following is an example of a recommended PCB layout.
printed circuit board (PCB) should ensure the digital and
                                                                       A single solid ground plane is used. Bypass capacitors to
analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In
                                                                       the supplies are placed as close as possible to the supply
particular, care should be taken not to run any digital clocks
                                                                       pins. Low impedance common returns for these bypass
or signals alongside analog signals or underneath the ADC.
                                                                       capacitors are essential to the low noise operation of the
