Note 1:    Accuracy specifications tested at VDD = 5.0V. Performance at power-supply tolerance limits guaranteed by Power-Supply
           Rejection test. Tested for the ±10V (MAX196) and ±4.096V (MAX198) input ranges.
Note 2:    External reference: VREF = 4.096V, offset error nulled, ideal last code transition = FS - 3/2LSB.
Note 3:    Ground “on” channel; sine wave applied to all “off” channels.
Note 4:    Maximum full-power input frequency for 1LSB error with 10ns jitter = 3kHz.
Note 5:    Guaranteed by design. Not tested.
Note 6:    Use static loads only.
Note 7:    Tested using internal reference.
Note 8:    PSRR measured at full-scale.
Note 9:    External acquisition timing: starts at data valid at ACQMOD = low control byte; ends at rising edge of WR with ACQMOD
           = high control byte.
Note 10:   Not subject to production testing. Provided for design guidance only.
Note 11:   All input control signals specified with tR = tF = 5ns from a voltage level of 0.8V to 2.4V.
Note 12:   tDO is measured with the load circuits of Figure 2 and defined as the time required for an output to cross 0.8V or 2.4V.
Note 13:   tTR is defined as the time required for the data lines to change by 0.5V.

  25                RD           If CS is low, a falling edge on RD will enable a read operation on the data bus.
                                 In the internal acquisition mode, when CS is low, a rising edge on WR latches in configuration data and starts an

                                 starts an acquisition, and a second rising edge on WR ends acquisition and starts a conversion cycle.

modes, with an external clock. A 100kHz to 2.0MHz
external clock with 45% to 55% duty cycle is required for
proper operation. Operating at clock frequencies lower

capacitor, and subsequently degrade performance.
