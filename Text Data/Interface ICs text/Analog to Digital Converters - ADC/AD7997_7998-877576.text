    A device must provide a data hold time for SDA in order to bridge the undefined region of the SCL falling edge.

ESD CAUTION
ESD (electrostatic discharge) sensitive device. Electrostatic charges as high as 4000 V readily accumulate on
the human body and test equipment and can discharge without detection. Although this product features
proprietary ESD protection circuitry, permanent damage may occur on devices subjected to high energy
electrostatic discharges. Therefore, proper ESD precautions are recommended to avoid performance
degradation or loss of functionality.

6               REFIN                Voltage Reference Input. The external reference for the AD7997/AD7998 should be applied to this input pin. The
                                     voltage range for the external reference is 1.2 V to VDD. A 0.1 µF and 1 µF capacitors should be placed between REFIN
                                     and AGND. See Typical Connection Diagram.

14              VIN2                 Analog Input 2. Single-ended analog input channel. The input range is 0 V to REFIN.
15              AS                   Logic Input. Address select input that selects one of three I2C addresses for the AD7997/AD7998, as shown in Table 6.
                                     The device address depends on the voltage applied to this pin.
16              CONVST               Logic Input Signal. Convert start signal. This is an edge-triggered logic input. The rising edge of this signal powers up
                                     the part. The power-up time for the part is 1 µs. The falling edge of CONVST places the track/hold into hold mode and
                                     initiates a conversion. A power-up time of at least 1 µs must be allowed for the CONVST high pulse; otherwise, the
                                     conversion result is invalid (see the Modes of Operation section).
17              ALERT/BUSY           Digital Output. Selectable as an ALERT or BUSY output function. When configured as an ALERT, this pin acts as an out-
                                     of-range indicator and, if enabled, becomes active when the conversion result violates the DATAHIGH or DATALOW
                                     register values. See the Limit Registers section. When configured as a BUSY output, this pin becomes active when a
                                     conversion is in progress. Open-drain output.
18              SDA                  Digital I/O. Serial bus bidirectional data. Open-drain output. External pull-up resistor required.
19              SCL                  Digital Input. Serial bus clock. Open-drain input. External pull-up resistor required.

INTERNAL REGISTER STRUCTURE
The AD7997/AD7998 contain 17 internal registers that are used                                              CONVERSION

Each data register has an address that the address pointer register                                        REGISTER

CONFIGURATION REGISTER
The configuration register is a 16-bit read/write register that is used to set the operating mode of the AD7997/AD7998. The 4 MSBs of the
register are unused. The bit functions of all 12 LSBs of the configuration register are outlined in Table 9. A 2-byte write is necessary when
writing to the configuration register.

D11 to D4      CH8 to CH1      These 8-channel address bits select the analog input channel(s) to be converted. A 1 in any of Bits D11 to D4
                               selects a channel for conversion. If more than one channel bit is set to 1, the AD7997/AD7998 sequence
                               through the selected channels, starting with the lowest channel. All unused channels should be set to 0. Prior
                               to initiating a conversion, a channel or channels for conversion must be selected in the configuration register.
D3             FLTR            The value written to this bit of the control register determines whether the filtering on SDA and SCL is
                               enabled or is to be bypassed. If this bit is a 1, then the filtering is enabled; if it is a 0, the filtering is bypassed.
D2             ALERT EN        The hardware ALERT function is enabled if this bit is set to 1, and disabled if this bit is set to 0. This bit is used
                               in conjunction with the BUSY/ALERT bit to determine if the ALERT/BUSY pin acts as an ALERT or a BUSY
                               output (see Table 12).
D1             BUSY/ALERT      This bit is used in conjunction with the ALERT EN bit to determine if the ALERT/ BUSY output, Pin 17, acts as
                               an ALERT or BUSY output (see Table 12), and if Pin 17 is configured as an ALERT output pin, if it is to be reset.
D0             BUSY/ALERT      This bit determines the active polarity of the ALERT/BUSY pin regardless of whether it is configured as an
               POLARITY        ALERT or BUSY output. It is active low if this bit is set to 0, and active high if set to 1.

data line SDA, while the serial clock line, SCL, remains high.
This indicates that an address/data stream follows. All slave
peripherals connected to the serial bus responds to the start
condition and shift in the next eight bits, consisting of a
7-bit address (MSB first) plus an R/W bit that determines the
direction of the data transfer, that is, whether data is written to
or read from the slave device.
The peripheral whose address corresponds to the transmitted
address responds by pulling the data line low during the low
period before the ninth clock pulse, known as the acknowledge
bit. All other devices on the bus remain idle while the selected
device waits for data to be read from or written to it. If the R/W
bit is a 0, the master writes to the slave device. If the R/W bit is a
1, the master reads from the slave device.

The value of the pull-up resistor depends on the application, but
should be as large as possible to avoid excessive sink currents at
