The MAX1290/MAX1292 low-power, 12-bit analog-to-                ♦ 12-Bit Resolution, ±0.5 LSB Linearity
digital converters (ADCs) feature a successive-approxi-
mation ADC, automatic power-down, fast wake-up                  ♦ +5V Single-Supply Operation
(2µs), an on-chip clock, +2.5V internal reference, and          ♦ User-Adjustable Logic Level (+2.7V to +5.5V)
a high-speed, byte-wide parallel interface. The devices
operate with a single +5V analog supply and feature a           ♦ Internal +2.5V Reference
VLOGIC pin that allows them to interface directly with a        ♦ Software-Configurable Analog Input Multiplexer
+2.7V to +5.5V digital supply.

Power consumption is only 10mW (VDD = VLOGIC) at a                  4-Channel Pseudo-Differential (MAX1290)
400ksps max sampling rate. Two software-selectable
power-down modes enable the MAX1290/MAX1292 to                        4-Channel Single-Ended/
be shut down between conversions; accessing the par-                  2-Channel Pseudo-Differential (MAX1292)
allel interface returns them to normal operation.               ♦ Software-Configurable Unipolar/Bipolar Analog
Powering down between conversions can cut supply                  Inputs
current to under 10µA at reduced sampling rates.
                                                                ♦ Low Current: 2.5mA (400ksps)

Note 1: Tested at VDD = +5V, COM = GND, = 0, unipolar single-ended input mode.
Note 2: Relative accuracy is the deviation of the analog value at any code from its theoretical value after offset and gain errors have
        been removed.
Note 3: Offset nulled.
Note 4: On channel is grounded; sine wave applied to off channels.
Note 5: Conversion time is defined as the number of clock cycles times the clock period; clock has 50% duty cycle.
Note 6: Input voltage range referenced to negative input. The absolute range for the analog inputs is from GND to VDD.
Note 7: External load should not change during conversion for specified accuracy.
Note 8: When bit 5 is set low for internal acquisition, WR must not return low until after the first falling clock edge of the conversion.
