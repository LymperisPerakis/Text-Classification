The MAX132 is a CMOS, 18-bit plus sign, serial-output,                         ♦ Low Supply Current:
analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Multi-slope integra-                           60µA (Normal Operation)
tion provides high-resolution conversions in less time
                                                                                  1µA (Sleep-Mode Operation)
than standard integrating ADCs, allowing operation up
to 100 conversions per second. Low conversion noise                            ♦ ±0.006% FSR Accuracy at 16 Conv/sec
provides guaranteed operation with ±512mV full-scale                           ♦ Low Noise: 15µVRMS
input range (2µV/LSB). A simple 4-wire serial interface
connects easily to all common microprocessors, and                             ♦ Serial I/O Interface with Programmed Output for
twos-complement output coding simplifies bipolar mea-                            Mux and PGA
surements. Typical supply current is only 60µA and is
