high-speed 12-bit parallel interface. They operate with
a single +5V analog supply.                                     ♦ Software-Configurable Analog Input Multiplexer

Both devices offer software-configurable analog inputs for
unipolar/bipolar and single-ended/pseudo-differential               2.8mA (420ksps)
operation. In single-ended mode, the MAX1266 has six                1.0mA (100ksps)
input channels and the MAX1268 has two (three input                 400µA (10ksps)
channels and one input channel, respectively, when in               2µA (Shutdown)

                  Note 1: Tested at VDD = +5V, COM = GND, unipolar single-ended input mode.
                  Note 2: Relative accuracy is the deviation of the analog value at any code from its theoretical value after offset and gain errors have
                          been removed.
                  Note 3: Offset nulled.
                  Note 4: On channel is grounded; sine wave applied to off channels.
                  Note 5: Conversion time is defined as the number of clock cycles times the clock period; clock has a 50% duty cycle.
                  Note 6: Input voltage range referenced to negative input. The absolute range for the analog inputs is from GND to VDD.
                  Note 7: External load should not change during conversion for specified accuracy.
                  Note 8: When bit 5 is set low for internal acquisition, WR must not return low until after the first falling clock edge of the conversion.

                                       In single-ended mode, input signals are referred to COM. In pseudo-differential mode, the voltage
                                       difference between two channels is measured (Tables 2 and 4).
                                       UNI/BIP = 0: Bipolar mode

                                       In unipolar mode, an analog input signal from 0V to VREF can be converted; in bipolar mode, the
                                       signal can range from -VREF/2 to +VREF/2.
                                       Address bits A2, A1, A0 select which of the 6/2 (MAX1266/MAX1268) channels is to be converted
