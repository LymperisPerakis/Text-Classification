disable SDO and turn off SCK. The auto power-down feature
will reduce the power dissipation of the LTC2377-16 as
the sampling frequency is reduced. Since power is con-
sumed only during a conversion, the LTC2377-16 remains
powered-down for a larger fraction of the conversion cycle
(tCYC) at lower sample rates, thereby reducing the average
power dissipation which scales with the sampling rate as
shown in Figure 12.
