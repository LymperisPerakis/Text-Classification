                  Stresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device. These are stress ratings only, and functional
                  operation of the device at these or any other conditions beyond those indicated in the operational sections of the specifications is not implied. Exposure to
                  absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.

Most applications require an input buffer amplifier to
achieve 14-bit accuracy. If the input signal is multiplexed,
the input channel should be switched immediately after
acquisition, rather than near the end of or after a conver-
sion. This allows more time for the input buffer amplifier to
respond to a large step-change in input signal. The input
amplifier must have a high enough slew rate to complete
