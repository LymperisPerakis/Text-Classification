NCV7341
High Speed Low Power CAN
Transceiver
  The NCV7341 CAN transceiver is the interface between a
controller area network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
bus and may be used in both 12 V and 24 V systems. The transceiver
provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential                                http://onsemi.com
receive capability to the CAN controller.
  Due to the wide common−mode voltage range of the receiver inputs,
the NCV7341 is able to reach outstanding levels of electromagnetic                                   PIN ASSIGNMENT
susceptibility (EMS). Similarly, extremely low electromagnetic
emission (EME) is achieved by the excellent matching of the output
signals.                                                                             TxD     1                                    14     STB
