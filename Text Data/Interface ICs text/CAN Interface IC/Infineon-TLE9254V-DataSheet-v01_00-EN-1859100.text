TLE9254V
High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Description
•    SAE J1939
•    SAE J2284
The TLE9254V is available in a PG-DSO-14 package and in a small, leadless PG-TSON-14 package. Both packages
are RoHS compliant and halogen free. Additionally the PG-TSON-14 package supports the solder joint
requirements for automated optical inspection (AOI).
As an interface between the physical bus layer and the HS CAN protocol controller, the TLE9254V is designed to
protect the microcontroller against interference generated inside the network. A very high ESD robustness and
the very high RF immunity allow the use in automotive applications without additional protection devices, such
as suppressor diodes.
The very high transmitter symmetry combined with the optimized delay symmetry of the receiver enables the
TLE9254V to support CAN FD data frames up to 5 Mbit/s. Based on the high symmetry of the CANH and CANL
output signals, the TLE9254V provides a very low level of electromagnetic emission (EME) within a wide
frequency range. The TLE9254V fulfills even stringent EMC test limits without external components, such as a
common mode choke.
TLE9254V offers low-power management using the stand-by mode with an optimized, very low quiescent
current. In stand-by mode the typical quiescent current for one channel of the TLE9254V is below 10 µA, while
the CAN channel can still wake up on a signal on the HS CAN bus.
Fail-safe features such as overtemperature protection, output current limitation or the TxD timeout feature are
designed to protect the TLE9254V and the external circuitry from irreparable damage.
While the transceiver TLE9254V is not supplied, the bus is switched off and exhibits an ideal passive behavior
with the lowest possible load to all other subscribers of the HS CAN network.
TLE9254V supports 3.3 V as well as 5 V supplied microcontrollers with the VIO.

High speed CAN functional description
4                    High speed CAN functional description
HS CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. ISO 11898 describes the use of the Controller Area Network (CAN) within road vehicles. According
to the 7-layer OSI reference model, the physical layer of an HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission
from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within the network. The physical layer specification of a
CAN bus system includes all electrical specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the
physical layer specification. The TLE9254V is a high speed CAN transceiver with a dedicated bus wake-up
function as defined in the latest ISO 11898-2 HS CAN standard.

TLE9254V
High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
High speed CAN functional description
The TLE9254V is a high speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. An HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates up to 5 MBit/s. HS CAN signals can have the following states on the CAN bus: dominant and recessive (see
Figure 3).
The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as input and output
simultaneously. The RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The TxD pin is the serial data
input from the CAN controller, the RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller. The TLE9254V includes
a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the bus medium and monitor the data
from the bus medium at the same time, see Figure 1. The TLE9254V converts the serial data stream, which is
available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output signal on the CAN bus, provided by the CANH
and CANL pins. The receiver stage of the TLE9254V monitors the data on the CAN bus and converts them to a
serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A "low" signal on the TxD pin creates a dominant signal on the
CAN bus, followed by a logical "low" signal on the RxD pin (see Figure 3). The feature of broadcasting data to
the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the CAN bus simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit
arbitration within CAN.
ISO 11898-2 specifies the voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers. Whether a data bit is dominant or recessive
depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL pins:
VDiff = VCANH - VCANL.
To transmit a dominant signal to the CAN bus, the amplitude of the differential signal VDiff is higher than or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a recessive signal from the CAN bus, the amplitude of the differential VDiff is lower than
or equal to 0.5 V.
In partially-supplied high speed CAN the bus nodes of one common network have different power supply
conditions. Some nodes are connected to the common power supply, while other nodes are disconnected from
the power supply and in power-down state. Regardless of whether the CAN bus subscriber is supplied or not,
each subscriber connected to the common bus media must not interfere with the communication. The
TLE9254V is designed to support partially-supplied networks. In power-down state, the receiver input resistors
are switched off and the transceiver input has a high resistance.
For permanently supplied ECUs, the TLE9254V provides a stand-by mode. In stand-by mode, the power
consumption of the TLE9254V is optimized to a minimum, while the device can still recognize wake-up patterns
on the CAN bus and signal the wake-up event to the external microcontroller.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level at
the VIO pin.

TLE9254V
High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Modes of operation
5                  Modes of operation
The description within this chapter applies for each of the two HS CAN channels of TLE9254V. The HS CAN
channels are independent from each other. Both HS CAN channels have equal functionality.
The TLE9254V supports two different modes of operation for each HS CAN channel (see Figure 4):
•    Normal-operating mode (see Normal-operating mode)
•    Stand-by mode (see Stand-by mode)
The mode selection input pin STB triggers mode changes. If a wake-up event occurs on the HS CAN bus, then
the TLE9254V indicates that on the RxD output pin in stand-by mode, but it does not trigger a mode change. The
transceiver channels work independently from each other. Both channels are supplied by VIO supply.
Transmitter output stage of channel 1 is supplied by VCC and the mode of operation is selected by STB1.
Transmitter output stage of channel 2 is supplied by VCC and the mode of operation is selected by STB2.

TLE9254V
High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Modes of operation
5.1                    Normal-operating mode
In normal-operating mode the TLE9254V sends and receives data from the HS CAN bus. All functions are active
(see Figure 4):
• The transmitter is enabled and drives the serial data stream on the TxD input pin to the bus pins CANH and
      CANL.
•     The receiver is enabled and converts the signal from the bus to a serial data stream on the RxD output pin.
• The bus biasing is connected to VCC/2.
•     The STB input pin drives the mode of operation and can change the mode of operation.
•     The TxD timeout function is enabled (see TxD timeout feature).
•     The overtemperature protection is enabled (see Overtemperature protection).
•     The undervoltage detection on VCC is enabled (see Undervoltage detection on VCC).
•     The undervoltage detection on VIO is enabled (see Undervoltage detection on VIO).
Conditions for entering the normal-operation mode for one channel of TLE9254V:
•     One channel of TLE9254V enters normal-operating mode after tMode, by setting the respective mode
      selection pin STB to "low" (see Figure 4).

Figure 5               Mode change to normal-operating mode with dominant signal on TxD
If a recessive signal on TxD input pin is applied after a mode change from any mode to normal-operating mode,
then the TLE9254V enables the transmitter path. If a dominant signal is on TxD input pin after a mode change,
then the TLE9254V keeps the transmitter path disabled and blocks the dominant signal in order not to disturb
the bus communication (see Figure 5).

High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Modes of operation
5.2                    Stand-by mode
The stand-by mode is the low-power mode of the TLE9254V. In stand-by mode most of the functions are
disabled and each channel of TLE9254V monitors the respective bus for a valid wake-up pattern (WUP), see Bus
Wake-up pattern (WUP) detection. The following functions are available in stand-by mode:
•    The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•    The TLE9254V monitors the bus for a valid wake-up pattern (WUP).
• The RxD output pin indicates a wake-up (see RxD pin wake-up behavior).
•    The bus biasing is connected to GND.
•    The TxD timeout function is disabled.
•    The overtemperature protection is disabled.
•    The undervoltage detection on VCC is disabled (see Undervoltage detection on VCC).
•    The undervoltage detection on VIO is enabled (see Undervoltage detection on VIO).
Conditions for entering the stand-by mode for one channel of TLE9254V:
•    If VIO > VIO_UV for at least tPON after power-on reset, then the TLE9254V enters stand-by mode.
•    If STB is set to "high" in normal-operating mode, then the TLE9254V enters stand-by mode.

High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Modes of operation
5.3                    Power-on reset
In power-on reset the CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE9254V acts as a high-impedance input with a very
low leakage current. The highly-resistive input does not influence the recessive level of the CAN network and
allows an optimized EME performance of the entire HS CAN.
In power-on reset all functions of the TLE9254V are disabled and all channels are switched off:
•    The transmitter and receiver are disabled.
•    The bus biasing is connected to high impedance.
•    The TxD timeout function is disabled.
• The overtemperature protection is disabled.
• The undervoltage detection on VCC is disabled.
•    The undervoltage detection on VIO is disabled.
•    The logical input pins are blocked.
•    RxD is connected to high impedance.
Conditions for entering the power-on reset:
•    VIO is below the VIO_UV threshold (see Figure 6).

TLE9254V
High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Modes of operation
5.4                  Bus Wake-up pattern (WUP) detection
Each channel of TLE9254V has a separate remote wake-up feature called bus wake-up feature according to
ISO 11898-2:2016. In stand-by mode the low-power receiver monitors the activity on the CAN bus. If it detects a
wake-up pattern, then the device indicates the wake-up signal on the RxD output pin of the dedicated channel.
A wake-up event does not trigger a mode change of the respective channel. The TLE9254V remains in stand-by
mode until the microcontroller requests a mode change to normal-operating mode. A valid wake-up pattern
triggers a wake-up of the dedicated bus.
5.4.1                Bus Wake-up pattern (WUP)
The wake-up pattern contains the following sequence of signals:
•    dominant with pulse width > tFilter
•    recessive with pulse width > tFilter
•    dominant with pulse width > tFilter
The tWake starts with the first valid dominant pulse (pulse width > tFilter). The subsequent recessive and
dominant pulses must occur within tWake to fulfill a wake-up pattern, see Figure 8. As long as the TLE9254V does
not detect a wake-up event, the RxD output remains "high".

TLE9254V
High speed dual CAN transceiver with bus wake-up
Fail-safe functions
6                     Fail-safe functions
6.1                   Short circuit protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short circuit proof to GND and short circuit proof to a positive supply
voltage. A current limiting circuit is designed to protect the transceiver against damage.
6.2                   Unconnected logic pins
If the input pins are not connected and floating, then this forces the TLE9254V into fail-safe behavior (see Table
5).

Input signal                           Default state                            Comment

6.3                   TxD timeout feature
The TxD timeout feature protects the CAN bus from permanently blocking in case the logical signal on the TxD
pin is continuously "low". A continuous "low" signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-up
microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example. In normal-operating mode, a
logical "low" signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD_TO enables the TxD timeout feature and the TLE9254V
disables the transmitter (see Figure 10). The receiver is still active. It monitors the CAN bus communication on
the CANH and CANL pins and reflects it on the RxD pin. The TxD timeout feature works for each CAN channel
independently.

Figure 10             TxD timeout function
Figure 10 shows how the transmitter is disabled and enabled again. A permanent "low" signal on the TxD input
pin activates the TxD timeout function and disables the transmitter. To release the transmitter after a TxD
timeout event, the TLE9254V requires a signal change from "low" to "high" on the TxD input pin.

6.4                    Overtemperature protection
The integrated overtemperature detection is designed to protect the TLE9254V from thermal overstress of the
transmitter. If the temperature exceeds the threshold TJSD, then the TLE9254V disables the transmitter. After the
device cools down, the TLE9254V enables the transmitter again (see Figure 11). A hysteresis is implemented
within the temperature sensor.

6.5                    Undervoltage detection on VCC
If VCC < VCC_UV, then the affected channel might not be able to provide the correct bus levels on the CANH and
CANL output pins. To avoid any interference with the network the TLE9254V disables the transmitter of the
affected channel (see Figure 12). If VCC has recovered (VCC > VCC_UV) for more than the glitch filter time tFilter AND
if the tRecovery time has expired, then the TLE9254V enables the transmitter.

6.7                 Delay time for mode change
The HS CAN transceiver TLE9254V changes the mode of operation within the time window tMode.During the
mode change the TLE9254V sets the RxD output pin permanently to "high", so RxD does not reflect the status on
the CANH and CANL input pins then. After the mode change is completed, the TLE9254V releases the RxD output
pin.
