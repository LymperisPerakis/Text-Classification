NCV7441
Dual High Speed Low
Power CAN Transceiver
   The NCV7441, dual CAN transceiver offers two fully independent
high−speed CAN transceivers which can be individually connected to
two CAN protocol controllers. The CAN channels can be separately
put to normal or to standby mode, in which remote wakeup detection                          http://onsemi.com
from the bus is possible.
   Due to the shared auxiliary circuitry and common package, this                                                           MARKING

   If the main power supply VCC (nominal 5 V) is above its under−voltage (VCC_UV) level, each CAN channel can enter either
normal mode (when the corresponding STB1/2 digital input is pulled Low) or standby mode (when the corresponding STB1/2
signal is left High):
• In the normal mode:
    ♦ The bus transceiver is ready to transmit and receive CAN bus signals with the full CAN communication speed (up to
       1 Mbps) and thus interconnect the CAN bus with the corresponding CAN controller through digital pins TxD1/2 and
       RxD1/2
    ♦ The bus pins are internally biased to typically VCC/2 through the input circuitry
    ♦ TxD1/2 input pin is monitored by a timeout in order to prevent a permanent dominant being forced to the bus thus
       preventing other nodes from communicating. If TxD1/2 is Low for longer than tcnt(timeout), the transmitter switches
       back to recessive. Only when TxD1/2 returns to High, the timeout counter is reset and the transmitter is ready to
       transmit dominant symbols again. The TxD1/2 timeout protection is implemented individually for both CAN
       transceivers.
    ♦ A common thermal monitoring circuit compares the circuit junction temperatures with threshold TJ(sd). If the thermal
       shutdown level is exceeded, dominant transmission is disabled. The circuit remains biased and ready to transmit but
       the logical path from TxD1/2 pin(s) is blocked. The transmission is again enabled when the junction temperature
       decreases below the shutdown level and the TxD1/2 pin returns to the High level, thus avoiding thermal oscillations.
• In the standby mode:
    ♦ The respective transmitter is disabled and the current consumption of the channel is fundamentally reduced. Only the
       low−power receiver on the channel remains active in order to detect potential CAN bus wakeups. The logical signal
       on TxD1/2 input is ignored.
    ♦ The bus pins are biased to GND through the input circuitry
    ♦ Digital output RxD1/2 signals the output of the low−power receiver and can be used as a wakeup signal in the
       application. A filtering time tdBUS is applied between the bus activity and the RxD1/2 signal in order to ensure that
       only sufficiently long dominant signals on the bus will be propagated to the digital output. In addition, dominant bus
       signals are ignored in case they were present during normal−to−standby mode transition; in this way unwanted
       wakeups are avoided in case of permanent dominant failure on the bus. Example waveforms illustrating bus activity
       detection in standby mode are shown in Figure 3.
   In order to ensure a safe device state, the digital inputs STB1/2 and TxD1/2 are connected through internal pull−up resistors
to VCC thus ensuring that both channels remain in standby mode and/or no dominant can be transmitted in case any of the digital
inputs gets disconnected.
