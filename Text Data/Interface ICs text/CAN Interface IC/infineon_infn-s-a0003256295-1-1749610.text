Functional Description
4            Functional Description
HS CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within
the network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer standards of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The is a High Speed
CAN transceiver without a wake-up function and defined by the international standard ISO11898-2.

High Speed CAN Transceiver
Functional Description
The is a High-Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the physical
bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission rates for
CAN FD frames up to 2 MBit/s. Characteristic for HS CAN networks are the two signal states on the HS CAN bus:
dominant and recessive (see Figure 3).
VCC and GND are the supply pins for the . The pins CANH and CANL are the interface to the HS CAN bus and
operate in both directions, as an input and as an output. RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the CAN
controller, the TxD pin is an input pin and the RxD pin is an output pin. The NEN and NRM pins are the input
pins for the mode selection (see Figure 4).
By setting the TxD input pin to logical “low” the transmitter of the drives a dominant signal to the CANH and
CANL pins. Setting TxD input to logical “high” turns off the transmitter and the output voltage on CANH and
CANL discharges towards the recessive level. The recessive output voltage is provided by the bus-biasing (see
Figure 1). The output of the transmitter is considered to be dominant, when the voltage difference between
CANH and CANL is at least higher than 1.5 V (VDiff = VCANH - VCANL).
Parallel to the transmitter the normal-mode receiver monitors the signal on the CANH and CANL pins and
indicates it on the RxD output pin. A dominant signal on the CANH and CANL pins sets the RxD output pin to
logical “low”, vice versa a recessive signal sets the RxD output to logical “high”. The normal-mode receiver
considers a voltage difference (VDiff) between CANH and CANL above 0.9 V as dominant and below 0.5 V as
recessive.
To be conform with HS CAN features, like the bit to bit arbitration, the signal on the RxD output has to follow
the signal on the TxD input within a defined loop delay tLoop ≤ 255 ns.

Figure 4       Mode state diagram
4.2.1         Normal-operating Mode
In normal-operating mode the transmitter and the receiver of the HS CAN transceiver are active (see
Figure 1). The HS CAN transceiver sends the serial data stream on the TxD input pin to the CAN bus. The data
on the CAN bus is displayed at the RxD pin simultaneously. A logical “low” signal on the NEN pin and a logical
“high” signal on the NRM pin selects the normal-operating mode, while the transceiver is supplied by VCC (see
Table 2 for details).
4.2.2         Power-save Mode
The power-save mode is an idle mode of the with optimized power consumption. In power-save mode the
transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off. The can not send any data to the HS CAN bus nor
receive any data from the HS CAN bus.
The RxD output pin is permanently “high” in the power-save mode.
A logical “high” signal on the NEN pin selects the power-save mode, while the transceiver is supplied by the
transmitter supply VCC (see Table 2 for details).
In power-save mode the bus input pins are not biased. Therefore the CANH and CANL input pins are floating
and the HS CAN bus interface has a high resistance.
4.2.3         Receive-only Mode
In receive-only mode the normal-mode receiver is active and the transmitter is turned off. The can receive
data from the HS CAN bus, but cannot send any data to the HS CAN bus.
A logical “low” signal on the NEN pin and a logical “low” signal on the NRM pin selects the receive-only mode,
while the transceiver is supplied by VCC (see Table 2 for details).

Functional Description
4.3.1        Power-down State
Independent of the NEN and NRM input pins the is in power-down state when the transmitter supply voltage
VCC is turned off (see Figure 5).
In the power-down state the input resistors of the receiver are disconnected from the bus biasing VCC/2. The
CANH and CANL bus interface of the is floating and acts as a high-impedance input with a very small leakage
current. The high-ohmic input does not influence the recessive level of the CAN network and allows an
optimized EME performance of the entire HS CAN network (see also Table 2).
4.3.2        Power-up
The HS CAN transceiver powers up if the transmitter supply VCC is connected to the device. By default the
device powers up in power-save mode, due to the internal pull-up resistor on the NEN pin to VCC.
In case the device needs to power-up to normal-operating mode, the NEN pin needs to be pulled active to
logical “low” while the NRM pin is logical “high” (see Figure 5).

4.3.3         Undervoltage on the Transmitter Supply VCC
In case the transmitter supply VCC falls below the threshold VCC < VCC(UV,F), the transceiver can not provide the
correct bus levels to the CANH and CANL anymore. The normal-mode receiver is powered by the transmitter
supply VCC. In case of insufficient VCC supply the can neither transmit the CANH and CANL signals correctly to
bus nor can it receive them properly. Therefore the powers down and blocks both, the transmitter and the
receiver.
The transceiver powers up again, when the transmitter supply VCC recovers from the undervoltage condition.

Fail Safe Functions
5             Fail Safe Functions
5.1           Short Circuit Protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short circuit proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device is heating up due to a
continuous short on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus
transmitter.
5.2           Unconnected Logic Pins
All logic input pins have an internal pull-up resistor to VCC. In case the VCC supply is activated and the logical
pins are open, the enters into the power-save mode by default. In power-save mode the transmitter of the
is disabled and the bus bias is floating.
5.3           TxD Time-out Function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example. In normal-operating mode, a
logical “low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out feature and the disables the
transmitter (see Figure 7). The receiver is still active and the data on the bus continues to be monitored by the
RxD output pin.

Figure 7       TxD time-out function
Figure 7 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the
TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter
after a TxD time-out event the requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to logical
“high”.

5.4           Overtemperature Protection
The has an integrated overtemperature detection to protect the against thermal overstress of the
transmitter. The overtemperature protection is active in normal-operating mode and disabled in power-save
mode and receive-only mode. In case of an overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor will disable
the transmitter (see Figure 1) while the transceiver remains in normal-operating mode.
After the device has cooled down the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 8). A hysteresis is implemented
within the temperature sensor.

5.5           Delay Time for Mode Change
The HS CAN transceiver changes the mode of operation within the time window tMode. Depending on the
selected mode of operation, the RxD output pin is set to logical “high” during the mode change.
In this case the RxD output does not reflect the status on the CANH and CANL input pins (see as an example
Figure 12 and Figure 13).

8.3           Examples for Mode Changes
•   The mode change is executed independently of the signal on the HS CAN bus. The CANH, CANL inputs may
    be either dominant or recessive. They can be also permanently shorted to GND or VCC.
•   A mode change is performed independently of the signal on the TxD input. The TxD input may be either
    logical “high” or “low”.
Analog to that, changing the NEN input pin to logical “high” changes the mode of operation to the power-save
mode. Changing the NEN input pin and the NRM input pin to logical “low” changes the mode of operation to
the receive-only mode. Both mode changes are independent on the signals at the CANH, CANL and TxD pins.
Note:         In case the TxD signal is “low” setting the NRM input pin to logical “high” and the NEN input pin to
              logical “low” changes the device to normal-operating mode and drives a dominant signal to the
              HS CAN bus”.
Note:         The TxD time-out is only effective in normal-operating mode. The TxD time-out timer starts when the
               enters normal-operating mode and the TxD input is set to logical “low”.

8.3.1         Mode Change while the TxD Signal is “low”
The example in Figure 13 shows a mode change to normal-operating mode while the TxD input is logical
“low”. The HS CAN signal is recessive, assuming all other HS CAN bus subscribers are also sending a recessive
bus signal.
While the transceiver is in power-save mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off.
The drives no signal to the HS CAN bus nor does it receive any signal from the HS CAN bus. Changing the NEN
to logical “low” turns the mode of operation to normal-operating mode, while the TxD input signal remains
logical “low”. The transmitter and the normal-mode receiver remain disabled until the mode transition is
completed. In normal-operating mode the transceiver and the normal-mode receiver are active. The “low”
signal on the TxD input drives a dominant signal to the HS CAN bus and the RxD output pin becomes logical
“low”, following the dominant signal on the HS CAN bus.
Changing the mode of operation from normal-operating mode to receive-only mode by setting the NRM input
pin to “low”, disables the transmitter and the TxD input, but the normal-mode receiver and the RxD output
remain active. The HS CAN bus becomes recessive since the transmitter is disabled. The RxD input indicates
the recessive HS CAN bus signal by a logical “high” output signal (see also the example in Figure 13).
Mode changes between the power-save mode on the one side and the normal-operating mode or the receive-
only mode on the other side, disable the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver. No signal can be driven
to the HS CAN bus nor can it be received from the HS CAN bus. Mode changes between the normal-operating
mode and the receive-only mode disable the transmitter and the normal mode receiver remains active. The
HS CAN transceiver monitors the HS CAN bus also during the mode transition from normal-operating mode
to receive-only mode and vice versa.
8.3.2         Mode Change while the Bus Signal is dominant
The example in Figure 14 shows a mode change while the bus is dominant and the TxD input signal is set to
logical “high”.
While the transceiver is in power-save mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off.
The drives no signal to the HS CAN bus nor does it receive any signal from the HS CAN bus. Changing the NEN
to logical “low” turns the mode of operation to normal-operating mode, while the TxD input signal remains
logical “high”. The transmitter and the normal-mode receiver remain disabled until the mode transition is
completed. In normal-operating mode the transceiver and the receiver are active and therefor the RxD output
changes to logical “low” indicating the dominant signal on the HS CAN bus.
Changing the mode of operation from normal-operating mode to receive-only mode by setting the NRM input
pin to “low”, disables the transmitter and the TxD input, but the normal-mode receiver and the RxD output
remain active. Since the dominant signal on the HS CAN bus is driven by another HS CAN bus subscriber, the
bus remains dominant and the RxD input indicates the dominant HS CAN bus signal by a logical “low” output
signal (see also the example in Figure 14).
