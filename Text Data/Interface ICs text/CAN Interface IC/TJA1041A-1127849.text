1. General description
              The TJA1041A provides an advanced interface between the protocol controller and the
              physical bus in a Controller Area Network (CAN) node. The TJA1041A is primarily
              intended for automotive high-speed CAN applications (up to 1 Mbit/s). The transceiver
              provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential receive capability to the
              CAN controller. The TJA1041A is fully compatible to the ISO 11898 standard, and offers
              excellent ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance, very low power
              consumption, and passive behavior when supply voltage is off. The advanced features
              include:
                • Low-power management, supporting local and remote wake-up with wake-up source
                   recognition and the capability to control the power supply in the rest of the node
                • Several protection and diagnosis functions including short circuits of the bus lines and
                   first battery connection
                • Automatic adaptation of the I/O-levels, in line with the supply voltage of the controller

7. Functional description
                       The primary function of a CAN transceiver is to provide the CAN physical layer as
                       described in the ISO 11898 standard. In the TJA1041A this primary function is
                       complemented with a number of operating modes, fail-safe features and diagnosis
                       features, which offer enhanced system reliability and advanced power management
                       functionality.

                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1041A can be operated in five modes, each with specific features. Control
                       pins STB and EN select the operating mode. Changing between modes also gives access
                       to a number of diagnostics flags, available via pin ERR. The following sections describe
                       the five operating modes. Table 4 shows the conditions for selecting these modes.
                       Figure 3 illustrates the mode transitions when VCC, VI/O and VBAT are present.

                       [1]  Setting the pwon flag or the wake-up flag will clear the UVNOM flag.
                       [2]  The transceiver directly enters Sleep mode and pin INH is set floating when the UVNOM flag is set (so after
                            the undervoltage detection time on either VCC or VI/O has elapsed before that voltage level has recovered).
                       [3]  When Go-to-sleep command mode is selected for longer than the minimum hold time of the go-to-sleep
                            command, the transceiver will enter Sleep mode and pin INH is set floating.
                       [4]  On entering Normal mode the pwon flag and the wake-up flag will be cleared.

                7.1.1 Normal mode
                      Normal mode is the mode for normal bidirectional CAN communication. The receiver will
                      convert the differential analog bus signal on pins CANH and CANL into digital data,
                      available for output to pin RXD. The transmitter will convert digital data on pin TXD into a
                      differential analog signal, available for output to the bus pins. The bus pins are biased at
                      0.5VCC (via Ri(cm)). Pin INH is active, so voltage regulators controlled by pin INH
                      (see Figure 4) will be active too.
                7.1.2 Pwon/Listen-only mode
                      In Pwon/Listen-only mode the transmitter of the transceiver is disabled, effectively
                      providing a transceiver listen-only behavior. The receiver will still convert the analog bus
                      signal on pins CANH and CANL into digital data, available for output to pin RXD. As in
                      Normal mode the bus pins are biased at 0.5VCC, and pin INH remains active.

                                                                                         High-speed CAN transceiver
                7.1.3 Standby mode
                       The Standby mode is the first-level power saving mode of the transceiver, offering reduced
                       current consumption. In Standby mode the transceiver is not able to transmit or receive
                       data and the low-power receiver is activated to monitor bus activity. The bus pins are
                       biased at ground level (via Ri(cm)). Pin INH is still active, so voltage regulators controlled
                       by this pin INH will be active too.
                       Pins RXD and ERR will reflect any wake-up requests (provided that VI/O and VCC are
                       present).
                7.1.4 Go-to-sleep command mode
                       The Go-to-sleep command mode is the controlled route for entering Sleep mode. In
                       Go-to-sleep command mode the transceiver behaves as if in Standby mode, plus a
                       Go-to-sleep command is issued to the transceiver. After remaining in Go-to-sleep
                       command mode for the minimum hold time (th(min)), the transceiver will enter Sleep mode.
                       The transceiver will not enter the Sleep mode if the state of pins STB or EN is changed or
                       the UVBAT, pwon or wake-up flag is set before th(min) has expired.
                7.1.5 Sleep mode
                       The Sleep mode is the second-level power saving mode of the transceiver. Sleep mode is
                       entered via the Go-to-sleep command mode, and also when the undervoltage detection
                       time on either VCC or VI/O elapses before that voltage level has recovered. In Sleep mode
                       the transceiver still behaves as described for Standby mode, but now pin INH is set
                       floating. Voltage regulators controlled by pin INH will be switched off, and the current into
                       pin VBAT is reduced to a minimum. Waking up a node from Sleep mode is possible via the
                       wake-up flag and (as long as the UVNOM flag is not set) via pin STB.
                   7.2 Internal flags
                       The TJA1041A makes use of seven internal flags for its fail-safe fallback mode control and
                       system diagnosis support. Table 4 shows the relation between flags and operating modes
                       of the transceiver. Five of the internal flags can be made available to the controller via
                       pin ERR. Table 5 shows the details on how to access these flags. The following sections
                       describe the seven internal flags.

                                     and VCC are present)

                                                                                            (provided that all local failures are
                                                                                            resolved)
                      [1]   Pin ERR is an active-LOW output, so a LOW-level indicates a set flag and a HIGH-level indicates a cleared
                            flag. Allow pin ERR to stabilize for at least 8 µs after changing operating modes.
                      [2]   Allow for a TXD dominant time of at least 4 µs per dominant-recessive cycle.
                7.2.1 UVNOM flag
                      UVNOM is the VCC and VI/O undervoltage detection flag. The flag is set when the voltage
                      on pin VCC drops below VCC(sleep) for longer than tUV(VCC) or when the voltage on pin VI/O
                      drops below VI/O(sleep) for longer than tUV(VI/O). When the UVNOM flag is set, the transceiver
                      will enter Sleep mode to save power and not disturb the bus. In Sleep mode the voltage
                      regulators connected to pin INH are disabled, avoiding the extra power consumption in
                      case of a short circuit condition. After a waiting time (fixed by the same timers used for
                      setting UVNOM) any wake-up request or setting of the pwon flag will clear UVNOM and the
                      timers, allowing the voltage regulators to be reactivated at least until UVNOM is set again.
                7.2.2 UVBAT flag
                      UVBAT is the VBAT undervoltage detection flag. The flag is set when the voltage on
                      pin VBAT drops below VBAT(stb). When UVBAT is set, the transceiver will try to enter
                      Standby mode to save power and not disturb the bus. UVBAT is cleared when the voltage
                      on pin VBAT has recovered. The transceiver will then return to the operating mode
                      determined by the logic state of pins STB and EN.
                7.2.3 Pwon flag
                      Pwon is the VBAT power-on flag. This flag is set when the voltage on pin VBAT has
                      recovered after it dropped below VBAT(pwon), particularly after the transceiver was
                      disconnected from the battery. By setting the pwon flag, the UVNOM flag and timers are
                      cleared and the transceiver cannot enter Sleep mode. This ensures that any voltage
                      regulator connected to pin INH is activated when the node is reconnected to the battery. In
                      Pwon/Listen-only mode the pwon flag can be made available on pin ERR. The flag is
                      cleared when the transceiver enters Normal mode.
                7.2.4 Wake-up flag
                      The wake-up flag is set when the transceiver detects a local or a remote wake-up request.
                      A local wake-up request is detected when a logic state change on pin WAKE remains
                      stable for at least twake. A remote wake-up request is detected after two bus dominant
                      states of at least tBUSdom (with each dominant state followed by a recessive state of at
                      least tBUSrec). The wake-up flag can only be set in Standby mode, Go-to-sleep command
                      mode or Sleep mode. Setting of the flag is blocked during the UVNOM flag waiting time. By
                      setting the wake-up flag, the UVNOM flag and timers are cleared. The wake-up flag is

NXP Semiconductors                                                                              TJA1041A
                                                                                       High-speed CAN transceiver
                       immediately available on pins ERR and RXD (provided that VI/O and VCC are present).
                       The flag is cleared at power-on, or when the UVNOM flag is set or the transceiver enters
                       Normal mode.
                7.2.5 Wake-up source flag
                       Wake-up source recognition is provided via the wake-up source flag, which is set when
                       the wake-up flag is set by a local wake-up request via pin WAKE. The wake-up source flag
                       can only be set after the pwon flag is cleared. In Normal mode the wake-up source flag
                       can be made available on pin ERR. The flag is cleared at power-on or when the
                       transceiver leaves Normal mode.
                7.2.6 Bus failure flag
                       The bus failure flag is set if the transceiver detects a bus line short circuit condition to
                       VBAT, VCC or GND during four consecutive dominant-recessive cycles on pin TXD, when
                       trying to drive the bus lines dominant. In Normal mode the bus failure flag can be made
                       available on pin ERR. The flag is cleared when the transceiver reenters Normal mode.
                7.2.7 Local failure flag
                       In Normal mode or Pwon/Listen-only mode the transceiver can recognize five different
                       local failures and will combine them into one local failure flag. The five local failures are:
                       TXD dominant clamping, RXD recessive clamping, a TXD-to-RXD short circuit, bus
                       dominant clamping, and overtemperature. Nature and detection of these local failures is
                       described in Section 7.3. In Pwon/Listen-only mode the local failure flag can be made
                       available on pin ERR. The flag is cleared when entering Normal mode or when RXD is
                       dominant while TXD is recessive, provided that all local failures are resolved.
                   7.3 Local failures
                       The TJA1041A can detect five different local failure conditions. Any of these failures will
                       set the local failure flag. In most cases the transmitter of the transceiver will be disabled.
                       The following sections give the details.
                7.3.1 TXD dominant clamping detection
                       A permanent LOW-level on pin TXD (due to a hardware or software application failure)
                       would drive the CAN bus into a permanent dominant state, blocking all network
                       communication. The TXD dominant time-out function prevents such a network lockup by
                       disabling the transmitter of the transceiver if pin TXD remains at a LOW level for longer
                       than the TXD dominant time-out tdom(TXD). The tdom(TXD) timer defines the minimum
                       possible bit rate of 40 kbit/s. The transmitter remains disabled until the local failure flag is
                       cleared.
                7.3.2 RXD recessive clamping detection
                       An RXD pin clamped to HIGH-level will prevent the controller connected to this pin from
                       recognizing a bus dominant state. So the controller can start messages at any time, which
                       is likely to disturb all bus communication. RXD recessive clamping detection prevents this
                       effect by disabling the transmitter when the bus is in dominant state without RXD reflecting

                                                                                        High-speed CAN transceiver
                7.3.3 TXD-to-RXD short-circuit detection
                       A short circuit between pins RXD and TXD would keep the bus in a permanent dominant
                       state once the bus is driven dominant, because the low-side driver of RXD is typically
                       stronger than the high-side driver of the controller connected to TXD. The TXD-to-RXD
                       short circuit detection prevents such a network lockup by disabling the transmitter. The
                       transmitter remains disabled until the local failure flag is cleared.
                7.3.4 Bus dominant clamping detection
                       A CAN bus short circuit (to VBAT, VCC or GND) or a failure in one of the other network
                       nodes could result in a differential voltage on the bus high enough to represent a bus
                       dominant state. Because a node will not start transmission if the bus is dominant, the
                       normal bus failure detection will not detect this failure, but the bus dominant clamping
                       detection will. The local failure flag is set if the dominant state on the bus persists for
                       longer than tdom(bus). By checking this flag, the controller can determine if a clamped bus is
                       blocking network communication. There is no need to disable the transmitter. Note that
                       the local failure flag does not retain a bus dominant clamping failure and is released as
                       soon as the bus returns to recessive state.
                7.3.5 Overtemperature detection
                       To protect the output drivers of the transceiver against overheating, the transmitter will be
                       disabled if the virtual junction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature
                       Tj(sd). The transmitter remains disabled until the local failure flag is cleared.
                   7.4 Recessive bus voltage stabilization
                       In recessive state the output impedance of transceivers is relatively high. In a partially
                       powered network (supply voltage is off in some of the nodes) any deactivated transceiver
                       with a significant leakage current is likely to load the recessive bus to ground. This will
                       cause a common-mode voltage step each time transmission starts, resulting in increased
                       EME. Using pin SPLIT of the TJA1041A in combination with split termination (see
                       Figure 5) will reduce this step effect. In Normal mode and Pwon/Listen-only mode
                       pin SPLIT provides a stabilized 0.5VCC DC voltage. In Standby mode, Go-to-sleep
                       command mode and Sleep mode pin SPLIT is set floating.
                   7.5 I/O level adapter
                       The TJA1041A is equipped with a built-in I/O-level adapter. By using the supply voltage of
                       the controller (to be supplied at pin VI/O) the level adapter ratiometrically scales the
                       I/O-levels of the transceiver. For pins TXD, STB and EN the digital input threshold level is
                       adjusted, and for pins RXD and ERR the HIGH-level output voltage is adjusted. This
                       allows the transceiver to be directly interfaced with controllers on supply voltages between
                       2.8 V and 5.25 V, without the need for glue logic.
                   7.6 Pin WAKE
                       Pin WAKE of the TJA1041A allows local wake-up triggering by a LOW-to-HIGH state
                       change as well as a HIGH-to-LOW state change. This gives maximum flexibility when
                       designing a local wake-up circuit. To keep current consumption at a minimum, after a twake
                       delay the internal bias voltage of pin WAKE will follow the logic state of this pin. A HIGH
                       level on pin WAKE is followed by an internal pull-up to VBAT. A LOW level on pin WAKE is

                   followed by an internal pull-down towards GND. To ensure EMI performance in
                   applications not using local wake-up it is recommended to connect pin WAKE to pin VBAT
                   or to pin GND.

[1]   All parameters are guaranteed over the virtual junction temperature range by design, but only 100 % tested at Tamb = 125 °C for dies on
      wafer level and in addition to this, 100 % tested at Tamb = 125 °C for cased products, unless specified otherwise. For bare dies, all
      parameters are only guaranteed with the reverse side of the die connected to ground.

15. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                15.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                15.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       • Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       • Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       • The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       • Package placement
                       • Inspection and repair
                       • Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering
                15.3 Wave soldering
                     Key characteristics in wave soldering are:
                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                         transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                         exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities

                15.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 12) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
