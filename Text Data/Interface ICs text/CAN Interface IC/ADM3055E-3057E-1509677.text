  |CMH| is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining AUXOUT ≥ 2.4 V, CANH/CANL recessive, or RXD ≥ VIO − 0.2 V. |CML| is
  the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining AUXOUT ≤ 0.4 V, CANH/CANL dominant, or RXD ≤ 0.4 V. The common-mode
  voltage slew rates apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

Pin No.    Mnemonic    Description
1, 2, 10   GND1        Ground, Logic Side.
3          VCC         isoPower Power Supply, 4.5 V to 5.5 V. This pin requires 0.1 µF and 10 µF decoupling capacitors.
4          VIO         iCoupler Power Supply, 1.7 V to 5.5 V. This pin requires 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF decoupling capacitors.
5          RXD         Receiver Output Data.
6          SILENT      Silent Mode Select with Input High. Bring this input low or leave the pin unconnected (internal pull-down) for
                       normal mode.
7          TXD         Driver Input Data. This pin has a weak internal pull-up resistor to VIO.
8          STBY        Standby Mode Select with Input High. Bring this input low or leave the pin unconnected (internal pull-down) for
                       normal mode.
9          AUXIN       Auxiliary Channel Input. This pin sets the AUXOUT output.
11, 15     GND2        Ground, Bus Side.
12         RS          Slope Control Pin. Short this pin to ground for full speed operation or use a weak pull-down resistor (for example,
                       47 kΩ) for slope control mode. An input high signal places the CAN transceiver in standby mode.
13         CANL        CAN Low Input/Output.
14         CANH        CAN High Input/Output.
16         VISOIN      Isolated Power Supply Input for the CAN Transceiver Bus Side Digital Isolator. This pin requires 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF
                       decoupling capacitors.
17         AUXOUT      Isolated Auxiliary Channel Output. The state of AUXOUT is latched when STBY is high. By default, AUXOUT is low at
                       startup or when VIO is unpowered.
18, 20     GNDISO      Ground for the Isolated DC-to-DC Converter. Connect these pins together through one ferrite bead to PCB ground
                       (bus side).
19         VISOOUT     Isolated Power Supply Output. This pin requires 0.22 µF and 10 µF capacitors to GNDISO. Connect this pin through a
                       ferrite bead and short the PCB trace to VISOIN for operation.
