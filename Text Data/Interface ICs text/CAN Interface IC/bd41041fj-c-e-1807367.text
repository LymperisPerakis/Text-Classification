    A diode is inserted on the RXD pin at the VCC side to prevent the reverse current to VCC.
    But a diode becomes invalid in Normal mode.
    When it changed to Normal mode by STB=LOW while TXD=LOW, Dominant output to CAN bus is stopped.
    After TXD=HIGH once and then TXD=LOW again, Dominant output to CAN bus is started.

Mode of Operation – continued
    1. Power-OFF Mode
       The Power OFF mode is the state in which the transceiver function is turned off due to an abnormal drop in VCC. In this
       mode, the IC cannot receive the Wake-up signal from CAN bus.
    2. Standby Mode
       The Standby Mode is the state in which electric power is saved by turning off all circuits except those with Receiver
       Standby, Wake up Filter and Dominate Time-out functions. RXD will output the wake up signal from CAN bus.
    3. Normal Mode
       The Normal mode is the state in which the transceiver is available for normal CAN communication. It transmits and
       receives data via the bus lines CANH and CANL. In this mode, TXD can transmit data to the CAN bus and RXD can
       receive data from the CAN bus. In addition, SPLIT outputs the voltage of VCC/2.

   Caution 1: Operating the IC over the absolute maximum ratings may damage the IC. The damage can either be a short circuit between pins or an open circuit
              between pins and the internal circuitry. Therefore, it is important to consider circuit protection measures, such as adding a fuse, in case the IC is
              operated over the absolute maximum ratings.
   Caution 2: Should by any chance the maximum junction temperature rating be exceeded the rise in temperature of the chip may result in deterioration of the
              properties of the chip. In case of exceeding this absolute maximum rating, design a PCB boards with thermal resistance taken into consideration by
              increasing board size and copper area so as not to exceed the maximum junction temperature rating.

Fail Safe Function
    1. Thermal Shut Down
       Thermal shut down is a function to automatically stop output to the CAN bus during an abnormal heat generation overrun.
       When the junction temperature of the IC becomes higher than a sensed temperature (Typ 170°C), CAN bus changes to
       the Recessive state. When the junction temperature of the IC is less than the detection release temperature(Typ 155°C),
       the thermal shut down function is cancelled by setting TXD HIGH.
       Attention: The sensed temperature reaches 150°C to 190°C, and the hysteresis temperature is 5°C to 30 °C. The sensed
       temperature/hysteresis temperature is not inspected for shipped samples. In addition, please avoid system designs that
       operate near the absolute maximum ratings as the temperature protective circuits activate when the limits are exceeded.

Operational Notes
    1.     Reverse Connection of Power Supply
           Connecting the power supply in reverse polarity can damage the IC. Take precautions against reverse polarity when
           connecting the power supply, such as mounting an external diode between the power supply and the IC’s power
           supply pins.
    2.     Power Supply Lines
           Design the PCB layout pattern to provide low impedance supply lines. Furthermore, connect a capacitor to ground at
           all power supply pins. Consider the effect of temperature and aging on the capacitance value when using electrolytic
           capacitors.
    3.     Ground Voltage
           Except for pins the output and the input of which were designed to go below ground, ensure that no pins are at a
           voltage below that of the ground pin at any time, even during transient condition.
    4.     Ground Wiring Pattern
           When using both small-signal and large-current ground traces, the two ground traces should be routed separately but
           connected to a single ground at the reference point of the application board to avoid fluctuations in the small-signal
           ground caused by large currents. Also ensure that the ground traces of external components do not cause variations
           on the ground voltage. The ground lines must be as short and thick as possible to reduce line impedance.
    5.     Recommended Operating Conditions
           The function and operation of the IC are guaranteed within the range specified by the recommended operating
           conditions. The characteristic values are guaranteed only under the conditions of each item specified by the electrical
           characteristics.
    6.     Inrush Current
           When power is first supplied to the IC, it is possible that the internal logic may be unstable and inrush current may flow
           instantaneously due to the internal powering sequence and delays, especially if the IC has more than one power
           supply. Therefore, give special consideration to power coupling capacitance, power wiring, width of ground wiring, and
           routing of connections.
    7.     Operation Under Strong Electromagnetic Field
           Operating the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field may cause the IC to malfunction.
    8.     Testing on Application Boards
           When testing the IC on an application board, connecting a capacitor directly to a low-impedance output pin may
           subject the IC to stress. Always discharge capacitors completely after each process or step. The IC’s power supply
           should always be turned off completely before connecting or removing it from the test setup during the inspection
           process. To prevent damage from static discharge, ground the IC during assembly and use similar precautions during
           transport and storage.
    9.     Inter-pin Short and Mounting Errors
           Ensure that the direction and position are correct when mounting the IC on the PCB. Incorrect mounting may result in
           damaging the IC. Avoid nearby pins being shorted to each other especially to ground, power supply and output pin.
           Inter-pin shorts could be due to many reasons such as metal particles, water droplets (in very humid environment) and
           unintentional solder bridge deposited in between pins during assembly to name a few.
    10.    Unused Input Pins
           Input pins of an IC are often connected to the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate has extremely high impedance and
           extremely low capacitance. If left unconnected, the electric field from the outside can easily charge it. The small charge
           acquired in this way is enough to produce a significant effect on the conduction through the transistor and cause
           unexpected operation of the IC. So unless otherwise specified, unused input pins should be connected to the power
           supply or ground line.

Operational Notes – continued
    11.    Regarding the Input Pin of the IC
          This monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrate layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them
          isolated. P-N junctions are formed at the intersection of the P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a
          parasitic diode or transistor. For example (refer to figure below):
           When GND > Pin A and GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic diode.
           When GND > Pin B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor.
           Parasitic diodes inevitably occur in the structure of the IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual
           interference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Therefore, conditions that cause these diodes to
           operate, such as applying a voltage lower than the GND voltage to an input pin (and thus to the P substrate) should be
           avoided.

    12.    Ceramic Capacitor
           When using a ceramic capacitor, determine a capacitance value considering the change of capacitance with
           temperature and the decrease in nominal capacitance due to DC bias and others.
    13.    Area of Safe Operation (ASO)
           Operate the IC such that the output voltage, output current, and the maximum junction temperature rating are all within
           the Area of Safe Operation (ASO).
    14.    Thermal Shutdown Circuit(TSD)
           This IC has a built-in thermal shutdown circuit that prevents heat damage to the IC. Normal operation should always
           be within the IC’s maximum junction temperature rating. If however the rating is exceeded for a continued period, the
           junction temperature (Tj) will rise which will activate the TSD circuit that will turn OFF power output pins. When the Tj
           falls below the TSD threshold, the circuits are automatically restored to normal operation.
           Note that the TSD circuit operates in a situation that exceeds the absolute maximum ratings and therefore, under no
           circumstances, should the TSD circuit be used in a set design or for any purpose other than protecting the IC from
           heat damage.

    2.  ROHM designs and manufactures its Products subject to strict quality control system. However, semiconductor
        products can fail or malfunction at a certain rate. Please be sure to implement, at your own responsibilities, adequate
        safety measures including but not limited to fail-safe design against the physical injury, damage to any property, which
        a failure or malfunction of our Products may cause. The following are examples of safety measures:
              [a] Installation of protection circuits or other protective devices to improve system safety
              [b] Installation of redundant circuits to reduce the impact of single or multiple circuit failure
    3.  Our Products are not designed under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions, as exemplified below.
        Accordingly, ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for any damages, expenses or losses arising from the
        use of any ROHM’s Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions. If you intend to use our
        Products under any special or extraordinary environments or conditions (as exemplified below), your independent
        verification and confirmation of product performance, reliability, etc, prior to use, must be necessary:
              [a] Use of our Products in any types of liquid, including water, oils, chemicals, and organic solvents
              [b] Use of our Products outdoors or in places where the Products are exposed to direct sunlight or dust
              [c] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to sea wind or corrosive gases, including Cl2,
                  H2S, NH3, SO2, and NO2
              [d] Use of our Products in places where the Products are exposed to static electricity or electromagnetic waves
              [e] Use of our Products in proximity to heat-producing components, plastic cords, or other flammable items
              [f] Sealing or coating our Products with resin or other coating materials
              [g] Use of our Products without cleaning residue of flux (Exclude cases where no-clean type fluxes is used.
                 However, recommend sufficiently about the residue.); or Washing our Products by using water or water-soluble
                 cleaning agents for cleaning residue after soldering
              [h] Use of the Products in places subject to dew condensation
    4.  The Products are not subject to radiation-proof design.
    5.  Please verify and confirm characteristics of the final or mounted products in using the Products.
    6.  In particular, if a transient load (a large amount of load applied in a short period of time, such as pulse, is applied,
        confirmation of performance characteristics after on-board mounting is strongly recommended. Avoid applying power
        exceeding normal rated power; exceeding the power rating under steady-state loading condition may negatively affect
        product performance and reliability.
    7.  De-rate Power Dissipation depending on ambient temperature. When used in sealed area, confirm that it is the use in
        the range that does not exceed the maximum junction temperature.
    8.  Confirm that operation temperature is within the specified range described in the product specification.
    9.  ROHM shall not be in any way responsible or liable for failure induced under deviant condition from what is defined in
        this document.
Precaution for Mounting / Circuit board design
    1.  When a highly active halogenous (chlorine, bromine, etc.) flux is used, the residue of flux may negatively affect product
        performance and reliability.
    2.  In principle, the reflow soldering method must be used on a surface-mount products, the flow soldering method must
        be used on a through hole mount products. If the flow soldering method is preferred on a surface-mount products,
        please consult with the ROHM representative in advance.
    For details, please refer to ROHM Mounting specification
