NCV7357
CAN FD Transceiver, High
Speed
Description
   The NCV7357 CAN transceiver is the interface between
a controller area network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
bus. The transceiver provides differential transmit capability to the bus                      www.onsemi.com
and differential receive capability to the CAN controller.
   The NCV7357 is an addition to the CAN high−speed transceiver
family complementing NCV7344 CAN stand−alone transceivers and
previous generations such as AMIS42665, AMIS3066x, etc.
   The NCV7357 guarantees additional timing parameters to ensure
                                                                                    SOIC−8                             DFNW8

NCV7357 an excellent choice for all types of HS−CAN networks, in
nodes that require only a basic CAN capability.                                               MARKING DIAGRAM
