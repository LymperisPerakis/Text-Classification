 (DIN VDE 0110, Table 1)
Note 1: All devices 100% production tested at TA = +25°C. Specifications over temperature are guaranteed by design.
          Specifications marked "GBD" are guaranteed by design and not production tested.
Note 2: All currents into the device are positive. All currents out of the device are negative. All voltages referenced to their respective
          ground (GNDA or GNDB), unless otherwise noted.
Note 3: The maximum VLDO voltage listed in the Electrical Characteristics table indicates the voltage capability of the MAX14882.
          Ambient temperature and power dissipation requirements of a given circuit may limit the allowable maximum VLDO to a
          lower value during operation.
Note 4: Not production tested. Guaranteed by design (GBD) and characterization.
Note 5: Capacitance range for a stable output. Values are nominal and allow for normal capacitor tolerance.
Note 6: CMTI is the maximum sustainable common-mode voltage slew rate while maintaining the correct output states. CMTI
          applies to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges. Tested with the transient generator connected between
          GNDA and GNDB.
Note 7: The dominant timeout feature releases the bus when TXD is held low longer than tDOM. CAN protocol guarantees a
          maximum of 11 successive dominant bits in any transmission. The minimum data rate allowed by the dominant timeout,
          then, is 11/tDOM(min)
Note 8: VIORM, VIOWM, and VISO are defined by the IEC 60747-5-5 standard
Note 9: Product is qualified VISO for 60 seconds. 100% production tested at 120% of VISO for 1 second.
