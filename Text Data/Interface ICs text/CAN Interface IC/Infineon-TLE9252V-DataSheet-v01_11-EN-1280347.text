High-Speed CAN FD Transceiver
Overview
Product validation
Qualified for automotive applications. Product validation according to AEC-Q100.
Description
The TLE9252V is a transceiver designed for HS CAN networks up to 5 Mbit/s in automotive and industrial
applications. As an interface between the physical bus layer and the CAN protocol controller, the TLE9252V
drives the signals to the bus and protects the microcontroller against interferences generated within the
network. Based on the high symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE9252V provides very low
electromagnetic emission allowing the operation without a common mode choke. The non-low power modes
(Normal-operating Mode and Receive-only Mode) and low power modes (Sleep Mode and Stand-by Mode) are
optimized for reduced current consumption based on the required functionality. Even in Sleep Mode with a
quiescent current below 25 µA over the full temperature range, the TLE9252V is able to detect a Wake-Up
Pattern (WUP) on the HS CAN bus. The VIO voltage reference input is used to support 3.3 V and 5 V supplied
microcontrollers. The TLE9252V is integrated in an RoHS compliant PG-DSO-14 or PG-TSON-14 package and
fulfills the requirements of the ISO11898-2 (2016).

Notes
1. Stresses above the ones listed here may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to absolute
    maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.
2. Integrated protection functions are designed to prevent IC destruction under fault conditions described in the
    data sheet. Fault conditions are considered as “outside” normal operating range. Protection functions are
    not designed for continuous repetitive operation.

TLE9252V
High-Speed CAN FD Transceiver
High-Speed CAN functional description
5            High-Speed CAN functional description
HS CAN is a serial bus system which connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within
the network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical specifications of a CAN
network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. The TLE9252V supports both Bus
Wake-up Pattern (WUP) functionality and Local Wake-up as defined by the ISO 11898 Standard. Additionally,
the TLE9252V supports CAN Flexible data rate (CAN FD) transmission up to 5 Mbit/s.

TLE9252V
High-Speed CAN FD Transceiver
High-Speed CAN functional description
The TLE9252V is a High-Speed CAN transceiver operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates up to 5 MBit/s. The characteristic for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus:
dominant and recessive (see Figure 3). The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and operate
as an input and output. The RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The TxD pin is the serial
data input from the CAN controller. The RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller.
The HS CAN transceiver TLE9252V includes a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send
data to the bus medium and monitors the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver
TLE9252V converts the serial data stream which is available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential
output signal on the CAN bus, provided by the CANH and CANL pins. The receiver stage of the TLE9252V
monitors the data on the CAN bus and converts it to a serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A
logical “low” signal on the TxD pin creates a dominant signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “low” signal
on the RxD pin (see Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic
on the CAN bus simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit arbitration within CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined in ISO 11898-2. Whether a data bit is dominant or
recessive depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL pins:
VDiff = VCANH - VCANL.
To transmit a dominant signal to the CAN bus the amplitude of the differential signal VDiff is higher than or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a recessive signal from the CAN bus the amplitude of the differential VDiff is lower than
or equal to 0.5 V.
In partially supplied CAN networks, participants have different power supply status. Some nodes are powered,
other nodes are unpowered, or some other nodes are in Low-Power Mode. Therefore the TLE9252V provides
the Sleep Mode in which the device is still able to recognize a Wake-Up Pattern or a local wake-up and signals
the wake-up event to the external microcontroller via RxD and NERR output pin. The INH output pin allows to
control an external device e.g. a voltage regulator. The HS CAN transceiver TLE9252V provides two Low-Power
Modes Sleep Mode and Stand-by Mode with optimized very low current consumption.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the reference supply
level at the VIO pin. Depending on the voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (EN, NERR,
NSTB, TxD and RxD) are compatible with microcontrollers having a 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually the digital
power supply VIO of the transceiver is connected to the I/O power supply of the microcontroller.

Modes of operation
6               Modes of operation
The TLE9252V supports five different Modes of operation (see Figure 4). Each mode with specific
characteristics in terms of quiescent current, data transmission or failure diagnostic. For the mode selection
the digital input pins EN and NSTB are used. Both digital input pins are event triggered. A mode change via the
mode selection pins EN and NSTB is only possible if the power supply voltages VBAT OR VCC AND the digital
reference voltage VIO is in the functional range.

Modes of operation
6.1           Normal-operating Mode
In Normal-operating Mode all functions of the TLE9252V are available and the device is fully functional. Data
can be received from the HS CAN bus as well as transmitted to the HS CAN bus.
•   The transmitter is active and drives data stream on the TxD input pin to the bus pins CANH and CANL.
•   The receiver is active and converts the signals from the bus to a serial data stream on the RxD output pin.
•   The bus biasing is connected to VCC/2.
•   The TxD time-out function is enabled (see Chapter 7.5).
•   The overtemperature protection is enabled (see Chapter 7.6).
•   The RxD Recessive Clamping detection is enabled (see Chapter 7.7)
•   The undervoltage detection on VBAT, VCC and VIO are enabled (see Chapter 7.2).
•   The Local Wake-Up pin is disabled.
•   The INH output pin is connected to VBAT.
•   Local failure detection is active and failures are indicated at the NERR output pin (see Chapter 8).
The TLE9252V enters Normal-operating Mode by setting the mode selection pins EN and NSTB to logical
“high” (see Figure 4 and Table 5). Normal-operating Mode can be entered if VBAT or VCC is in the functional
range and the reference voltage VIO is in the functional range.
Possible mode changes are described in Figure 5.

TLE9252V
High-Speed CAN FD Transceiver
Modes of operation
6.3           Stand-by Mode
Stand-by Mode is a low power mode of the TLE9252V and the transmitter and the receiver are disabled. In
Stand-by Mode the transceiver can neither send data to the HS CAN bus nor receive data from the HS CAN bus:
•   The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•   The low power receiver is enabled and monitors the HS CAN bus for a valid Wake-Up Pattern. The RxD
    output pin and NERR display a wake-up event (Chapter 6.9). After Power On Reset RxD and NERR output
    pins are logical “high”. The default value of the RxD and NERR output pins are logical “high” if no wake-up
    event is pending.
•   The Local Wake-Up (LWU) pin is active.
•   After Power On Reset the bus biasing connected to GND. The conditions for the bus biasing are defined in
    Chapter 6.7.
•   TxD Dominant time-out function is disabled.
•   RxD Recessive Clamping detection is disabled.
•   The overtemperature protection is disabled.
•   The undervoltage detection on VBAT, VCC and VIO is enabled (see Chapter 7.2).
•   The INH output pin is connected to VBAT.
•   Local failure detection on NERR pin is disabled.
Conditions for entering the Stand-by Mode:
•   After Power On Reset if VBAT or VCC is in the functional range for at least tPONthe TLE9252V will enter Stand-
    by Mode. Mode changes by host command are only possible if VIO is in the functional range.
•   Stand-by Mode will be entered if a wake-up (WUP or LWU) has been detected in Sleep Mode or Go-to-Sleep
    command.
•   The device is in Go-to-Sleep command and the EN pin goes logical “low” before the time t < tSLEEP has
    expired.
•   The device is in Normal-operating Mode or Receive-only Mode and the input pins EN and NSTB are set to
    logical “low”.
Possible mode changes are described in Figure 7.

6.4          Go-to-Sleep command
Go-to-Sleep command is a transition mode allowing external circuitry like a microcontroller to prepare the
ECU to go to Sleep Mode. The TLE9252V stays for the maximum time t = tSLEEP in Go-to-Sleep command. After
exceeding the time tSLEEP the device changes to Sleep Mode if no wake-up is pending AND the POR flag has
been reset. If a wake-up is pending OR the POR flag is set the device remains in Go-to-Sleep command and INH
is connected to VBAT. A wake-up is indicated on the RxD and NERR output pins. A mode change to Sleep Mode
via Host Command is only possible via the Go-to-Sleep command. The following conditions are valid for the
Go-to-Sleep command:
•   The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•   The low power receiver is enabled and monitors the HS CAN bus for a valid Wake-Up Pattern. The RxD
    output pin and NERR indicate a wake-up event (Chapter 6.9). The default value of the RxD and NERR
    output pin are logical “high” if no wake-up event is pending.
•   The Local Wake-Up pin is active.
•   The bus biasing is GND if tSilence is expired. The conditions for the bus biasing are defined in Chapter 6.7.
•   The TxD time-out function is disabled.
•   The RxD Recessive Clamping detection is disabled.
•   The overtemperature protection is disabled.
•   The undervoltage detection on VBAT, VCC and VIO are enabled (see Chapter 7.2).
•   The INH output pin is connected to VBAT if the timer tSLEEP is not expired OR a wake-up is pending OR the
    POR is set. If tSLEEP is expired and no wake-up is pending and the POR Flag is reset, the INH output pin is high
    impedance.
Conditions for entering the Go-to-Sleep command:
Go-to-Sleep command is entered from Normal-operating Mode, Receive-only Mode and Stand-by Mode by
setting the NSTB input pin to logical “low” AND EN input pin to logical “high”.

Modes of operation
6.5.2         Mode Change via EN and NSTB pin
Besides a mode change from Sleep Mode to Stand-by Mode issued by a wake-up event, the mode of operation
can be changed by changing the signals on the EN and NSTB input pins. Therefore the reference voltage VIO
has to be in the functional range. According to the mode diagram (see Figure 4) the mode of operation can be
changed directly from Sleep Mode to Receive-only Mode or Normal-operating Mode. In Sleep Mode once a
rising edge on the pin NSTB is detected (VIO > VIO_UV) either Normal-operating Mode or Receive-only Mode will
be entered, depending on the signal on the EN pin. The device will stay in Sleep Mode regardless of the signal
on the EN input pin if NSTB is statically logical “low”. A mode change to from Sleep Mode to Stand-by Mode is
only possible via a wake-up event.

The autonomous bus voltage biasing was introduced for improving complete network EMC performance and
increasing the reliability of communication performance in networks using CAN networks. The autonomous
bus voltage biasing is enabled in all modes of Operation. The biasing unit will work independently from other
transceiver functions and depends only on the status of detected network activity (tSilence). Figure 13
describes the behavior for active and for low power modes in Detail as well as the status after a power-on reset

Figure 13    Autonomous Bus Voltage Biasing
In low power modes, in case there has been no activity on the bus for longer than tSilence, the bus pins are
biased towards GND via the internal resistors. With the detection of a valid Wake-Up Pattern (WUP), the
internal biasing gets enabled and the biasing is stabilized via internal resistors towards 2.5 V . This activation
is being performed within the time t > tWU_Bias after the WUP detection.

6.8              Wake-Up functions
There are several possibilities for a mode change from Sleep Mode to another operation mode:
•   Wake-Up Pattern (WUP)
•   Local Wake-Up (LWU)
In typical applications the power supplies VCC and VIO are turned off in Sleep Mode. This means a mode change
can only be caused by an external event as WUP OR LWU. The detection of a valid WUP or LWU triggers a mode
change from Sleep Mode to Stand-by Mode.
6.8.1            Wake-up Pattern (WUP)
Within the maximum wake-up time tWAKE, the Wake-Up Pattern consists of a dominant signal with the pulse
width t > tFilter, followed by a recessive signal with the pulse width t > tFilter and another dominant signal with
the pulse width t > tFilter (see Figure 14).

Figure 14        Wake-Up Pattern (WUP)
The diagnostic output NERR and RxD will indicate a valid Wake-Up Pattern on the HS CAN bus.
A Wake-Up Pattern is not valid under the following conditions:
•   A mode change to Normal-operating Mode OR Receive-only Mode is performed during the Wake-Up
    Pattern.
•   The maximum wake-up time tWAKE expires before a valid WUP has been detected.
•   The transceiver is powered down (VBAT < VBAT_POD AND VCC < VCC_POD).
In Stand-by Mode the RxD output pin and the NERR diagnostic pin display the WUP detection (Details see
Chapter 8).

6.8.2         Local Wake-Up (LWU)
The WAKE input pin works bi-sensitive, meaning it is able to detect a rising and falling edge as a wake-up event.
Designed to withstand up to 40 V the WAKE pin can be directly connected to VBAT. The Local Wake-Up detection
works for VBAT > VBAT_UV. The Local Wake-Up timings and behavior is described in Figure 15.

Figure 15     Local Wake-Up
The filter time tWAKE_filter is implemented to protect the TLE9252V against unintended Wake-Ups, caused by
spikes on the WAKE pin. The wake-up thresholds VWAKE_TH depend on the level of the VBAT power supply. In
Stand-by Mode the RxD output pin and the NERR diagnostic pin display the wake-up event (Details see
Chapter 8). Once a LWU has been recognized in Sleep Mode the device goes to Stand-by mode and the INH
output pin is connected to VBAT.

6.9          Wake-up: RxD and NERR behavior
The RxD and NERR output pin will signal a wake up event to the microcontroller (see Chapter 8). In Sleep
Mode, Stand-by Mode and Go-to-Sleep command by default values of RxD and NERR are logical “high” when
no wake-up event has been detected. If a valid wake up pattern (WUP) is detected, RxD and NERR will be
logical “low”. If a Local Wake-Up (LWU) is detected the RXD will be logical “low” and NERR will be logical
“high”.If both, LWU and WUP have been detected, then the WUP detection has higher priority and RxD and
NERR pin are set to logical “low”, regardless if a LWU event is pending.

7.1              Short Circuit Protection
The CANH and CANL bus pins are proven to withstand a short circuit fault against GND and against the supply
voltages. A current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages.
7.2              Undervoltage detection
The TLE9252V has three independent undervoltage detections: VBAT, VCC and VIO. Undervoltage events may
have impact on the functionality of the device and also may change the mode of operation (see Chapter 6).
7.2.1            Undervoltage and power-down detection on VBAT
The power-down is detected if the power supply VBAT is below VBAT_POD for more than the glitch filter time
tVBAT_filter. This glitch filter is implemented in order to prevent an undervoltage detection due to short voltage
transients on VBAT. In case of an power-down detection on VBAT the TLE9252V is switched off (Power On Reset).
If VBAT recovers (VBAT > VBAT_UV) the TLE9252V enters by default Stand-by Mode. If VBAT > VBAT_POD the INH output
pin is connected to VBAT. Figure 20 shows the undervoltage scenario.

7.2.2          Undervoltage detection on VCC
An undervoltage on VCC is detected if the VCC supply is below VCC_UV for more than the glitch filter time tVCC_filter.
This glitch filter is implemented in order to prevent an undervoltage detection due to short voltage transients
on VCC. The following actions will be performed if a undervoltage has been detected:
•   The NERR pin switches from logical “high” to “low” (In Normal-operating Mode and Receive-only Mode).
•   The transmitter is disabled (Normal-operating Mode).
The transmitter will be re-enabled if the VCC > VCC_UV for more than the glitch filter time t > tVCC_filter + tVCC_RECOVERY
in Normal-operating Mode.

The VCC long-term undervoltage timer tVCC_UV_T is armed once VBAT is in the functional range. If the VCC voltage
drops below VCC_UV for longer than t > tVCC_UV_T AND no communication is monitored on the HS CAN Bus (tSilence
is expired), this will trigger a mode change from any mode to Sleep Mode. If during the undervoltage event,
communication is monitored and tSilence does not expire, the device remains in the current mode of operation.
7.2.3          Undervoltage detection on VIO
An undervoltage on VIO is detected if the power supply VIO is below VIO_UV. As long as VIO < VIO_UV any signal on
the logic input pins EN, NSTB and TxD will be blocked (see Figure 24). The default value of NERR and RxD if VIO

TLE9252V
High-Speed CAN FD Transceiver
Fail safe functions
In Low-power Mode (Stand-by Mode, Sleep Mode, Go-to-Sleep Command) bus communication requires at
valid WUP detection (see Chapter 6.8.1). In Normal-operating Mode or Receive-only mode a single dominant
period of t > tfilter is reflecting bus communication.
7.3           Dual Power Supply Solution
The integrated Dual Power Supply Concept of TLE9252VSK offers the possibility to supply the device with VBAT
OR/AND VCC pin. During VBAT battery supply cranking, the TLE9252VSK remains functional if VCC stays in the
functional range. For further information please refer to TLE9252V Application Note.
7.4           Unconnected logic pins
The integrated pull-up and pull-down resistors at the digital input pins force the TLE9252V into fail safe
behavior if the input pins are not connected and floating (see Table 6).

7.5           TxD time-out function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example. In Normal-operating Mode, a
logical “low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTXD_TO enables the TxD time-out feature and the TLE9252V
disables the transmitter (see Figure 26) and sets the NERR output pin to logical “low”. The receiver is still
active and the data on the bus continues to be monitored by the RxD output pin.

Figure 26 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and re-activated.To release the transmitter after a TxD
time-out event, the TLE9252V requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to logical

7.6           Overtemperature protection
The TLE9252V has an integrated overtemperature detection to protect the TLE9252V against thermal
overstress of the transmitter. The overtemperature protection is active in Normal-operating Mode and is
disabled in all other Modes. The temperature sensor provides one temperature threshold: TJSD.When the
temperature exceeds the threshold TJSD the transmitter is disabled. This overtemperature event will be
signaled as logical “low” on the NERR output pin in Normal-operating Mode. After the device has cooled down,
the transmitter is re-enabled and NERR returns to logical “high”. A hysteresis is implemented within the
temperature sensor.

7.7           RxD Recessive Clamping detection
The RxD Recessive Clamping detection is only active in Normal-operating Mode. In Normal-operating mode a
permanent logical “high” signal on the RxD pin indicates the external microcontroller, there is no
communication on the HS CAN bus. The microcontroller then can transmit a message to the CAN bus, only if
the bus is in recessive state. In case the logical “high” signal on the RxD pin is caused by a a failure, like a short
circuit RxD to VIO, the RxD signal does not reflect the signal on the HS CAN bus. In this case the microcontroller
is able to place a message on the CAN bus at any time and corrupts the CAN messages on the bus. If the
TLE9252V detects a logical “high” signal on the RxD pin while the bus is dominant for t > tRRC the RxD Recessive
Clamping flag is set along with disabling the transmitter in Normal-operating Mode. In order to avoid any data
collision on the CAN bus, the transmitter is disabled in Normal-operating Mode as long as the RxD-Recessive
Clamping is present. In Normal-operating Mode the TLE9252V indicates the RxD clamping by a logical “low”
signal on the NERR pin. On detection the transmitter is disabled immediately, so that the corrupted, non-
synchronized node is prevented from disturbing the remaining bus traffic. The corrupted node is then

excluded from communication. The TLE9252V releases the failure flag and the output stage if the RxD
clamping failure disappears. Whenever the pin RXD becomes dominant while the bus signal is dominant for t
> tRRC the RxD Recessive Clamping flag is reset along with enabling the transmitter again in Normal-operating
Mode (see Figure 28).

The HS CAN transceiver TLE9252V changes the modes of operation within the time window tMode. During mode
changes from low-power mode to Normal-operating Mode or low-power mode to Receive-only Mode, the RxD
output pin is set to logical “high” and does not reflect the status on the CANH and CANL input pins.
