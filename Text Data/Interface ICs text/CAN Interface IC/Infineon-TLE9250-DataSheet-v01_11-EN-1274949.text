The TLE9250 is the latest Infineon high-speed CAN transceiver generation, used inside HS CAN networks for
automotive and also for industrial applications. It is designed to fulfill the requirements of ISO 11898-2 (2016)
physical layer specification and respectively also the SAE standards J1939 and J2284.
The TLE9250 is available in a PG-DSO-8 package and in a small, leadless PG-TSON-8 package. Both packages
are RoHS compliant and halogen free. The PG-TSON-8 package supports the solder joint requirements for
automated optical inspection (AOI).
As an interface between the physical bus layer and the HS CAN protocol controller, the TLE9250 protects the
microcontroller against interferences generated inside the network. A very high ESD robustness and the
perfect RF immunity allows the use in automotive applications without adding additional protection devices,
like suppressor diodes for example.
While the transceiver TLE9250 is not supplied the bus is switched off and illustrates an ideal passive behavior
with the lowest possible load to all other subscribers of the HS CAN network.
Based on the high symmetry of the CANH and CANL output signals, the TLE9250 provides a very low level of
electromagnetic emission (EME) within a wide frequency range. The TLE9250 fulfills even stringent EMC test
limits without additional external circuit, like a common mode choke for example.
The perfect transmitter symmetry combined with the optimized delay symmetry of the receiver enables the
TLE9250 to support CAN FD data frames. Depending on the size of the network and the along coming parasitic
effects the device supports bit rates up to 5 MBit/s.
Fail-safe features like overtemperature protection, output current limitation or the TxD time-out feature
protect the TLE9250 and the external circuitry from irreparable damage.

High-speed CAN functional description
5            High-speed CAN functional description
HS CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within
the network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical specifications of a CAN
network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several different physical layer
standards of CAN networks have been developed in recent years.

High Speed CAN FD Transceiver
TLE9250
High-speed CAN functional description
The TLE9250 is a high-speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates up to 5 MBit/s. The characteristic for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus:
dominant and recessive (see Figure 3).
The CANH and CANL pins are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as an input and output. The
RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the microcontroller. The pin TxD is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, the RxD pin is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE9250 includes a receiver and a transmitter unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the bus
medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE9250
converts the serial data stream which is available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output
signal on the CAN bus, provided by the CANH and CANL pins. The receiver stage of the TLE9250 monitors the
data on the CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single-ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “low”
signal on the TxD pin creates a dominant signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “low” signal on the RxD
pin (see Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the
CAN bus simultaneously is essential to support the bit-to-bit arbitration within CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined in ISO 11898-2. Whether a data bit is dominant or
recessive depends on the voltage difference between the CANH and CANL pins:
VDiff = VCANH - VCANL.
To transmit a dominant signal to the CAN bus the amplitude of the differential signal VDiff is higher than or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a recessive signal from the CAN bus the amplitude of the differential VDiff is lower than
or equal to 0.5 V.
“Partially-supplied” high-speed CAN networks are those where the CAN bus nodes of one common network
have different power supply conditions. Some nodes are connected to the common power supply, while other
nodes are disconnected from the power supply and in power-down state. Regardless of whether the CAN bus
subscriber is supplied or not, each subscriber connected to the common bus media must not interfere in the
communication. The TLE9250 is designed to support “partially-supplied” networks. In power-down state, the
receiver input resistors are switched off and the transceiver input has a high resistance.
For permanently supplied ECU's, the HS CAN transceiver TLE9250 provides a Power-save mode. In Power-save
mode, the power consumption of the TLE9250 is optimized to a minimum
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level
at the VCC pin. Depending on the voltage level at the VCC pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (STB, TxD and
RxD) are compatible with microcontrollers having a 5 V I/O supply.

Modes of operation
6           Modes of operation
The TLE9250 supports three different modes of operation (see Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   Normal-operating mode
•   Power-save mode
•   Receive-only mode
Mode changes are either triggered by the mode selection input pin NEN and NRM . An undervoltage event on
the supply VCC powers down the TLE9250.

High Speed CAN FD Transceiver
TLE9250
Modes of operation
6.1          Normal-operating mode
In Normal-operating mode the transceiver TLE9250 sends and receives data from the HS CAN bus. All
functions are active (see also Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   The transmitter is active and drives the serial data stream on the TxD input pin to the bus pins CANH and
    CANL.
•   The normal-mode receiver is active and converts the signals from the bus to a serial data stream on the RxD
    output.
•   The RxD output pin indicates the data received by the normal-mode receiver.
•   The bus biasing is connected to VCC/2.
•   The NEN and NRM input pin is active and changes the mode of operation.
•   The TxD time-out function is enabled and disconnects the transmitter in case a time-out is detected.
•   The overtemperature protection is enabled and disconnects the transmitter in case an overtemperature is
    detected.
•   The undervoltage detection on VCC is enabled and powers down the device in case of detection .
Normal-operating mode is entered from Power-save mode and Receive-only mode, when the NEN input pin is
set to logical “low” and NRM input pin is set to logical “low”.
Normal-operating mode can only be entered when all supplies are available:
•   The transmitter supply VCC is available (VCC > VCC(UV,R)).
6.2          Receive-only mode
In Receive-only mode the transmitter is disabled and the receiver is enabled. The TLE9250 can receive data
from the bus, but cannot send any message (see also Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•   The normal-mode receiver is enabled.
•   The RxD output pin indicates the data received by the normal-mode receiver.
•   The bus biasing is connected to VCC/2.
•   The NEN and NRM input pins are active and change the mode of operation to Normal-operating mode or
    Power-save mode.
•   The TxD time-out function is disabled.
•   The overtemperature protection is disabled.
•   The undervoltage detection on VCC is active and powers down the device in case of detection.
•   Receive-only mode can only be entered when VCC (VCC > VCC(UV,R)) is available.
6.3          Power-save mode
In Power-save mode the transmitter and receiver are disabled. (see also Figure 4 and Table 5):
•   The transmitter is disabled and the data available on the TxD input is blocked.
•   The receiver is disabled and the data available on the bus is blocked.
•   The RxD output pin is permanently set to logical “high”.
•   The bus biasing is floating.
•   The NEN and NRM input pins are active and change the mode of operation to Normal-operating mode or
    Receive-only mode.
•   The overtemperature protection is disabled.

High Speed CAN FD Transceiver
TLE9250
Modes of operation
•   The undervoltage detection on VCC is enabled and powers down the device in case of detection.
6.4            Power-down state
Independent of the status at NRM and NEN input pins the TLE9250 is powered down if the supply voltage VCC
< VCC(UV,F) (see Figure 4).
In the power-down state the differential input resistors of the receiver are switched off. The CANH and CANL
bus interface of the TLE9250 is floating and acts as a high-impedance input with a very small leakage current.
The high-ohmic input does not influence the recessive level of the CAN network and allows an optimized EME
performance of the entire HS CAN network. In power-down state the transceiver is an invisible node to the
bus.

Changing the mode of operation
7              Changing the mode of operation
7.1            Power-up and power-down
The HS CAN transceiver TLE9250 powers up by applying the supply voltage VCC to the device (VCC > VCC(U,R)).
After powering up, the device enters one out of three operating modes (see Figure 5 and Figure 6).
Depending on the condition of the mode selection pin NEN and NRM the device can enter every mode of
operation after the power-up:
•   The NEN input is set to “low” and NRM input is set to “high” - Normal-operating mode
•   The NEN input is set to “high” - Power-save mode
•   The NEN input is set to “low” and NRM input is set to “low” - Receive-only mode
The device TLE9250 powers down when the VCC supply falls below the undervoltage detection threshold
(VCC < VCC(U,F)). The power-down detection is active in every mode of operation.

High Speed CAN FD Transceiver
TLE9250
Changing the mode of operation
7.2          Mode change by the NEN and NRM pins
When the TLE9250 is supplied with the digital voltage VCC the internal logic works and mode change by the
mode selection pins NEN and NRM is possible.
By default the NRM input pin and the NEN input pin are logical “high” due to the internal pull-up current source
to VCC.
Changing the NEN input pin to logical “low” in Power-save mode triggers a mode change to Normal-operating
mode (see Figure 7). To enter Normal-operating mode the NRM input pin has to be logical “high” and the
transmitter supply VCC needs to be available.
Receive-only mode can be entered from Normal-operating mode and Power-save mode by setting the NRM
pin to logical “low”. To enter Receive-only mode the NEN input pin and the NRM input pin has to be logical
“low” and the transmitter supply VCC needs to be available. The device remains in Power-save mode
independently of state of the NRM input pin.

Fail safe functions
8            Fail safe functions
8.1          Short circuit protection
The CANH and CANL bus pins are proven to cope with a short circuit fault against GND and against the supply
voltages. A current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device is heating up due to
a continuous short on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus
transmitter.
8.2          Unconnected logic pins
All logic input pins have an internal pull-up current source to VCC. In case the VCC supply is activated and the
logical pins are open, the TLE9250 enters into the Power-save mode by default.
8.3          TxD time-out function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example.
In Normal-operating mode, a logical “low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out
feature and the TLE9250 disables the transmitter (see Figure 8). The receiver is still active and the data on the
bus continues to be monitored by the RxD output pin.

Figure 8      TxD time-out function
Figure 8 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the
TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter
after a TxD time-out event, the TLE9250 requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to
logical “high”.
8.4          Overtemperature protection
The TLE9250 has an integrated overtemperature detection to protect the TLE9250 against thermal overstress
of the transmitter. The overtemperature protection is only active in Normal-operating mode. In case of an

in Normal-operating mode. After the device has cooled down the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 9).
A hysteresis is implemented within the temperature sensor.

8.5          Delay time for mode change
The HS CAN transceiver TLE9250 changes the mode of operation within the time window tMode. During the
mode change from Power-save mode to non-low power mode the RxD output pin is permanently set to logical
“high” and does not reflect the status on the CANH and CANL input pins.
After the mode change is completed, the transceiver TLE9250 releases the RxD output pin.
