General Description                                                   Features
The MAX3050 and MAX3057 interface between the                         ●● ±80V Fault Protection for 42V Systems
CAN protocol controller and the physical wires of the bus             ●● Four Operating Modes:
lines in a control area network (CAN). They are primarily                 • High-Speed Operation Up to 2Mbps
intended for systems requiring data rates up to 2Mbps                     • Slope-Control Mode to Reduce EMI
and feature ±80V fault protection against shorts in high-                 		 (40kbps to 500kbps)
voltage power buses. They provide differential transmit                   • Standby Mode
capability to the bus and differential receive capability to              • Low-Current Shutdown Mode
the CAN controller.                                                   ●● AutoShutdown when Device is Inactive (MAX3050)
The MAX3050 and MAX3057 have four modes of operation:                 ●● Automatic Wake-Up from Shutdown (MAX3050)
high speed, slope control, standby, and shutdown. High-

speed mode allows data rates up to 2Mbps. In slope-control
mode, data rates are 40kbps to 500kbps, so the effects of             ●● Current Limiting
EMI are reduced, and unshielded twisted or parallel cable             ●● Fully Compatible with the ISO 11898 Standard
can be used. In standby mode, the transmitters are shut off
and the receivers are put into low-current mode. In shutdown          Ordering Information
mode, the transmitter and receiver are switched off.

 Recessive
Note 1: As defined by ISO, bus value is one of two complementary logical values: dominant or recessive. The dominant value
          represents the logical 1 and the recessive represents the logical 0. During the simultaneous transmission of the dominant
          and recessive bits, the resulting bus value is dominant. For MAX3050 and MAX3057 values, see the truth table in the
          Transmitter and Receiver sections under Detailed Description.
Note 2: The ESD structures do not short out CANH and CANL under an ESD event while -7V < CANH, CANL < +12V.

the logical 0 and the recessive represents the logical 1. During the simultaneous transmission of the dominant and recessive bits, the

AutoShutdown (MAX3050)
To manage power consumption, AutoShutdown puts the
device into shutdown mode after it has been inac-tive                                                  CANH - CANL
                                                                                                       1V/div
for a period of time. The value of an external capacitor
(CSHDN) connected to SHDN determines the threshold
of inactivity time, after which the AutoShutdown triggers.
Floating SHDN allows the MAX3050 to automatically
change from active mode to shutdown.
Use a 100nF capacitor as CSHDN for a typical threshold
of 20ms. Change the capacitor value according to the                                                   FFT

Drive SHDN high to turn the MAX3050 on and disable
AutoShutdown.
When the MAX3050 is in shutdown mode, only the wake-
up comparator is active, and normal bus communication
is ignored. The remote master of the CAN system wakes
up the MAX3050 with a signal greater than 9V on CANH.
                                                                                                       CANH - CANL
Internal circuitry in the MAX3050 puts the device in nor-                                              1V/div
mal operation by driving SHDN high.
The MAX3057 does not have the AutoShutdown feature.
Driver Output Protection                                                                               FFT
The MAX3050 and MAX3057 have several features that                                                     200mV/div
protect them from damage. Thermal shutdown switches
off the device and puts CANH and CANL into high
impedance if the junction temperature exceeds +160°C.
Thermal protection is needed particularly when a bus line      Figure 6. FFT Recessive Bus at 2Mbps
is short-circuited. The hysteresis for the thermal shutdown
is approximately 20°C.
Additionally, a current-limiting circuit protects the trans-
mitter output stage against short-circuit to positive and                                              CANH - CANL
negative battery voltage. Although the power dissipation                                               1V/div
increases during this fault condition, this feature prevents
destruction of the transmitter output stage.
Applications Information
Reduced EMI and Reflections
In slope-control mode, the CANH and CANL outputs are                                                   FFT

slew-rate limited, minimizing EMI and reducing reflections
caused by improperly terminated cables. In general, a
transmitter’s rise time relates directly to the length of an
unterminated stub, which can be driven with only minor         Figure 7. FFT Dominant Bus at 500kbps
waveform reflections. The following equation expresses
this relationship conservatively:
                  Length = tRISE / (15ns/ft)
where tRISE is the transmitter’s rise time.
