1.       Introduction
The Innovasic Semiconductor IA82527 Controller Area Network (CAN) Serial Communications
Controller is a form, fit, and function replacement for the original Intel® 82527 Serial
Communications Controller.
These devices are produced using Innovasic’s Managed IC Lifetime Extension System
(MILES™). This cloning technology, which produces replacement ICs beyond simple
emulations, is designed to achieve compatibility with the original device, including any
“undocumented features.” Please note that there may be some functional differences between the
Innovasic device and the original device and customers should thoroughly test the device in
system to ensure compatibility. Innovasic reports all known functional differences in the Errata
section of this data sheet. Additionally, MILES™ captures the clone design in such a way that
production of the clone can continue even as silicon technology advances.
The IA82527 Serial Communications Controller replaces the obsolete Intel 82527 device,
allowing users to retain existing board designs, software compilers/assemblers, and emulation
tools, thereby avoiding expensive redesign efforts.
1.1      General Description
CAN protocol uses a multi-master CSMA/CR (Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision
Resolution) bus to transfer message objects between network nodes.
The IA82527 support CAN Specification 2.0 Part A and B, standard and extended message
frames, and has the capability to transmit, receive, and perform message filtering on standard and
extended message frames.
The IA82527 can store 15 message objects of 8-byte data length. Each message object can be
configured as either transmit or receive except for message object 15, which is receive-only.
Message object 15 also provides a special acceptance mask designed to filter message identifiers
that are received.
The IA82527 also provides a programmable acceptance mask that allows users to globally mask
any identifier bits of the incoming message. This global mask can be used for both standard and
extended message frames.
The IA82527 is capable of operating at 5.0 or 3.3 volts. This datasheet discusses both modes of
operation. Where applicable, characteristics specific to either 3.3 or 5.0 volt operation are
identified separately throughout this datasheet.
The IA82527 is manufactured in a reliable 5-volt process technology and is available in 44-lead
PLCC or PQFP RoHS packages for the automotive temperature range (-40°C to 125°C).

                                           via the Clockout Register (1FH) and can range from
                                           the frequency of the xtal (crystal) input to xtal/n, where
                                           n can be an integer value from 2 through 15. This
                                           output allows the IA82527 to clock other devices such

                                           non-Intel architecture mode (Mode 3), this signal
                                           functions as follows: when the CPU reads from the
                                           IA82527, dsack0_n active low indicates that the data

                                           dsack0_n active low indicates that the data has been
                                           received.
                                           Note: The active pull-up circuitry drives dsack0_n
                                           high for 10ns to raise it to a 3.0V voltage level. After
                                           that, an external pull up is required to pull dsack0_n
                                           the remainder of the way to VSS.

                                           The mode1 and mode0 inputs are also used to
                                           establish the Serial Interface Mode as follows: when
                                           the IA82527 is reset, if
                                             mode1 = 0
                                             mode0 = 0
                                             rd_n = 0
                                             wr_n = 0
                                           the Serial Interface Mode will be selected.
                                           The mode1 and mode0 pins are internally connected
                                           to weak pull-downs. These pins will be pulled low
                                           during reset if unconnected. Following reset, these
                                           pins will float.

                                           Port 1 bits p1.7–p1.0 can be individually programmed
 p1.2        ad10/d2/p1.2      36    30    as inputs or outputs. Programming is accomplished by
 p1.3        ad11/d3/p1.3      35    29    writing to the P1CONF Register (9FH). The 8 bits of
 p1.4        ad12/d4/p1.4      34    28    the P1CONF Register, P1CONF7–P1CONF0,
                                           correspond directly to pins p1.7–p1.0. Writing a 0 to a
 p1.5        ad13/d5/p1.5      33    27    bit in the P1CONF Register causes the corresponding
 p1.6        ad14/d6/p1.6      32    26    pin to be configured as a high-impedance input.
 p1.7        ad15/d7/p1.7      31    25    Writing a 1 to a bit in the P1CONF Register causes the
                                           corresponding pin to be configured as a push-pull
                                           output. All Port 1 pins have weak pull-ups until the

                                           was read from the corresponding pin; a logic 1 for any
                                           bit means that a logic 1 was read from the
                                           corresponding pin. The default value of the P1IN
                                           Register following a reset is FFH.
                                           Data is written to Port 1 via the P1OUT Register
                                           (DFH). Writing a logic 0 to any bit in this register
                                           means that a logic 0 is written to the corresponding
                                           pin; writing a logic 1 to any bit means that a logic 1 is
                                           written to the corresponding pin. The default value of

 reset_n        reset_n         29   23    reset. Input. Active Low. When the reset_n signal is
                                           asserted (low), the IA82527 is initialized. There are
                                           two reset situations:
                                           Cold reset is a power-on reset. As VCC is driven to a
                                           valid level (power on), the reset_n signal must be
                                           driven low for a minimum of 1 ms measured from a
                                           valid VCC level. No falling edge on the reset_n pin is
                                           required during a cold reset.
                                           For warm reset, VCC remains at a valid level (i.e.,
                                           power is already on and remains on) while reset_n is
                                           driven low for a minimum of 1 ms.

                                           signals a read cycle. When r-w_n is low, it signals a
                                           write cycle.

                                           These pins connect internally to the receiver input
                                           comparator. Serial data from the CAN bus can be
                                           received using both rx0 and rx1 or by using only rx0
                                           as follows:

                                               non-inverting input and rx1 is connected to the
                                               inverting input). A recessive level is read when rx0
                                               > rx1. A dominant level is read when rx1 > rx0.

                                           the transmission of the synchronization bytes through
                                           the IA82527 miso pin while the master device
                                           transmits the Address and Control Byte as follows:
                                            When a logic 0 is placed on the ste pin, the
                                              synchronization bytes sent through the miso pin are
                                              00H and 00H.
                                            When a logic 1 is placed on the ste pin, the

 xtal1            xtal1         18   12    Crystal (xtal) 1. Input. The xtal1 pin is the input
                                           connection for an external crystal that drives the
                                           IA82527 internal oscillator. (When an external crystal
                                           is used, it is connected between this pin and the xtal2
                                           pin—see next table entry.)
                                           If an external oscillator or clock source is used to drive
                                           the IA82527 instead of a crystal, the xtal1 pin is the
                                           input for this clock source.
 xtal2            xtal2         19   13    Crystal (xtal) 2. Output (push-pull). The xtal2 pin is
                                           the output connection for an external crystal that drives
                                           the IA82527 internal oscillator. (When an external
                                           crystal is used, it is connected between this pin and
                                           the xtal1 pin—see previous table entry.)
                                           If an external oscillator or clock source is used to drive
                                           the IA82527 instead of a crystal, xtal2 must be left
                                           unconnected (i.e., must be floated). Additionally, the
                                           xtal2 output must not be used as a clock source for
                                           other system components.

4.1.1   CAN Controller
The CAN Controller block of the IA82527 supports the interface to the CAN Bus via the rx0,
rx1, tx0, and tx1 lines. The CAN Controller manages the transceiver logic, error management
logic, and the message objects, controlling the data stream between the Message RAM (parallel
data) and the CAN Bus (serial data).
4.1.2   Message RAM
The Message RAM block of the IA82527 provides the interface buffer between the system CPU
and the CAN Bus. The IA82527 Message RAM provides storage for 15 message objects of
8-byte data length. The Message RAM is Dual Port RAM allowing the CPU and the CAN
controller simultaneous access to the Message RAM.
4.1.3    CPU Interface
The IA82527 is can be interfaced to many commonly used microcontrollers. There are four
parallel interface options and a serial interface option.
Different interface options, or modes, are selected using interface mode pins, mode1 and mode0.
The parallel interface modes that can be selected are as follows:
       8-bit Intel multiplexed address and data buses
       16-bit Intel multiplexed address and data buses
       8-bit non- Intel multiplexed address and data buses
       8-bit non-multiplexed address and data buses
The serial interface mode is fully compatible with the Motorola® SPI protocol and will interface
to most commonly used serial interfaces. The serial interface is implemented in slave mode
only, and responds to the master using the specially designed serial interface protocol. The serial
interface mode interconnection scheme is shown in Figure 6.

4.1.3   I/O Ports
The IA82527 contains two 8-bit General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) ports. Each GPIO port is
selectable or programmable as either an input or an output. CPU interface modes may use some
of the GPIO pins or signals, precluding their use as GPIO. Six bits of GPIO Port 2 (p2.5 to p2.0)
are always available as GPIO. GPIO Port 2 bits 6 and 7 (p2.6 and p2.7) have alternate functions
as the alternate source for int_n and as the wrh_n input for CPU mode 2 and may be available as
GPIO depending on the CPU mode. GPIO Port 1 is available for use as GPIO in CPU
modes 0, 2, and SPI and is not available in CPU modes 1 and 3.
4.1.4   Programmable Clock Output
Using an oscillator, clock divider register, and a driver circuit, the IA82527 provides a
programmable clock output. The output frequency range available is from the external crystal
frequency to that frequency divided by 15. The clock output allows the IA82527 to drive other
devices such as the host CPU. The slew rate of the clkout signal is selectable via the CLKOUT
Register (1FH).
4.2     Address Map
The IA82527 includes 256 8-bit locations that provide device configuration registers and
message storage. The address map is shown in Table 8.
4.3     CAN Message Objects
Each CAN message object has a unique identifier and can be configured as either transmit or
receive, except for message object 15. Message object 15 is a double-buffered receive-only
buffer with a special mask design to allow select groups of different message identifiers to be
received. Each message object contains registers for control and status bits.
All message objects have separate transmit and receive interrupts and status bits that allow the
host CPU to determine when a message frame has been sent or received. The IA82527
implements a global masking feature that allows the user to globally mask any identifier bits of
the incoming message. This mask is programmable, which permits application-specific message
identification.
The Message Object Structure is shown in Table 9.

7.2      Detail
Errata No. 1
Problem: The CPU writes to Msg Box 15 RAM cannot be read back if MsgVal is set.
Description: If the MsgVal bit (Bits [7–6]) of Msg Box 15 Control_0 register (0xF0) is set, any
CPU writes to the Msg Box 15 arbitration 0–3 registers (0xF2–0xF5), and data 0–7 registers
(0xF7–0xFE) will operate properly, however CPU reads of these registers will return unknown
data. In other words, any CPU data written to Msg Box 15 will not be read back correctly if the
MsgVal bit is set. If the MsgVal bit (Bits [7–6]) of Msg Box 15 Control_0 register (0xF0) is
reset, CPU data written can be read back normally.
Workaround: The workaround is to clear the MsgVal bit (Bits [7–6]) of Msg Box 15 Control_0
register (0xF0) before trying to read back any CPU data written to the Msg Box 15 arbitration
0–3 registers (0xF2–0xF5), and data 0–7 registers (0xF7–0xFE).

Errata No. 2
Problem: Setting the IntPnd bit to 1 from CPU interface will not cause Interrupt.
Description: During normal operation, a CAN message event sets the IntPnd bit of Control 0
Register of the appropriate message box (assuming appropriate interrupt enables are set), and the
interrupt signal is asserted. The CPU will then reset IntPnd to clear the interrupt. The errata
issue occurs if the user directly sets the IntPnd bit via the CPU interface, no interrupt will be
generated.
Workaround: None.
Errata No. 3
Problem: An unintended Remote Frame may be generated.
Description: If a Message Box is set to receive and a Remote Frame with a matching ID and
Data Length Code (DLC) is received, the IA82527 will generate an unexpected Remote Frame
for the ID in the Message Box instead of just acknowledging the CAN message.
A Message Box configured as follows may lead to this scenario, as explained below:
    1. A Message Box is set with an ID in the Arbitration Registers to match the ID of Remote
        Frame.
    2. The Message Box Control_0 Register has MsgVal(Bits[7-6]) in the set state.
    3. The Message Box Control_1 Register has all fields in the reset state.
    4. The Message Box Configuration Register has the Dir bit (bit 3) reset to 0 for receive.
    5. The Message Box Configuration Register has the DLC field set to match the DLC of the
        Remote Frame.
When the IA82527 sees a Remote Frame that matches the Message Box ID and DLC, the
IA82527 will generate the expected RX_OK status change interrupt. The IA82527 will also
generate an unexpected RX interrupt for the Message Box that matches the ID of the Remote
Frame if the RXIE field of the Message Box Control_0 register is in the set state. In addition,
the IA82527 will generate an unexpected Remote Frame for the ID in the Message Box.
Workaround: In a system that uses remote frames, only use a single Remote Frame Requester
for a single Remote Frame Responder.

Errata No. 4
Problem: Majority Logic sample mode delays start of ACK bit transmission by one time
quanta.
Description: When the SPL bit (Bit 7) of the Bit Timing Register 1 (0x4F) is set to 1 to enable
the 3 sample Majority Logic mode, the transmission of the ACK bit in response to a received
CAN frame will be time shifted by 1 time quanta. With sufficient cable propagation delays and
propagation delays through CAN transceiver parts, CAN nodes on the CAN bus may see the
ACK bit being a 0 shifted over into its ACK delimiter bit time and flag this as an error.
Workaround: Use Single Sample mode instead of Majority Logic Sample Mode. The SPL bit
of the Bit Timing Register 1 (bit 7 of address 0x4F) should be a 0.
Errata No. 5
Problem: dsack0_n signal may not respond properly under certain conditions.
Description: Under certain conditions when the cs_n is asserted near the edge of xtal1 the
dsack0_n signal may not be properly generated. Depending on the clock divider settings sys_clk
and mem_clk at address 0x02, if the setup or hold time for cs_n with respect to xtal1 edge (rising
or falling) is violated, it is possible that dsack0_n will not respond to the cycle. This can cause
problems for systems that are dependent upon dsack0_n to occur before releasing cs_n to finish
the cycle. Note: The cycle still operates correctly in respect to reading or writing of data, only
the dsack0_n signal may not be generated.
Workaround:
Workaround #1: Do not use dsack0_n as part of the bus cycle timing.
Workaround #2: cs_n must meet the following timing relationship with regards to the xtal1 clock
edge:
       sys clock divide       edge of xtal1      setup (ns)       hold (ns)
           1 dsc=0                 rise               7              16
           2 dsc=1                 fall               7              16

Errata No. 6
Problem: Behavior of double buffered Msgbox15 differs from the OEM device. There are
several facets to this errata which are all tightly coupled.
Errata No. 6.1
Problem: Receiving a second message while reading the first stored message may
corrupt the data being read.
Description: If a second CAN message is stored to MsgBox 15 during the time the information
from the first message is being read, a byte of this data may reflect that of the new message being
stored. When using double reads, this corrupted data may be captured in the High Speed Read
Register when the low speed register is accessed. When using single reads this corrupted data
may appear on the external data bus for a very brief amount of time (2 – 6ns). If the data from
the first message is retrieved prior to receiving the second message, this will not be a problem.
Workaround: Because of the coupled nature of these errata, the workaround must address all
facets together. Figure 18 provides the description of a software workaround that addresses errata
6.1 and 6.2.
Errata No. 6.2
Problem: Control Register 0 and Control Register 1 have different behavior than the OEM
part when two messages have been stored before either message is processed.
Description: IntPnd and NewDat are not automatically reasserted after being cleared to
acknowledge the first message. MsgLst will be asserted after the second message is received
while NewDat is set. RmtPnd will be asserted after the second message is received while
NewDat is set. See Table 21 and Table 22 for differences.
Workaround: Because of the coupled nature of these errata, the workaround must address all
facets together. Figure 18 provides the description of a software workaround that addresses errata
6.1 and 6.2.
Errata No. 6.3
Problem: Receiving a third message before the first two messages are processed can cause
data to be lost.
Description: If a third message is stored before the NewDat and RmtPnd bits are cleared, the

Arbitration ID information for the first message will be overwritten by that of the third. In
addition, the Arbitration ID information of the second message will be kept instead of being
replaced by that of the third. See Table 23 and Table 24 for differences.
Workaround: There is no workaround for errata 6.3. To avoid this situation, user systems must
be implemented such that no more than two messages can be received by this mailbox in the
time between interrupt services.
