2. Equivalent to discharging a 200 pF capacitor via a 0.75 µH series inductor and a 10 Ω series resistor.
3. Junction temperature in accordance with IEC 60747-1. An alternative definition of Tvj is: Tvj = Tamb + P × Rth(vj-amb),
      where Rth(vj-amb) is a fixed value to be used for the calculating of Tvj. The rating for Tvj limits the allowable
      combinations of power dissipation (P) and ambient temperature (Tamb).

Wave soldering
Conventional single wave soldering is not recommended
for surface mount devices (SMDs) or printed-circuit boards
with a high component density, as solder bridging and
non-wetting can present major problems.

Notes
1. For more detailed information on the BGA packages refer to the “(LF)BGA Application Note” (AN01026); order a copy
    from your Philips Semiconductors sales office.
2. All surface mount (SMD) packages are moisture sensitive. Depending upon the moisture content, the maximum
    temperature (with respect to time) and body size of the package, there is a risk that internal or external package
    cracks may occur due to vaporization of the moisture in them (the so called popcorn effect). For details, refer to the
    Drypack information in the “Data Handbook IC26; Integrated Circuit Packages; Section: Packing Methods”.
3. These transparent plastic packages are extremely sensitive to reflow soldering conditions and must on no account
    be processed through more than one soldering cycle or subjected to infrared reflow soldering with peak temperature
    exceeding 217 °C ± 10 °C measured in the atmosphere of the reflow oven. The package body peak temperature
    must be kept as low as possible.
4. These packages are not suitable for wave soldering. On versions with the heatsink on the bottom side, the solder
    cannot penetrate between the printed-circuit board and the heatsink. On versions with the heatsink on the top side,
    the solder might be deposited on the heatsink surface.
5. If wave soldering is considered, then the package must be placed at a 45° angle to the solder wave direction.
    The package footprint must incorporate solder thieves downstream and at the side corners.
6. Wave soldering is suitable for LQFP, TQFP and QFP packages with a pitch (e) larger than 0.8 mm; it is definitely not
    suitable for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.65 mm.
7. Wave soldering is suitable for SSOP, TSSOP, VSO and VSSOP packages with a pitch (e) equal to or larger than
    0.65 mm; it is definitely not suitable for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.5 mm.
8. Hot bar or manual soldering is suitable for PMFP packages.
