1. General description
              The UJA1167A is a mini high-speed CAN System Basis Chip (SBC) containing an ISO
              11898-2:2016 and SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5 compliant HS-CAN transceiver and an
              integrated 5 V/100 mA supply for a microcontroller. It also features a watchdog and a
              Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The UJA1167A can be operated in very-low-current
              Standby and Sleep modes with bus and local wake-up capability and supports ISO
              11898-2:2016 compliant autonomous CAN biasing. The microcontroller supply is switched
              off in Sleep mode.
              The UJA1167ATK variant contains a battery-related high-voltage output (INH) for
              controlling an external voltage regulator, while the UJA1167ATK/X is equipped with a 5 V
              sensor supply (VEXT).
              This implementation enables reliable communication in the CAN FD fast phase at data
              rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              A number of configuration settings are stored in non-volatile memory, allowing the SBC to
              be adapted for use in a specific application. This makes it possible to configure the
              power-on behavior of the UJA1167A to meet the requirements of different applications.

7. Functional description
                   7.1 System controller
                       The system controller manages register configuration and controls the internal functions
                       of the UJA1167A. Detailed device status information is collected and made available to
                       the microcontroller.
                7.1.1 Operating modes
                       The system controller contains a state machine that supports seven operating modes:
                       Normal, Standby, Sleep, Reset, Forced Normal, Overtemp and Off. The state transitions
                       are illustrated in Figure 3.
               7.1.1.1 Normal mode
                       Normal mode is the active operating mode. In this mode, all the hardware on the device is
                       available and can be activated (see Table 4). Voltage regulator V1 is enabled to supply the
                       microcontroller.
                       The CAN interface can be configured to be active and thus to support normal CAN
                       communication. Depending on the SPI register settings, the watchdog may be running in
                       Window or Timeout mode and the INH/VEXT output may be active.
                       Normal mode can be selected from Standby mode via an SPI command (MC = 111).
               7.1.1.2 Standby mode
                       Standby mode is the first-level power-saving mode of the UJA1167A, offering reduced
                       current consumption. The transceiver is unable to transmit or receive data in Standby
                       mode. The SPI remains enabled and V1 is still active; the watchdog is active (in Timeout
                       mode) if enabled. The behavior of INH/VEXT is determined by the SPI setting.
                       If remote CAN wake-up is enabled (CWE = 1; see Table 27), the receiver monitors bus
                       activity for a wake-up request. The bus pins are biased to GND (via Ri(cm)) when the bus is
                       inactive for t > tto(silence) and at approximately 2.5 V when there is activity on the bus
                       (autonomous biasing).
                       Pin RXD is forced LOW when any enabled wake-up event is detected. This can be either
                       a regular wake-up (via the CAN bus or pin WAKE) or a diagnostic wake-up such as an
                       overtemperature event (see Section 7.10).
                       The UJA1167A switches to Standby mode via Reset mode:
                         • from Off mode if the battery voltage rises above the power-on detection threshold
                            (Vth(det)pon)
                         • from Overtemp mode if the chip temperature falls below the overtemperature
                            protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp
                         • from Sleep mode on the occurrence of a regular or diagnostic wake-up event
                       Standby mode can also be selected from Normal mode via an SPI command (MC = 100).

                                Sleep mode is the second-level power-saving mode of the UJA1167A. The difference
                                between Sleep and Standby modes is that V1 is off in Sleep mode and temperature
                                protection is inactive.

                                        Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                 watchdog
                       Any enabled regular wake-up via CAN or WAKE or any diagnostic wake-up event will
                       cause the UJA1167A to wake up from Sleep mode. The behavior of INH/VEXT is
                       determined by the SPI settings. The SPI is disabled. Autonomous bus biasing is active.
                       See Table 7 for a description of watchdog behavior in Sleep mode.
                       Sleep mode can be selected from Normal or Standby mode via an SPI command
                       (MC = 001). The UJA1167A will switch to Sleep mode on receipt of this command,
                       provided there are no pending wake-up events and at least one regular wake-up source is
                       enabled. Any attempt to enter Sleep mode while one of these conditions has not been met
                       will cause the UJA1167A to switch to Reset mode and set the reset source status bits
                       (RSS) to 10100 (‘illegal Sleep mode command received’; see Table 6).
                       Since V1 is off in Sleep mode, the only way the SBC can exit Sleep mode is via a wake-up
                       event (see Section 7.10).
                       Sleep mode can be permanently disabled in applications where, for safety reasons, the
                       supply voltage to the host controller must never be cut off. Sleep mode is permanently
                       disabled by setting the Sleep control bit (SLPC) in the SBC configuration register (see
                       Table 9) to 1. This register is located in the non-volatile memory area of the device. When
                       SLPC = 1, a Sleep mode SPI command (MC = 001) triggers an SPI failure event instead
                       of a transition to Sleep mode.
               7.1.1.4 Reset mode
                       Reset mode is the reset execution state of the SBC. This mode ensures that pin RSTN is
                       pulled down for a defined time to allow the microcontroller to start up in a controlled
                       manner.
                       The transceiver is unable to transmit or receive data in Reset mode. The behavior of
                       INH/VEXT is determined by the settings of bits VEXTC and VEXTSUC (see Section 7.6).
                       The SPI is inactive; the watchdog is disabled; V1 and overtemperature detection are
                       active.
                       The UJA1167A switches to Reset mode from any mode in response to a reset event (see
                       Table 6 for a list of reset sources).
                       The UJA1167A exits Reset mode:
                         • and switches to Standby mode if pin RSTN is released HIGH
                         • and switches to Forced Normal mode if bit FNMC = 1
                         • if the SBC is forced into Off or Overtemp mode
                       If a V1 undervoltage event forced the transition to Reset mode, the UJA1167A will remain
                       in Reset mode until the voltage on pin V1 has recovered.
               7.1.1.5 Off mode
                       The UJA1167A switches to Off mode when the battery is first connected or from any mode
                       when VBAT < Vth(det)poff. Only power-on detection is enabled; all other modules are
                       inactive. The UJA1167A starts to boot up when the battery voltage rises above the
                       power-on detection threshold Vth(det)pon (triggering an initialization process) and switches
                       to Reset mode after tstartup. In Off mode, the CAN pins disengage from the bus (zero load;
                       high-ohmic).

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                          UJA1167A
                                         Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                 watchdog
               7.1.1.6 Overtemp mode
                       Overtemp mode is provided to prevent the UJA1167A being damaged by excessive
                       temperatures. The UJA1167A switches immediately to Overtemp mode from any mode
                       (other than Off mode or Sleep mode) when the global chip temperature rises above the
                       overtemperature protection activation threshold, Tth(act)otp.
                       To help prevent the loss of data due to overheating, the UJA1167A issues a warning when
                       the IC temperature rises above the overtemperature warning threshold (Tth(warn)otp). When
                       this happens, status bit OTWS is set and an overtemperature warning event is captured
                       (OTW = 1), if enabled (OTWE = 1).
                       In Overtemp mode, the CAN transmitter and receiver are disabled and the CAN pins are
                       in a high-ohmic state. No wake-up event will be detected, but a pending wake-up will still
                       be signalled by a LOW level on pin RXD, which will persist after the overtemperature
                       event has been cleared. V1 is off and pin RSTN is driven LOW.
                       VEXT is off in the UJA1167ATK/X. In the UJA1167ATK, INH remains unchanged when
                       the SBC enters Overtemp mode.
                       The UJA1167A exits Overtemp mode:
                         • and switches to Reset mode if the chip temperature falls below the overtemperature
                            protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp
                         • if the device is forced to switch to Off mode (VBAT < Vth(det)poff)
               7.1.1.7 Forced Normal mode
                       Forced Normal mode simplifies SBC testing and is useful for initial prototyping and failure
                       detection, as well as first flashing of the microcontroller. The watchdog is disabled in
                       Forced Normal mode. The low-drop voltage regulator (V1) is active, VEXT/INH is enabled
                       and the CAN transceiver is active.
                       Bit FNMC is factory preset to 1, so the UJA1167A initially boots up in Forced Normal
                       mode (see Table 9). This allows a newly installed device to be run in Normal mode without
                       a watchdog. So the microcontroller can be flashed via the CAN bus in the knowledge that
                       a watchdog timer overflow will not trigger a system reset.
                       The register containing bit FNMC (address 74h) is stored in non-volatile memory (see
                       Section 7.11). So once bit FNMC is programmed to 0, the SBC will no longer boot up in
                       Forced Normal mode, allowing the watchdog to be enabled.
                       Even in Forced Normal mode, a reset event (e.g. an external reset or a V1 undervoltage)
                       will trigger a transition to Reset mode with normal Reset mode behavior (except that the
                       transmitter remains active if there is no V1 undervoltage). However, the UJA1167A will
                       return to Forced Normal mode instead of switching to Standby mode when it exits Reset
                       mode.
                       In Forced Normal mode, only the Main status register, the Watchdog status register, the
                       Identification register and registers stored in non-volatile memory can be read. The
                       non-volatile memory area is fully accessible for writing as long as the UJA1167A is in the
                       factory preset state (for details see Section 7.11).
                       The UJA1167A switches from Reset mode to Forced Normal mode if bit FNMC = 1.

                   7.2 Watchdog
                       The UJA1167A contains a watchdog that supports three operating modes: Window,
                       Timeout and Autonomous. In Window mode (available only in SBC Normal mode), a
                       watchdog trigger event within a closed watchdog window resets the watchdog timer. In
                       Timeout mode, the watchdog runs continuously and can be reset at any time within the
                       timeout time by a watchdog trigger. Watchdog timeout mode can also be used for cyclic
                       wake-up of the microcontroller. In Autonomous mode, the watchdog can be off or in
                       Timeout mode (see Section 7.2.4).
                       The watchdog mode is selected via bits WMC in the Watchdog control register (Table 8).
                       The SBC must be in Standby mode when the watchdog mode and/or period is changed. If
                       Window mode is selected (WMC = 100), the watchdog will remain in (or switch to)
                       Timeout mode until the SBC enters Normal mode. Any attempt to change the watchdog
                       operating mode (via WMC) or period (via NWP) while the SBC is in Normal mode will
                       cause the UJA1167A to switch to Reset mode. The reset source status bits (RSS) will be
                       set to 10000 (‘illegal watchdog mode control access’; see Table 6) and an SPI failure
                       (SPIF) event triggered, if enabled.
                       Eight watchdog periods are supported, from 8 ms to 4096 ms. The watchdog period is
                       programmed via bits NWP. The selected period is valid for both Window and Timeout
                       modes. The default watchdog period is 128 ms.

                                A watchdog trigger event resets the watchdog timer. A watchdog trigger event is any valid
                                write access to the Watchdog control register. If the watchdog mode or the watchdog
                                period have changed as a result of the write access, the new values are immediately
                                valid.

                                The watchdog is a valuable safety mechanism, so it is critical that it is configured correctly.
                                Two features are provided to prevent watchdog parameters being changed by mistake:
                                  • redundant states of configuration bits WMC and NWP
                                  • reconfiguration protection in Normal mode

                                                                                                                                              watchdog
                   Redundant states associated with control bits WMC and NWP ensure that a single bit
                   error cannot cause the watchdog to be configured incorrectly (at least two bits must be
                   changed to reconfigure WMC or NWP). If an attempt is made to write an invalid code to
                   WMC or NWP (e.g. 011 or 1001 respectively), the SPI operation is abandoned and an SPI
                   failure event is captured, if enabled (see Section 7.10).
                   Two operating modes have a major impact on the operation of the watchdog: Forced
                   Normal mode and Software Development mode (Software Development mode is provided
                   for test purposes and is not an SBC operating mode; the UJA1167A can be in any mode
                   with Software Development mode enabled; see Section 7.2.1). These modes are enabled
                   and disabled via bits FNMC and SDMC respectively in the SBC configuration control
                   register (see Table 9). Note that this register is located in the non-volatile memory area
                   (see Section 7.10). In Forced Normal mode (FNM), the watchdog is completely disabled.
                   In Software Development mode (SDM), the watchdog can be disabled or activated for test
                   purposes.
                   Information on the status of the watchdog is available from the Watchdog status register
                   (Table 10). This register also indicates whether Forced Normal and Software
                   Development modes are active.

                7.2.1 Software Development mode
                      Software Development mode is provided to simplify the software design process. When
                      Software Development mode is enabled, the watchdog starts up in Autonomous mode
                      (WMC = 001) and is inactive after a system reset, overriding the default value (see
                      Table 8). The watchdog is always off in Autonomous mode if Software Development mode
                      is enabled (SDMC = 1; see Table 11).
                      Software can be run without a watchdog in Software Development mode. However, it is
                      possible to activate and deactivate the watchdog for test purposes by selecting Window or
                      Timeout mode via bits WMC while the SBC is in Standby mode (note that Window mode
                      will only be activated when the SBC switches to Normal mode). Software Development
                      mode is activated via bits SDMC in non-volatile memory (see Table 9).
                7.2.2 Watchdog behavior in Window mode
                      The watchdog runs continuously in Window mode. The watchdog will be in Window mode
                      if WMC = 100 and the UJA1167A is in Normal mode.
                      In Window mode, the watchdog can only be triggered during the second half of the
                      watchdog period. If the watchdog overflows, or is triggered in the first half of the watchdog
                      period (before ttrig(wd)1), a system reset is performed. After the system reset, the reset
                      source (either ‘watchdog triggered too early’ or ‘watchdog overflow’) can be read via the
                      reset source status bits (RSS) in the Main Status register (Table 6). If the watchdog is
                      triggered in the second half of the watchdog period (after ttrig(wd)1 but before ttrig(wd)2), the
                      watchdog timer is restarted.
                7.2.3 Watchdog behavior in Timeout mode
                      The watchdog runs continuously in Timeout mode. The watchdog will be in Timeout mode
                      if WMC = 010 and the UJA1167A is in Normal, Standby or Sleep mode. The watchdog will
                      also be in Timeout mode if WMC = 100 and the UJA1167A is in Standby or Sleep mode. If
                      Autonomous mode is selected (WMC = 001), the watchdog will be in Timeout mode if one
                      of the conditions for Timeout mode listed in Table 11 has been satisfied.
                      In Timeout mode, the watchdog timer can be reset at any time by a watchdog trigger. If the
                      watchdog overflows, a watchdog failure event (WDF) is captured. If a WDF is already
                      pending when the watchdog overflows, a system reset is performed. In Timeout mode, the
UJA1167A                               All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2019. All rights reserved.

                       watchdog can be used as a cyclic wake-up source for the microcontroller when the
                       UJA1167A is in Standby or Sleep mode. In Sleep mode, a watchdog overflow generates a
                       wake-up event.
                       When the SBC is in Sleep mode with watchdog Timeout mode selected, a wake-up event
                       is generated after the nominal watchdog period (NWP). If bit WDF is set, RXD is forced
                       LOW and V1 is turned on. The application software can then clear the WDF bit and trigger
                       the watchdog before it overflows.
                7.2.4 Watchdog behavior in Autonomous mode
                       Autonomous mode is selected when WMC = 001. In Autonomous mode, the watchdog is
                       either off or in Timeout mode, according to the conditions detailed in Table 11.
                       Table 11.   Watchdog status in Autonomous mode
                        UJA1167A operating mode                         Watchdog status
                                                                        SDMC = 0                                    SDMC = 1
                        Normal                                          Timeout mode                                off
                        Standby; RXD HIGH                               off                                         off
                        Sleep                                           off                                         off
                        any other mode                                  off                                         off
                        Standby; RXD LOW                                Timeout mode                                off
                       When Autonomous mode is selected, the watchdog will be in Timeout mode if the SBC is
                       in Normal mode or Standby mode with RXD LOW, provided Software Development mode
                       has been disabled (SDMC = 0). Otherwise the watchdog will be off.
                       In Autonomous mode, the watchdog will not be running when the SBC is in Standby (RXD
                       HIGH) or Sleep mode. If a wake-up event is captured, pin RXD is forced LOW to signal
                       the event and the watchdog is automatically restarted in Timeout mode. If the SBC was in
                       Sleep mode when the wake-up event was captured, it switches to Standby mode.
                   7.3 System reset
                       When a system reset occurs, the SBC switches to Reset mode and initiates a process
                       that generates a low-level pulse on pin RSTN.
                7.3.1 Characteristics of pin RSTN
                       Pin RSTN is a bidirectional open drain low side driver with integrated pull-up resistance,
                       as shown in Figure 4. With this configuration, the SBC can detect the pin being pulled
                       down externally, e.g. by the microcontroller. The input reset pulse width must be at least
                       tw(rst).

                7.3.2 Selecting the output reset pulse width
                      The duration of the output reset pulse is selected via bits RLC in the Start-up control
                      register (Table 12). The SBC distinguishes between a cold start and a warm start. A cold
                      start is performed if the reset event was combined with a V1 undervoltage event
                      (power-on reset, reset during Sleep mode, over-temperature reset, V1 undervoltage
                      before entering or while in Reset mode). The output reset pulse width for a cold start is
                      determined by the setting of bits RLC.
                      If any other reset event occurs without a V1 undervoltage (external reset, watchdog
                      failure, watchdog change attempt in Normal mode, illegal Sleep mode command) the SBC
                      uses the shortest reset length (tw(rst) = 1 ms to 1.5 ms). This is called a warm start of the
                      microcontroller.

                        •  pin RSTN is pulled down externally
                        •  the watchdog overflows in Window mode

                          • local or CAN bus wake-up in Sleep mode
                          • diagnostic wake-up in Sleep mode
                          • the SBC leaves Overtemp mode
                          • illegal Sleep mode command received
                   7.4 Global temperature protection
                       The temperature of the UJA1167A is monitored continuously, except in Sleep and Off
                       modes. The SBC switches to Overtemp mode if the temperature exceeds the
                       overtemperature protection activation threshold, Tth(act)otp. In addition, pin RSTN is driven
                       LOW and V1, VEXT and the CAN transceiver are switched off. When the temperature
                       drops below the overtemperature protection release threshold, Tth(rel)otp, the SBC
                       switches to Standby mode via Reset mode.
                       In addition, the UJA1167A provides an overtemperature warning. When the IC
                       temperature rises about the overtemperature warning threshold (Tth(warn)otp), status bit
                       OTWS is set and an overtemperature warning event is captured (OTW = 1).
                   7.5 Power supplies
                7.5.1 Battery supply voltage (VBAT)
                       The internal circuitry is supplied from the battery via pin BAT. The device needs to be
                       protected against negative supply voltages, e.g. by using an external series diode. If VBAT
                       falls below the power-off detection threshold, Vth(det)poff, the SBC switches to Off mode.
                       However, the microcontroller supply voltage (V1) remains active until VBAT falls below 2 V.
                       The SBC switches from Off mode to Reset mode tstartup after the battery voltage rises
                       above the power-on detection threshold, Vth(det)pon. Power-on event status bit PO is set to
                       1 to indicate the UJA1167A has powered up and left Off mode (see Table 21).
                7.5.2 Low-drop voltage supply for 5 V microcontroller (V1)
                       V1 is intended to supply the microcontroller and the internal CAN transceiver and delivers
                       up to 150 mA at 5 V. The output voltage on V1 is monitored. A system reset is generated
                       if the voltage on V1 drops below the selected undervoltage threshold (60 %, 70 %, 80 %
                       or 90 % of the nominal V1 output voltage, selected via V1RTC in the V1 and INH/VEXT
                       control register; see Table 13).
                       The internal CAN transceiver consumes 50 mA (max) when the bus is continuously
                       dominant, leaving 100 mA available for the external load on pin V1. In practice, the typical
                       current consumption of the CAN transceiver is lower (25 mA), depending on the
                       application, leaving more current available for the load.
                       The default value of the undervoltage threshold at power-up is determined by the value of
                       bits V1RTSUC in the SBC configuration control register (Table 9). The SBC configuration
                       control register is in non-volatile memory, allowing the user to define the undervoltage
                       threshold (V1RTC) at start-up.

                       In addition, an undervoltage warning (a V1U event; see Section 7.10) is generated if the
                       voltage on V1 falls below 90 % of the nominal value (and V1U event detection is enabled,
                       V1UE = 1; see Table 26). This information can be used as a warning, when the 60 %,
                       70 % or 80 % threshold is selected, to indicate that the level on V1 is outside the nominal
                       supply range. The status of V1, whether it is above or below the 90 % undervoltage
                       threshold, can be read via bit V1S in the Supply voltage status register (Table 14).

                       sensor supply (VEXT).
                       In the UJA1167ATK, the INH pin can be used to control external devices, such as voltage
                       regulators. Depending on the setting of bits VEXTC, pin INH will either be disabled (to
                       disable external devices) or at a battery-related HIGH level (to enable external devices) in

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1167A
                                       Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                watchdog
                       selected SBC operating modes (see Table 13). To ensure external devices are not
                       disabled due to an overtemperature event, pin INH does not change state when the SBC
                       switches to Overtemp mode.
                       In the UJA1167ATK/X, the VEXT pin is a voltage output intended to supply external
                       components, delivering up to 30 mA at 5 V. Like INH, VEXT is also configured via bits
                       VEXTC in the V1 and INH/VEXT control register (Table 13).
                       The default value of VEXTC at power-on is defined by bits VEXTSUC in non-volatile
                       memory (see Section 7.11).
                       In contrast to pin INH, pin VEXT is disabled when the SBC switches to Overtemp mode.
                       The status of VEXT can be read from the Supply voltage status register (Table 14).
                   7.7 High-speed CAN transceiver
                       The integrated high-speed CAN transceiver is designed for active communication at bit
                       rates up to 1 Mbit/s, providing differential transmit and receive capability to a CAN protocol
                       controller. The transceiver is ISO 11898-2:2016 compliant. The CAN transmitter is
                       supplied from V1. The UJA1167A includes additional timing parameters on loop delay
                       symmetry to ensure reliable communication in fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s, as
                       used in CAN FD networks.
                       The CAN transceiver supports autonomous CAN biasing, which helps to minimize RF
                       emissions. CANH and CANL are always biased to 2.5 V when the transceiver is in Active
                       or Listen-only modes (CMC = 01/10/11).
                       Autonomous biasing is active in CAN Offline mode - to 2.5 V if there is activity on the bus
                       (CAN Offline Bias mode) and to GND if there is no activity on the bus for t > tto(silence)
                       (CAN Offline mode).
                       This is useful when the node is disabled due to a malfunction in the microcontroller. The
                       SBC ensures that the CAN bus is correctly biased to avoid disturbing ongoing
                       communication between other nodes. The autonomous CAN bias voltage is derived
                       directly from VBAT.
                7.7.1 CAN operating modes
                       The integrated CAN transceiver supports four operating modes: Active, Listen-only,
                       Offline and Offline Bias (see Figure 5). The CAN transceiver operating mode depends on
                       the UJA1167A operating mode and on the setting of bits CMC in the CAN control register
                       (Table 15).
                       When the UJA1167A is in Normal mode, the CAN transceiver operating mode (Active,
                       Listen-only or Offline) can be selected via bits CMC in the CAN control register (Table 15).
                       When the UJA1167A is in Standby or Sleep modes, the transceiver is forced to Offline or
                       Offline Bias mode (depending on bus activity).
               7.7.1.1 CAN Active mode
                       In CAN Active mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data via CANH and CANL.
                       The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data, which
                       is output on pin RXD. The transmitter converts digital data generated by the CAN
                       controller (input on pin TXD) into analog signals suitable for transmission over the CANH
                       and CANL bus lines.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1167A
                                        Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                watchdog
                       CAN Active mode is selected when CMC = 01 or 10. When CMC = 01, V1/CAN
                       undervoltage detection is enabled and the transceiver will go to CAN Offline or CAN
                       Offline Bias mode when the voltage on V1 drops below the 90 % threshold. When
                       CMC = 10, V1/CAN undervoltage detection is disabled. The transmitter will remain active
                       until the voltage on V1 drops below the V1 reset threshold (selected via bits V1RTC). The
                       SBC will then switch to Reset mode and the transceiver will switch to CAN Offline or CAN
                       Offline Bias mode.
                       The CAN transceiver is in Active mode when:
                          • the UJA1167A is in Normal mode (MC = 111) and the CAN transceiver has been
                            enabled by setting bits CMC in the CAN control register to 01 or 10 (see Table 15)
                            and:
                            – if CMC = 01, the voltage on pin V1 is above the 90 % undervoltage threshold
                            – if CMC = 10, the voltage on pin V1 is above the V1 reset threshold
                       If pin TXD is held LOW (e.g. by a short-circuit to GND) when CAN Active mode is selected
                       via bits CMC, the transceiver will not enter CAN Active mode but will switch to or remain in
                       CAN Listen-only mode. It will remain in Listen-only mode until pin TXD goes HIGH in
                       order to prevent a hardware and/or software application failure from driving the bus lines
                       to an unwanted dominant state.
                       In CAN Active mode, the CAN bias voltage is derived from V1.
                       The application can determine whether the CAN transceiver is ready to transmit/receive
                       data or is disabled by reading the CAN Transceiver Status (CTS) bit in the Transceiver
                       Status Register (Table 16).
               7.7.1.2 CAN Listen-only mode
                       CAN Listen-only mode allows the UJA1167A to monitor bus activity while the transceiver
                       is inactive, without influencing bus levels. This facility could be used by development tools
                       that need to listen to the bus but do not need to transmit or receive data or for
                       software-driven selective wake-up. Dedicated microcontrollers could be used for selective
                       wake-up, providing an embedded low-power CAN engine designed to monitor the bus for
                       potential wake-up events.
                       In Listen-only mode the CAN transmitter is disabled, reducing current consumption. The
                       CAN receiver and CAN biasing remain active. This enables the host microcontroller to
                       switch to a low-power mode in which an embedded CAN protocol controller remains
                       active, waiting for a signal to wake up the microcontroller.
                       The CAN transceiver is in Listen-only mode when:
                          • the UJA1167A is in Normal mode and CMC = 11
                       The CAN transceiver will not leave Listen-only mode while TXD is LOW or CAN Active
                       mode is selected with CMC = 01 while the voltage on V1 is below the 90 % undervoltage
                       threshold.
               7.7.1.3 CAN Offline and Offline Bias modes
                       In CAN Offline mode, the transceiver monitors the CAN bus for a wake-up event, provided
                       CAN wake-up detection is enabled (CWE = 1). CANH and CANL are biased to GND.

                                           Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                    watchdog
                       CAN Offline Bias mode is the same as CAN Offline mode, with the exception that the CAN
                       bus is biased to 2.5 V. This mode is activated automatically when activity is detected on
                       the CAN bus while the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode. The transceiver will return to
                       CAN Offline mode if the CAN bus is silent (no CAN bus edges) for longer than tto(silence).
                       The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode from CAN Active mode or CAN
                       Listen-only mode if:
                         • the SBC switches to Reset or Standby or Sleep mode OR
                         • the SBC is in Normal mode and CMC = 00
                       provided the CAN-bus has been inactive for at least tto(silence). If the CAN-bus has been
                       inactive for less than tto(silence), the CAN transceiver switches first to CAN Offline Bias
                       mode and then to CAN Offline mode once the bus has been silent for tto(silence).
                       The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline/Offline Bias mode from CAN Active mode if
                       CMC = 01 and the voltage on V1 drops below the 90 % undervoltage threshold or
                       CMC = 10 and the voltage on V1 drops below the V1 reset threshold.
                       The CAN transceiver switches to CAN Offline mode:
                         • from CAN Offline Bias mode if no activity is detected on the bus (no CAN edges) for
                            t > tto(silence) OR
                         • when the SBC switches from Off or Overtemp mode to Reset mode
                       The CAN transceiver switches from CAN Offline mode to CAN Offline Bias mode if:
                         • a standard wake-up pattern is detected on the CAN bus OR
                         • the SBC is in Normal mode, CMC = 01 or 10 and VV1 < 90 %
               7.7.1.4 CAN Off mode
                       The CAN transceiver is switched off completely with the bus lines floating when:
                         • the SBC switches to Off or Overtemp mode OR
                         • VBAT falls below the CAN receiver undervoltage detection threshold, Vuvd(CAN)
                       It will be switched on again on entering CAN Offline mode when VBAT rises above the
                       undervoltage recovery threshold (Vuvr(CAN)) and the SBC is no longer in Off/Overtemp
                       mode. CAN Off mode prevents reverse currents flowing from the bus when the battery
                       supply to the SBC is lost.

         (1) To prevent the bus lines being driven to a permanent dominant state, the transceiver will not switch to CAN Active mode or CAN
               Listen-only mode if pin TXD is held LOW (e.g. by a short-circuit to GND)

                                 If the CAN transceiver is in Offline mode and CAN wake-up is enabled (CWE = 1), the
                                 UJA1167A will monitor the bus for a wake-up pattern.
                                 A filter at the receiver input prevents unwanted wake-up events occurring due to
                                 automotive transients or EMI. A dominant-recessive-dominant wake-up pattern must be
                                 transmitted on the CAN bus within the wake-up timeout time (tto(wake)) to pass the wake-up
                                 filter and trigger a wake-up event (see Figure 6; note that additional pulses may occur
                                 between the recessive/dominant phases). The recessive and dominant phases must last
                                 at least twake(busrec) and twake(busdom), respectively.

                             Transceiver event status register is set (see Table 23) and pin RXD is driven LOW. If the
                             SBC was in Sleep mode when the wake-up pattern was detected, V1 is enabled to supply
                             the microcontroller and the SBC switches to Standby mode via Reset mode.

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1167A
                                        Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                watchdog
                   7.8 CAN fail-safe features
                7.8.1 TXD dominant timeout
                       A TXD dominant time-out timer is started when pin TXD is forced LOW while the
                       transceiver is in CAN Active Mode. If the LOW state on pin TXD persists for longer than
                       the TXD dominant time-out time (tto(dom)TXD), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                       failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                       communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD goes HIGH.
                       The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 4.4 kbit/s.
                       When the TXD dominant time-out time is exceeded, a CAN failure event is captured
                       (CF = 1; see Table 23), if enabled (CFE = 1; see Table 27). In addition, the status of the
                       TXD dominant timeout can be read via the CFS bit in the Transceiver status register
                       (Table 16) and bit CTS is cleared.
                7.8.2 Pull-up on TXD pin
                       Pin TXD has an internal pull-up towards V1 to ensure a safe defined recessive driver state
                       in case the pin is left floating.
                7.8.3 V1 undervoltage event
                       When CMC = 01, a CAN failure event is captured (CF = 1) and status bit VCS is set to 1
                       when the supply to the CAN transceiver (VV1) falls below 90 % of its nominal value
                       (assuming CAN failure detection is enabled; CFE = 1).
                7.8.4 Loss of power at pin BAT
                       A loss of power at pin BAT has no influence on the bus lines or on the microcontroller. No
                       reverse currents will flow from the bus.
                   7.9 Local wake-up via WAKE pin
                       Local wake-up is enabled via bits WPRE and WPFE in the WAKE pin event capture
                       enable register (see Table 28). A wake-up event is triggered by a LOW-to-HIGH (if
                       WPRE = 1) and/or a HIGH-to-LOW (if WPFE = 1) transition on the WAKE pin. This
                       arrangement allows for maximum flexibility when designing a local wake-up circuit. In
                       applications that don’t make use of the local wake-up facility, local wake-up should be
                       disabled and the WAKE pin connected to GND to ensure optimal EMI performance.

                        0      reserved      R                 -
                       While the SBC is in Normal mode, the status of the voltage on pin WAKE can always be
                       read via bit WPVS. Otherwise, WPVS is only valid if local wake-up is enabled (WPRE = 1
                       and/or WPFE = 1).

                7.10 Wake-up and interrupt event diagnosis via pin RXD
                         Wake-up and interrupt event diagnosis in the UJA1167A is intended to provide the
                         microcontroller with information on the status of a range of features and functions. This
                         information is stored in the event status registers (Table 21 to Table 23) and is signaled on
                         pin RXD, if enabled.
                         A distinction is made between regular wake-up events and interrupt events (at least one
                         regular wake-up source must be enabled to allow the UJA1167A to switch to Sleep mode;
                         see Section 7.1.1.3).

                                       Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                watchdog
                      If an event occurs while the associated event capture function is enabled, the relevant
                      event status bit is set. If the transceiver is in CAN Offline mode with V1 active (SBC
                      Normal or Standby mode), pin RXD is forced LOW to indicate that a wake-up or interrupt
                      event has been detected. If the UJA1167A is in sleep mode when the event occurs, the
                      microcontroller supply, V1, is activated and the SBC switches to Standby mode (via Reset
                      mode).
                      The microcontroller can monitor events via the event status registers. An extra status
                      register, the Global event status register (Table 20), is provided to help speed up software
                      polling routines. By polling the Global event status register, the microcontroller can quickly
                      determine the type of event captured (system, supply, transceiver or WAKE pin) and then
                      query the relevant table (Table 21, Table 22, Table 23 or Table 24 respectively).
                      After the event source has been identified, the status flag should be cleared (set to 0) by
                      writing 1 to the relevant bit (writing 0 will have no effect). A number of status bits can be
                      cleared in a single write operation by writing 1 to all relevant bits.
                      It is strongly recommended to clear only the status bits that were set to 1 when the status
                      registers were last read. This precaution ensures that events triggered just before the
                      write access are not lost.
               7.10.1 Interrupt/wake-up delay
                      If interrupt or wake-up events occur very frequently while the transceiver is in CAN Offline
                      mode, they can have a significant impact on the software processing time (because pin
                      RXD is repeatedly driven LOW, requiring a response from the microcontroller each time
                      an interrupt/wake-up is generated). The UJA1167A incorporates an event delay timer to
                      limit the disturbance to the software.
                      When one of the event capture status bits is cleared, pin RXD is released (HIGH) and a
                      timer is started. If further events occur while the timer is running, the relevant status bits
                      are set. If one or more events are pending when the timer expires after td(event), pin RXD
                      goes LOW again to alert the microcontroller.
                      In this way, the microcontroller is interrupted once to process a number of events rather
                      than several times to process individual events.
                      If all events are cleared while the timer is running, RXD remains HIGH after the timer
                      expires, since there are no pending events. The event capture registers can be read at
                      any time.
                      The event capture delay timer is stopped immediately when pin RSTN goes low (triggered
                      by a HIGH-to-LOW transition on the pin). RSTN is driven LOW when the SBC enters
                      Reset, Sleep, Overtemp and Off modes. A pending event is signaled on pin RXD when
                      the SBC enters Sleep mode.
               7.10.2 Sleep mode protection
                      The wake-up event capture function is critical when the UJA1167A is in Sleep mode,
                      because the SBC will only leave Sleep mode in response to a captured wake-up event. To
                      avoid potential system deadlocks, the SBC distinguishes between regular and diagnostic
                      events (see Section 7.10). Wake-up events (via the CAN bus or the WAKE pin) are
                      classified as regular events; diagnostic events signal failure/error conditions or state

NXP Semiconductors                                                                                                         UJA1167A
                                       Mini high-speed CAN system basis chip with Standby/Sleep modes &
                                                                                                                                                watchdog
                      changes. At least one regular wake-up event must be enabled before the UJA1167A can
                      switch to Sleep mode. Any attempt to enter Sleep mode while all regular wake-up events
                      are disabled will trigger a system reset.
                      Another condition that must be satisfied before the UJA1167A can switch to Sleep mode
                      is that all event status bits must be cleared. If an event is pending when the SBC receives
                      a Sleep mode command (MC = 001), it will immediately switch to Reset mode. This
                      condition applies to both regular and diagnostic events.
                      Sleep mode can be permanently disabled in applications where, for safety reasons, the
                      supply voltage to the host controller must never be cut off. Sleep mode is permanently
                      disabled by setting the Sleep control bit (SLPC) in the SBC configuration register (see
                      Table 9) to 1. This register is located in the non-volatile memory area of the device. When
                      SLPC = 1, a Sleep mode SPI command (MC = 001) will trigger an SPI failure event
                      instead of a transition to Sleep mode.
               7.10.3 Event status and event capture registers
                      After an event source has been identified, the status flag should be cleared (set to
                      0) by writing 1 to the relevant status bit (writing 0 will have no effect).

                 7.11 Non-volatile SBC configuration
                         The UJA1167A contains Multiple Time Programmable Non-Volatile (MTPNV) memory
                         cells that allow some of the default device settings to be reconfigured. The MTPNV
                         memory address range is from 0x73 to 0x74. An overview of the MTPNV registers is given
                         in Table 29.

               7.11.1 Programming MTPNV cells
                         The UJA1167A must be in Forced Normal mode and the MTPNV cells must contain the
                         factory preset values before the non-volatile memory can be reprogrammed. The
                         UJA1167A will switch to Forced Normal mode after a reset event (e.g. pin RSTN LOW)
                         when the MTPNV cells contain the factory preset values (since FNMC = 1).
                         The factory presets may need to be restored before reprogramming can begin (see
                         Section 7.11.2). When the factory presets have been restored, a system reset is
                         generated automatically and UJA1167A switches to Forced Normal mode. This ensures
                         that the programming cycle cannot be interrupted by the watchdog.
                         Programming of the non-volatile memory registers is performed in two steps. First, the
                         required values are written to addresses 0x73 and 0x74. In the second step,
                         reprogramming is confirmed by writing the correct CRC value to the MTPNV CRC control
                         register (see Section 7.11.1.1). The SBC starts reprogramming the MTPNV cells as soon
                         as the CRC value has been validated. If the CRC value is not correct, reprogramming is
                         aborted. On completion, a system reset is generated to indicate that the MTPNV cells
                         have been reprogrammed successfully. Note that the MTPNV cells cannot be read while
                         they are being reprogrammed.
                         After an MTPNV programming cycle has been completed, the non-volatile memory is
                         protected from being overwritten via a standard SPI write operation.
                         The MTPNV cells can be reprogrammed a maximum of 200 times (Ncy(W)MTP; see
                         Table 47). Bit NVMPS in the MTPNV status register (Table 30) indicates whether the
                         non-volatile cells can be reprogrammed. This register also contains a write counter,
                         WRCNTS, that is incremented each time the MTPNV cells are reprogrammed (up to a
                         maximum value of 111111; there is no overflow; performing a factory reset also increments
                         the counter). This counter is provided for information purposes only; reprogramming will
                         not be rejected when it reaches its maximum value.
                         An error correction code status bit, ECCS, is set to indicate that the CRC check
                         mechanism in the SBC has detected a single bit failure in non-volatile memory. If more
                         than one bit failure is detected, the SBC will not restart after MTPNV reprogramming.
                         Check the ECCS flag at the end of the production cycle to verify the content of non-volatile
                         memory. When this flag is set, it indicates a device or ECU failure.

                       The cyclic redundancy check value stored in bits CRCC in the MTPNV CRC control
                       register is calculated using the data written to registers 0x73 and 0x74.

               7.11.2 Restoring factory preset values
                      Factory preset values are restored if the following conditions apply for at least td(MTPNV)
                      during power-up:
                        • pin RSTN is held LOW
                        • CANH is pulled up to VBAT
                        • CANL is pulled down to GND
                      After the factory preset values have been restored, the SBC performs a system reset and
                      enters Forced normal Mode. Since the CAN bus is clamped dominant, pin RXDC is forced
                      LOW. During the factory preset restore process, this pin is forced HIGH; a falling edge on
                      this pin caused by bit PO being set after power-on then clearly indicates that the process
                      has been completed.
                      Note that the write counter, WRCNTS, in the MTPNV status register is incremented every
                      time the factory presets are restored.

                7.13 Lock control register
                      Sections of the register address area can be write-protected to protect against unintended
                      modifications. Note that this facility only protects locked bits from being modified via the
                      SPI and will not prevent the UJA1167A updating status registers etc.

                      to 0x09 (see Table 35).
                7.15 SPI
               7.15.1 Introduction
                      The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) provides the communication link with the
                      microcontroller, supporting multi-slave operations. The SPI is configured for full duplex
                      data transfer, so status information is returned when new control data is shifted in. The
                      interface also offers a read-only access option, allowing registers to be read back by the
                      application without changing the register content.
                      The SPI uses four interface signals for synchronization and data transfer:
                        •  SCSN: SPI chip select; active LOW
                        •  SCK: SPI clock; default level is LOW due to low-power concept (pull-down)
                        •  SDI: SPI data input
                        •  SDO: SPI data output; floating when pin SCSN is HIGH
                      Bit sampling is performed on the falling edge of the clock and data is shifted in/out on the
                      rising edge, as illustrated in Figure 8.

  Fig 8.   SPI timing protocol
                           The SPI data in the UJA1167A is stored in a number of dedicated 8-bit registers. Each
                           register is assigned a unique 7-bit address. Two bytes must be transmitted to the SBC for
                           a single register write operation. The first byte contains the 7-bit address along with a
                           ‘read-only’ bit (the LSB). The read-only bit must be 0 to indicate a write operation (if this bit
                           is 1, a read operation is assumed and any data on the SDI pin is ignored). The second
                           byte contains the data to be written to the register.
                           24- and 32-bit read and write operations are also supported. The register address is
                           automatically incremented, once for a 24-bit operation and twice for a 32-bit operation, as

                   The UJA1167A tolerates attempts to write to registers that don't exist. If the available
                   address space is exceeded during a write operation, the data above the valid address
                   range is ignored (without generating an SPI failure event).
                   During a write operation, the UJA1167A monitors the number of SPI bits transmitted. If the
                   number recorded is not 16, 24 or 32, then the write operation is aborted and an SPI failure
                   event is captured (SPIF = 1).
                   If more than 32 bits are clocked in on pin SDI during a read operation, the data stream on
                   SDI is reflected on SDO from bit 33 onwards.

                           A number of register bits may change state automatically when the UJA1167A switches
                           from one operating mode to another. This is particularly evident when the UJA1167A
                           switches to Off mode. These changes are summarized in Table 44. If an SPI transmission
                           is in progress when the UJA1167A changes state, the transmission is ignored (automatic
                           state changes have priority).

[1]    All parameters are guaranteed over the virtual junction temperature range by design. Factory testing uses correlated test conditions to
       cover the specified temperature and power supply voltage range.
[2]    See Figure 11 and Figure 16.
[3]    See Figure 12 and Figure 16.
[4]    A system reset will be performed if the watchdog is in Window mode and is triggered less than ttrig(wd)1 after the start of the watchdog
       period (or in the first half of the watchdog period).
[5]    The nominal watchdog period is programmed via the NWP control bits.
[6]    The watchdog will be reset if it is in window mode and is triggered at least ttrig(wd)1, but not more than ttrig(wd)2, after the start of the
       watchdog period (or in the second half of the watchdog period). A system reset will be performed if the watchdog is triggered more than
       ttrig(wd)2 after the start of the watchdog period (watchdog overflows).
[7]    Not tested in production; guaranteed by design.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                          exposed to the wave

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 19) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 49 and 50

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 19.
