                  Rev. 9 — 28 November 2017                                         Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1051 is a high-speed CAN transceiver that provides an interface between a
              Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical two-wire CAN bus.
              The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive industry,
              providing differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN
              protocol controller.
              The TJA1051 belongs to the third generation of high-speed CAN transceivers from NXP
              Semiconductors, offering significant improvements over first- and second-generation
              devices such as the TJA1050. It offers improved ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
              and ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) performance, and also features:
                • Ideal passive behavior to the CAN bus when the supply voltage is off
                • TJA1051T/3 and TJA1051TK/3 can be interfaced directly to microcontrollers with
                   supply voltages from 3 V to 5 V
              The TJA1051 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. This implementation enables reliable communication in the
              CAN FD fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              These features make the TJA1051 an excellent choice for all types of HS-CAN networks,
              in nodes that do not require a standby mode with wake-up capability via the bus.

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1051 is a high-speed CAN stand-alone transceiver with Silent mode. It combines
                       the functionality of the TJA1050 transceiver with improved EMC and ESD handling
                       capability. Improved slope control and high DC handling capability on the bus pins
                       provides additional application flexibility.
                       The TJA1051 is available in three versions, distinguished only by the function of pin 5:
                         • The TJA1051T is backwards compatible with the TJA1050
                         • The TJA1051T/3 and TJA1051TK/3 allow for direct interfacing to microcontrollers with
                             supply voltages down to 3 V
                         • The TJA1051T/E allows the transceiver to be switched to a very low-current Off
                             mode.
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1051 supports two operating modes, Normal and Silent, which are selected via
                       pin S. An additional Off mode is supported in the TJA1051T/E via pin EN. See Table 4 for
                       a description of the operating modes under normal supply conditions.

                       [3]   ‘X’ = don’t care.
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                       A LOW level on pin S selects Normal mode. In this mode, the transceiver is able to
                       transmit and receive data via the bus lines CANH and CANL (see Figure 1 for the block
                       diagram). The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital
                       data which is output to pin RXD. The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are
                       controlled internally and are optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible
                       ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME).
                7.1.2 Silent mode
                       A HIGH level on pin S selects Silent mode. In Silent mode the transmitter is disabled,
                       releasing the bus pins to recessive state. All other IC functions, including the receiver,
                       continue to operate as in Normal mode. Silent mode can be used to prevent a faulty CAN
                       controller from disrupting all network communications.

                                                                                                                    High-speed CAN transceiver
                7.1.3 Off mode
                       A LOW level on pin EN of TJA1051T/E selects Off mode. In Off mode the entire
                       transceiver is disabled, allowing the microcontroller to save power when CAN
                       communication is not required. The bus pins are floating in Off mode, making the
                       transceiver invisible to the rest of the network.
                   7.2 Fail-safe features
                7.2.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                       A ‘TXD dominant time-out’ timer is started when pin TXD is set LOW. If the LOW state on
                       pin TXD persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                       failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                       communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD is set HIGH.
                       The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 20 kbit/s.
                7.2.2 Internal biasing of TXD, S and EN input pins
                       Pin TXD has an internal pull-up to VIO and pins S and EN (TJA1051T/E) have internal
                       pull-downs to GND. This ensures a safe, defined state in case one or more of these pins
                       is left floating.
                7.2.3 Undervoltage detection on pins VCC and VIO
                       Should VCC or VIO drop below their respective undervoltage detection levels (Vuvd(VCC)
                       and Vuvd (VIO); see Table 7), the transceiver will switch off and disengage from the bus
                       (zero load) until VCC and VIO have recovered.
                7.2.4 Overtemperature protection
                       The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                       temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), the output drivers will be
                       disabled until the virtual junction temperature falls below Tj(sd) and TXD becomes
                       recessive again. Including the TXD condition ensures that output driver oscillations due to
                       temperature drift are avoided.
                   7.3 VIO supply pin
                       There are three versions of the TJA1051 available, only differing in the function of a single
                       pin. Pin 5 is either an enable control input (EN), a VIO supply pin or is not connected.
                       Pin VIO on the TJA1051T/3 and TJA1051TK/3 should be connected to the microcontroller
                       supply voltage (see Figure 6). This will adjust the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and S to
                       the I/O levels of the microcontroller. For versions of the TJA1051 without a VIO pin, the VIO
                       input is internally connected to VCC. This sets the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and S to
                       levels compatible with 5 V microcontrollers.

[1]    Only TJA1051T/3 and TJA1051TK/3 have a VIO pin. In transceivers without a VIO pin, the VIO input is internally connected to VCC.
[2]    All parameters are guaranteed over the virtual junction temperature range by design. Factory testing uses correlated test conditions to
       cover the specified temperature and power supply voltage range.
[3]    VIO = VCC for the non-VIO product variants TJA1051T(/E)
[4]    Only TJA1051T/E has an EN pin.
[5]    Maximum value assumes VCC < VIO; if VCC > VIO, the maximum value will be VCC + 0.3 V.
[6]    Not tested in production; guaranteed by design.
[7]    The test circuit used to measure the bus output voltage symmetry (which includes CSPLIT) is shown in Figure 8.

15. Handling information
                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
