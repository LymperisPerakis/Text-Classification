AMIS-42665
High-Speed Low Power
CAN Transceiver
Description
   The AMIS−42665 CAN transceiver is the interface between a
controller area network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical                        http://onsemi.com
bus and may be used in both 12 V and 24 V systems. The transceiver
provides differential transmit capability to the bus and differential                                             MARKING
