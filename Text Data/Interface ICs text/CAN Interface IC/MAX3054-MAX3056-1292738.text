MAX3056
General Description                                                       Features
The MAX3054/MAX3055/MAX3056 are interfaces                                ●● ±80V Fault Protection
between the protocol controller and the physical wires                    ●● Low RFI/Excellent EMC Immunity
of the bus lines in a controller area network (CAN). The
devices provide differential transmit capability and switch               ●● Full Wake-Up Capability During Failure Modes
to single-mode if certain fault conditions occur. The                     ●● Bus Failure Management
MAX3054/MAX3055/MAX3056 guarantee full wakeup                             ●● Support Single-Wire Transmission Mode with Ground
capability during failure modes.                                             Offset Voltages Up to 1.5V
The extended fault-protected voltage range of CANH and                    ●● Thermally Protected
CANL bus lines of ±80V. Current-limiting and thermalpro-
                                                                          ●● Do Not Disturb the Bus Line when Unpowered
tection circuits protect the transmitter output stage against
overcurrent faults to prevent destruction of the transmitter              ●● Low-Current Sleep and Standby Mode with Wake-Up
output stage. The CANH and CANL lines are also protect-                      Through Bus Lines
ed against electrical transients that may occur in rugged                 ●● Up to 250kbps Data Rate (MAX3054)
environments.
                                                                          ●● Pin and Functionally Compatible with TJA1054
The transceiver provides three low-power modes that
can be entered and exited through pins STB and EN. An
output INH pin can be used for deactivation of an external
voltage regulator.                                                        Ordering Information
