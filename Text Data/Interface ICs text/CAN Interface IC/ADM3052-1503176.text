  CM is the maximum common-mode voltage slew rate that can be sustained while maintaining specification-compliant operation. VCM is the common-mode potential
  difference between the logic and bus sides. The transient magnitude is the range over which the common mode is slewed. The common-mode voltage slew rates
  apply to both rising and falling common-mode voltage edges.

the data link layer. DeviceNet allows up to 64 nodes on a single
network, with node addresses ranging from 0 to 63. DeviceNet
supports 125 kbps, 250 kbps, and 500 kbps data rates and supports
master and slave as well as peer-to-peer communication. The
ADM3052 can be used as the CAN physical layer transceiver for a
DeviceNet implementation. Refer to the AN-1123 Application
