1. General description
              The TJA1052i is a high-speed CAN transceiver that provides a galvanically isolated
              interface between a Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical
              two-wire CAN bus. The TJA1052i is specifically targeted at Electric Vehicles (EV) and
              Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV), where galvanic isolation barriers are needed between the
              high- and low-voltage parts.
              Safety: Isolation is required for safety reasons, eg. to protect humans from electric shock
              or to prevent the electronics being damaged by high voltages.
              Signal integrity: The isolator uses proprietary capacitive isolation technology to transmit
              and receive CAN signals. This technology enables more reliable data communications in
              noisy environments, such as high-voltage battery management systems or the drive and
              regeneration systems in EVs and HEVs.
              Performance: The transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the
              automotive industry, supplying the differential transmit and receive capability to a CAN
              protocol controller in a microcontroller. Integrating the galvanic isolation along with the
              transceiver in the TJA1052i removes the need for stand-alone isolation. It also improves
              reliability and system performance parameters such as loop delay.
              The TJA1052i belongs to the third generation of high-speed CAN transceivers from NXP
              Semiconductors, offering significant improvements over first- and second-generation
              devices. It offers improved ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) and ElectroStatic
              Discharge (ESD) performance, and also features ideal passive behavior to the CAN bus
              when the transceiver supply voltage is off.
              The TJA1052i implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. This implementation enables reliable communication in the
              CAN FD fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              The TJA1052i is an excellent choice for all types of automotive and industrial CAN
              networks where isolation is required for safety reasons or to enhance signal integrity in
              noisy environments.

7. Functional description
                   7.1 Operation
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                        During normal operation, the TJA1052i transceiver transmits and receives data via bus
                        lines CANH and CANL (see Figure 1 for the block diagram). The differential receiver
                        converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data, which is output on pin RXD.
                        The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are controlled internally and are
                        optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible EME.
                        The isolator used in the TJA1052i is an AC device that employs on-off keying to
                        guarantee the DC output state at all times. The states of TXD, RXD and the CAN bus at
                        start-up, shut-down and during normal operation are described in Table 5.
                        Care should be taken regarding power sequencing if the device is used in networks that
                        support remote wake-up (see Section 12 ‚ÄúApplication information‚Äù).

                                                                                                    an unpowered state

                7.1.2 Standby mode
                        The TJA1052i cannot transmit or receive regular CAN messages in Standby mode. Only
                        the isolator and low-power CAN receiver are active, monitoring the bus lines for activity.
                        The bus wake-up filter ensures that only bus dominant and bus recessive states that
                        persist longer than tfltr(wake)bus are reflected on the RXD pin (see Figure 3). To reduce
                        current consumption, the CAN bus is terminated to GND and not biased to VDD2/2 as in
                        Normal mode.
                        Standby mode is selected by setting pin STB HIGH. The TJA1052i also switches to
                        Standby mode when an undervoltage is detected on VDD2 (Vuvd(swoff)(VDD2) < VDD2 <
                        Vuvd(stb)(VDD2); Section 7.2.3). An internal pull-up ensures that Standby mode is selected
                        by default when pin STB is not connected.
                         In Standby mode:

                           The isolation function of the TJA1052i is not disabled in Standby mode. Overall quiescent
                           current is not reduced significantly in this mode. The TJA1052i is not designed to support
                           CAN bus wake-up functionality with very low quiescent currents.

                   7.2 Fail-safe features
                7.2.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                           A ‚ÄòTXD dominant time-out‚Äô timer is started when pin TXD goes LOW. If the LOW state on
                           TXD persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus lines
                           to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application failure
                           from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                           communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset by a positive edge on TXD.
                           The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 40 kbit/s.
                7.2.2 Bus dominant time-out function
                           In Standby mode, a 'bus dominant time-out' timer is started when the CAN bus changes
                           from recessive to dominant state. If the dominant state on the bus persists for longer than
                           tto(dom)bus, the RXD pin is forced HIGH. This prevents a clamped dominant bus (due to a
                           bus short-circuit or a failure in one of the other nodes on the network) generating a
                           permanent wake-up request. The bus dominant time-out timer is reset when the CAN bus
                           changes from dominant to recessive state.
                7.2.3 Undervoltage protection: VDD2
                           If the voltage on pin VDD2 falls below the standby threshold, Vuvd(stb)(VDD2), the transceiver
                           switches to Standby mode. The TJA1052i will remain in Standby mode until VDD2 rises
                           above Vuvd(stb)(VDD2) (max). The low-power receiver continues to monitor the bus while the
                           TJA1052i is in Standby mode. Data on the bus is still reflected onto RXD, but the transfer
                           speed is reduced.
                           If the voltage on VDD2 falls below the switch-off threshold, Vuvd(swoff)(VDD2), the transceiver

                                                                                          Galvanically isolated high-speed CAN transceiver
                    7.2.4 Undervoltage protection: VDD1
                             If the voltage on pin VDD1 falls below the undervoltage detection threshold, Vuvd(VDD1), the
                             CAN bus switches to dominant state and the TXD dominant timeout timer is started. RXD
                             will not go high again until the supply voltage has been restored on VDD1 (VDD1 >
                             Vuvd(VDD1)).
                    7.2.5 Overtemperature protection
                             The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                             temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), the output drivers are
                             disabled. They are enabled again when the virtual junction temperature falls below Tj(sd)
                             and TXD is HIGH. Including the TXD condition ensures that output driver oscillation due to
                             temperature drift is avoided.

12. Application information
                     Isolated CAN applications are becoming increasingly common in electric and hybrid
                     electric vehicles. The TJA1052i is the ideal solution in applications that require an isolated

                     level shifting. The device can also be used to isolate high-voltage on-demand pumps and
                     motors in belt elimination projects.
                     If the TJA1052i is used in a HS-CAN network that supports remote bus wake-up, the
                     power-down sequence of the supplies must be managed properly to avoid a dominant
                     pulse on the CAN bus. VDD2 should pass the minimum undervoltage threshold
                     (Vuvd(stb)(VDD2) (min)) before VDD1 falls below its maximum undervoltage detection
                     threshold (Vuvd(VDD1)(max)). Power-up sequencing can happen in any order.
                     Digital inputs and outputs are 3 V compliant, allowing the TJA1052i to interface directly
                     with 3 V and 5 V microcontrollers.

                     All input and output pins are protected against ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under
                     normal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as
                     described in JESD625-A or equivalent standards.
16. Soldering of SMD packages
                     This text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account
                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 ‚ÄúSurface mount reflow
                     soldering description‚Äù.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       ‚Ä¢ Through-hole components
                       ‚Ä¢ Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       ‚Ä¢  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       ‚Ä¢  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       ‚Ä¢  Package placement
                       ‚Ä¢  Inspection and repair
                       ‚Ä¢  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       ‚Ä¢ Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave

                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       ‚Ä¢ Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 11) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       ‚Ä¢ Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       ‚Ä¢ Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 13 and 14

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 11.
