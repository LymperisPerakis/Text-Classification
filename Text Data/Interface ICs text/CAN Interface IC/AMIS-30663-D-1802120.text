AMIS-30663
High Speed CAN
Transceiver
Introduction
  The AMIS−30663 CAN transceiver is the interface between a
controller area network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical                                  http://onsemi.com
bus and may be used in both 12 V and 24 V systems. The digital
interface level is powered from a 3.3 V supply providing true I/O
voltage levels for 3.3 V CAN controllers.                                                           PIN ASSIGNMENT
  The transceiver provides differential transmit capability to the bus
                                                                                                       1

8. All surface mount (SMD) packages are moisture sensitive. Depending upon the moisture content, the maximum temperature (with respect
    to time) and body size of the package, there is a risk that internal or external package cracks may occur due to vaporization of the moisture
    in them (the so called popcorn effect). For details, refer to the drypack information in the “Data Handbook IC26; Integrated Circuit Packages;
    Section: Packing Methods.”
9. These packages are not suitable for wave soldering as a solder joint between the PCB and heatsink (at bottom version) can not be achieved,
    and as solder may stick to the heatsink (on top version).
10. If wave soldering is considered, then the package must be placed at a 45° angle to the solder wave direction. The package footprint must
    incorporate solder thieves downstream and at the side corners.
11. Wave soldering is only suitable for LQFP, TQFP and QFP packages with a pitch (e) equal to or larger than 0.8 mm; it is definitely not suitable
    for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.65 mm.
12. Wave soldering is only suitable for SSOP and TSSOP packages with a pitch (e) equal to or larger than 0.65 mm; it is definitely not suitable
    for packages with a pitch (e) equal to or smaller than 0.5 mm.
