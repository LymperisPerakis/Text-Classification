General Description                                                   Features
The MAX3053 interfaces between the control area network               ●● ±80V Fault Protection
(CAN) protocol controller and the physical wires of the bus           ●● Three Operating Modes
lines in a CAN. It is primarily intended for industrial systems           • High-Speed Operation up to 2Mbps
requiring data rates up to 2Mbps and features ±80V fault
                                                                          • Slope Control Mode to Reduce EMI
protection against shorts to high-voltage power buses. The
                                                                             (40kbps to 500kbps)
device provides differential transmit capability to the bus
and differential receive capability to the CAN controller.            ●● 15μA Low-Current Shutdown Mode
The MAX3053 has three different modes of operation:                   ●● Autoshutdown when Device Is Inactive
high-speed, slope control, and shutdown. High-speed                   ●● Automatic Wakeup from Shutdown
mode allows data rates up to 2Mbps. In slope control
                                                                      ●● Thermal Shutdown
mode, data rates are between 40kbps and 500kbps so
the effects of EMI are reduced and unshielded twisted                 ●● Current Limiting
or parallel cable may be used. In shutdown mode, the                  ●● Fully Compatible with the ISO 11898 Standard
transmitter is switched off, and the receiver is switched to
a low-current mode.
An autoshutdown function puts the device in 15μA shut-
down mode when the bus or CAN controller is inactive for              Ordering Information
47ms or greater.

 Recessive
Note 1: As defined by ISOSHDN, bus value is one of two complementary logical values: dominant or recessive. The dominant value
          represents the logical 1 and the recessive represents the logical 0. During the simultaneous transmission of the dominant
          and recessive bits, the resulting bus value is dominant. For MAX3053 values, see the truth table in the Transmitter and
          Receiver sections.
Note 2: The ESD structures do not short out CANH and CANL under an ESD event while -7V < CANH, CANL < +12V.
