NCV7356
Single Wire CAN Transceiver
  The NCV7356 is a physical layer device for a single wire data link
capable of operating with various Carrier Sense Multiple Access
with Collision Resolution (CSMA/CR) protocols such as the Bosch
Controller Area Network (CAN) version 2.0. This serial data link
network is intended for use in applications where high data rate is not                 www.onsemi.com
required and a lower data rate can achieve cost reductions in both the
physical media components and in the microprocessor and/or                                        MARKING DIAGRAMS

Electrical Specification
   All voltages are referenced to ground (GND). Positive                   permanent damage of the device but exceeding any of these
currents flow into the IC. The maximum ratings given in                    limits may do so. Long term exposure to limiting values
the table below are limiting values that do not lead to a                  may affect the reliability of the device.

13. Minimum signal delay time is measured from the TxD voltage threshold to CANH = 1.0 V. t load should be min per the Timing Measurement
    Load Conditions table.
14. Maximum signal delay time is measured from the TxD voltage threshold to CANH = 3.5 V at VBAT = 27 V, CANH = 2.8 V at VBAT = 5.0 V. t load
    should be max per the Timing Measurement Load Conditions table.

17. Maximum signal delay time is measured from the TxD voltage threshold to CANH = 1 V. t load should be max per the Timing Measurement

19. Minimum signal delay time is measured from the TxD voltage threshold to CANH = 3.5 V. t load should be min per the Timing Measurement

20. Receive delay time is measured from the rising / falling edge crossing of the nominal Vih value on CANH to the falling (Vcmos_il_max) / rising
    (Vcmos_ih_min) edge of RxD. This parameter is tested by applying a square wave signal to CANH. The minimum slew rate for the bus rising
    and falling edges is 50 V/ms. The low level on bus is always 0 V. For normal mode and high−speed mode testing the high level on bus is 4 V.
    For HVWU mode testing the high level on bus is VBAT − 2 V. Relaxation of this non−critical parameter from 0.15 ms to 0.10 ms may be addressed
    in future revisions of GMW3089.
21. Tested on 14 Pin package only.

*Bold face items in the Cauer network above, represent the package without the external thermal system. The Bold face items in the Foster network
 are computed by the square root of time constant R(t) = 130 * sqrt(time(sec)). The constant is derived based on the active area of the device
 with silicon and epoxy at the interface of the heat generation.
  The Cauer networks generally have physical                                using circuit simulating tools, whereas Foster networks

*Bold face items in the Cauer network above, represent the package without the external thermal system. The Bold face items in the Foster network
 are computed by the square root of time constant R(t) = 24.4 * sqrt(time(sec)). The constant is derived based on the active area of the device
 with silicon and epoxy at the interface of the heat generation.
  The Cauer networks generally have physical                                using circuit simulating tools, whereas Foster networks
