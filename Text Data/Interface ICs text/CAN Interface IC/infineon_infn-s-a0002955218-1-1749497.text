TLE8250GVIO
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Overview
As a successor to the first generation of HS CAN transceivers, the TLE8250GVIO is fully pin and function
compatible to his predecessor model, the TLE6250GV33. The TLE8250GVIO is optimized to provide an
excellent passive behavior in Power Down mode. This feature makes the TLE8250GVIO extremely suitable for
mixed supply CAN networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, the TLE8250GVIO provides industry leading ESD
robustness together with a very high electromagnetic immunity (EMI). The Infineon Smart Power Technology
SPT allows bipolar and CMOS control circuitry in accordance with DMOS power devices to exist on the same
monolithic circuit. The TLE8250GVIO and the Infineon SPT technology are AEC qualified and tailored to
withstand the harsh conditions of the Automotive Environment.
Two different operation modes, additional Fail Safe features like a TxD time-out and the optimized output
slew rates on the CANH and CANL signals are making the TLE8250GVIO the ideal choice for large CAN networks
with high data rates.

High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Functional Description
4            Functional Description
CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensor and actuators for real-time control
applications. The usage of the Control Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7 layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a CAN
bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes inside the
network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer standards of CAN networks have been developed over the last years. The TLE8250GVIO
is a High Speed CAN transceiver without any dedicated Wake-Up function. High Speed CAN Transceivers
without Wake-Up function are defined by the international standard ISO 11898-2.

TLE8250GVIO
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Functional Description
The TLE8250GVIO is a High Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and
the physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates up to 1 MBit/s. Characteristic for a HS CAN network are the two signal states on the CAN bus: “Dominant”
and “Recessive” (see Figure 3).
The pins CANH and CANL are the interface to the CAN bus and both pins operate as a input and as an output.
The pins RxD and TxD are the interface to the microcontroller. The pin TxD is the serial data input from the CAN
controller, the pin RxD is the serial data output to the CAN controller. As shown in Figure 1, the HS CAN
transceiver TLE8250GVIO has a receive and a transmit unit, allowing the transceiver to send data to the bus
medium and monitor the data from the bus medium at the same time. The HS CAN transceiver TLE8250GVIO
converts the serial data stream available on the transmit data input TxD, into a differential output signal on
CAN bus, provided by the pins CANH and CANL. The receiver stage of the TLE8250GVIO monitors the data on
the CAN bus and converts them to a serial, single ended signal on the RxD output pin. A logical “Low” signal on
the TxD pin creates a “Dominant” signal on the CAN bus, followed by a logical “Low” signal on the RxD pin (see
Figure 3). The feature, broadcasting data to the CAN bus and listening to the data traffic on the CAN bus
simultaneous is essential to support the bit to bit arbitration inside CAN networks.
The voltage levels for HS CAN transceivers are defined by the ISO 11898-2 and the ISO 11898-5 standards. If a
data bit is “Dominant” or “Recessive” depends on the voltage difference between pins CANH and CANL:
VDIFF = VCANH - VCANL.
In comparison to other differential network protocols the differential signal on a CAN network can only be
larger or equal to 0 V. To transmit a “Dominant” signal to the CAN bus the differential signal VDIFF is larger or
equal to 1.5 V. To receive a “Recessive” signal from the CAN bus the differential VDIFF is smaller or equal to 0.5 V.
Partially supplied CAN networks are networks where the CAN bus participants have different power supply
conditions. Some nodes are connected to the power supply, some other nodes are disconnected from the
power supply. Regardless, if the CAN bus participant is supplied or not supplied, each participant connected
to the common bus media must not disturb the communication. The TLE8250GVIO is designed to support
partially supplied networks. In Power Down mode, the receiver input resistors are switched off and the
transceiver input is high resistive.
The voltage level on the digital input TxD and the digital output RxD is determined by the power supply level
at the pin VIO. Depending on voltage level at the VIO pin, the signal levels on the logic pins (NEN, TxD and RxD)
are compatible to microcontrollers with 5 V or 3.3 V I/O supply. Usually the VIO power supply of the transceiver
is connected to same power supply as I/O power supply of the microcontroller.
4.2            Operation Modes
Two different operation modes are available on TLE8250GVIO. Each mode with specific characteristics in
terms of quiescent current or data transmission. For the mode selection the digital input pin NEN is used.
Figure 4 illustrates the different mode changes depending on the status of the NEN pin. After suppling VCC and
VIO to the HS CAN transceiver, the TLE8250GVIO starts in Stand-By mode. The internal pull-up resistor is setting
the TLE8250GVIO to Stand-By per default. If the microcontroller is up and running the TLE8250GVIO can
change to operation mode within the time for mode change tMode.

4.3          Normal Operation Mode
In Normal Operation mode the HS CAN transceiver TLE8250GVIO sends the serial data stream on the TxD pin
to the CAN bus while at the same time the data available on the CAN bus are monitored to the RxD pin. In
Normal Operation mode all functions of the TLE8250GVIO are active:
•   The output driver stage is active and drives data from the TxD to the CAN bus.
•   The receiver unit is active and provides the data from the CAN bus to the RxD pin.
•   The bus basing is set to VCC/2.
•   The under-voltage monitoring on the power supply VCC and on the power supply VIO is active.

TLE8250GVIO
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Functional Description
To enter the Normal Operation mode set the pin NEN to logical “Low” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The NEN pin
has an internal pull-up resistors to the power-supply VIO.
4.4           Stand-By Mode
Stand-By mode is an idle mode of the TLE8250GVIO with optimized power consumption. In Stand-By mode
the TLE8250GVIO can not send or receive any data. The output driver stage and the normal receiver unit are
disabled. Both CAN bus pins, CANH and CANL are floating.
•   The output driver stage is disabled.
•   The receiver unit is disabled.
•   The bus basing is floating.
•   The under-voltage monitoring on the power supply VCC and on the power supply VIO is active.
To enter the Stand-By mode set the pin NEN to logical “High” (see Table 2 or Figure 4). The NEN pin has an
internal pull-up resistor to the power-supply VIO. In case the Stand-By mode will not be used in the application,
the NEN pin needs to get connected to GND.
4.5           Power Down
Power Down mode means the TLE8250GVIO is not supplied. In Power Down the differential input resistors of
the receiver stage are switched off. The CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE8250GVIO acts as an high
impedance input with a very small leakage current. The high ohmic input doesn’t influence the “Recessive”
level of the CAN network and allows an optimized EME performance of the whole CAN network.

Fail Safe Functions
5             Fail Safe Functions
5.1           Short circuit protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short-circuit-proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device is heating up due to a continuos
short on CANH or CANL, the internal over-temperature protection switches off the bus transmitter.
5.2           Open Logic Pins
All logic input pins have internal pull-up resistor to VIO. In case the VIO supply is activated and the logical pins
are open or floating, the TLE8250GVIO enters into the Stand-By mode per default. In Stand-By mode the
output driver stage of the TLE8250GVIO is disabled, the bus biasing is shut off and the HS CAN TLE8250GVIO
transceiver will not influence the data on the CAN bus.
5.3           TxD Time-Out function
The TxD Time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “Low”. A continuous “Low” signal on the TxD pin can have it’s root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or a short on the printed circuit board for example. In Normal Operation mode, a logical
“Low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD Time-out feature and the TLE8250GVIO
disables the output driver stage (see Figure 5). The receive unit is still active and the data on the bus are still
monitored by the RxD output pin.

Figure 5       TxD Time-Out function
Figure 5 shows the way how the transmission stage is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “Low”
signal on the TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter output stage.
To release the transmitter output stage after a TxD time-out event the TLE8250GVIO requires a signal change
on the TxD input pin from logical “Low” to logical “High”.

5.4           Under-Voltage detection
The HS CAN Transceiver TLE8250GVIO is equipped with an under-voltage detection on the power supply VCC
and the power supply VIO. In case of an under-voltage event on VCC or VIO, the under-voltage detection changes
the operation mode of TLE8250GVIO to the Stand-By mode, regardless to the logical signal on the NEN pin (see
Figure 6).If the transceiver TLE8250GVIO recovers from the under-voltage event, the operation mode returns
to the programmed mode by the NEN pin.

Figure 7      Over-Temperature protection
The TLE8250GVIO has an integrated over-temperature detection to protect the device against thermal
overstress of the output driver stage. In case of an over-temperature event, the temperature sensor will
disable the output driver stage (see Figure 1). After the device cools down the output driver stage is activated
again (see Figure 7). Inside the temperature sensor a hysteresis is implemented.

TLE8250GVIO
High Speed CAN-Transceiver
Application Information
8.2            Output Characteristics of the RxD Pin
The RxD output pin is designed as a push-pull output stage (see Figure 1), meaning to produce a logical “Low”
signal the TLE8250GVIO switches the RxD output to GND. Vice versa to produce a logical “High” signal the
TLE8250GVIO switches the RxD output to VIO.
The level VRXD,H for a logical “High” signal on the RxD output depends on the load at the RxD output pin and
therefore on the RxD output current IRD,H. The voltage level VRxD,H also depends on the voltage of the power
supply VIO. According to the operating range (see Table 4) the power supply VIO can vary between 3.0 V and
5.5 V. At a VIO supply of 5 V the output current of the RxD pin on the TLE8250GVIO is higher as in comparison for
a VIO supply of 3.3 V. For a load against the GND potential, the current IRD,H is flowing out of the RxD output pin.
Similar to the logical “High” signal, the level VRXD,L for a logical “Low” signal on the RxD output pin depends on
the input current IRD,L and the power supply voltage VIO. For a load against the power supply VIO the current IRD,L
is flowing into the RxD output pin.
Currents flowing into the device are marked positive inside the data sheet and currents flowing out of the
device TLE8250GVIO are marked negative inside the data sheet (see Table 6).
The diagram in Figure 11 shows the output current capability of the RxD output pin depended on the chip
temperature TJ at a VIO power supply of 5.0 V. Figure 12 shows the output current capability of the RxD output
pin at a VIO power supply of 3.3 V.
Both diagrams show the output current for a logical “High” level VRxD,H = 4.6 V. The CAN transceiver
TLE8250GVIO provides a logical “High” signal on the RxD output while the signal on the CAN bus is “Recessive”
(see Figure 3):
•    The curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typ. output current; VCC = 5.0 V; VIO =5.0 V;” displays the typical output current
     at the RxD output pin of the TLE8250GVIO (see Figure 11).
     For this graph VCC = 5.0 V and VIO = 5.0 V.
•    The curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typ. output current + 6 sigma; VCC = 5.0 V; VIO =5.0 V;” displays the expected
     maximum value of the output current at the RxD output pin (see Figure 11).
     For this graph VCC = 5.0 V and VIO = 5.0 V.
•    The curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typ. output current - 6 sigma; VCC = 5.0 V; VIO =5.0 V;” displays the expected
     minimum value of the output current at the RxD output pin (see Figure 11).
     For this graph VCC = 5.0 V and VIO = 5.0 V.
•    The curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typ. output current; VCC = 5.0 V; VIO =3.3 V;” displays the typical output current
     at the RxD output pin of the TLE8250GVIO (see Figure 12).
     For this graph VCC = 5.0 V and VIO = 3.3 V.
•    The curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typ. output current + 6 sigma; VCC = 5.0 V; VIO =3.3 V;” displays the expected
     maximum value of the output current at the RxD output pin (see Figure 12).
     For this graph VCC = 5.0 V and VIO = 3.3 V.
•    The curve “VRxD,H = 4.6 V; typ. output current - 6 sigma; VCC = 5.0 V; VIO =3.3 V;” displays the expected
     minimum value of the output current at the RxD output pin (see Figure 12).
     For this graph VCC = 5.0 V and VIO = 3.3 V.
The diagram in Figure 13 and the diagram in Figure 14 show the current capability of the RxD output pin
depended on the chip temperature TJ. Figure 13 shows the current capability of the RxD output pin at a VIO
power supply of 5.0 V and Figure 14 shows the current capability of the RxD output pin at a VIO power supply
of 3.3 V.
Both diagrams show the output current for a logical “Low” level VRxD,H = 0.4 V. The CAN transceiver
TLE8250GVIO provides a logical “Low” signal on the RxD output while the signal on the CAN bus is “Dominant”
(see Figure 3):
