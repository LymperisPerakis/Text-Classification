                  Rev. 6 — 15 January 2018                                          Product data sheet
1. General description
              The TJA1049 high-speed CAN transceiver provides an interface between a Controller
              Area Network (CAN) protocol controller and the physical two-wire CAN bus. The
              transceiver is designed for high-speed CAN applications in the automotive industry,
              supplying the differential transmit and receive capability to (a microcontroller with) a CAN
              protocol controller.
              The TJA1049 belongs to the third generation of high-speed CAN transceivers from NXP
              Semiconductors, offering significant improvements over first- and second-generation
              devices such as the TJA1040. It offers improved ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
              and ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) performance, and also features:
                • Ideal passive behavior to the CAN bus when the supply voltage is off
                • A very low-current Standby mode with bus wake-up capability
                • TJA1049T/3 and TJA1049TK/3 can be interfaced directly to microcontrollers with
                   supply voltages from 3 V to 5 V
              The TJA1049 implements the CAN physical layer as defined in ISO 11898-2:2016 and
              SAE J2284-1 to SAE J2284-5. This implementation enables reliable communication in the
              CAN FD fast phase at data rates up to 5 Mbit/s.
              These features make the TJA1049 an excellent choice for all types of HS-CAN networks,
              in nodes that require a low-power mode with wake-up capability via the CAN bus.

7. Functional description
                       The TJA1049 is a HS-CAN stand-alone transceiver with Standby mode. It combines the
                       functionality of the PCA82C250, PCA82C251 and TJA1040 transceivers with improved
                       EMC and ESD handling capability and quiescent current performance. Improved slope
                       control and high DC handling capability on the bus pins provide additional application
                       flexibility.
                       The TJA1049 is available in two versions, distinguished only by the function of pin 5:
                         • The TJA1049T and TJA1049TK are 100 % backwards compatible with the TJA1040
                            when operating with a 5 V microcontroller, and also cover existing PCA82C250 and
                            PCA82C251 applications
                         • The TJA1049T/3 and TJA1049TK/3 allow for direct interfacing to microcontrollers with
                            supply voltages down to 3 V
                   7.1 Operating modes
                       The TJA1049 supports two operating modes, Normal and Standby, which are selectable
                       via pin STB. See Table 4 for a description of the operating modes under normal supply
                       conditions.

                                                                                                       detected                detected
                7.1.1 Normal mode
                       A LOW level on pin STB selects Normal mode. In this mode, the transceiver can transmit
                       and receive data via the bus lines CANH and CANL (see Figure 1 for the block diagram).
                       The differential receiver converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data which is
                       output on pin RXD. The slopes of the output signals on the bus lines are controlled
                       internally and are optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible EME.
                7.1.2 Standby mode
                       A HIGH level on pin STB selects Standby mode. In Standby mode, the transceiver is not
                       able to transmit or correctly receive data via the bus lines. The transmitter and
                       Normal-mode receiver blocks are switched off to reduce supply current, and only a
                       low-power differential receiver monitors the bus lines for activity. The wake-up filter on the
                       output of the low-power receiver does not latch bus dominant states, but ensures that only
                       bus dominant and bus recessive states that persist longer than tfltr(wake)bus are reflected on
                       pin RXD, as shown in Figure 3.
                       In Standby mode, the bus lines are biased to ground to minimize the system supply
                       current. The low-power receiver is supplied by VIO, and is capable of detecting CAN bus
                       activity even if VIO is the only supply voltage available. When pin RXD goes LOW to signal
                       a wake-up request, a transition to Normal mode will not be triggered until STB is forced
                       LOW.

                7.2.1 TXD dominant time-out function
                       A ‘TXD dominant time-out’ timer is started when pin TXD is set LOW. If the LOW state on
                       pin TXD persists for longer than tto(dom)TXD, the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus
                       lines to recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application
                       failure from driving the bus lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network
                       communications). The TXD dominant time-out timer is reset when pin TXD is set HIGH.
                       The TXD dominant time-out time also defines the minimum possible bit rate of 40 kbit/s.
                7.2.2 Bus dominant time-out function
                       In Standby mode, a 'bus dominant time-out' timer is started when the CAN bus changes
                       from recessive to dominant state. If the dominant state on the bus persists for longer than
                       tto(dom)bus, the RXD pin is forced HIGH. This prevents a clamped dominant bus (due to a
                       bus short-circuit or a failure in one of the other nodes on the network) generating a
                       permanent wake-up request. The bus dominant time-out timer is reset when the CAN bus
                       changes from dominant to recessive state.
                7.2.3 Internal biasing of TXD and STB input pins
                       Pins TXD and STB have internal pull-ups to VIO to ensure a safe, defined state in case
                       one (or both) of these pins is left floating. Pull-up currents flow in these pins in all states;
                       both pins should be held HIGH in Standby mode to minimize standby current.
                7.2.4 Undervoltage detection on pins VCC and VIO
                       Should VCC drop below the VCC undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(VCC), the transceiver
                       will switch to Standby mode. The logic state of pin STB will be ignored until VCC has
                       recovered.
                       Should VIO drop below the VIO undervoltage detection level, Vuvd(VIO), the transceiver will
                       switch off and disengage from the bus (zero load) until VIO has recovered.

                                                                                      High-speed CAN transceiver with Standby mode
                7.2.5 Overtemperature protection
                       The output drivers are protected against overtemperature conditions. If the virtual junction
                       temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature, Tj(sd), the output drivers will be
                       disabled until the virtual junction temperature falls below Tj(sd) and TXD becomes
                       recessive again. Including the TXD condition ensures that output driver oscillation due to
                       temperature drift is avoided.
                   7.3 SPLIT output pin and VIO supply pin
                       Two versions of the TJA1049 are available, only differing in the function of a single pin.
                       Pin 5 is either a SPLIT output pin or a VIO supply pin.
                7.3.1 SPLIT pin
                       Using the SPLIT pin on the TJA1049T or TJA1049TK in conjunction with a split
                       termination network (see Figure 4 and Figure 7) can help to stabilize the recessive voltage
                       level on the bus. This will reduce EME in networks with DC leakage to ground (e.g. from
                       deactivated nodes with poor bus leakage performance). In Normal mode, pin SPLIT
                       delivers a DC output voltage of 0.5VCC. In Standby mode or when VCC is off, pin SPLIT is
                       floating.
                                                                                            VCC
                                                                                             TJA1049
                                                                                                                  CANH

                         Fig 4.   Stabilization circuitry and application for version with SPLIT pin
                7.3.2 VIO supply pin
                       Pin VIO on the TJA1049T/3 and TJA1049TK/3 should be connected to the microcontroller
                       supply voltage (see Figure 8). This will adjust the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and STB
                       to the I/O levels of the microcontroller. Pin VIO also provides the internal supply voltage for
                       the low-power differential receiver of the transceiver. For applications running in
                       low-power mode, this allows the bus lines to be monitored for activity even if there is no
                       supply voltage on pin VCC.
                       For versions of the TJA1049 without a VIO pin, the VIO input is internally connected to VCC.
                       This sets the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD and STB to levels compatible with 5 V
                       microcontrollers.

[1]   Only TJA1049T/3 and TJA1049TK/3 have a VIO pin; in TJA1049T and TJA1049TK, the VIO input is internally connected to VCC.
[2]   All parameters are guaranteed over the virtual junction temperature range by design. Factory testing uses correlated test conditions to
      cover the specified temperature and power supply voltage range.
[3]   VIO = VCC in non-VIO product variants TJA1049T and TJA1049TK.
[4]   Maximum value assumes VCC < VIO; if VCC > VIO, the maximum value will be VCC + 0.3 V.
[5]   Not tested in production; guaranteed by design.
[6]   The test circuit used to measure the bus output voltage symmetry (which includes CSPLIT) is shown in Figure 10.

                     of soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow
                     soldering description”.
                16.1 Introduction to soldering
                     Soldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to
                     Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides both
                     the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method that is
                     ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and
                     Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not
                     suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high
                     densities that come with increased miniaturization.
                16.2 Wave and reflow soldering
                     Wave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from
                     a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:
                       • Through-hole components
                       • Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board
                     Not all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless
                     packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,
                     leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,
                     due to an increased probability of bridging.
                     The reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by
                     component placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,
                     packages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.
                     Key characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:
                       •  Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias
                       •  Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation
                       •  The moisture sensitivity level of the packages
                       •  Package placement
                       •  Inspection and repair
                       •  Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering

                       • Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board
                          transport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are
                          exposed to the wave
                       • Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities
                16.4 Reflow soldering
                     Key characteristics in reflow soldering are:
                       • Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads to
                          higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 13) than a SnPb process, thus
                          reducing the process window
                       • Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process
                          window for a mix of large and small components on one board
                       • Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board is
                          heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak
                          temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste
                          characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the
                          packages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package
                          depends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with
                          Table 9 and 10

                     Moisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all
                     times.
                     Studies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow
                     soldering, see Figure 13.
