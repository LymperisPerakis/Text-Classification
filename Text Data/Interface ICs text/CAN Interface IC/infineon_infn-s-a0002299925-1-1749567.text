Overview
signals to the bus and protects the microcontroller against interferences generated within the network. Based
on the high symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE8251VSJ provides a very low level of
electromagnetic emission (EME) within a wide frequency range.
The TLE8251VSJ fulfills or exceeds the requirements of the ISO11898-2.
The TLE8251VSJ provides a digital supply input VIO and a stand-by mode. It is designed to fulfill the enhanced
physical layer requirements for CAN FD and supports data rates up to 2 MBit/s.
On the basis of a very low leakage current on the HS CAN bus interface the TLE8251VSJ provides an excellent
passive behavior in power-down state. These and other features make the TLE8251VSJ exceptionally suitable
for mixed supply HS CAN networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, the TLE8251VSJ provides excellent ESD immunity
together with a very high electromagnetic immunity (EMI). The TLE8251VSJ and the Infineon SPT technology
are AEC qualified and tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the automotive environment.
Two different operating modes, additional fail-safe features like a TxD time-out and the optimized output slew
rates on the CANH and CANL signals make the TLE8251VSJ the ideal choice for large HS CAN networks with
high data transmission rates.

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional Description
4            Functional Description
HS CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within
the network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer standards of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The TLE8251VSJ is a
High Speed CAN transceiver with a dedicated bus wake-up function and defined by the international standard
ISO 11898-5.

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional Description
The TLE8251VSJ is a High-Speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and
the physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates for CAN FD frames up to 2 MBit/s. Characteristic for HS CAN networks are the two signal states on the
HS CAN bus: dominant and recessive (see Figure 3).
VCC, VIO and GND are the supply pins for the TLE8251VSJ. The pins CANH and CANL are the interface to the
HS CAN bus and operate in both directions, as an input and as an output. RxD and TxD pins are the interface
to the CAN controller, the TxD pin is an input pin and the RxD pin is an output pin. The STB pin is the input pin
for mode selection (see Figure 4).
By setting the TxD input pin to logical “low” the transmitter of the TLE8251VSJ drives a dominant signal to the
CANH and CANL pins. Setting TxD input to logical “high” turns off the transmitter and the output voltage on
CANH and CANL discharges towards the recessive level. The recessive output voltage is provided by the bus
biasing (see Figure 1). The output of the transmitter is considered to be dominant, when the voltage difference
between CANH and CANL is greater than 1.5 V (VDiff = VCANH - VCANL).
Parallel to the transmitter the normal-mode receiver monitors the signal on the CANH and CANL pins and
indicates it on the RxD output pin. A dominant signal on the CANH and CANL pins sets the RxD output pin to
logical “low”, vice versa a recessive signal sets the RxD output to logical “high”. The normal-mode receiver
considers a voltage difference (VDiff) between CANH and CANL above 0.9 V as dominant and below 0.5 V as
recessive.
To conform with HS CAN features, like the bit to bit arbitration, the signal on the RxD output has to follow the
signal on the TxD input within a defined loop delay tLoop ≤ 255 ns.
The thresholds of the digital inputs (TxD and STB) and of the RxD output voltage are adapted to the digital
power supply VIO.

Figure 4       Mode state diagram
4.2.1         Normal-operating Mode
In normal-operating mode the transmitter and the receiver of the HS CAN transceiver TLE8251VSJ are active
(see Figure 1). The HS CAN transceiver sends the serial data stream on the TxD input pin to the CAN bus. The
data on the CAN bus is displayed at the RxD pin simultaneously. A logical “low” signal on the STB pin selects
the normal-operating mode, while the transceiver is supplied by VCC and VIO (see Table 2 for details).
4.2.2         Stand-by Mode
The stand-by mode is an idle mode of the TLE8251VSJ with optimized power consumption. In stand-by mode
the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off. The TLE8251VSJ cannot send any data to the
CAN bus nor receive any data from the CAN bus.
The low-power receiver is connected to the bus lines. Wake-up signals are indicated on the RxD output pin. An
additional filter, implemented inside the low-power receiver, ensures that only dominant and recessive”
signals on the CAN bus, which are longer than the CAN activity filter time tFilter, are indicated at the RxD output
pin (see Figure 8).
A logical “high” signal on the STB pin selects the stand-by mode, while the transceiver is supplied by the digital
supply VIO (see Table 2 for details).
In stand-by mode the bus input pins are biased to GND via the receiver input resistors Ri.
Undervoltage detection on the transmitter supply VCC is turned off, allowing to switch off the VCC supply in
stand-by mode.

4.3          Power-up and Undervoltage Condition
When detecting an undervoltage event, either on the transmitter supply VCC or the digital supply VIO, the
transceiver TLE8251VSJ changes the mode of operation. Turning off the digital power supply VIO, the
transceiver powers down and remains in the power-down state. While switching off the transmitter supply VCC,
the transceiver either changes to the forced stand-by mode, or remains in stand-by mode (details see
Figure 5).

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional Description
4.3.1        Power-down State
Independent of the transmitter supply VCC and of the STB input pin, the TLE8251VSJ is in power-down state
when the digital supply voltage VIO is turned off (see Figure 5).
In power-down state the input resistors of the receiver are disconnected from the bus biasing VCC/2. The CANH
and CANL bus interface of the TLE8251VSJ is floating and acts as a high-impedance input with a very low
leakage current. The high-ohmic input does not influence the recessive level of the CAN network and allows
an optimized EME performance of the entire HS CAN network (see also Table 2).
4.3.2        Forced Stand-by Mode
The forced stand-by mode is a fail-safe mode to avoid any disturbance on the HS CAN bus during loss of the
transmitter supply VCC.
In forced stand-by mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off and therefore the
transceiver TLE8251VSJ can not disturb the bus media.
Similar to stand-by mode, the low-power receiver is connected to the bus lines and wake-up signals on the
CAN bus are indicated at the RxD output pin (see Figure 8).
In forced stand-by mode the bus is also biased to GND (details see Table 2) via the receiver input resistors.
Forced stand-by mode can only be entered when the transmitter supply VCC is not available, either by
powering up the digital supply VIO only or by turning off the transmitter supply in normal-operating mode.
While the transceiver TLE8251VSJ is in forced stand-by mode, switching the STB input pin to logical “high”
triggers a mode change to stand-by mode (see Figure 5).
4.3.3        Power-up
The HS CAN transceiver TLE8251VSJ powers up if at least the digital supply VIO is connected to the device. By
default the device powers up in stand-by mode, due to the internal pull-up resistor on the STB pin to VIO.
In case the device is to power-up to normal-operating mode, the STB pin needs to be pulled active to logical
“low” and the supplies VIO and VCC have to be connected.
By supplying only the digital power supply VIO the TLE8251VSJ powers up either in forced stand-by mode or
stand-by mode, depending on the signal of the STB input pin (see Figure 5).

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional Description
4.3.4          Undervoltage on the Digital Supply VIO
If the voltage on VIO supply input falls below the threshold VIO < VIO(UV,F), the transceiver TLE8251VSJ powers
down and changes to power-down state.
Undervoltage detection on the digital supply VIO has the highest priority. It is independent of the transmitter
supply VCC and also independent of the currently selected operating mode. Any undervoltage event on VIO
powers down the TLE8251VSJ.

High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional Description
4.3.5         Undervoltage on the Transmitter Supply VCC
In case the transmitter supply VCC falls below the threshold VCC < VCC(UV,F), the transceiver TLE8251VSJ changes
the mode of operation to forced stand-by mode. The transmitter and also the normal-mode receiver of the
TLE8251VSJ are powered by the VCC supply. In case of insufficient VCC supply, the TLE8251VSJ can neither
transmit the CANH and CANL signals correctly to the bus, nor can it receive them properly. Therefore the
TLE8251VSJ blocks the transmitter and the receiver in forced stand-by mode. The low-power receiver is active
in forced stand-by mode (see Figure 7).
Undervoltage detection on the transmitter supply VCC is only active in normal-operating mode (see Figure 5).

4.3.6         Voltage Adaption to the Microcontroller Supply
The HS CAN transceiver TLE8251VSJ has two different power supplies, VCC and VIO. The power supply VCC
supplies the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver. The power supply VIO supplies the digital input and
output buffers, the low-power receiver and the wake-up logic. It is also the main power domain for the internal
logic.
To adjust the digital input and output levels of the TLE8251VSJ to the I/O levels of the external microcontroller,
connect the power supply VIO to the microcontroller I/O supply voltage (see Figure 14).
Note:         In case the digital supply voltage VIO is not required in the application, connect the digital supply
              voltage VIO to the transmitter supply VCC.

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional Description
4.4               Remote Wake-up
The TLE8251VSJ has a remote wake-up feature, also called bus wake-up feature. In both stand-by mode and
forced stand-by mode, the low-power receiver monitors the activity on the CAN bus and in case it detects a
wake-up signal, the TLE8251VSJ indicates the wake-up signal on the RxD output pin.
While entering stand-by mode, the RxD output pin is set to logical “high”, regardless of the signal on the CAN
bus. The low-power receiver of the TLE8251VSJ requires a signal change from recessive to dominant on the
CAN bus before the RxD output is enabled to follow the signals on the HS CAN bus.
HS CAN bus signals, dominant or recessive, with a pulse width above the CAN activity filter time t > tFilter are
indicated on the RxD output pin. Glitches with a pulse width below the CAN activity filter time t < tFilter are
ignored and not considered a valid wake-up signal. The RxD output reacts within the reaction time tWU_Rec after
detecting a wake-up signal (see Figure 8).
Note:             A wake-up event on the CAN bus is only indicated on the RxD output, no automatic change of the
                  operating mode is applied. To enter normal-operating mode, the external microcontroller needs to
                  change the signal on the STB pin.
The wake-up logic is supplied by the power supply VIO (see Figure 1). In case the TLE8251VSJ is in stand-by
mode the power supply VCC can be turned off, while the TLE8251VSJ is still able to detect a wake-up signal on
the HS CAN bus (see also Figure 4).

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Fail Safe Functions
5             Fail Safe Functions
5.1           Short Circuit Protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short circuit proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damage. If the device is heating up due to a continuous
short on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus transmitter.
5.2           Unconnected Logic Pins
All logic input pins have an internal pull-up resistor to VIO. In case VIO supply is activated and the logic pins are
open, the TLE8251VSJ enters stand-by mode by default. In stand-by mode the transmitter of the TLE8251VSJ
is disabled, the bus bias is turned off and the input resistors of CANH and CANL are connected to GND.
5.3           TxD Time-out Function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example. In normal-operating mode, a
logical “low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out feature and the TLE8251VSJ
disables the transmitter (see Figure 9). The receiver is still active and the the RxD output continues monitoring
data on the bus.

Figure 9       TxD time-out function
Figure 9 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the
TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter
after a TxD time-out event the TLE8251VSJ requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to
logical “high”.

5.4          Overtemperature Protection
The integrated overtemperature detection protects the TLE8251VSJ against thermal overstress of the
transmitter. Overtemperature protection is active in normal-operating mode and disabled in stand-by mode.
In overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor disables the transmitter (see Figure 1) while the
transceiver remains in normal-operating mode.
After the device has cooled down the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 10). A hysteresis is
implemented within the temperature sensor.

5.5          Delay Time for Mode Change
The HS CAN transceiver TLE8251VSJ changes the mode of operation within the time window tMode. During the
mode change the RxD output pin is permanently set to logical “high” and does not reflect the status on the
CANH and CANL input pins.
While changing the mode of operation from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode, the transceiver
TLE8251VSJ turns off the transmitter and switches from the normal-mode receiver to the low-power receiver.
After the mode change is completed, the transceiver TLE8251VSJ releases the RxD output pin (see as an
example Figure 16 and Figure 17).

Note:          Stresses above the ones listed here may cause permanent damage to the device. Exposure to
              absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability. Integrated
              protection functions are designed to prevent IC destruction under fault conditions described in the
              data sheet. Fault conditions are considered as “outside” normal-operating range. Protection
              functions are not designed for continuos repetitive operation.

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Application Information
Mode changes are triggered by the STB pin when the device TLE8251VSJ is fully supplied. Setting the STB pin
to logical “low” changes the mode of operation to normal-operating mode:
•   The mode change is executed independently of the signal on the HS CAN bus. The CANH, CANL inputs may
    be either dominant or recessive. They can be also permanently shorted to GND or VCC.
•   A mode change is performed independently of the signal on the TxD input. The TxD input may be either
    logical “high” or “low”.
Analog to that, changing the STB input pin to logical “high” changes the mode of operation to the stand-by
mode, independent on the signals at the CANH, CANL and TxD pins.
Note:         In case the TxD signal is “low” setting the STB input pin to logical “low” changes the operating mode
              of the device to normal-operating mode and drives a dominant signal to the HS CAN bus.
Note:         The TxD time-out is only effective in normal-operating mode. The TxD time-out timer starts when the
              TLE8251VSJ enters normal-operating mode and the TxD input is set to logical “low”.

TLE8251V
High Speed CAN Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Application Information
8.3.1           Mode Change to Stand-by Mode during a dominant Bus Signal
Figure 15 shows an example of mode change from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode while the signal
on the HS CAN bus is dominant.
During the mode transition time tMode, the TLE8251VSJ blocks the RxD output and provides a logical “high” on
the RxD output pin. The internal receiver switches from the normal-mode receiver to the low-power receiver,
while changing from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode.
After entering stand-by mode the TLE8251VSJ continues to indicate a “high” signal on the RxD output as long
as the HS CAN bus remains dominant. The permanent dominant bus signal is not considered a wake-up event
and is therefore not indicated on the RxD output pin.
Detecting the first signal change from recessive to dominant on the HS CAN bus releases the internal wake-up
logic. Within the wake-up reaction time tWU_Rec, a recessive CAN bus signal is indicated on the RxD output pin
by a logical “high” signal and a dominant CAN bus signal is indicated by a logical “low” signal, as long as the
pulse width of the HS CAN bus signals exceeds CAN activity filter time t > tFilter.
Entering stand-by mode while the HS CAN bus signal is recessive, a release of the internal wake-up logic is not
necessary and a dominant wake-up signal (t > tFilter) on the HS CAN bus is indicated on the RxD output pin
within the wake-up reaction time tWU_Rec (compare to Figure 8).
          Note: The “dominant” signal on the HS CAN bus is set by another HS CAN bus subscriber.

Application Information
8.3.2        Mode Change from Stand-by Mode to Normal-operating Mode
8.3.2.1      Mode Change while the TxD Signal is “low”
Figure 16 shows an example of mode change to normal-operating mode while the TxD input is logical “low”.
The HS CAN signal is recessive, assuming all other HS CAN bus subscribers are also sending a recessive bus
signal.
While the TLE8251VSJ is in stand-by mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off. In
stand-by mode the low-power receiver is active. The TLE8251VSJ drives no signal to the HS CAN bus, the RxD
output is connected to the low-power receiver and follows only the HS_CAN bus signals when its pulse width
exceeds CAN activity filter time tFilter. Changing the STB to logical “low” turns the mode of operation to normal-
operating mode, while the TxD input signal remains logical “low”. The transmitter and the normal-mode
receiver remain disabled until the mode transition is completed. During the mode transition the RxD output is
blocked and set to logical “high”. In normal-operating mode the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver
are active. The “low” signal on the TxD input drives a dominant signal to the HS CAN bus and the RxD output
becomes logical “low” following the dominant signal on the HS CAN bus.
Changing the STB pin back to logical “high”, disables the transmitter and normal-mode receiver again. The
RxD output pin is blocked and set to logical “high” with the start of the mode transition. The TxD input and the
transmitter are blocked and the HS CAN bus becomes recessive.
                  Note: The signals on the HS CAN bus are “recessive”, the “dominant” signal is
                         generated by the TxD input signal

stand-by mode the low-power receiver is active. The TLE8251VSJ drives no signal to the HS CAN bus, the RxD
output is connected to the low-power receiver and follows only the HS_CAN bus signals when its pulse width
exceeds the bus wake-up time tWU. Changing the STB to logical “low” turns the mode of operation to normal-
operating mode, while the TxD input signal remains logical “high”. The transmitter and the normal-mode
receiver remain disabled until the mode transition is completed. During the mode transition the RxD output is
blocked and set to logical “high”. In normal-operating mode the normal-mode receiver is active and the RxD
output follows the dominant signal on the HS CAN bus by indicating a logical “low” signal.
Changing the STB pin back to logical “high”, disables the transmitter and normal-mode receiver again. The
RxD output pin is blocked and set to logical “high” with the start of the mode transition. The low-power
receiver is active in stand-by mode. The RxD output signal remains “high” as long as the HS CAN bus remains
dominant. Only if the HS CAN bus changes to a recessive signal exceeding CAN activity filter time tFilter, the RxD
output follows the bus signal within wake-up reaction time tWU_Rec (see also Chapter 8.3.1).
          Note: The “dominant” signal on the HS CAN bus is set by another HS CAN bus subscriber.
