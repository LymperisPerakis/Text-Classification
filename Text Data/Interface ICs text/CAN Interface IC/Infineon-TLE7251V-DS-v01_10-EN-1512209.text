TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Overview
Description
The TLE7251V is a transceiver designed for HS CAN networks in automotive and industrial applications. As an
interface between the physical bus layer and the CAN protocol controller, the TLE7251V drives the signals to
the bus and protects the microcontroller against interferences generated within the network. Based on the
high symmetry of the CANH and CANL signals, the TLE7251V provides a very low level of electromagnetic
emission (EME) within a wide frequency range.
The TLE7251V is available in a small, leadless PG-TSON-8 package and in a PG-DSO-8 package. Both packages
are RoHS compliant and halogen free. Additionally the PG-TSON-8 package supports the solder joint
requirements for automated optical inspection (AOI). The TLE7251VLE and the TLE7251VSJ are fulfilling or
exceeding the requirements of the ISO11898-2.
The TLE7251V provides a digital supply input VIO and a stand-by mode. It is designed to fulfill the enhanced
physical layer requirements for CAN FD and supports data rates up to 2 MBit/s.
On the basis of a very low leakage current on the HS CAN bus interface the TLE7251V provides an excellent
passive behavior in power-down state. These and other features make the TLE7251V exceptionally suitable for
mixed supply HS CAN networks.
Based on the Infineon Smart Power Technology SPT, the TLE7251V provides excellent ESD immunity together
with a very high electromagnetic immunity (EMI). The TLE7251V and the Infineon SPT technology are
AEC qualified and tailored to withstand the harsh conditions of the automotive environment.
Two different operating modes, additional fail-safe features like a TxD time-out and the optimized output slew
rates on the CANH and CANL signals make the TLE7251V the ideal choice for large HS CAN networks with high
data transmission rates.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional description
4            Functional description
HS CAN is a serial bus system that connects microcontrollers, sensors and actuators for real-time control
applications. The use of the Controller Area Network (abbreviated CAN) within road vehicles is described by
the international standard ISO 11898. According to the 7-layer OSI reference model the physical layer of a
HS CAN bus system specifies the data transmission from one CAN node to all other available CAN nodes within
the network. The physical layer specification of a CAN bus system includes all electrical and mechanical
specifications of a CAN network. The CAN transceiver is part of the physical layer specification. Several
different physical layer standards of CAN networks have been developed in recent years. The TLE7251V is a
high speed CAN transceiver with a dedicated bus wake-up function and defined by the international standard
ISO 11898-5.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional description
The TLE7251V is a high speed CAN transceiver, operating as an interface between the CAN controller and the
physical bus medium. A HS CAN network is a two wire, differential network which allows data transmission
rates for CAN FD frames up to 2 MBit/s. Characteristic for HS CAN networks are the two signal states on the
HS CAN bus: “dominant” and “recessive” (see Figure 3).
VCC, VIO and GND are the supply pins for the TLE7251V. The pins CANH and CANL are the interface to the HS CAN
bus and operate in both directions, as an input and as an output. RxD and TxD pins are the interface to the CAN
controller, the TxD pin is an input pin and the RxD pin is an output pin. The STB pin is the input pin for the mode
selection (see Figure 4).
By setting the TxD input pin to logical “low” the transmitter of the TLE7251V drives a “dominant” signal to the
CANH and CANL pins. Setting TxD input to logical “high” turns off the transmitter and the output voltage on
CANH and CANL discharges towards the “recessive” level. The “recessive” output voltage is provided by the
bus biasing (see Figure 1). The output of the transmitter is considered to be “dominant”, when the voltage
difference between CANH and CANL is at least higher than 1.5 V (VDiff = VCANH - VCANL).
Parallel to the transmitter the normal-mode receiver monitors the signal on the CANH and CANL pins and
indicates it on the RxD output pin. A “dominant” signal on the CANH and CANL pins sets the RxD output pin to
logical “low”, vice versa a “recessive” signal sets the RxD output to logical “high”. The normal-mode receiver
considers a voltage difference (VDiff) between CANH and CANL above 0.9 V as “dominant” and below 0.5 V as
“recessive”.
To be conform with HS CAN features, like the bit to bit arbitration, the signal on the RxD output has to follow
the signal on the TxD input within a defined loop delay tLoop ≤ 255 ns.
The thresholds of the digital inputs (TxD and STB) and also the RxD output voltage are adapted to the digital
power supply VIO.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional description
4.2           Modes of operation
The TLE7251V supports two different modes of operation, stand-by mode and normal-operating mode while
the transceiver is supplied according to the specified functional range. The mode of operation is selected by
the STB input pin (see Figure 4).
                                                        stand-by mode
                           VCC = “don’t care”

                                            STB = 0                       STB = 1
                                                       normal-operating
                           VCC > VCC(UV,R)                   mode
                           VIO > VIO(UV,R)
                                                            STB = 0
Figure 4      Mode state diagram
4.2.1         Normal-operating mode
In normal-operating mode the transmitter and the receiver of the HS CAN transceiver TLE7251V are active (see
Figure 1). The HS CAN transceiver sends the serial data stream on the TxD input pin to the CAN bus. The data
on the CAN bus is displayed at the RxD pin simultaneously. A logical “low” signal on the STB pin selects the
normal-operating mode, while the transceiver is supplied by VCC and VIO (see Table 2 for details).
4.2.2         Stand-by mode
The stand-by mode is an idle mode of the TLE7251V with optimized power consumption. In stand-by mode the
transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off. The TLE7251V can not send any data to the CAN bus
nor receive any data from the CAN bus.
The low-power receiver is connected to the bus lines. Wake-up signals are indicated on the RxD output pin. An
additional filter, implemented inside the low-power receiver, ensures that only “dominant” and recessive”
signals on the CAN bus, which are longer than the CAN activity filter time tFilter, are indicated at the RxD output
pin (see Figure 8).
A logical “high” signal on the STB pin selects the stand-by mode, while the transceiver is supplied by the digital
supply VIO (see Table 2 for details).
In stand-by mode the bus input pins are biased to GND via the receiver input resistors Ri.
The undervoltage detection on the transmitter supply VCC is turned off, allowing to switch off the VCC supply in
stand-by mode.

Functional description
4.3          Power-up and undervoltage condition
By detecting an undervoltage event, either on the transmitter supply VCC or the digital supply VIO, the
transceiver TLE7251V changes the mode of operation. Turning off the digital power supply VIO, the transceiver
powers down and remains in the power-down state. While switching off the transmitter supply VCC, the
transceiver either changes to the forced stand-by mode, or remains in stand-by mode (details see Figure 5).

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional description
4.3.1         Power-down state
Independent of the transmitter supply VCC and of the STB input pin, the TLE7251V is in power-down state when
the digital supply voltage VIO is turned off (see Figure 5).
In the power-down state the input resistors of the receiver are disconnected from the bus biasing VCC/2. The
CANH and CANL bus interface of the TLE7251V is floating and acts as a high-impedance input with a very small
leakage current. The high-ohmic input does not influence the “recessive” level of the CAN network and allows
an optimized EME performance of the entire HS CAN network (see also Table 2).
4.3.2         Forced stand-by mode
The forced stand-by mode is a fail-safe mode to avoid any disturbance on the HS CAN bus, while the TLE7251V
faces a loss of the transmitter supply VCC.
In forced stand-by mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned off and therefore the
transceiver TLE7251V can not disturb the bus media.
Similar to the stand-by mode, the low-power receiver is connected to the bus lines and wake-up signals on the
CAN bus are indicated at the RxD output pin (see Figure 8).
In forced stand-by mode the bus is also biased to GND (details see Table 2) via the receiver input resistors.
The forced stand-by mode can only be entered when the transmitter supply VCC is not available, either by
powering up the digital supply VIO only or by turning off the transmitter supply in normal-operating mode.
While the transceiver TLE7251V is in forced stand-by mode, switching the STB input pin to logical “high”
triggers a mode change to stand-by mode (see Figure 5).
4.3.3         Power-up
The HS CAN transceiver TLE7251V powers up if at least the digital supply VIO is connected to the device. By
default the device powers up in stand-by mode, due to the internal pull-up resistor on the STB pin to VIO.
In case the device needs to power-up to normal-operating mode, the STB pin needs to be pulled active to
logical “low” and the supplies VIO and VCC have to be connected.
By supplying only the digital power supply VIO the TLE7251V powers up either in forced stand-by mode or
stand-by mode, depending on the signal of the STB input pin. (see Figure 5).

4.3.4          Undervoltage on the digital supply VIO
If the voltage on VIO supply input falls below the threshold VIO < VIO(UV,F), the transceiver TLE7251V powers down
and changes to the power-down state.
The undervoltage detection on the digital supply VIO has the highest priority. It is independent of the
transmitter supply VCC and also independent of the currently selected operating mode. An undervoltage event
on VIO always powers down the TLE7251V.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional description
4.3.5         Undervoltage on the transmitter supply VCC
In case the transmitter supply VCC falls below the threshold VCC < VCC(UV,F), the transceiver TLE7251V changes
the mode of operation to forced stand-by mode. The transmitter and also the normal-mode receiver of the
TLE7251V are powered by the VCC supply. In case of an insufficient VCC supply, the TLE7251V can neither
transmit the CANH and CANL signals correctly to the bus, nor can it receive them properly. Therefore the
TLE7251V blocks the transmitter and the receiver in forced stand-by mode. The low-power receiver is active
in forced stand-by mode (see Figure 7).
The undervoltage detection on the transmitter supply VCC is only active in normal-operating mode (see
Figure 5).

4.3.6         Voltage adaption to the microcontroller supply
The HS CAN transceiver TLE7251V has two different power supplies, VCC and VIO. The power supply VCC supplies
the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver. The power supply VIO supplies the digital input and output
buffers, the low-power receiver, the wake-up logic and it is also the main power domain for the internal logic.
To adjust the digital input and output levels of the TLE7251V to the I/O levels of the external microcontroller,
connect the power supply VIO to the microcontroller I/O supply voltage (see Figure 14).
Note:         In case the digital supply voltage VIO is not required in the application, connect the digital supply
              voltage VIO to the transmitter supply VCC.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Functional description
4.4               Remote wake-up
The TLE7251V has a remote wake-up feature, also called bus wake-up feature. In both stand-by mode and
forced stand-by mode, the low-power receiver monitors the activity on the CAN bus and in case it detects a
wake-up signal, the TLE7251V indicates the wake-up signal on the RxD output pin.
While entering stand-by mode, the RxD output pin is set to logical “high”, regardless of the signal on the CAN
bus. The low-power receiver of the TLE7251V requires a signal change from “recessive” to “dominant” on the
CAN bus before the RxD output is enabled to follow the signals on the HS CAN bus.
HS CAN bus signals, “dominant” or “recessive”, with a pulse width above the CAN activity filter time t > tFilter
are indicated on the RxD output pin. Glitches with a pulse width below the CAN activity filter time t < tFilter are
ignored and not considered as a valid wake-up signal. The RxD output reacts within the reaction time tWU_Rec
after detecting a wake-up signal (see Figure 8).
Note:             A wake-up event on the CAN bus is only indicated on the RxD output, no automatic change of the
                  operating mode is applied. To enter normal-operating mode, the external microcontroller needs to
                  change the signal on the STB pin.
The wake-up logic is supplied by the power supply VIO (see Figure 1). In case the TLE7251V is in stand-by mode
the power supply VCC can be turned off, while the TLE7251V is still able to detect a wake-up signal on the
HS CAN bus (see also Figure 4).

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Fail safe functions
5             Fail safe functions
5.1           Short circuit protection
The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short circuit proof, either against GND or a positive supply voltage. A
current limiting circuit protects the transceiver against damages. If the device is heating up due to a
continuous short on the CANH or CANL, the internal overtemperature protection switches off the bus
transmitter.
5.2           Unconnected logic pins
All logic input pins have an internal pull-up resistor to VIO. In case the VIO supply is activated and the logical pins
are open, the TLE7251V enters into the stand-by mode by default. In stand-by mode the transmitter of the
TLE7251V is disabled, the bus bias is turned off and the input resistors of CANH and CANL are connected to
GND.
5.3           TxD time-out function
The TxD time-out feature protects the CAN bus against permanent blocking in case the logical signal on the
TxD pin is continuously “low”. A continuous “low” signal on the TxD pin might have its root cause in a locked-
up microcontroller or in a short circuit on the printed circuit board, for example. In normal-operating mode, a
logical “low” signal on the TxD pin for the time t > tTxD enables the TxD time-out feature and the TLE7251V
disables the transmitter (see Figure 9). The receiver is still active and the data on the bus continues to be
monitored by the RxD output pin.

Figure 9      TxD time-out function
Figure 9 illustrates how the transmitter is deactivated and activated again. A permanent “low” signal on the
TxD input pin activates the TxD time-out function and deactivates the transmitter. To release the transmitter
after a TxD time-out event the TLE7251V requires a signal change on the TxD input pin from logical “low” to
logical “high”.

5.4          Overtemperature protection
The TLE7251V has an integrated overtemperature detection to protect the TLE7251V against thermal
overstress of the transmitter. The overtemperature protection is active in normal-operating mode and
disabled in stand-by mode. In case of an overtemperature condition, the temperature sensor will disable the
transmitter (see Figure 1) while the transceiver remains in normal-operating mode.
After the device has cooled down the transmitter is activated again (see Figure 10). A hysteresis is
implemented within the temperature sensor.

5.5          Delay time for mode change
The HS CAN transceiver TLE7251V changes the mode of operation within the time window tMode. During the
mode change the RxD output pin is permanently set to logical “high” and does not reflect the status on the
CANH and CANL input pins.
While changing the mode of operation from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode, the transceiver
TLE7251V turns off the transmitter and switches from the normal-mode receiver to the low-power receiver.
After the mode change is completed, the transceiver TLE7251V releases the RxD output pin (see as an example
Figure 16 and Figure 17).

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Application information
8.3           Examples for mode changes
Changing the status on the STB input pin triggers a change of the operating mode, disregarding the actual
signal on the CANH, CANL and TxD pins (see also Chapter 4.2).
Mode changes are triggered by the STB pin, when the device TLE7251V is fully supplied. Setting the STB pin to
logical “low” changes the mode of operation to normal-operating mode:
•   The mode change is executed independently of the signal on the HS CAN bus. The CANH, CANL inputs may
    be either “dominant” or “recessive”. They can be also permanently shorted to GND or VCC.
•   A mode change is performed independently of the signal on the TxD input. The TxD input may be either
    logical “high” or “low”.
Analog to that, changing the STB input pin to logical “high” changes the mode of operation to the stand-by
mode, independent on the signals at the CANH, CANL and TxD pins.
Notes
1. In case the TxD signal is “low” setting the STB input pin to logical “low” changes the operating mode of the
    device to normal-operating mode and drives a “dominant” signal to the HS CAN bus.
2. The TxD time-out is only effective in normal-operating mode. The TxD time-out timer starts when the
    TLE7251V enters normal-operating mode and the TxD input is set to logical “low”.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Application information
8.3.1           Mode change to stand-by mode during a “dominant” bus signal
The example in Figure 15 shows a mode change from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode while the
signal on the HS CAN bus is “dominant”.
During the mode transition time tMode, the transceiver TLE7251V blocks the RxD output and provides a logical
“high” on the RxD output pin. The internal receiver switches from the normal-mode receiver to the low-power
receiver, while changing from normal-operating mode to stand-by mode.
After entering stand-by mode the transceiver TLE7251V continues to indicate a “high” signal on the RxD
output as long as the HS CAN bus remains “dominant”. The permanent “dominant” bus signal is not
considered as a wake-up event and therefore not indicated on the RxD output pin.
Detecting the first signal change from “recessive” to “dominant” on the HS CAN bus releases the internal
wake-up logic. Within the wake-up reaction time tWU_Rec, a “recessive” CAN bus signal is indicated on the RxD
output pin by a logical “high” signal and a “dominant” CAN bus signal is indicated by a logical “low” signal, as
long the pulse width of the HS CAN bus signals is longer than the CAN activity filter time t > tFilter.
Entering stand-by mode while the HS CAN bus signal is “recessive”, a release of the internal wake-up logic is
not necessary and a “dominant” wake-up signal (t > tFilter) on the HS CAN bus is indicated on the RxD output
pin within the wake-up reaction time tWU_Rec.(compare to Figure 8).
          Note: The “dominant” signal on the HS CAN bus is set by another HS CAN bus subscriber.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Application information
8.3.2          Mode changes from stand-by mode to normal-operating mode
8.3.2.1        Mode change while the TxD Signal is “low”
The example in Figure 16 shows a mode change to normal-operating mode while the TxD input is logical
“low”. The HS CAN signal is “recessive”, assuming all other HS CAN bus subscribers are also sending a
“recessive” bus signal.
While the transceiver TLE7251V is in stand-by mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned
off. In stand-by mode the low-power receiver is active. The TLE7251V drives no signal to the HS CAN bus, the
RxD output is connected to the low-power receiver and follows only the HS_CAN bus signals when its pulse
width exceeds the CAN activity filter time tFilter. Changing the STB to logical “low” turns the mode of operation
to normal-operating mode, while the TxD input signal remains logical “low”. The transmitter and the normal-
mode receiver remain disabled until the mode transition is completed. During the mode transition the RxD
output is blocked and set to logical “high”. In normal-operating mode the transmitter and the normal-mode
receiver are active. The “low” signal on the TxD input drives a “dominant” signal to the HS CAN bus and the
RxD output becomes logical “low” following the “dominant” signal on the HS CAN bus.
Changing the STB pin back to logical “high”, disables the transmitter and normal-mode receiver again. The
RxD output pin is blocked and set to logical “high” with the start of the mode transition. The TxD input and the
transmitter are blocked and the HS CAN bus becomes “recessive”.

TLE7251V
High Speed CAN-Transceiver with Bus Wake-up
Application information
8.3.2.2         Mode change while the bus signal is “dominant”
The example in Figure 17 shows a mode change while the bus is “dominant” and the TxD input signal is set to
logical “high”.
While the transceiver TLE7251V is in stand-by mode, the transmitter and the normal-mode receiver are turned
off. In stand-by mode the low-power receiver is active. The TLE7251V drives no signal to the HS CAN bus, the
RxD output is connected to the low-power receiver and follows only the HS_CAN bus signals when its pulse
width exceeds the bus wake-up time tWU. Changing the STB to logical “low” turns the mode of operation to
normal-operating mode, while the TxD input signal remains logical “high”. The transmitter and the normal-
mode receiver remain disabled until the mode transition is completed. During the mode transition the RxD
output is blocked and set to logical “high”. In normal-operating mode the normal-mode receiver is active and
the RxD output follows the “dominant” signal on the HS CAN bus by indicating a logical “low” signal.
Changing the STB pin back to logical “high”, disables the transmitter and normal-mode receiver again. The
RxD output pin is blocked and set to logical “high” with the start of the mode transition. The low-power
receiver is active in stand-by mode. The RxD output signal remains “high” as long the HS CAN bus remains
“dominant”, only if the HS CAN bus changes to a “recessive” signal longer as the CAN activity time tFilter, the
RxD output follows the bus signal within the wake-up reaction time tWU_Rec (see also Chapter 8.3.1).
             Note: The “dominant” signal on the HS CAN bus is set by another HS CAN bus subscriber.
