AMIS-42770
Dual High Speed CAN
Transceiver
General Description
  Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial communication protocol,
                                                                                                    http://onsemi.com
which supports distributed real−time control and multiplexing with high
safety level. Typical applications of CAN−based networks can be found
in automotive and industrial environments.
  The AMIS−42770 Dual−CAN transceiver is the interface between
up to two physical bus lines and the protocol controller and will be
used for serial data interchange between different electronic units at
more than one bus line. It can be used for both 12 V and 24 V systems.
  The circuit consists of following blocks:
• Two differential line transmitters
• Two differential line receivers
• Interface to the CAN protocol handler
• Interface to expand the number of CAN busses                                                             SOIC 20

• Logic block including repeater function and the feedback suppression                                  CASE 751AQ
• Thermal shutdown circuit (TSD)
  Due to the wide common−mode voltage range of the receiver inputs,
the AMIS−42770 is able to reach outstanding levels of electromagnetic                            20
susceptibility (EMS). Similarly, extremely low electromagnetic                                              AMIS42770
emission (EME) is achieved by the excellent matching of the output                                           ICAW−N
