1.1 Battery Supply Voltage Pin (VS)
    This is the power supply pin. In an application, this pin is usually connected to the battery through a serial
    diode for reverse battery protection. This pin sustains standard automotive conditions, such as 40V
    during load dump. An undervoltage detection circuit is implemented to avoid a malfunction or false bus
    messages. After switching on the VS pin, the Integrated Circuit (IC) starts in Standby mode and the INH
    output is switched on.

                                                                                                     ATA6571
                                                                                             Pin Configuration
1.2 Ground Pin (GND)
    The IC does not affect the CAN bus in the event of a GND disconnection.
1.3 Transceiver Supply Voltage Pin (VCC)
    This is the supply pin for the CANH and CANL bus drivers, the bus differential receiver and the bus
    biasing voltage circuitry. The VCC is monitored for undervoltage conditions.
1.4 Supply Pin for I/O Level Adapter (VIO)
    This is the supply pin for the digital input/outputs pins. This pin should be connected to the
    microcontroller’s supply voltage to adjust the signal levels of pins TXD, RXD, NSTBY, EN and NERR to
    the I/O levels of the microcontroller. The VIO pin is monitored for undervoltage conditions.
1.5 Bus Pins (CANH and CANL)
    These are the CAN bus terminals.
    The CANL pin is a low-side driver to GND, and the CANH pin is a high-side driver to VCC. In Normal
    mode and if TXD is high, the CANH and CANL drivers are OFF, and the voltage at CANH and CANL is
    approximately 2.5V, provided by the internal bus biasing circuitry. This state is called recessive.
    When TXD is low, CANL is pulled to GND and CANH to VCC, creating a differential voltage on the CAN
    bus. This state is called dominant.
    In Standby mode, the CANH and CANL drivers are OFF. If the device is in unpowered mode or Sleep
    mode, CANH and CANL are highly resistive with extremely low leakage current to GND, making the
    device ideally passive.
    The CANH and CANL have integrated ESD protection and extremely high robustness versus external
    disturbance, such as EMC and electrical transients. The CANH and CANL bus outputs are short-circuit
    protected, either against GND or a positive supply voltage and are also protected against
    overtemperature conditions.
1.6 Transmit Data Input Pin (TXD)
    This is the device input pin used to control the CAN bus level. In the application, this pin is connected to
    the microcontroller transmit terminal. Pin TXD has an internal pull-up toward VIO to ensure a safe defined
    recessive driver state in case this pin is left floating.
    In Normal mode, when TXD is high or floating, the CANH and CANL drivers are OFF, setting the bus in
    the recessive state.
    The TXD pin must be pulled to GND in order to activate the CANH and CANL drivers, and the bus is set
    to the dominant state. A TXD dominant time-out timer starts when the TXD pin is set to low. If the low
    state on the TXD pin persists for longer than tto(dom), the transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus lines to
    recessive state. This function prevents a hardware and/or software application failure from driving the bus
    lines to a permanent dominant state (blocking all network communications). The TXD dominant time-out
    timer is reset when the TXD pin is set to high.

                                                                                                     ATA6571
                                                                                            Pin Configuration
     The transmitter is also disabled, if pin TXD is held low (for example, by a short circuit to GND) while the
     device is switched into Normal mode, the bus lines are in the recessive state. The transceiver remains in
     this state, until pin TXD goes high.
1.7  Receive Data Output Pin (RXD)
     In Normal and Silent mode, this pin reports the state of the CAN bus to the microcontroller. In the
     application, this pin is connected to the microcontroller receive terminal. RXD is high when the bus is
     recessive. When the bus is dominant, RXD is low.
     The output is a push-pull structure; the high side is connected to VIO and the low side to GND.
     In Standby mode, the RXD is switched to VIO. When a wake-up event is detected, the RXD will be forced
     to low.
     A RXD recessive clamping function (see section 2.3.3 RXD Recessive Clamping) is implemented. This
     fail-safe feature prevents the controller from sending data on the bus if the RXD line is clamped to high
     (for example, recessive).
1.8  Inhibit Output Pin (INH)
     The inhibit output pin provides an internal switch toward the VS pin and is used to control external voltage
     regulators. If the device is in Normal or Standby mode, the inhibit high-side switch is turned on. When the
     device is in Sleep mode, the inhibit switch is turned off, thus disabling the connected external voltage
     regulators or other connected external devices.
     A wake-up event on the CAN bus or at the WAKE pin switches the INH pin to the VS level. After a system
     power-up (VS rises from zero), the INH pin switches to the VS level automatically.
1.9  Wake Pin (WAKE)
     This pin is a high-voltage input used for waking up the device from Sleep mode. It is usually connected to
     an external switch in the application to generate a local wake-up. If the WAKE pin is not needed in the
     application, it should be connected to GND to ensure optimal EMI performance.
     The WAKE pin has a special design structure and is triggered by a low-to-high or a high-to-low transition
     on the WAKE pin. This arrangement allows for maximum flexibility when designing a local wake-up
     circuit.
     An internal filter is implemented to avoid a false wake-up event due to parasitic pulses. A serial resistor
     should be inserted in order to limit the input current mainly during transient pulses and ESD. The
     recommended resistor value is 10 kΩ. An external 10 nF capacitor is recommended for better EMC and
     ESD performances.
     To reduce the battery current during Low-Power mode, the internal pull-up/pull-down circuit follows the
     logic level at WAKE pin:
       • a high level on the pin is followed by an internal pull-up toward VS
       • a low level is followed by an internal pull-down towards GND.
1.10 Enable Pin (EN)

     The EN pin provides a pull-down to force the transceiver into Recessive mode if EN is disconnected.
1.11 Error Indication Pin (NERR)
     The NERR pin reflects the status of the device. The ATA6571 has seven internal flags for a system
     diagnosis support. Five of these flags can be polled by the controller through pin NERR. The available
     flag on pin NERR depends on the active operating mode and on a number of other conditions. Switching
     between modes allows access to a number of diagnostic flags through pin NERR.
1.12 Standby Mode Control Pin (NSTBY)
     The NSTBY input pin together with the EN pin control the operating mode of the device. The NSTBY pin
     provides a pull-down current to force the transceiver into Standby mode, if STBY is disconnected.

2.  Functional Description
    The ATA6571 high-speed CAN transceiver offers a number of operating modes, diagnostic features and
    fail-safe features that enable enhanced system reliability and advanced power management.
2.1 Device Operation Modes
    The control pins NSTBY and EN are used to select one of the five operating modes supported by the
    ATA6571. Switching between modes allows access to a number of diagnostic flags through pin NERR.
    Table 2-1 describes how to switch between modes and Figure 2-1 illustrates the different mode
    transitions.

2.1.1 Normal Mode
      In Normal mode, the transceiver can transmit and receive data through the bus lines CANH and CANL.
      The output driver stage is active and drives data from the TXD input to the CAN bus. The High-Speed
      Comparator (HSC) converts the analog data on the bus lines into digital data, which is output to pin RXD.
      The bus biasing is set to VVCC/2 and the undervoltage monitoring of VCC is active. The slope of the output
      signals on the bus lines is controlled and optimized in a way that guarantees the lowest possible
      Electromagnetic Emission (EME). Pin INH is active, so voltage regulators controlled by pin INH are active
      too.

                                                                                                        ATA6571
                                                                                           Functional Description
2.1.2 Silent Mode
      This Receive-Only mode can be used to test the connection of the bus medium. In Silent mode, the
      ATA6571 can still receive data from the bus, but the transmitter is disabled and therefore no data can be
      sent to the CAN bus. The bus pins are released to recessive state (VVCC/2). All other IC functions,
      including the HSC, continue to operate as they do in Normal mode. The Silent mode can be used to
      prevent a faulty CAN controller from disrupting all network communications.
2.1.3 Standby Mode
      The Standby mode is the first level of power-saving mode for the ATA6571, offering reduced current
      consumption. In this mode, the transceiver is not able to transmit or correctly receive data through the
      bus lines. The transmitter and the HSC are switched off to reduce current consumption and only the low-
      power Wake-Up Comparator (WUC) monitors the bus lines for a valid wake-up signal. The bus pins are
      biased at ground level.
      Pin INH is still active, so voltage regulators controlled by this pin are also active.
      Pins RXD and NERR reflect any active wake-up requests (provided that VIO and VS are present).
2.1.4 Go-to-Sleep Mode
      The Go-to-Sleep mode is the controlled route for entering Sleep mode. In Go-to-Sleep mode, the
      transceiver behaves as in Standby mode, with the addition that a Go-to-Sleep command is issued to the
      transceiver. The transceiver remains in Go-to-Sleep mode for the minimum hold time (thold) before
      entering Sleep mode. The transceiver does not enter Sleep mode if the state of pin NSTBY or pin EN is
      changed or if the Wake flag is set before thold has elapsed.
2.1.5 Sleep Mode
      The Sleep mode is the best power-saving mode of the device. In this mode, the INH output is switched
      off. Therefore the external voltage regulator(s) controlled by this pin is also switched-off. This is the only
      difference between Sleep mode and Standby mode.
      The Sleep mode is entered through Go-to-Sleep mode, and also when the undervoltage detection time
      on either VCC or VIO elapses before the relevant voltage level has recovered. Pins NSTBY, EN, and the
      Wake flag can be used to wake up a node from Sleep mode.
2.1.6 Remote Wake-Up through the CAN Bus
      In Standby and Sleep mode, the bus lines are biased to ground to reduce current consumption to a
      minimum. The ATA6571 monitors the bus lines for a valid WUP as specified in the ISO 11898-2: 2016.
      This filtering helps to avoid spurious wake-up events, which can be triggered by scenarios such as a
      dominant clamped bus or by a dominant phase due to noise, spikes on the bus, automotive transients or
      EMI.
      The wake-up pattern consists of at least two consecutive dominant bus levels for a duration of at least
      tFilter, each separated by a recessive bus level with a duration of at least tFilter. Dominant or recessive bus
      levels shorter than tFilter are always ignored. The complete dominant-recessive-dominant pattern must be
      received within the bus wake-up time-out time twake, to be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern, as
      shown in Figure 2-2. Otherwise, the internal wake-up logic is reset and then the complete wake-up
      pattern must be retransmitted to trigger a wake-up event. Pin RXD remains at high level until a valid
      wake-up event is detected. During Normal mode, at a VCC or VIO undervoltage condition or when the
      complete wake-up pattern is not received within twake, no wake-up is signalled at the RXD pin.

    Figure 2-2. Timing of the Bus WUP in Standby Mode
    When a valid CAN WUP is detected on the bus, the RXD pin switches to low to signal a wake-up request.
2.2 Internal Flags
    For Fail-Safe Fallback mode control and system diagnosis, the ATA6571 has seven internal flags. Five of
    these flags can be polled by the controller through pin NERR. Depending on the current operating mode
    and on a number of other conditions, a different flag is available on the NERR pin. Table 2-2 describes
    how to access and control these flags.

      Note:
        1. Pin NERR is an active-low output, so a low level indicates a set flag and a high level indicates a
                cleared flag. Allow pin NERR to stabilize for at least 8 µs after changing operating modes.
        2. Allow a TXD dominant time of at least 4 µs per dominant-recessive cycle.
2.2.1 UVVCC/VIO Flag
      UVVCC/VIO is the VCC and/or VIO undervoltage detection flag. The flag is set when the voltage on pin
      VCC drops below the VCC undervoltage detection voltage, VVCC _UV, for longer than the undervoltage
      detection time, tVSUP_UV_set, or when the voltage on pin VIO drops below VVIO _UV for longer than
      tVSUP_UV_set. When the UVVCC/VIO flag is set, the transceiver enters Sleep mode to save power and to
      ensure the bus is not disturbed. In Sleep mode the voltage regulators connected to pin INH are disabled,
      avoiding any extra power consumption that might be generated as a result of a short-circuit condition.
      Any wake-up request, setting the Pwon flag or a low-to-high transition on NSTBY will clear UVVCC/VIO and
      the timers, allowing the voltage regulators to be reactivated (at least until UVVCC/VIO is set again).
      UVVCC/VIO is also cleared if both VCC and VIO recover for longer than the undervoltage recovery time,
      tVSUP_UV_clear. The transceiver will then switch to the operating mode indicated by the logic levels on pins
      NSTBY and EN (see section 2.1 Device Operation Modes).
2.2.2 UVVS Flag
      The UVVS is the VS undervoltage detection flag. This flag is set when the voltage on pin VS drops below
      VVS_UV_CAN_Set. When UVVS is set, the transceiver enters Standby mode to save power and disengages
      from the bus (zero load). UVVS is cleared when the voltage on pin VS recovers. The transceiver then
      switches to the operating mode indicated by the logic levels on pins NSTBY and EN (see section 2.1
      Device Operation Modes).
2.2.3 Pwon Flag
      The Pwon is the VS power-on flag. This flag is set when the voltage on pin VS recovers after previously
      dropping below VVS_PWROFF (usually because the battery was disconnected). Setting the Pwon flag clears
      the UVVCC/VIO flag and timers. The Wake and Wake-Up Source flags are set to ensure consistent system
      power-up under all supply conditions. In Silent mode, the Pwon flag can be polled through pin NERR (see
      Table 2-2). The flag is cleared when the transceiver enters Normal mode.
2.2.4 Wake Flag
      The Wake flag is set when the transceiver detects a local or remote wake-up request. A local wake-up
      request is detected when the logic level on pin WAKE changes and the new level remains stable for at
      least twake. A remote wake-up request is triggered by two bus dominant states of at least twake(busdom),
      with the first dominant state followed by a recessive state of at least twake(busrec) (provided the dominant-
      recessive-dominant pattern is completed within tto(wake)bus). The Wake flag can be set in Standby mode,

      Go-to-Sleep mode or Sleep mode. Setting the Wake flag clears the UVVCC/VIO flag and timers. Once set,
      the Wake flag status is immediately available on pins NERR and RXD (if VIO and VS are present). This
      flag is also set at power-on and cleared when the UVVCC/VIO flag is set or the transceiver enters Normal
      mode.
2.2.5 Wake-Up Source Flag
      The wake-up source recognition is provided through the Wake-Up Source flag, which is set when the
      Wake flag is set by a local wake-up request through the WAKE pin. The Wake-Up Source flag can be
      polled through the NERR pin in Normal mode (see Table 2-2). This flag is also set at power-on and
      cleared when the transceiver leaves the Normal mode.
2.2.6 Bus Failure Flag
      The Bus Failure flag is set if the transceiver detects a bus line short-circuit condition to VS, VCC or GND
      during four consecutive dominant-recessive cycles on pin TXD, while trying to drive the dominant bus
      lines. The Bus Failure flag can be polled through the NERR pin in Normal mode (see Table 2-2). This flag
      is cleared at power-on or when the transceiver re-enters Normal mode.
2.2.7 Local Failure Flag
      In Normal and Silent modes, the transceiver can distinguish five different local failure events, any of which
      will cause the Local Failure flag to be set. The five local failure events are: TXD dominant clamping, TXD-
      to-RXD short circuit, bus dominant clamping, an overtemperature event, and an RXD recessive clamping
      event (see section 2.3 Fail-Safe Features). The Local Failure flag can be polled through the NERR pin in
      Silent mode (see Table 2-2). This flag is cleared at power-on, when entering Normal mode or when RXD
      is dominant while TXD is recessive, provided that all local failures have been resolved.
2.3   Fail-Safe Features
      The ATA6571 can detect a number of different local failure conditions. Any of these failures sets the Local
      Failure flag and in most cases the transmitter of the transceiver is disabled.
2.3.1 TXD Dominant Time-Out Function
      A permanent low level on pin TXD (due to a hardware or software application failure) drives the CAN bus
      into a permanent dominant state, blocking all network communications. The TXD dominant time-out
      function prevents such a network lock-up by disabling the transmitter. The TXD dominant time-out timer is
      started when the TXD pin is set to low. If the low state on the TXD pin persists for longer than tto(dom), the
      transmitter is disabled, releasing the bus lines to a recessive state. The tto(dom) dominant time-out timer
      defines a minimum possible bit rate of 40 kbit/s. The transmitter remains disabled until the Local Failure
      flag is cleared.
2.3.2 TXD-to-RXD Short-Circuit Detection
      A short circuit between pins RXD and TXD locks the bus in a permanent dominant state once it has been
      driven dominant, because the low-side driver of RXD is typically stronger than the high-side driver of the
      controller connected to TXD. The TXD-to-RXD short-circuit detection prevents this network lock-up by
      disabling the transmitter. The transmitter remains disabled until the Local Failure flag is cleared.
2.3.3 RXD Recessive Clamping
      This fail-safe feature prevents the controller from sending data to the bus if its RXD line is clamped to
      high (for example, recessive). That is, if the RXD pin cannot signalize a dominant bus condition because
      it is shorted to VCC, the transmitter within the ATA6571 is disabled to avoid possible data collisions on the
      bus. In Normal and Silent mode, the device permanently compares the state of the the HSC with the state

                                                                                                         ATA6571
                                                                                        Functional Description
      of the RXD pin. If the HSC indicates a dominant bus state for more than tRXD_rec_clmp, without the RXD pin
      doing the same, a recessive clamping situation is detected. The RXD recessive clamping detection is
      reset (LOCFAIL flag removed) by either entering Normal or unpowered mode or if the RXD pin is showing
      a dominant (for example, LOW) level again.
      Figure 2-3. RXD Recessive Clamping Detection
2.3.4 Bus Dominant Clamping Detection
      A CAN bus short circuit (to VS, VCC or GND) or a failure in one of the other network nodes can result in a
      differential voltage on the bus, high enough to represent a bus dominant state. Because a node does not
      start transmission if the bus is dominant, the normal bus failure detection does not detect this failure, but
      the bus dominant clamping detection will. The Local Failure flag is set if the dominant state on the bus
      persists for longer than tBUS_dom. By checking this flag, the controller can determine if a clamped bus is
      blocking network communications. There is no need to disable the transmitter. RXD is low as long as the
      bus is still dominant and goes high when the bus is released to high.
      Note: The Local Failure flag does not retain a bus dominant clamping failure and is released as soon as
      the bus returns to the recessive state.
2.3.5 Overtemperature Detection
      The transceiver is protected against overtemperature conditions. If the junction temperature exceeds the
      shutdown junction temperature, TJsd, the transmitter is disabled until the Local Failure flag is cleared.
2.3.6 Bus Wake-Up only at Dedicated Wake-Up Pattern
      Due to the implementation of the wake-up filtering, the ATA6571 does not wake up when the bus is in a
      long dominant phase, it only wakes up at a dedicated wake-up pattern as specified in the ISO 11898-2:
      2016. This means for a valid wake-up at least two consecutive dominant bus levels for a duration of at
      least tFilter, each separated by a recessive bus level with a duration of at least tFilter that must be received
      through the bus. Dominant or recessive bus levels shorter than tFilter are always ignored. The complete
      dominant-recessive-dominant pattern (as shown in Figure 2-2) must be received within the bus wake-up
      time-out time twake to be recognized as a valid wake-up pattern. This filtering leads to a higher robustness
      against EMI and transients and reduces therefore the risk of an unwanted bus wake-up significantly.
2.3.7 Undervoltage Detection on Pins VS, VCC and VIO
      If VVS, VVCC or VVIO drop below their respective undervoltage detection levels (VVS_UV_CAN_Set, VVCC _UV
      and VVIO _UV (see section 5. Electrical Characteristics), the transceiver switches off and disengages from
      the bus until VVS, VVCC and VVIO recover. The low-power wake-up comparator and local wake-up are
      switched off during a VS undervoltage.

Microchip Devices Code Protection Feature
Note the following details of the code protection feature on Microchip devices:
  • Microchip products meet the specification contained in their particular Microchip Data Sheet.
  • Microchip believes that its family of products is one of the most secure families of its kind on the
     market today, when used in the intended manner and under normal conditions.
  • There are dishonest and possibly illegal methods used to breach the code protection feature. All of
     these methods, to our knowledge, require using the Microchip products in a manner outside the
     operating specifications contained in Microchip’s Data Sheets. Most likely, the person doing so is
     engaged in theft of intellectual property.

  • Microchip is willing to work with the customer who is concerned about the integrity of their code.
  • Neither Microchip nor any other semiconductor manufacturer can guarantee the security of their
     code. Code protection does not mean that we are guaranteeing the product as “unbreakable.”
Code protection is constantly evolving. We at Microchip are committed to continuously improving the
code protection features of our products. Attempts to break Microchip’s code protection feature may be a
violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If such acts allow unauthorized access to your software
or other copyrighted work, you may have a right to sue for relief under that Act.
